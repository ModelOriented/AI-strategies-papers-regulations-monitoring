# Data sets dependancies

The datasets are available at: https://github.com/ModelOriented/AI-strategies-papers-regulations-monitoring/tree/master/data/s2orc/bt_company_meme_popularity.

The flowchart resembles the dependancies from creation of the datasets, indicates what columns are inside and what are the counts of observations at each stage.

The chart is designed for the pipeline of BT analysis, but the one for the company looks like it, but there are changes of the names (from bt to company).
