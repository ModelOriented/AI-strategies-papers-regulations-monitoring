# Languages
Almost 800 out of 1217 questionnaires were answered in English.

```{r}
Languages <- as.data.frame(table(contr$Language))
Languages
```
```{r eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(Languages, aes(x=Var1, y=Freq)) +

```

# User Type
Despite anonymous users, most interested faction were people connected to business (organization + association), Academic/Research Institutions, Non governmental organisations and regular EU Citizens.

```{r}
UType <- as.data.frame(table(contr$User.type))
UType
```
```{r eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}

# Organization size
Large organisations were the most interested, however the medium ones were  the least interested group with small and micro almost doubling their frequency.

```{r}
OrgSize <- as.data.frame(table(contr$Organisation.size))

# Country of origin
The most interested countries were the leading European countries such as Belgium, Germany and France. One of the biggest faction were also people from the USA and surprisingly even people outside of Europe were involved in this questionnaire.

```{r}
Country <- as.data.frame(table(contr$Country))
Country

# Importance Questions
During 1-5 questions analysis we found out which questions are most commonly supported and which ones are more disagreed upon. To make a brief selection we counted sum of agreement points (1-5) and focused on top 3 questions in each category. 

```{r}
Questions <- contr[,-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,19,26,30,36,43,45,47,49,56,57,

Questions <- Questions[,-c(27,28,29,30)]
Q <- as.data.frame(Questions)
colnames(Q) <- 1:31
Q[Q == "5 - Very important"] <- 5
Q[Q == "4 - Important"] <- 4
Q[Q == "3 - Neutral"] <- 3
Q[Q == "2 - Not important"] <- 2
Q[Q == "1 - Not important at all"] <- 1
Q[Q == "No opinion"] <- ""
Q[Q == ""] <- ""
Q <- as.data.frame(Q)
Qmat <- matrix(as.integer(unlist(Q)), ncol = 31)
namez <- 1:31
Mean <- colMeans(Qmat,na.rm = TRUE)
Mean
```

From second part of this analysis we can see that if we look at % distribution of given rating our assumptions were quiet accurate. We can see big difference between highest importance in this two groups. Although most of the respondents generally thought that the discussed issues are important, we can see that in the less important matter groups they were quiet close to being neutral / slightly important. The heatmap also provides us some information about the importance.
