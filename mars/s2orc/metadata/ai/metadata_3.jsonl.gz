ILP algorithms have a number of attractive features, notably the ability to make use of declarative background (user-supplied) knowledge. However, ILP algorithms deal poorly with large data sets (>104 examples) and their widespread use of the greedy set-covering algorithm renders them susceptible to local maxima in the space of logic programs.This paper presents a novel approach to address these problems based on combining the local search properties of an inductive logic programming algorithm with the global search properties of an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed algorithm may be viewed as an evolutionary wrapper around a population of ILP algorithms.The evolutionary wrapper approach is evaluated on two domains. The chess-endgame (KRK) problem is an artificial domain that is a widely used benchmark in inductive logic programming, and Part-of-Speech Tagging is a real-world problem from the field of Natural Language Processing. In the latter domain, data originates from excerpts of the Wall Street Journal.

Hence the alternative option like biometric-based recognition for reliable and robust human identification has given more importance in the wide range of commercial sectors. In existing system, face recognition is performed through hybrid swarm intelligence approach which uses both PSO and ABC. Hybrid ABC optimization algorithm was used to train a weighting mask for assisting the face recognition process.

And face detection is performed by using boosted classifiers with Haar-like features. The same boosted classifiers are also used for eye detection. In this eye detection the left eye and right eye features extracted to locate multifaces in the result. To ensure the high security eye pupil is detected by using circle Hough transforms.

The proposed algorithm consists of preliminary operations to enhance the obtained image using median filtering and histogram equalization. Connected components are comparatively darker features on the preprocessed images, which are obtained using manual thresholding. The algorithm also includes the elimination of noise through applying a preset threshold to the connected components. These operations produce crack candidate regions which are categorized into four classes: transverse, longitudinal, alligator and non-crack. Through features extracted from the cracked and non-cracked components, successfully trained Support VectorMachines produce a pavement crack identification system in which the images are finally purified by removing the non-crack features and classified accordingly after post-processing. A case study is performed in this paper to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. In 100 images taken from pavements with different type of cracks, the identification results obtained were quite satisfactory.

Analytical methods for identifying Mendelian disease genes are not appropriate when applied to common multigenic diseases, because such methods investigate association with the phenotype only one genetic locus at a time. New strategies are needed that can capture the spectrum of genetic effects, from Mendelian to multifactorial epistasis. Random Forests (RF) and Relief-F are two powerful machine-learning methods that have been studied as filters for genetic case-control data due to their ability to account for the context of alleles at multiple genes when scoring the relevance of individual genetic variants to the phenotype. However, when variants interact strongly, the independence assumption of RF in the tree node-splitting criterion leads to diminished importance scores for relevant variants. Relief-F, on the other hand, was designed to detect strong interactions but is sensitive to large backgrounds of variants that are irrelevant to classification of the phenotype, which is an acute problem in genome-wide association studies. To overcome the weaknesses of these data mining approaches, we develop Evaporative Cooling (EC) feature selection, a flexible machine learning method that can integrate multiple importance scores while removing irrelevant genetic variants. To characterize detailed interactions, we construct a genetic-association interaction network (GAIN), whose edges quantify the synergy between variants with respect to the phenotype. We use simulation analysis to show that EC is able to identify a wide range of interaction effects in genetic association data. We apply the EC filter to a smallpox vaccine cohort study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and infer a GAIN for a collection of SNPs associated with adverse events.

Unlike the conventional CGAN, which represents an attribute directly using an observable variable (e.g., the binary indicator of attribute presence) so its controllability is restricted to attribute labeling (e.g., restricted to an ON or OFF control), the CFGAN has a filtering architecture that associates an attribute with a multi-dimensional latent variable, enabling latent variations of the attribute to be represented. We also define the filtering architecture and training scheme considering controllability, enabling the variations of the attribute to be intuitively controlled using typical controllers (radio buttons and slide bars).

During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain.

Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns.

The objective of this study is to explore the performance of the MCRF post-classification method based on pre-classification results from different conventional classifiers on a complex landscape. Five conventional classifiers, including maximum likelihood ML, neural network NN, Support Vector Machine SVM, minimum distance MD, and k-means KM, were used to conduct land cover pre-classifications of a remotely sensed image with a 90,000 ha area and complex landscape. A sample dataset 0.32% of total pixels was first interpreted based on expert knowledge from the image and other related data sources, and then MCRF cosimulations were performed conditionally on the expert-interpreted sample dataset and the five pre-classified image datasets, respectively. Finally, MCRF post-classification maps were compared with corresponding pre-classification maps. Results showed that the MCRF method achieved obvious accuracy improvements ranging from 4.6% to 16.8% in post-classifications compared to the pre-classification results from different pre-classifiers.

The development and proliferation of GANs raises an interesting question: can we train a GAN to remove an object, if present, from an image while otherwise preserving the image? Specifically, can a GAN ``virtually heal'' anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health status (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions could be revealed by subtracting those two images? Such a task requires a GAN to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1) supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and (2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation, we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization using only image-level annotation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in multi-domain image-to-image translation and that it surpasses predominant weakly-supervised localization methods in both disease detection and localization.

The model includes: (a.) a hyper-functioning reward anticipation and processing system (amygdala-striatum dependent) in response to food-related cues; (b.) a hypo-functioning reflective and inhibitory control system (prefrontal cortex dependent), that fails to anticipate and properly weigh future outcomes; and (c.) an altered interoceptive awareness system (insular cortex dependent) that translates homeostatic violation signals into a strong consumption desire that hijacks the inhibitory system and excites the reward system. We posit that when the abovementioned systems are imbalanced in such a way that the dopamine axis is hyperactive in relation to food cues and the inhibitory system is weak, and this is further aggravated by an altered interoceptive awareness system, people may experience loss of control or inability to resist tempting/rewarding foods.

The information extracted from Wikipedia has been utilised for many tasks, such as Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and supporting multilingual information access. These tasks often rely on gathering data from articles that describe the same topic in different languages with the assumption that the contents are equivalent to each other. However, studies have shown that this might not be the case. ::: ::: Given the scale and use of Wikipedia, there is a need to develop an approach to measure cross-lingual similarity across Wikipedia. Many existing similarity measures, however, require the availability of \"language-dependent\" resources, such as dictionaries or Machine Translation (MT) systems, to translate documents into the same language prior to comparison. This presents some challenges for some language pairs, particularly those involving \"under-resourced\" languages where the required linguistic resources are not widely available. This study aims to present a solution to this problem by first, investigating cross-lingual similarity in Wikipedia, and secondly, developing \"language-independent\" approaches to measure cross-lingual similarity in Wikipedia. ::: ::: Two main contributions were provided in this work to identify cross-lingual similarity in Wikipedia. The first key contribution of this work is the development of a Wikipedia similarity corpus to understand the similarity characteristics of Wikipedia articles and to evaluate and compare various approaches for measuring cross-lingual similarity. The author elicited manual judgments from people with the appropriate language skills to assess similarities between a set of 800 pairs of interlanguage-linked articles. This corpus contains Wikipedia articles for eight language pairs (all pairs involving English and including well-resourced and under-resourced languages) of varying degrees of similarity. ::: ::: The second contribution of this work is the development of language-independent approaches to measure cross-lingual similarity in Wikipedia. The author investigated the utility of a number of \"lightweight\" language-independent features in four different experiments. The first experiment investigated the use of Wikipedia links to identify and align similar sentences, prior to aggregating the scores of the aligned sentences to represent the similarity of the document pair. The second experiment investigated the usefulness of content similarity features (such as char-n-gram overlap, links overlap, word overlap and word length ratio). The third experiment focused on analysing the use of structure similarity features (such as the ratio of section length, and similarity between the section headings). And finally, the fourth experiment investigates a combination of these features in a classification and a regression approach. ::: ::: Most of these features are language-independent whilst others utilised freely available resources (Wikipedia and Wiktionary) to assist in identifying overlapping information across languages. The approaches proposed are lightweight and can be applied to any languages written in Latin script; non-Latin script languages need to be transliterated prior to using these approaches. The performances of these approaches were evaluated against the human judgments in the similarity corpus. ::: ::: Overall, the proposed language-independent approaches achieved promising results. The best performance is achieved with the combination of all features in a classification and a regression approach. The results show that the Random Forest classifier was able to classify 81.38% document pairs correctly (F1 score=0.79) in a binary classification problem, 50.88% document pairs correctly (F1 score=0.71) in a 5-class classification problem, and RMSE of 0.73 in a regression approach. These results are significantly higher compared to a classifier utilising machine translation and cosine similarity of the tf-idf scores. These findings showed that language-independent approaches can be used to measure cross-lingual similarity between Wikipedia articles. Future work is needed to evaluate these approaches in more languages and to incorporate more features.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2949293565", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196197058"}

In this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation via Hierarchical Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Graph (HRLHG), to address this new problem. HRLHG can learn a representation function by mapping the publications, from multilingual repositories, to a low-dimensional joint embedding space from various kinds of vertexes and relations on a heterogeneous graph. By leveraging both global (task specific) plus local (task independent) information as well as a novel supervised hierarchical random walk algorithm, the proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing the likelihood of locating the important cross-language neighborhoods on the graph.

However, most prior studies on trading systems have common limitations. First, they just adopted several technical indicators based on stock indices as independent variables although there are a variety of variables that can be used as independent variables for predicting the market. In addition, most of them focus on developing a model that predicts the direction of the stock market indices rather than one that can generate trading signals for maximizing returns. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel intelligent trading system that mitigates these limitations. It is designed to use both the technical indicators and the other non-price variables on the market. Also, it adopts 'two-threshold mechanism' so that it can transform the outcome of the stock market prediction model based on support vector machines to the trading decision signals like buy, sell or hold. To validate the usefulness of the proposed system, we applied it to the real world data-the KOSPI200 index from May 2004 to December 2009.

The basic idea of TA-SVM is to use a sequence of classifiers, each one appropriate for a small time window but, in contrast to other proposals, learning all the hyperplanes in a global way. We show that the addition of a new term in the cost function of the set of SVMs (that penalizes the diversity between consecutive classifiers) produces a coupling of the sequence that allows TA-SVM to learn as a single adaptive classifier. We evaluate different aspects of the method using appropriate drifting problems. In particular, we analyze the regularizing effect of changing the number of classifiers in the sequence or adapting the strength of the coupling.

First, a framework called Angle-enhanced Faster RCNN is proposed as a multi-oriented detector to localize insulators on catenary. Then, a discriminator is proposed to decide whether an insulator is defective using deep metric learning.

In this paper an approach, in which synergistic use of a feature selection (FS) methods with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and multiple classifiers combination based on Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence, is proposed and evaluated for classifying land cover features in New South Wales, Australia. Multi-date SAR data, including ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR and optical (Landsat 5 TM+) images, were used for this study. Textural information were also derived and integrated with the original images. Various combined datasets were generated for classification. Three classifiers, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were employed. Firstly, feature selection using GA was applied for each classifier and dataset to determine the optimal input features and parameters. Then the results of three classifiers on particular datasets were combined using the Dempster-Shafer theory of Evidence. Results of this study demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method for land cover mapping using complex datasets.

Hence, it plays a vital role in detecting neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Dyslexia is a hidden learning disability with a neurological origin affecting a significant amount of the world population. Studies show unique brain structures and behaviours in individuals with dyslexia and these variations have become more evident with the use of techniques such as EEG, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). ::: ::: In this thesis, we are particularly interested in discussing the use of EEG to explore unique brain activities of adults with dyslexia. We attempt to discover unique EEG signal patterns between adults with dyslexia compared to normal controls while performing tasks that are more challenging for individuals with dyslexia. These tasks include real--\u2010word reading, nonsense--\u2010 word reading, passage reading, Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN), writing, typing, browsing the web, table interpretation and typing of random numbers. Each participant was instructed to perform these specific tasks while staying seated in front of a computer screen with the EEG headset setup on his or her head. The EEG signals captured during these tasks were examined using a machine learning classification framework, which includes signal preprocessing, frequency sub--\u2010band decomposition, feature extraction, classification and verification. Cubic Support Vector Machine (CSVM) classifiers were developed for separate brain regions of each specified task in order to determine the optimal brain regions and EEG sensors that produce the most unique EEG signal patterns between the two groups. ::: ::: The research revealed that adults with dyslexia generated unique EEG signal patterns compared to normal controls while performing the specific tasks. One of the vital discoveries of this research was that the nonsense--\u2010words classifiers produced higher Validation Accuracies (VA) compared to real--\u2010 words classifiers, confirming difficulties in phonological decoding skills seen in individuals with dyslexia are reflected in the EEG signal patterns, which was detected in the left parieto--\u2010occipital. It was also uncovered that all three reading tasks showed the same optimal brain region, and RAN which is known to have a relationship to reading also showed optimal performance in an overlapping region, demonstrating the likelihood that the association between reading and RAN reflects in the EEG signal patterns.

Thermal stratification and a longer water residence time in the lake boost the phytoplankton production. Most metals are naturally found in the environment in trace amounts. Trace metals are essential to growth and reproduction of organisms. However, some are also well known for their toxic effects on animals and humans. Total metal concentrations do not reflect their ecotoxicity that depends on their properties and speciation (particulate, dissolved: labile or bioavailable and inert fractions). Trace metals can be adsorbed to various components in aquatic systems including inorganic and organic ligands. The ability of metal binding to dissolved organic matter (DOM), in particular humic substances, has been largely studied. In urban lakes, the phytoplankton development can produce autochthonous DOM, non humic substances that can have the ability of metal binding.. But there are few studies about trace metal speciation in lake water column.The main objectives of this thesis are (1) to obtain a consistent database of trace metal concentrations in the water column of representative urban lakes; (2) to access their bioavailability through an adapted speciation technique; (3) to analyze the seasonal and spatial evolution of the metals and their speciation; (4) to study the potential impact of environmental variables, particularly of dissolved organic matter related to phytoplankton production on metal bioavailability and (5) to link the metal concentrations to the land use in the lake watershed.Our methodology is based on a dense field survey of the water bodies in addition to specific laboratory analysis. The research has been conducted on three study sites: Lake Creteil (France), Lake Pampulha (Brazil) and a panel of 49 peri-urban lakes (Ile de France). Lake Creteil is an urban lake impacted by anthropogenic pollution. It benefits of a large number of monitoring equipment, which allowed us to collect a part of the data set. In Lake Pampulha catchment, the anthropogenic pressure is high. Lake Pampulha has to face with many pollution point and non-point sources. The climate and limnological characteristics of the lakes are also very different. The panel of 49 lakes of Ile de France was sampled once during three successive summers (2011-2013); they provided us with a synoptic, representative data set of the regional metal contamination in a densely anthropized region.In order to explain the role of the environmental variables on the metal concentrations, we applied the Random Forest model on the Lake Pampulha dataset and on the 49 urban lake dataset with 2 specific objectives: (1) in Lake Pampulha, understanding the role of environmental variables on the trace metal labile concentration, considered as potentially bioavailable and (2) in the 49 lakes, understanding the relationship of the environmental variables, more particularly the watershed variables, on the dissolved metal concentrations. The analysis of the relationships between the trace metal speciation and the environmental variables provided the following key results of this thesis.In Lake Pampulha, around 80% of the variance of the labile cobalt is explained by some limnological variables: Chl a, O2, pH, and total phosphorus. For the other metals, the RF model did not succeed in explaining more than 50% of the relationships between the metals and the limnological variables.In the 49 urban lakes in Ile de France, the RF model gave a good result for Co (66% of explained variance) and very satisfying for Ni (86% of explained variance). For Ni, the best explanatory variables are landuse variables such as \u201cactivities\u201d (facilities for water, sanitation and energy, logistical warehouses, shops, office\u2026) and \u201clandfill\u201d. This result fits with Lake Creteil where dissolved Ni concentration is particularly high and where the \u201cactivities\u201d and \u201clandfill\u201d landuse categories are the highest", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2777386629", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135433813"}

The sketch-based query, which enjoys the flexibility in representing the user's intention, has received growing interests in recent years due to the popularization of the touchscreen technology. Essentially, the sketch depicts an abstraction of an shape in a certain view while the shape contains the full 3D information. Matching between them is a cross-modality retrieval problem. However, for a given query, only part of the viewpoints of the 3D shape is representative. Thus, blindly projecting a 3D shape into a feature vector without considering what is the query will inevitably bring query-unrepresentative information. To handle this issue, in this paper we propose a Deep Point-to-Subspace Metric Learning (DPSML) framework to project a sketch into a feature vector and a 3D shape into a subspace spanned by a few selected basis feature vectors. The similarity between them is defined as the distance between the query feature vector and its closest point in the subspace by solving an optimization problem on the fly. Note that, the closest point is query-adaptive and can reflect the viewpoint information that is representative to the given query. To efficiently learn such a deep model, we formulate it as a classification problem with a special classifier design. To reduce the redundancy of 3D shapes, we also introduce a Representative-View Selection (RVS) module to select the most representative views of a 3D shape.

To address this issue, we propose a novel method of the weighted random support vector machine cluster (WRSVMC) in which multiple SVMs were built and different weights were given to corresponding SVMs with different classification performances.

Manual post-editing is more accurate but can be prohibitive when too many changes have to be made. Automatic post-editing demands less effort but can also be less effective and give rise to new errors. A way to avoid unnecessary automatic post-editing and new errors is by previously selecting only the machine-translated segments that really need to be post-edited. Thus, this paper describes the experiments carried out to automatically identify MT errors generated by a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system.

Through its structural risk minimization, it has enjoyed a good reputation in effectively reducing overfitting, avoiding dimensional disaster, and not falling into local minima. Nevertheless, existing SVMs do not perform well when facing class imbalance and large-scale samples. Undersampling is a plausible alternative to solve imbalanced problems in some way, but suffers from soaring computational complexity and reduced accuracy because of its enormous iterations and random sampling process. To improve their classification performance in dealing with data imbalance problems, this work proposes a weighted undersampling (WU) scheme for SVM based on space geometry distance, and thus produces an improved algorithm named WU-SVM. In WU-SVM, majority samples are grouped into some subregions (SRs) and assigned different weights according to their Euclidean distance to the hyper plane. The samples in an SR with higher weight have more chance to be sampled and put to use in each learning iteration, so as to retain the data distribution information of original data sets as much as possible. Comprehensive experiments are performed to test WU-SVM via 21 binary-class and six multiclass publically available data sets.

Existing methods tackle this challenging problem by learning features from the visual and linguistic domains independently while the critical semantic correlations bridging two domains have been under-explored in the feature learning process. In this paper, we propose to exploit sharable semantic attributes as \"anchors\" to ensure the learned features are well aligned across domains for better object retrieval. We define \"attributes\" as the common concepts that are informative for object retrieval and can be easily learned from both visual content and language expression. In particular, diverse and complex attributes (e.g., location, color, category, interaction between object and context) are modeled and incorporated to promote cross-domain alignment for feature learning from multiple perspectives. Based on the sharable attributes, we propose a deep Attribute-Preserving Metric learning (AP-Metric) framework that jointly generates unique query-sensitive region proposals and conducts novel cross-modal feature learning that explicitly pursues consistency over semantic attribute abstraction within both domains for deep metric learning. Benefiting from the cross-modal semantic correlations, our proposed framework can localize challenging visual objects to match complex query expressions within cluttered background accurately. The overall framework is end-to-end trainable. Extensive evaluations on popular datasets including ReferItGame, RefCOCO, and RefCOCO+ well demonstrate its superiority.

However, the \u0471pd is measured in a short time period before sunrise and the collection of a large sample of points is necessary to adequately represent a vineyard, which constitute operational constraints. In the present study, an alternative method based on hyperspectral data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer and machine learning algorithms was tested and validated for assessing grapevine water status. Two test sites in Douro wine region, integrating three grapevine cultivars, were studied for the years of 2014, 2015, and 2017. Four machine learning regression algorithms were tested for predicting the \u0471pd as a continuous variable, namely Random Forest (RF), Bagging Trees (BT), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression (VH-GPR). Three predicting variables, including two vegetation indices (NRI554,561 and WI900,970) and a time-dynamic variable based on the \u0471pd (\u0471pd_0), were applied for modelling the response variable (\u0471pd). Additionally, the predicted values of \u0471pd were aggregated into three classes representing different levels of water deficit (low, moderate, and high) and compared with the corresponding classes of \u0471pd observed values. A root mean square error (RMSE) and a mean absolute error (MAE) lower or equal than 0.15 MPa and 0.12 MPa, respectively, were obtained with an external validation data set (n = 71 observations) for the various algorithms. When the modelling results were assessed through classes of values, a high overall accuracy was obtained for all the algorithms (82\u201383%), with prediction accuracy by class ranging between 79% and 100%. These results show a good performance of the predictive models, which considered a large variability of climatic, environmental, and agronomic conditions, and included various grape cultivars.

This is true provided the combined predictors are accurate and diverse enough, which posses the problem of generating suitable aggregate members in order to have optimal generalization capabiliti es. We propose here a new method for selecting members of regression/classification ensembles. In particular, using artificial neural networks as learners in a regression context, we show that this method leads to small aggregates with few but very diverse individual networks. The algorithm is favorably tested against other methods recently proposed in the literature, producing equal performance on the standard statistical databases used as benchmarks with ensembles that have 75% less members on average. Keywords: Neural Networks, Ensemble Learning, Regression, Bias/Variance Decomposition. 1. Introduction Ensemble techniques have been used recently in regression/classification tasks with considerable success. The motivation for this procedure is based on the intuitive idea that by combining the outputs of several individual predictors one might improve on the performance of a single generic one [1]. However, this idea has been proved to be true only when the combined predictors are simultaneously accurate and diverse enough, which requires an adequate trade-off between these two conflicting conditions. Some attempts [2,3] to achieve a good compromise between these properties include elaborations of bagging[4], boosting[5] and stacking[6] techniques. Artificial neural networks (ANN) provide a natural framework for ensemble techniques. This is so because ANN are a very unstable learning method, i.e. small changes in training set and/or parameter selection can produce large changes in prediction outputs. This diversity of ANN comes naturally from the inherent data and training process randomness, and also from the intrinsic non-identifiability of the model (many different but a priori equally good local minima of the error surface). On the other hand, the above mentioned trade-off between the ensemble diversity and the accuracy of the individual members posses the problem of generating a set of ANN with both reasonably good (individual) generalization capabilities and distributed predictions for the test points. This problem has been considered in several recent works in the literature [2,3,7-9]. We provide here an alternative way of generating an ANN ensemble with members that are both accurate and diverse. The method essentially amounts to the sequential aggregation of individual predictors where, unlike in standard aggregation techniques which combine individually optimized ANN [7], the learning process of a (potential) new member is validated by the overall aggregate prediction performance. That is, an ANN is incorporated to the", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4114/ia.v5i12.710", "venue": "ASAI'2000: Proceedings of the Argentine Symposium on Artificial Intelligence", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1985337939", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5846986", "8966425", "2381438", "207738357", "6644398", "5895004", "905513", "12093784", "207106194", "14215320", "198120286"], "inbound_citations": ["15923128", "14672245"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7330924"}

In this paper, we define a piece-wise function as the pseudo ground-truth to reinterpret the CTC loss based on sequences as the cross entropy loss based on timesteps. The cross entropy form makes it easy to re-weight the CTC loss.

We propose an efficient algorithm SkipLPA based on label propagation algorithm for the discovering community structure in the sparse network. The initialization phase is split into two sub-phases. First sub-phase: only certain nodes are initialized with unique labels. Second sub-phase: remaining nodes will get initial labels from connected nodes and excluded from the propagation phase. The algorithm is tested not only on benchmark networks but also on the real world networks, and efficiently recovers community structure.

Existing algorithms capable of extracting task-level representations from high-dimensional inputs, e.g. object detection, often produce outputs of varying lengths, restricting their use in RL methods due to the need for neural networks to have fixed length inputs. In this work, we propose a framework that combines deep sets encoding, which allows for variable-length abstract representations, with modular RL that utilizes these representations, decoupling high-level decision making from low-level control.

Comparing with the labor-intensive and time-consuming experiment approaches, computational prediction of pupylation sites is much desirable for their convenience and fast speed. In this study, a new bioinformatics tool named EnsemblePup was developed that used an ensemble of support vector machine classifiers to predict pupylation sites. The highlight of EnsemblePup was to utilize the Bi-profile Bayes feature extraction as the encoding scheme. The performance of EnsemblePup was measured with a sensitivity of 79.49%, a specificity of 82.35%, an accuracy of 85.43%, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.617 using the 5-fold cross validation on the training dataset.

This thesis investigates the problem of conjointly designing both classifier stages to achieve a most effective classifier architecture. Particularly, the wavelet features should be adapted to the Support Vector classifier and the specific classification problem. Three different approaches to achieve this goal are considered: The classifier performance is seriously affected by the wavelet or filter used for feature extraction. To optimally choose this wavelet with respect to the subsequent Support Vector classification, appropriate criteria may be used. The radius - margin Support Vector Machine error bound is proven to be computable by two standard Support Vector problems. Criteria which are computationally still more efficient may be sufficient for filter adaptation. For the classification by a Support Vector Machine, several criteria are examined rating feature sets obtained from various orthogonal filter banks. An adaptive search algorithm is devised that, once the criterion is fixed, efficiently finds the optimal wavelet filter. To extract shift invariant wavelet features, Kingsbury's dual-tree complex wavelet transform is examined. The dual-tree filter bank construction leads to wavelets with vanishing negative frequency parts. An enhanced transform is established in the frequency domain for standard wavelet filters without special filter design. The translation and rotational invariance is improved compared with the common wavelet transform as shown for various standard wavelet filters. So the framework well applies to adapted signal classification. Wavelet adaptation for signal classification is a special case of feature selection. Feature selection is an important combinatorial optimisation problem in the context of supervised pattern classification. Four novel continuous feature selection approaches directly minimising the classifier performance are presented. In particular, they include linear and nonlinear Support Vector classifiers. The key ideas of the approaches are additional regularisation and embedded nonlinear feature selection. To solve the optimisation problems, difference of convex functions programming which is a general framework for non-convex continuous optimisation is applied. This optimisation framework may also be interesting for other applications and succeeds in robustly solving the problems, and hence, building more powerful feature selection methods.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2215475929", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32091911", "9101139"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5585941"}

In this study, we propose an original deep-learning domain-adaptation framework to use a pre-existing dictionary of lung texture patterns (LTP), learned on gold-standard full-lung HRCT scans, to label emphysema regions on cardiac CT scans.

Combination of the classification and adversarial tasks enables to label real cardiac CT scans, and is evaluated on the MESA cohort (N = 15,357 scans). Our results show that image features derived from the adversarial training preserve the labeling accuracy on synthetic scans. LTP histogram signatures generated on 4,315 longitudinal pairs of cardiac CT scans, show high level of consistency over time and scanner generations.

Proteins usually work in context of other proteins and rarely function alone. Therefore, it is highly relevant to study the interaction partners of a protein in order to understand its function. For this reason, the main objective of this thesis is to predict protein-protein interactions based only on protein primary structure. Using the Support Vector Machines (SVM), different protein features have been studied and examined. These features include protein domain structures, hydrophobicity and amino acid compositions. The results imply that the protein domain structure is the most informative feature for predicting protein-protein interactions. It also requires much lower running time compared to the other features. However, using normal binary SVM requires positive and negative data samples. Although it is easy to get a dataset of interacting proteins as positive examples, there are no experimentally confirmed non-interacting proteins to be considered as negative examples. Previous researches cope with this problem by artificially generate random set of proteins pairs that are not listed in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) as negative examples. This approach can be used for comparing features because the error will be uniform. In this research, we consider this problem as a one-class classification problem and solve it using the One-Class SVM. Using only positive examples (interacting protein pairs) in training phase, the one-class SVM achieves accuracy of 80%. These results imply that protein-protein interaction can be predicted using one-class classifier with comparable accuracy to the binary classifiers that use artificially constructed negative examples. Finally, a Bayesian Kernel for SVM was implemented to incorporate the probabilistic information about protein-protein interactions that were compiled from different sources. The probabilistic output from the Bayesian Kernel can assist the biologist to conduct more research on the highly predicted interactions.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "32612843", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59642908"}

In this paper, we propose a robust and non-negative collective matrix factorization model to handle noise in text-to-image transfer learning, and make a reliable bridge to transfer accurate and useful knowledge from the text domain to the image domain.

Extensive experiments on real data sets suggest that the proposed model is able to effectively perform transfer learning in noisy text and image domains, and it is superior to the popular existing methods for text-to-image transfer learning.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26259080", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2015.2465157", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1527369603", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["11664336", "740063", "11695825", "2090561", "10360019", "777477", "4908577", "15260040", "4553188", "15778895", "16197334", "196536", "18391272", "2800834", "9683534", "3036406", "13830532", "15052554", "13833463", "4968", "10593533", "11592961", "670108", "3823268", "15475648", "14250058", "7128002", "18304365", "197437484", "6387937", "6483070", "4428232", "9165217", "16162039", "6386670", "8143231", "4663262", "2095855", "126253703", "126391605", "47128183", "14595033", "118828957", "14627863", "961425", "808323"], "inbound_citations": ["6988444", "46768638", "35087305", "13703949", "5524956", "51628385", "59337374", "30442332", "6134968", "18582070", "19349971", "8795823", "29151531", "54203227", "36662980", "174801595", "211206613", "209376483", "16632621"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15654728"}

The driver's gap acceptance data was collected at 4-legged unsignalized intersections. The information such as the type of crossing vehicle, conflicting vehicle, speed and the spatial gap was extracted from the video data.

Efficient and early prediction of people having PD is a key issue to improve patient\u2019s quality of life. The diagnosis of PD specifically in its initial stages is extremely complex and time-consuming. Thus, the accurate and efficient diagnosis of PD has been a significant challenge for medical experts and practitioners. In order to tackle this issue and to accurately diagnosis the patient of PD, we proposed a machine-learning-based prediction system. In the development of the proposed system, the support vector machine (SVM) was used as a predictive model for the prediction of PD. The L1-norm SVM of features selection was used for appropriate and highly related features selection for accurate target classification of PD and healthy people. The L1-norm SVM produced a new subset of features from the PD dataset based on a feature weight value. For the validation of the proposed system, the $K$ -fold cross-validation method was used. In addition, the metrics of performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and execution time, were computed for model performance evaluation. The PD dataset was in this paper. The optimal accuracy achieved the best subset of the selected features that might be due to various contributions of the PD features. The experimental findings of this paper suggest that the proposed method can be used to accurately predict the PD and can be easily incorporated in healthcare for diagnosis purpose. Currently, the computer-based assisted predictive system is playing an important role to assist in PD recognition.

The starting point of this dissertation is the concept of probabilistic robotics, an emerging paradigm that combines state-of-the-art methods with the classic probabilistic theory, developing stochastic frameworks for understanding the uncertain nature of the interaction between a robot and its environment. This allows introducing relevant concepts which are the foundation of the localisation system implemented on the main experimental platform used on this dissertation. An accurate estimation of the position of a robot with respect to a fixed frame is fundamental for building navigation systems that can work in dynamic unstructured environments. This development also allows introducing additional contributions related with global localisation, dynamic obstacle avoidance, path planning and position tracking problems. Kinematics on generalised manipulators are characterised for dealing with complex nonlinear systems. Nonlinear formulations are needed to properly model these systems, which are not always suitable for real-time realisation, lacking analytic formulations in most cases. In this context, this thesis tackles the serial-parallel dual kinematic problem with a novel approach, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance. With a spatial decomposition method, the forward kinematics problem on parallel robots and the inverse kinematics problem on serial manipulators is solved modelling the nonlinear behaviour of the pose space using Support Vector Machines. The results are validated on different topologies with the analytic solution for such manipulators, which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method. Modelling and control of complex dynamical systems is another relevant field with applications on mobile robots. Nonlinear techniques are usually applied to tackle problems like feature or object tracking. However, some nonlinear integer techniques applied for tasks like position tracking in mobile robots with complex dynamics have limited success when modelling such systems. Fractional calculus has demonstrated to be suitable to model complex processes like viscoelasticity or super diffusion. These tools, that take advantage of the generalization of the derivative and integral operators to a fractional order, have been applied to model and control different topics related with robotics in recent years with remarkable success. With the proposal of a fractional-order PI controller, a suitable controller design method is presented to solve the position tracking problem. This is applied to control the distance of a self-driving car with respect to an objective, which can also be applied to other tracking applications like following a navigation path. Furthermore, this thesis introduces a novel fractional-order hyperchaotic system, stabilised with a full-pseudo-state-feedback controller and a located feedback method. This theoretical contribution of a chaotic system is introduced hoping to be useful in this context. Chaos theory has recently started to be applied to study manipulators, biped robots and autonomous navigation, achieving new and promising results, highlighting the uncertain and chaotic nature which also has been found on robots. All together, this thesis is devoted to different problems related with dynamic state estimation for mobile robots, proposing specific contributions related with modelling and control of complex nonlinear systems. These findings are presented in the context of a self-driving electric car, Verdino, jointly developed in collaboration with the Robotics Group of Universidad de La Laguna (GRULL).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2956061134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198331744"}

This technique calculates the projected values of potentially linearly correlated values onto P-linearly orthogonal axes, where P is the number of principal axes that define a subset space. Classification was done using support vector machines (SVM). Using the PCA and SVM algorithm, approximately 5300 training images representative of 16 different modes were used to create a classifier.

{"paper_id": "16192714", "title": "Optimisation of Support Vector Machine Classifier Algorithms for use as a brain computer interface in real-time fMRI applications", "authors": [{"first": "G.", "middle": ["B."], "last": "Williams", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Introduction In recent years support vector machines (SVMs) have been used for analysis of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI). They are particularly well suited to categorisation and classification of brain states and they can subsequently be used to infer spatial activation[1] as an alternative to the more conventional general linear model (GLM) approaches. At the same time, real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) technology has been developed to allow the rapid export and analysis of data from the scanner environment. Many rt-fMRI experiments rely on general linear model approaches, which allow good sensitivity for spatial activation. However, they rely on an accumulation of data to provide valid statistics and are less useful for the classification of a single time point. For some contexts, in particular the development of a brain computer interface (BCI), temporal classification of scans into \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cbaseline\u201d (or \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d) are precisely the information that we require, and we are less interested in the spatial pattern of activation. LaConte[2] has previously successfully presented results on the application of SVM classifiers to real-time fMRI datasets with a variety of paradigms, but many questions remain over the optimal choice of experimental design. In particular there is \u201cdrift\u201d in classification status that appears to favour active classifications more than baseline classifications which is hypothesised to be due to subject motion[2]. In this work, we explore how different acquisition and processing strategies can increase the reliability of the classifier, while constrained by the fact that results must be reported rapidly and in time-order. Methods Acquisition Eleven healthy volunteers were scanned on a Siemens 3T Tim Trio using a paradigm that has previously been successfully used to identify the supplementary motor area in healthy volunteers and some patients with impaired consciousness [3]. The image matrix was 64x64, with an in-plane resolution of 3x3mm. 32 slices were acquired with a thickness of 3mm (interslice gap 0.75mm). TR was 2 seconds. Subjects were initially asked to imagine playing tennis for 20 seconds, followed by a period of rest for 40 seconds, and \u201ctennis\u201d for a further 20 seconds. This sequence was repeated four times. After four such blocks, the paradigm was reversed (so that it started with 20 seconds of \u201ctennis\u201d), and repeated a further three times. This resulted in a total of 320 time points (with equal numbers of \u201crest\u201d and \u201ctennis\u201d time points) and a scan time of 10 minutes and 40 seconds. This relatively unusual block design was chosen so that the first moment of the task label was zero. The initial phase shift was inserted in order to test whether the classifier tended to favour \u201ctennis\u201d states since on average they came later in the acquisition, and thus later scans were more similar to them. The reason for the reversal of the block design half way through was to avoid artefacts resulting from any periodic temporal variation in the classifier. We also deliberately use a single acquisition for training and classification in order to eliminate any effects on the classifier resulting from differing calibrations at the start of each acquisition. Support Vector Machine implementation SVM light software[4] was used to implement the classifiers. For a binary classification such as this we can define a \u201cdecision boundary\u201d in a space with the same dimension as the number of independent measurements in each time point (i.e. the number of voxels in the analysis). One side of the decision boundary we classify a point as being \u201ctennis\u201d, and the other \u201crest\u201d. In brief, the SVM algorithm determines (from a training data set where the classifications are known) the time points that are most difficult to classify (they are closest to the decision boundary). A decision function is formed from a linear combination of these points, and this is used to classify subsequent unknown time points. For more details see [1],[2] or [4]. For each analysis, 160 time points were used for the training and 160 were treated as unknown time points, allowing an estimate of the success rate of the classifier for each analysis method. All time points were aligned to correct for subject motion by built-in Siemens image reconstruction software. Masking procedures: In order to restrict the analysis to voxels within the brain, a mask was created from the first image of the time series. Images were thresholded at 80% of the mean voxel value, which was an ad-hoc threshold that broadly identified brain tissue and excluded voxels with very little signal. Data preprocessing: Two different preprocessing methods were attempted: with and without temporal detrending. In the latter case a linear intensity drift (calculated from all data acquired so far) was assumed and subtracted from the image on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Additionally, the experiments were repeated after smoothing with a 8mm Gaussian kernel. Block Ordering: It is interesting to determine whether it is optimal to acquire all the training data prior to classification, or whether the scanner stability during the acquisition is such that it is more appropriate to dynamically update the classifier during the sequence. In order to test this, we have relabelled the data so that the 160 training blocks are distributed through the whole acquisition, and assessed whether this affects the error rate. Each learning/classifier period was constrained to be 40 time points long. For example, we might treat the first 40 scans as \u201clearning\u201d scans where the class is unknown, the next 40 time points as \u201cunknown\u201d states, and repeat this sequence four times. With these constraints there are 20 different arrangements of learning/classifier periods. Results & Discussion A typical result (corrected for classifier drift) is shown in Fig. 1 and the results for all subjects and settings summarised in Table 1. They showed that temporal detrending did not in general reduce the classifier drift and in all cases the correction employed by LaConte et al was still able to improve the success rate. The redesigned order of the blocks did not appear to significantly change the corrected success rate from that found in a previous study (88%)[2]. Smoothing the input data also did not significantly change the results. Changing the task order and including learning and classification periods within the same acquisition does not appear to compensate completely for classifier drift despite the presence of motion correction. It was found that it was better to have all learning scans acquired near the beginning of the acquisition, although the exact scheme varied between individuals (see Table 2). Further investigation of this is needed for longer acquisitions. References [1] LaConte S. et al. NeuroImage 26:317-329 (2005). [2] LaConte S. et al. HBM 28:1033-1044 (2007). [3] Owen A. et al.

However, a single unified projection matrix can hardly characterize all data similarities accurately as the practical data are usually very complicated, and simply adopting one global projection matrix might ignore important local patterns hidden in the dataset. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method dubbed \u201cData-Adaptive Metric Learning\u201d (DAML), which constructs a data-adaptive projection matrix for each data pair by selectively combining a set of learned candidate matrices. As a result, every data pair can obtain a specific projection matrix, enabling the proposed DAML to flexibly fit the training data and produce discriminative projection results. The model of DAML is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly learns candidate projection matrices and their sparse combination for every data pair. Nevertheless, the over-fitting problem may occur due to the large amount of parameters to be learned. To tackle this issue, we adopt the Total Variation (TV) regularizer to align the scales of data embedding produced by all candidate projection matrices, and thus the generated metrics of these learned candidates are generally comparable. Furthermore, we extend the basic linear DAML model to the kernerlized version (denoted \u201cKDAML\u201d) to handle the non-linear cases, and the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) is employed to solve the optimization model.

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Sound Source Localization (SSL) are the key signal processing components that humans perform by processing sound signals received at both ears, sometimes with the help of visual cues by locating and observing the lip movements of the speaker. Both VAD and SSL serve as the crucial design elements for building applications involving human speech. For example, systems with microphone arrays can benefit from these for robust speech capture in video conferencing applications, or for speaker identification and speech recognition in Human Computer Interfaces (HCIs). The design and implementation of robust VAD and SSL algorithms in practical acoustic environments are still challenging problems, particularly when multiple simultaneous speakers exist in the same audiovisual scene.

However, few authors have used mathematical models for evaluating the likelihood of perioperative cardiac events. Methods and Results This retrospective cohort study collected data of 1,351 patients referred for SPECT before non-cardiac surgery. We generated binary classifiers using support vector machine (SVM) and conventional linear models for predicting perioperative cardiac events. We used clinical and surgical risk, and SPECT findings as input data, and the occurrence of all and hard cardiac events as output data. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for assessing the prediction accuracy. The AUC values were 0.884 and 0.748 in the SVM and linear models, respectively in predicting all cardiac events with clinical and surgical risk, and SPECT variables. The values were 0.861 (SVM) and 0.677 (linear) when not using SPECT data as input. In hard events, the AUC values were 0.892 (SVM) and 0.864 (linear) with SPECT, and 0.867 (SVM) and 0.768 (linear) without SPECT. Conclusion The SVM was superior to the linear model in risk stratification. We also found an incremental prognostic value of SPECT results over information about clinical and surgical risk.

With the words in the English sentiment lexicon as seeds, we propose a bilingual word graph label propagation approach to induce sentiment polarities of the unlabeled words in the target language. Particularly, we show that both synonym and antonym word relations can be used to build the intra-language relation, and that the word alignment information derived from bilingual parallel sentences can be effectively leveraged to build the inter-language relation.

Design We developed a hybrid system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with augmented training data from the Internet. Our system consists of three types of classification-based systems: the first system uses spanning n-gram features for subjective categories, the second one uses bag-of-n-gram features for objective categories, and the third one uses pattern matching for infrequent or subtle emotion categories. The spanning n-gram features are selected by a feature selection algorithm that leverages emotional corpus from weblogs. Special normalization of objective sentences is generalized with shallow parsing and external web knowledge. We utilize three sources of web data: the weblog of LiveJournal which helps to improve the feature selection, the eBay List which assists in special normalization of information and instructions categories, and the suicide project web which provides unlabeled data with similar properties as suicide notes. Measurements The performance is evaluated by the overall micro-averaged precision, recall and F-measure. Result Our system achieved an overall micro-averaged F-measure of 0.59. Happiness_peacefulness had the highest F-measure of 0.81. We were ranked as the second best out of 26 competing teams. Conclusion Our results indicated that classifying fine-grained sentiments at sentence level is a non-trivial task. It is effective to divide categories into different groups according to their semantic properties.

In this paper we consider two basic learning problems assuming that the underlying data follow a generative model based on a ReLU-network -- a neural network with ReLU activations. As a primarily theoretical study, we limit ourselves to a single-layer network. The first problem we study corresponds to dictionary-learning in the presence of nonlinearity (modeled by the ReLU functions). Given a set of observation vectors $\\mathbf{y}^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, i =1, 2, \\dots , n$, we aim to recover $d\\times k$ matrix $A$ and the latent vectors $\\{\\mathbf{c}^i\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^k$ under the model $\\mathbf{y}^i = \\mathrm{ReLU}(A\\mathbf{c}^i +\\mathbf{b})$, where $\\mathbf{b}\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is a random bias. We show that it is possible to recover the column space of $A$ within an error of $O(d)$ (in Frobenius norm) under certain conditions on the probability distribution of $\\mathbf{b}$. The second problem we consider is that of robust recovery of the signal in the presence of outliers, i.e., large but sparse noise. In this setting we are interested in recovering the latent vector $\\mathbf{c}$ from its noisy nonlinear sketches of the form $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathrm{ReLU}(A\\mathbf{c}) + \\mathbf{e}+\\mathbf{w}$, where $\\mathbf{e} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ denotes the outliers with sparsity $s$ and $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ denote the dense but small noise. This line of work has recently been studied (Soltanolkotabi, 2017) without the presence of outliers. For this problem, we show that a generalized LASSO algorithm is able to recover the signal $\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ within an $\\ell_2$ error of $O(\\sqrt{\\frac{(k+s)\\log d}{d}})$ when $A$ is a random Gaussian matrix.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.04304", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2790769103", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["995480", "1048447", "9272289", "40077539", "12605120", "2427577", "54983697", "15273415", "5568091", "1033682", "3127593", "14379407", "53504", "118526268", "6080319", "11921974", "15691159", "7780104", "735951", "6920994"], "inbound_citations": ["204876819", "56895249", "203257931"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3888084"}

Given a pair of sample and synthesised textures, the two regressors can be used to predict the global and local quality scores of the synthesised texture respectively. An overall score is generated from the two scores. Our results show that the deep Bag-of-Words (BoW) descriptors, extracted by a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), perform better than, or comparably to, the other nine types of hand-crafted or CNN descriptors and an image quality assessment measure, together with the proposed TSQA approach.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105591", "venue": null, "journal": "Knowledge Based Systems", "mag_id": "3004094352", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212998814"}

A popular approach uses key information from electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify human emotions. In this paper, we proposed an emotion recognition model based on the Russell's circumplex model, Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. Moreover, we also proposed a method to determine an emotion label of a series of EEG signals. Our model includes two main approaches in machine learning step. In a first approach, machine learning was utilized for all EEG signals from numerous subjects while another used machine learning for each particular subject. We extensively implemented our model in several test data. The experimental results showed that the first approach is impossible to apply in practical applications because EEG signal of each subject has individual characteristic.

Which ALS-derived metrics to include when modeling forest inventory attributes, and how prediction accuracies vary over forest types depends largely on the structural complexity of the forest(s) being studied. Hence, the purpose of this study was to (i) examine the usefulness of adding texture and intensity metrics to height-based ALS metrics for the prediction of several forest resource inventory (FRI) attributes in one boreal and two Great Lakes, St. Lawrence (GLSL) forest region sites in Ontario and (ii) quantify and compare the site and forest type variability within the context of the FRI prediction accuracies. Basal area (BA), quadratic mean diameter-at-breast height (QMD), and stem density (S) were predicted using the ABA and a nonparametric Random Forests (RF) regression model. At the site level, prediction accuracies (i.e., expressed as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), bias, and R2) improved at the three sites when texture and intensity metrics were included in the predictor set, even though no significant differences (p > 0.05) could be detected using the nonparametric RMANOVA test. Stem density benefitted the most from the inclusion of texture and intensity, particularly in the GLSL sites (% RMSE improved up to 6%). Combining site and forest type results indicated that improvements in site level predictions, due to the addition of texture and intensity metrics to the ALS predictor set, were the result of changes in prediction accuracy in some but not all forest types present at a site and that these changes in prediction accuracy were site and FRI attribute specific. The nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test indicated that prediction errors between the different forest types were significantly different (p \u2264 0.01). In the boreal site, prediction accuracies for conifer forest types were higher than for deciduous and mixedwoods.

The relevance of features in a classification procedure is linked to the fact that misclassifications costs are frequently asymmetric, since false positive and false negative cases may have very different consequences. However, off-the-shelf Feature Selection procedures seldom take into account such cost-sensitivity of errors. In this paper we propose a mathematical-optimization-based Feature Selection procedure embedded in one of the most popular classification procedures, namely, Support Vector Machines, accommodating asymmetric misclassification costs. The key idea is to replace the traditional margin maximization by minimizing the number of features selected, but imposing upper bounds on the false positive and negative rates. The problem is written as an integer linear problem plus a quadratic convex problem for Support Vector Machines with both linear and radial kernels. The reported numerical experience demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed Feature Selection procedure.

We revisit this popular research and industry sought problem, in the historical data perspective. Proposed model has two steps. N Test cases based on multiple heuristics are recommended as part of first step. These heuristics can be derived based on test manager, test lead and/or test director requirements as inputs. The N test cases that are to be recommended will be derived upon executing evolutionary randomized algorithms such as Random Forest / Genetic Algorithm. These algorithms fed with historically derived inputs such as test case execution frequency, test case failure pattern, change feature pattern and bug fixes & associations. The recommended test suite is further optimized based on a 2 dimensional approach during second step. Test case specific vertical constraints such as distribution of environments, distribution of features as well as test suite composition parameters such as golden test cases, sanity test cases, that serves as horizontal constraints.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICAIET.2014.18", "venue": "2014 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Engineering and Technology", "journal": "2014 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Engineering and Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2539541966", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17001450", "14596302", "385644", "7260816", "89141", "8758844", "18989122", "14097338", "2911517", "16999563", "34563682", "17068830"], "inbound_citations": ["34696322", "19908742"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18071373"}

Since conventional approaches are expensive and voluminous protein sequence information are available in the post-genomic era, development of an automated and accurate computational tool is highly desirable for prediction of HSPs, their families and sub-types. Thus, we propose a computational approach for reliable prediction of all these components in a single framework and with higher accuracy as well. The proposed approach achieved an overall accuracy of ~84% in predicting HSPs, ~97% in predicting six different families of HSPs and ~94% in predicting four types of DnaJ proteins, with bench mark datasets. The developed approach also achieved higher accuracy as compared to most of the existing approaches. For easy prediction of HSPs by experimental scientists, a user friendly web server ir-HSP is freely accessible at http://cabgrid.res.in:8080/ir-hsp. The ir-HSP was further evaluated for proteome-wide identification of HSPs by using proteome datasets of eight different species, and ~50% of the predicted HSPs in each species were found to be annotated with InterPro HSP families/domains. Thus, the developed computational method is expected to supplement the currently available approaches for HSP prediction to the extent of families and sub-types.

The features learned from the models were then employed in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework to classify the pages into one of the two categories of acceptable and unacceptable quality. In this paper, we introduce a set of tools for machine learning in the assessment of printed page uniformity. This work is primarily targeted to the printing industry, specifically the ubiquitous laser, electrophotographic printer. We use features that are well-correlated with the rankings of expert observers to develop a novel machine learning framework that allows one to achieve the minimum \"false alarm\" rate, subject to a chosen \"miss\" rate. Surprisingly, most of the research that has been conducted on machine learning does not consider this framework. During the process of developing a new product, test engineers will print hundreds of test pages, which can be scanned and then analyzed by an autonomous algorithm. Among these pages, most may be of acceptable quality. The objective is to find the ones that are not. These will provide critically important information to systems designers, regarding issues that need to be addressed in improving the printer design. A \"miss\" is defined to be a page that is not of acceptable quality to an expert observer that the prediction algorithm declares to be a \"pass\". Misses are a serious problem, since they represent problems that will not be seen by the systems designers. On the other hand, \"false alarms\" correspond to pages that an expert observer would declare to be of acceptable quality, but which are flagged by the prediction algorithm as \"fails\". In a typical printer testing and development scenario, such pages would be examined by an expert, and found to be of acceptable quality after all. \"False alarm\" pages result in extra pages to be examined by expert observers, which increases labor cost. But \"false alarms\" are not nearly as catastrophic as \"misses\", which represent potentially serious problems that are never seen by the systems developers. This scenario motivates us to develop a machine learning framework that will achieve the minimum \"false alarm\" rate subject to a specified \"miss\" rate. In order to construct such a set of receiver operating characteristic2 (ROC) curves, we examine various tools for the prediction, ranging from an exhaustive search over the space of the nonlinear discriminants to a Cost-Sentitive SVM3 framework. We then compare the curves gained from those methods.

We propose an automated approach for the classification of stellar spectra in the optical region using Convolutional Neural Networks. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods with \"shallow\" architecture (usually up to 2 hidden layers) have been trained for these purposes in the past. However, deep learning methods with a larger number of hidden layers allow the use of finer details in the spectrum which results in improved accuracy and better generalisation. Studying finer spectral signatures also enables us to determine accurate differential stellar parameters and find rare objects. We examine various machine and deep learning algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify stellar spectra using the Jacoby Atlas, ELODIE and MILES spectral libraries as training samples.

The evaluation of relationships between irrigation demand and groundwater availability is important to effectively manage water sources for agricultural production. In the field of groundwater modeling, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been widely used in the forecasting of level fluctuations, because of its performance and capacity to reproduce the groundwater seasonal variability. Meanwhile, Support Vector Regression (SVR) is another machine learning technique that has gained popularity in hydrologic sciences because it provides global predictions, accurate estimates and is based on statistical learning theory. These types of machine learning algorithms are useful especially when field measurement of daily groundwater levels is unsustainable. In addition to the limited number of studies that evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of ANN and SVR in groundwater level prediction, there is a need to develop more research for the analysis of new models in forecasting groundwater levels. The objective of this study was to compare two machine learning algorithms for the prediction of groundwater variations at a local level in a shallow alluvial aquifer. ANN and SVR were evaluated in terms of optimization efficiency and runtime speed for an individual well located in Sunflower Mississippi, to identify the best model for simulating changes in groundwater levels, providing estimations up to three months ahead. The analysis of performance between the two models was based on the mean square error (MSE) results and the model\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to represent the groundwater withdrawal periods. Results from ANN and SVR simulations showed that the models can efficiently predict daily groundwater levels. However, for the recharge (winter) season, ANN performed better than SVR with MSE values of 0.005612 and 0.09369 m, respectively. A robust and suitable groundwater forecasting model is a useful decision support tool for farmers and stakeholders to develop groundwater conservation plans and improve crop production with an efficient use of water.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.13031/aim.20152181983", "venue": "2015 ASABE International Meeting", "journal": "2015 ASABE International Meeting", "mag_id": "2229425721", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199387285", "150367159"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110276960"}

In the meantime, many studies and applications using OWL have been reported in research, many of which go beyond Internet usage and employ the power of ontological modelling in other fields such as biology, medicine, software engineering, knowledge management, and cognitive systems. However, recent progress in the field faces a lack of well-structured ontologies with large amounts of instance data due to the fact that engineering such ontologies requires a considerable investment of resources. Nowadays, knowledge bases often provide large volumes of data without sophisticated schemata. Methods for automated schema acquisition and maintenance are, therefore, sought. Furthermore, many classification and knowledge acquisition problems, e.g. the detection of chemical compounds causing cancer, can be handled by using the same techniques. In order to leverage machine-learning approaches for solving these tasks, it is required to develop methods and tools for learning concepts in description logics or, equivalently, class expressions in OWL. In this thesis, it is shown that methods from Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are applicable to learning in description logic knowledge bases. The results provide foundations for the acquisition of OWL ontologies, in particular in cases when extensional information (facts, instance data) is easily available, while corresponding intensional information (schema) is missing or not expressive enough to allow powerful reasoning over the ontology in a useful way. Such situations often occur when extracting knowledge from different sources, e.g. databases and wikis, or in collaborative knowledge engineering scenarios. It can be argued that being able to learn OWL class expressions is a step towards enriching OWL knowledge bases in order to enable powerful reasoning, consistency checking, and improved querying possibilities. In particular, plugins for OWL ontology editors based on learning methods are developed and evaluated in this work. The developed algorithms are, of course, not restricted to ontology engineering and can handle other learning problems. Indeed, they lend themselves to generic use in machine learning in the same way as ILP systems do. The main difference, however, is the employed knowledge representation paradigm: ILP traditionally uses logic programs for knowledge representation, whereas this work rests on DLs/OWL. This distinction is crucial when considering Semantic Web applications as target use cases, as such applications hinge centrally on the chosen knowledge representation format for knowledge interchange and integration.

To this end, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to solve the PEVs' Cooperative Charging with Power constraints (PEV-CCP). Our solution considers the electric power limits that originate from physical characteristics of charging station, such as on-site transformer capacity limit, and allows for containing charging burden of PEVs on the electric distribution network. Our approach also enables plug-and-play and valley-filling capabilities of PEV charge scheduling. It distributes computation among agents (PEVs) to solve the PEV-CCP problem in a distributed fashion through an iterative interaction between neighboring agents. The structure of each agent's update functions ensures an agreement on a price signal while enforcing individual PEV constraints. In addition to converging towards the globally-optimum solution, our algorithm ensures the feasibility of each PEV's decision at each iteration.

Our model consists of a top-down stack of GANs, each learned to generate lower-level representations conditioned on higher-level representations. A representation discriminator is introduced at each feature hierarchy to encourage the representation manifold of the generator to align with that of the bottom-up discriminative network, leveraging the powerful discriminative representations to guide the generative model. In addition, we introduce a conditional loss that encourages the use of conditional information from the layer above, and a novel entropy loss that maximizes a variational lower bound on the conditional entropy of generator outputs. We first train each stack independently, and then train the whole model end-to-end. Unlike the original GAN that uses a single noise vector to represent all the variations, our SGAN decomposes variations into multiple levels and gradually resolves uncertainties in the top-down generative process.

Most modern systems communicating directly with the user share one common feature: they have a dialog system (DS) at their base. As of today almost all DS components embraced statistical methods and widely use them as their core models. Until recently Natural Language Generation (NLG) component of a dialog system used primarily hand-coded generation templates, which represented model phrases in a natural language mapped to a particular semantic content. Today data-driven models are making their way into the NLG domain. In this thesis, we follow along this new line of research and present several novel data-driven approaches to natural language generation. In our work we focus on two important aspects of NLG systems development: building an efficient generator and diversifying its output. Two key ideas that we defend here are the following: first, the task of NLG can be regarded as the translation between a natural language and a formal meaning representation, and therefore, can be performed using statistical machine translation techniques, and second, corpus extension and diversification which traditionally involved manual paraphrasing and rule crafting can be performed automatically using well-known and widely used synonym and paraphrase extraction methods. Concerning our first idea, we investigate the possibility of using NGRAM translation framework and explore the potential of discriminative learning, notably Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models, as applied to NLG; we build a generation pipeline which allows for inclusion and combination of different generation models (NGRAM and CRF) and which uses an efficient decoding framework (finite-state transducers' best path search). Regarding the second objective, namely corpus extension, we propose to enlarge the system's vocabulary and the set of available syntactic structures via integrating automatically obtained synonyms and paraphrases into the training corpus. To our knowledge, there have been no attempts to increase the size of the system vocabulary by incorporating synonyms. To date most studies on corpus extension focused on paraphrasing and resorted to crowd-sourcing in order to obtain paraphrases, which then required additional manual validation often performed by system developers. We prove that automatic corpus extension by means of paraphrase extraction and validation is just as effective as crowd-sourcing, being at the same time less costly in terms of development time and resources. During intermediate experiments our generation models showed a significantly better performance than the phrase-based baseline model and appeared to be more robust in handling unknown combinations of concepts than the current in-house rule-based generator. The final human evaluation confirmed that our data-driven NLG models is a viable alternative to rule-based generators.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2527937800", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["35691568"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45116545"}

The traditional input devices, such as keyboard and mouse, are not able to fully exploit the potential of these interfaces and do not offer a natural interaction. Hand gestures provide, instead, a more natural and sometimes safer way of interacting with computers and other machines without touching them. The use cases for gesture-based interfaces range from gaming to automatic sign language interpretation, health care, robotics, and vehicle automation. ::: Automatic gesture recognition is a challenging problem that has been attaining a growing interest in the research field for several years due to its applications in natural interfaces. The first approaches, based on the recognition from 2D color pictures or video only, suffered of the typical problems characterizing such type of data. Inter occlusions, different skin colors among users even of the same ethnic group and unstable illumination conditions, in facts, often made this problem intractable. Other approaches, instead, solved the previous problems by making the user wear sensorized gloves or hold proper tools designed to help the hand localization in the scene. ::: The recent introduction in the mass market of novel low-cost range cameras, like the Microsoft Kinect, Asus XTION, Creative Senz3D, and the Leap Motion, has opened the way to innovative gesture recognition approaches exploiting the geometry of the framed scene. Most methods share a common gesture recognition pipeline based on firstly identifying the hand in the framed scene, then extracting some relevant features on the hand samples and finally exploiting suitable machine learning techniques in order to recognize the performed gesture from a predefined ``gesture dictionary''. ::: This thesis, based on the previous rationale, proposes a novel gesture recognition framework exploiting both color and geometric cues from low-cost color and range cameras. The dissertation starts by introducing the automatic hand gesture recognition problem, giving an overview of the state-of-art algorithms and the recognition pipeline employed in this work. Then, it briefly describes the major low-cost range cameras and setups used in literature for color and depth data acquisition for hand gesture recognition purposes, highlighting their capabilities and limitations. The methods employed for respectively detecting the hand in the framed scene and segmenting it in its relevant parts are then analyzed with a higher level of detail. The algorithm first exploits skin color information and geometrical considerations for discarding the background samples, then it reliably detects the palm and the finger regions, and removes the forearm. For the palm detection, the method fits the largest circle inscribed in the palm region or, in a more advanced version, an ellipse. ::: A set of robust color and geometric features which can be extracted from the fingers and palm regions, previously segmented, is then illustrated accurately. Geometric features describe properties of the hand contour from its curvature variations, the distances in the 3D space or in the image plane of its points from the hand center or from the palm, or extract relevant information from the palm morphology and from the empty space in the hand convex hull. Color features exploit, instead, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), local phase quantization (LPQ) and local ternary patterns (LTP) algorithms to provide further helpful cues from the hand texture and the depth map treated as a grayscale image. Additional features extracted from the Leap Motion data complete the gesture characterization for a more reliable recognition. Moreover, the thesis also reports a novel approach jointly exploiting the geometric data provided by the Leap Motion and the depth data from a range camera for extracting the same depth features with a significantly lower computational effort. ::: This work then addresses the delicate problem of constructing a robust gesture recognition model from the features previously described, using multi-class Support Vector Machines, Random Forests or more powerful ensembles of classifiers. Feature selection techniques, designed to detect the smallest subset of features that allow to train a leaner classification model without a significant accuracy loss, are also considered. ::: The proposed recognition method, tested on subsets of the American Sign Language and experimentally validated, reported very high accuracies. The results showed also how higher accuracies are obtainable by combining proper sets of complementary features and using ensembles of classifiers. Moreover, it is worth noticing that the proposed approach is not sensor dependent, that is, the recognition algorithm is not bound to a specific sensor or technology adopted for the depth data acquisition. Eventually, the gesture recognition algorithm is able to run in real-time even in absence of a thorough optimization, and may be easily extended in a near future with novel descriptors and the support for dynamic gestures.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2194617458", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62351769"}

This study proposes a novel self-taught learning for more accurately reconstructing the raw data based on the sparse autoencoder. It is well known that autoencoder is able to learn latent features via setting the target values to be equal to the input data, and can be stacked for pursuing high-level feature learning. Motivated by the natural sparsity of data representation, sparsity has been imposed on the hidden layer responses of autoencoder for more effective feature learning. Although the conventional autoencoder-based feature learning aims at obtaining the latent representation via minimizing the reconstruction error of the input data, it is unavoidable to produce reconstruction residual error of the input data and thus some tiny structures are unable to be represented, which may be essential information for fine-grained image task such as medical image analysis. Even with the multiple-layer stacking for high-level feature pursuing in autoencoder-based learning strategy, the lost tiny structure in the former layers cannot be recovered evermore. Therefore, this study proposes a residual sparse autoencoder for learning the latent feature representation of more tiny structures in the raw input data. With the unavoidably generated reconstruction residual error, we exploit another sparse autoencoder to pursuing the latent feature of the residual tiny structures and this self-taught learning process can continue until the representation residual error is enough small.

This simplicity makes it easy to work reasonably well without severe tuning of learning parameters. Further, our algorithm equips an algorithmic scheme to avoid negative transfer. We applied TrBagg to personalized tag prediction tasks for social bookmarks Our approach has several convenient characteristics for this task such as adaptation to multiple tasks with low computational cost.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2009.9", "venue": "2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": "2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2158514621", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207738357", "740063", "207752942", "13650160", "14154185", "8153773", "597779", "14669208", "2883482", "14862769", "18102927", "1946917", "207731647", "7311285", "5360764", "15353445", "2709712", "17429744", "9238949", "17547265", "7590780", "2807135", "1215039", "8144968"], "inbound_citations": ["2910429", "17586126", "7584447", "15448992", "2627541", "49666932", "116060692", "14085200", "635466", "36787778", "205435802", "211553787", "14576292", "204838807", "2328574", "3439816", "59617613", "202637578", "9438194", "58028909", "126154264", "18448043", "14523863", "7559976", "12702497", "212710165", "43608791", "14938142", "6220482", "204801127", "12281859", "52887687", "26986561", "198401143", "17981529", "19870573", "9753166", "15823540", "174774888", "61515250"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6153928"}

To avoid this problem we suggest a method referred to as active testing, whose aim is to reduce the number of comparisons by carefully selecting which tests should be carried out. This method uses meta-knowledge concerning past experiments and proceeds in an iterative manner. It takes the form of a competition in which, in each iteration, the candidate best algorithm is pitted against its most promising competitor. The winner proceeds to the next round, while the loser is removed from consideration. To speed up the process of testing each pair of competitors on new datasets, we use a fast method that exploits meta-information on partial learning curves measured on prior datasets to predict which algorithm is better.

The success of this technique partly relies on the selection of atlases that are best mapped to a new target image after registration.

Therefore, different techniques produce different embeddings even when applied to the same data set. Previous studies used a single technique in their method and gave no reason for the choice of the manifold learning technique employed nor the theoretical grounds for the choice of the manifold parameters. In this study, we compare side-by-side the results given by 3 manifold learning techniques (Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding) on the same data set. We assess the ability of those 3 different techniques to select the best atlases to combine in the framework of multi-atlas segmentation. First, a leave-one-out experiment is used to optimize our method on a set of 110 manually segmented atlases of hippocampi and find the manifold learning technique and associated manifold parameters that give the best segmentation accuracy. Then, the optimal parameters are used to automatically segment 30 subjects from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For our dataset, the selection of atlases with Locally Linear Embedding gives the best results. Our findings show that selection of atlases with manifold learning leads to segmentation accuracy close to or significantly higher than the state-of-the-art method and that accuracy can be increased by fine tuning the manifold learning process.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3732273", "pubmed_id": "23936376", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070059", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2142366297", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15100686", "10998222", "9391973", "1761791", "15729548", "11298817", "18106824", "8008351", "3090412", "16201824", "16845999", "3190160", "3123413", "10714386", "9585081", "15826252", "2770667", "1536455", "14879317", "40225386", "14184445", "16707847", "6894357", "15144156", "405538", "330039", "3025202", "11646075", "2995286", "3272607", "8087199", "23356568", "17518987", "53335638", "13942688", "8856627", "38468630", "9629554", "207165453", "8625980", "22046389", "9892253", "5611286", "9196907", "5890119", "6411928", "764149"], "inbound_citations": ["38723246", "89612170", "10641065", "51628044", "3150599", "215214444", "38003960", "39246940", "64810340", "8634249", "890872", "8999144", "195882886", "708146", "8528501", "20800512", "9113421", "496258", "6712943", "38833651", "8271094", "195192892", "30564565", "12432509", "108294944"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15632456"}

Using Random Forest regression we analysed how both average woody cover and its patchiness depend on annual rainfall, fire frequency and grazer and browser metabolic biomass densities. Fire frequency and rainfall were the clearest predictors, whereas effects of large herbivores on woody vegetation were smaller and more complex. Under low rainfall conditions (500 mm\u00b7yr\u22121) trees had less total cover and were more regularly spaced across the landscape (lower patchiness). Woody cover and vegetation patchiness increased with rainfall whereas fire frequency decreased woody cover and further increased patchiness.

In this paper, we propose a unified approach, Constrained Hierarchical Conditional Random Fields, to accomplish the three labeling tasks simultaneously. In this approach, complex structural dependencies can be well described. Also, the constrained Viterbi algorithm in the inference process can avoid logical errors. Experimental results on real world conference data have demonstrated that this approach performs better than cascaded labeling methods by 3.6% in F1-measure and that the constrained inference process can improve the accuracy by 14.3%.

Thus, phishing email detection with high accuracy has been an issue of great interest. Machine learning-based detection methods, particularly Support Vector Machine (SVM), have been proved to be effective. However, the parameters of kernel method, whose default is that class numbers reciprocals in general, affect the classification accuracy of SVM. In order to improve the classification accuracy, this paper proposes a model, called Cuckoo Search SVM(CS-SVM). The CS-SVM extracts 23 features, which are used to construct the hybrid classifier. In the hybrid classifier, Cuckoo Search (CS) is integrated with SVM to optimize parameter selection of Radial Basis Function(RBF).

Large-scale monitoring of wetlands is of high importance, but also challenging. The Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite missions for the first time provide radar and optical data at high spatial and temporal detail, and with this a unique opportunity for more accurate wetland mapping from space arises. Recent studies already used Sentinel-1 and -2 data to map specific wetland types or characteristics, but for comprehensive wetland characterisations the potential of the data has not been researched yet. The aim of our research was to study the use of the high-resolution and temporally dense Sentinel-1 and -2 data for wetland mapping in multiple levels of characterisation. The use of the data was assessed by applying Random Forests for multiple classification levels including general wetland delineation, wetland vegetation types and surface water dynamics. The results for the St. Lucia wetlands in South Africa showed that combining Sentinel-1 and -2 led to significantly higher classification accuracies than for using the systems separately. Accuracies were relatively poor for classifications in high-vegetated wetlands, as subcanopy flooding could not be detected with Sentinel-1\u2019s C-band sensors operating in VV/VH mode. When excluding high-vegetated areas, overall accuracies were reached of 88.5% for general wetland delineation, 90.7% for mapping wetland vegetation types and 87.1% for mapping surface water dynamics. Sentinel-2 was particularly of value for general wetland delineation, while Sentinel-1 showed more value for mapping wetland vegetation types. Overlaid maps of all classification levels obtained overall accuracies of 69.1% and 76.4% for classifying ten and seven wetland classes respectively.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2019.102009", "venue": "Int.

In this paper, we propose a non-parametric, noise resilient, graph-based classification algorithm. By modifying the training phase of the k-associated optimal graph algorithm, and proposing a new labeling algorithm in the testing phase, we introduce a novel approach that is robust in the presence of different level of noise. In designing the proposed classification method, each class of dataset is represented by a set of sub-graphs (components), and a new extension of the k-associated optimal graph algorithm is introduced in the training phase to combine the smaller components. With this enhancement, we demonstrate that our algorithm distinguishes between noisy and non-noisy sub-graphs. Moreover, in the testing phase, we combine relational data, such as the degree of relevancy, with non-relational attributes, such as distance, for each sample in a graph to make the proposed algorithm less sensitive to noise. Gravity formula is the main concept behind the proposed test sample with various modifications to tailor it to the arbitrary shape and non-uniform sample scattering of the graph structure. We compare the proposed method with a graph-based classifier, as well as two other well-known classifiers, namely, Decision Tree and Multi-Class Support Vector Machine. Confirmed by the t-Test score, our proposed method shows a superior performance in the presence of different levels of noise on various datasets from the UCI repository.

The current system does not give great precision in light of the fact that these strategies are wasteful for classification. The proposed work represents the classification of images depending on the groups. This work classifies the age into old, adult and child groups. This work completes in three steps, i.e., preprocessing, facial aging feature extraction and classification. In preprocessing, the RGB image is converted into a grayscale level image; the facial aging feature extraction is performed by skin texture feature extraction and wrinkle analysis. LGBPH and the density of wrinkles accomplished the wrinkle analysis. LGBPH is a histogram of LGBP which is calculated by LBP. The LGBP feature is not dynamic for features like rotation, alignment, and the illumination of the image. The proposed work selected three different skins for skin texture feature and five different skin textures for wrinkle investigation. This work uses K-NN classifier due to its fast processing; classifies the testing dataset from training dataset. The LGBPH provides better results and estimates the accuracy as compared to the previous technique used by the researcher.

The synchronies varied significantly between the perceived and not perceived faces, particularly in the theta, alpha and gamma bands but they were specific to the subject and the face category.

Most existing metric learning methods for person re-identification first generate the pairwise constraints where the sample pairs with the same labels consist of the positive set and the ones with the different labels comprise the negative set. And then, different kinds of methods are formulated to pull the pairs in positive set together and penalize the pairs in negative set such that a good metric is learned. However, such a process has two drawbacks: 1) the size of negative set is often far more than the negative set for which the learning process is largely dominated by the large amount of negative sample pairs and 2) it often experiences tedious optimization procedures to compute pairwise distances which would be computationally intractable in real scenarios, especially for large-scale data sets. To address the above issues, we propose a new simple and effective metric learning method, which gets rid of the pairwise constraints. We take the unknown class center\u2019s information into consideration to model the relationships between different classes directly, and a new objective function is formed. In addition, the proposed objective function can be solved by taking advantage of simple matrix multiplications and hence can avoid computationally complex optimization schemes. The proposed algorithm termed largest center-specific margin metric learning is shown to be computationally efficient and can be applied to large-scale person re-identification.

Firstly, since the signal-to-noise ratio cannot accurately reflect the denoising effect when the original signal is unknown, the noise envelope area as an evaluation index of the denoising effect for heart sound signal was proposed, and then the parameters of the wavelet threshold denoising method were optimized based on it. Next, the heart sound signal was denoised by the wavelet threshold denoising method with the optimal parameters. Secondly, the heart sound signal envelope was extracted based on the normalized average Shannon energy, and the double threshold method was improved by introducing the extra heart sounds culling function. Afterwards, the heart sound signal with murmur or extra heart sounds was located and segmented by the improved double threshold method. Finally, a discrete time-frequency energy feature based on S transform was proposed, and then the heart sound signals were classified by the Support Vector Machine based on it. The test results show that the discrete time-frequency energy feature based on S transform can better reflect the difference between different types of heart sound signals and has better classification effect compared with the conventional features.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101684", "venue": "Biomed.

It goes from solving a quadratic problem to a set of linear equations. A well-known property with respect to such least-squares formulation is the lack of sparseness. Sparseness is related to the induced model be expressed in terms of a relatively small number of samples. As the induced model lacks sparseness, it becomes intractable to deal with large-size datasets since, due to such reformulation, the computational complexity usually scales cubically based on the size of the training set. In this work, we tackle the problem of imposing sparseness in LSSVM by proposing a novel direct method based on class-corner support vector selection, named Class-corner LSSVM (CC-LSSVM). Our proposal is mainly based on FAST, an image corner detector. The main idea is to use the definition of what is a corner in FAST and then apply the same reasoning in support vector selection no only for pruning but for the construction of a (possibly) less constrained system as well. We validate CC-LSSVM through three types of experiments, evaluating different aspects: accuracy, sparseness, support vector selection, and hyperparameter sensitivity. Based on the results, we show that CC-LSSVM is a competitive alternative to other LSSVM variants since generalization performance was not impaired, while competitive costs with respect to memory usage, training and prediction costs were achieved as well.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.08.081", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2892419861", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53033593"}

Bilateral image denoising is considered as the preprocessing step. Support Vector Machine classifier is used for object identification. We have assumed that the spine is a continuous contour rather than a series of discrete vertebral bodies with individual orientations. Morphological operation, Gaussian blurring, spine centerline approximation and polynomial fit are used to extract the centerline of spine. The tangent at every point of the extracted centerline is taken and Cobb angle is evaluated from these tangent values. To analyze the automated diagnosis technique, the proposed approach was evaluated on a set of 21 coronal radiograph images. Identification of ROI based on Support Vector Machine classifier is effective enough with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and the center line extraction from this ROI gave correct results for 57.14% subjects with very less or negligible angular variability.

We developed an Ensembling-based predictive model using 13 attributes that were selected based on their clinical importance, Multiple Linear Regression, and Information Gain Ranking methods. The negative effect of the imbalance class of the constructed model was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The overall performance of the predictive model classifier was improved by the Ensemble machine learning approach using the Vote method with three Decision Trees (Naive Bayes Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Model Tree) and achieved high accuracy of prediction (AUC = 0.92).

To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel long-short distance aggregation networks (\\textttLSDAN ) for positive unlabeled (PU) graph learning. Our theme is to generate multiple graphs at different distances based on the adjacency matrix, and further develop a long-short distance attention model for these graphs. The short-distance attention mechanism is used to capture the importance of neighbor nodes to a target node. The long-distance attention mechanism is used to capture the propagation of information within a localized area of each node and help model weights of different graphs for node representation learning. A non-negative risk estimator is further employed, to aggregate long- short-distance networks, for PU learning using back-propagated loss modeling.

In contrast to well-known bagging algorithms such as random forest, the proposed method recalculates the motion features for each \u201cweak classifier\u201d (it does not randomly sample a feature set). The proposed classification method was evaluated on a challenging (even to a human observer) motion capture recording dataset of martial arts techniques performed by professional karate sportspeople. The dataset consisted of 360 recordings in 12 motion classes. Because some classes of these motions might be symmetrical (which means that they are performed with a dominant left or right hand/leg), an analysis was conducted to determine whether accounting for symmetry could improve the recognition rate of a classifier. The experimental results show that applying the proposed classifiers\u2019 bagging procedure increased the recognition rate (RR) of the Nearest-Neighbor (NNg) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers by more than 5% and 3%, respectively. The RR of one trained classifier (SVM) was higher when we did not use symmetry. On the other hand, the application of symmetry information for bagged NNg improved its recognition rate compared with the results without symmetry information. We can conclude that symmetry information might be helpful in situations in which it is not possible to optimize the decision borders of the classifier (for example, when we do not have direct information about class labels).

The dramatic increase in geo-tagged social media posts adds a new potential to understand consumer satisfaction towards target-specific quality-of-experience (QoE) topics. In our paper, we focus on evaluating users' opinion on wireless service-related topics by applying natural language processing (NLP) to geo-tagged Twitter data. Current generalized sentiment detection methods with generalized NLP corpora are not topic specific. Here, we develop a novel wireless service topic-specific sentiment framework, yielding higher targeting accuracy than generalized NLP frameworks. To do so, we first annotate a new sentiment corpus called SignalSentiWord (SSW) and compare its performance with two other popular corpus libraries, AFINN and SentiWordNet. We then apply three established machine learning methods, namely: Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to build our topic-specific sentiment classifier. Furthermore, we discuss the capability of SSW to filter noisy and high-frequency irrelevant words to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Some of these ADRs, such as torsade de pointes (TdP), are important issues in the approval of drugs for certain diseases. Thus there is a need to develop tools for facilitating the prediction of these ADRs. This work explores the use of a statistical learning method, support vector machine (SVM), for TdP prediction. TdP involves multiple mechanisms and SVM is a method suitable for such a problem. Our SVM classification system used a set of linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) descriptors and was optimized by leave-one-out cross validation procedure. Its prediction accuracy was evaluated by using an independent set of agents and by comparison with results obtained from other commonly used classification methods using the same dataset and optimization procedure. The accuracies for the SVM prediction of TdP-causing agents and non-TdP-causing agents are 97.4 and 84.6% respectively; one is substantially improved against and the other is comparable to the results obtained by other classification methods useful for multiple-mechanism prediction problems.

In the Diogenes dietary intervention study, high protein and low glycemic index (GI) diet improved weight maintenance. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: To identify blood predictors for weight change after weight loss following the dietary intervention within the Diogenes study. ::: ::: ::: DESIGN ::: Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 8-week low caloric diet-induced weight loss from 48 women who continued to lose weight and 48 women who regained weight during subsequent 6-month dietary intervention period with 4 diets varying in protein and GI levels. Thirty-one proteins and 3 steroid hormones were measured. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) was the most important predictor. Its greater reduction during the 8-week weight loss was related to continued weight loss during the subsequent 6 months, identified by both Logistic Regression and Random Forests analyses. The prediction power of ACE was influenced by immunoproteins, particularly fibrinogen. Leptin, luteinizing hormone and some immunoproteins showed interactions with dietary protein level, while interleukin 8 showed interaction with GI level on the prediction of weight maintenance. A predictor panel of 15 variables enabled an optimal classification by Random Forests with an error rate of 24\u00b11%. A logistic regression model with independent variables from 9 blood analytes had a prediction accuracy of 92%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: A selected panel of blood proteins/steroids can predict the weight change after weight loss.

Critically associated with the miRNAs biogenesis, the hairpin structure is a necessary feature for the computational classification of novel precursor miRNAs (pre-miRs). Though many of the abundant genomic inverted repeats (pseudo hairpins) can be filtered computationally, novel species-specific pre-miRs are likely to remain elusive. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: miPred is a de novo Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for identifying pre-miRs without relying on phylogenetic conservation. To achieve significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than existing (quasi) de novo predictors, it employs a Gaussian Radial Basis Function kernel (RBF) as a similarity measure for 29 global and intrinsic hairpin folding attributes. They characterize a pre-miR at the dinucleotide sequence, hairpin folding, non-linear statistical thermodynamics and topological levels. Trained on 200 human pre-miRs and 400 pseudo hairpins, miPred achieves 93.50% (5-fold cross-validation accuracy) and 0.9833 (ROC score).

Given a training set of labeled data and a working set of unlabeled data, S3VM constructs a support vector machine using both the training and working sets.

The transduction problem is to estimate the value of a classification function at the given points in the working set. This contrasts with the standard inductive learning problem of estimating the classification function at all possible values and then using the fixed function to deduce the classes of the working set data. We propose a general S3VM model that minimizes both the misclassification error and the function capacity based on all the available data. We show how the S3VM model for 1-norm linear support vector machines can be converted to a mixed-integer program and then solved exactly using integer programming. Results of S3VM and the standard 1-norm support vector machine approach are compared on ten data sets.

Precision agriculture is one of many strategies with which growers are able to try to overcome these issues by using data collected in the fi eld to make informed management decisions. Until recently, soybean fi elds were generally seeded at a single rate. Most seeding equipment used a fi xed metering system and operators were unable to freely change seeding rates while moving across the fi eld. However, advances in both GPS accuracy and VRT on commercial equipment have enabled farmers to use precision farming practices to change seeding rates automatically from a computer-based prescription (Hoeft et al., 2000). As soybean seed prices continue to increase (USDA-ERS, 2014), growers are looking for ways to optimize seeding rates across their fi elds (Hoeft et al., 2000). For years, many growers have also been collecting spatial data for their fi elds including yield, elevation, and soils data. However, Lambert et al. (2004) reported advances in site-specifi c recommendations and application methods far outpaced those in GIS data analysis. Growers and researchers alike feel there is an abundance of raw data but a shortage of methods and knowledge on how to use the data from these precision operations to optimize yields and input costs (Bullock et al., 2007). Th e increased use of precision-based technologies allows growers access to new research systems which can help them make current and future management decisions (Bullock and Bullock, 2000; Fleming et al., 2000; Mueller et al., 2001; Kravchenko and Bullock, 2002a,2002b; Kaspar et al., 2003; Kravchenko et al., 2005; Hornung et al., 2006). Th e infl uence of soil physical and chemical parameters on crop yields is relatively predictable (Miller et al., 1988; Sudduth et al., 1996; Moran et al., 1997; Machado et al., 2000) which make layers such as topsoil depth, primary nutrients, and soil texture potentially useful for yield data analysis.

Our aim is to replace SPICE simulation with our proposed surrogate models, which can be used to evaluate samples generated by sampling methods in variation space. Our methodology initiates by first characterizing the leakage of basic transistor stacks and then provides estimate of the leakage of basic gates based on these stacks. Transistor stacks are extracted across various standard cells, which are used to estimate leakage of CMOS gates with different input vector combinations. We develop Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression surrogate models and characterize the transistor stacks of CMOS gates, while accounting the combined effect of process variations in transistor length ( L ), threshold voltage ( V th ), oxide thickness ( T ox ), supply voltage ( 0.6 V \u2212 1.2 V ), temperature ( 0 \u00b0 C \u2212 100 \u00b0 C ) and width ( 28 nm \u2212 200 nm ), all scalable at the same time. For gates containing parallel transistor stacks, we merge the parallel transistors having identical inputs, which in turn allows us to use precharacterized basic stacks for leakage calculation, thus avoiding generation of new models. Our experiments illustrate that we only require 30 and 26 stack models to predict the subthreshold and gate tunneling leakage of 20 different gates across 176 input combinations, instead of characterizing leakage model for each input vector separately. SVM regression models generated in our approach have the ability to predict the leakage with maximum average error of 2.7% in mean ( \u03bc ) and maximum average error of 3.1% in standard deviation ( \u03c3 ), both for OAI22 gate. Our results establish that there is on an average 10 \u00d7 improvement in runtime while estimating the \u03bc and \u03c3 of leakage of a gate within 10000 Monte Carlo simulation loop. Our approaches also result into a maximum of 221 \u00d7 runtime improvement for C6288 ISCAS'85 benchmark circuit. We further develop Sparse SVM models using Support Vector spectrum pruning method, which reduces the runtime of the regression models with negligible increase in the error. Runtime efficiency of 17 \u00d7 and 323 \u00d7 is achieved on standard cell library and C6288 benchmark circuit respectively using Sparse SVM models.

To build a semantic digital library, we first propose an integrated digital library system that provides multiple viewpoints of harvested metadata collections by combining search and data mining technologies. This system provides three value-added services: (1) the cross-archive search service provides a term view of harvested metadata, (2) the concept browsing service provides a subject view of harvested metadata, and (3) the collection summary service provides a collection view of each metadata collection. We also propose a text data mining method using a hierarchical self-organizing map algorithm to build concept hierarchies from Dublin Core metadata. ::: We then present a new classification method, called Associative Naive Bayes (ANB), to associate MEDLINE citations with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. We define the concept of class-support to find frequent itemsets and the concept of class-all-confidence to find interesting itemsets. In the training phase, ANB finds frequent and interesting itemsets and estimates the class prior probabilities and the probabilities of itemsets for all classes. Once the frequent and interesting itemsets are discovered in the training phase, new unlabeled examples are classified by the classification algorithm by incrementally choosing the most interesting itemset. Empirical test results on three MEDLINE datasets show that ANB is superior to both naive Bayesian classifier and Large Bayes. The results also show that ANB is more scalable than Support Vector Machines. ::: Finally, we present a text mining method that uses both text categorization and text clustering for building concept hierarchies for MEDLINE citations. The approach we propose is a three-step data mining process for organizing MEDLINE database: (1) categorizations according to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, MeSH major topics, and the co-occurrence of MeSH descriptors; (2) clustering using the results of MeSH term categorization; and (3) visualization of categories and hierarchical clusters.

Service robots are supposed to capture efficiently object related information in real world scenes while for instance considering clutter and noise, and also being flexible and scalable to memorize a large set of objects. Besides object perception tasks like object recognition where the object\u2019s identity is analyzed, object categorization is an important visual object perception cue that associates unknown object instances based on their e.g. appearance or shape to a corresponding category. We present a pipeline from the detection of object candidates in a domestic scene over the description to the final shape categorization of detected candidates. In order to detect object related information in cluttered domestic environments an object detection method is proposed that copes with multiple plane and object occurrences like in cluttered scenes with shelves. Further a surface reconstruction method based on Growing Neural Gas (GNG) in combination with a shape distribution-based descriptor is proposed to reflect shape characteristics of object candidates. Beneficial properties provided by the GNG such as smoothing and denoising effects support a stable description of the object candidates which also leads towards a more stable learning of categories. Based on the presented descriptor a dictionary approach combined with a supervised shape learner is presented to learn prediction models of shape categories. ::: Experimental results, of different shapes related to domestically appearing object shape categories such as cup, can, box, bottle, bowl, plate and ball, are shown. A classification accuracy of about 90% and a sequential execution time of lesser than two seconds for the categorization of an unknown object is achieved which proves the reasonableness of the proposed system design.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of Sentinel-1A SAR imagery for characterising land use and land cover (LULC) in Bac Lieu, a rapidly developing province of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, to support natural resource management for land use planning and monitoring. Twenty-one SAR images acquired in 2016 were classified in a four-step process. Firstly, the SAR images were pre-processed to produce Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture images. Then, to reduce the effects of rainfall variation confounding the classification, the images were divided into two categories: dry season (Jan\u2013April) and wet season (May\u2013December) and three input image sets were produced: 1) a single-date composite image (two VV-VH bands), 2) a multi-temporal composite image (eight bands for dry season and sixteen bands for wet season) and 3) a multi-temporal and textural composite image (sixteen bands for dry season and thirty two bands for wet season). We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to characterise urban, forest, aquaculture, and rice paddy field for the three input image sets. We tested a combination of input images and classification algorithms and found that no matter the classification algorithms used, multi-temporal images had a higher overall classification accuracy than single-date images and that differences between classification algorithms were minimal. The most accurate classification resulted from a combination of the SVM classifier and multi-temporal and textural input image sets from the dry and wet seasons; with an overall accuracy of 94.81% and Kappa coefficient of 0.92. Our land cover mapping showed that Bac Lieu province is dominated by shrimp farming and rice paddy fields, with natural coastal forested ecosystems only made up a small proportion of the province. The results demonstrated the potential use of SAR as an up-to-date complementary data source of land cover information for local authorities, to support their land use master plan and to monitor illegal land use changes.

This work addresses the problem of increased degradation in performance when moving from speaker-dependent (SD) to speaker-independent (SI) conditions for connectionist (or hybrid) hidden Markov model/artificial neural network (HMM/ANN) systems in the context of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). Adapting hybrid HMM/ANN systems on a small amount of adaptation data has been proven to be a difficult task, and has been a limiting factor in the widespread deployment of hybrid techniques in operational ASR systems. Addressing the crucial issue of speaker adaptation (SA) for hybrid HMM/ANN system can thereby have a great impact on the connectionist paradigm, which will play a major role in the design of next-generation LVCSR considering the great success reported by deep neural networks - ANNs with many hidden layers that adopts the pre-training technique - on many speech tasks. Current adaptation techniques for ANNs based on injecting an adaptable linear transformation network connected to either the input, or the output layer are not effective especially with a small amount of adaptation data, e.g., a single adaptation utterance. In this paper, a novel solution is proposed to overcome those limits and make it robust to scarce adaptation resources. The key idea is to adapt the hidden activation functions rather than the network weights. The adoption of Hermitian activation functions makes this possible.

In a series of computer simulations, the authorsdemonstrated how non-Turing-based quantum computingcan be harnessed for viewpoint-invariant face recognitionusing Hebb-like storage of image-encoding Gabor waveletsimplemented in a quantum-holographic procedure. Thepresented model was largely motivated by Hop\ufb01eld\u2019s neuralnetwork [2], which was then transformed into a quantum-holographic process in which the Hebbian memory wasreplaced by multiple self-interferences of quantum planewaves [3].This transformation was achieved by means of a simplesubstitution (see Table 1 for details) of Hop\ufb01eld\u2019s real-valued variables by the complex-valued variables changingas sinusoids (waves), while simultaneously preserving allinput-to-output transformations in the model. By doingthis, it becomes possible to combine the area of arti\ufb01cialneural networks with that of quantum computing in a rathernatural way. In particular, the authors showed that thequality of reconstructed images can be enhanced by meansof an iterative sampling method using (1) one optimumsampling frequency for which the best distinction amongimages is warranted and (2) by selecting Gabor coef\ufb01cientswith least activity for correlation in the associative net-work, which is necessary to determine the order parametersin the model.Although the authors meticulously dealt with issuesrelated to quality improvements of reconstructed images,they made much less effort to address two essential issuesintimately linked to their work. First, while a substantialportion of the paper was dedicated to Gabor wavelets asbiologically plausible descriptors of receptive \ufb01elds, itremains unclear how the implemented quantum-holo-graphic procedure\u2014the central aspect of the introducedmodel\u2014relates to current neurocognitive theories of visualinformation processing.

This can lead to ambiguous features being generated near class boundaries, reducing target classification accuracy. We propose a novel approach, Adversarial Dropout Regularization (ADR), to encourage the generator to output more discriminative features for the target domain. Our key idea is to replace the critic with one that detects non-discriminative features, using dropout on the classifier network. The generator then learns to avoid these areas of the feature space and thus creates better features.

Furthermore, an estimated 0.1 percent of epileptic patients suffer sudden deaths resulting from injuries sustained during seizures. For this reason, patients with intractable seizures need alternative therapeutic approaches. An engineered device tailored toward seizure prediction that warns patients of an impending seizure or that intervenes to prevent its occurrence may significantly decrease the burden of epilepsy. Although much research efforts have been directed at the development of a seizure prediction algorithm, a therapeutic or warning device that meets stringent clinical requirements is still elusive. In the present study a novel patient-specific seizure prediction method is proposed. The method is based on time-frequency analysis of scalp electroencephalogram (sEEG) and the use of state-of-the-art unsupervised feature representation learning techniques: reconstruction independent component analysis and sparse filtering. In a moving window analysis, a novel engineered bivariate EEG characterizing measure named Normalized Logarithmic Wavelet Packet Coefficient Energy Ratios (NLWPCER) was extracted from all possible combination of EEG channels and relevant frequency sub - bands. Thereafter unsupervised representation learning algorithm adapted to each patient through Bayesian optimization procedure was used to learn NLWPCER features representation or transformation suitable for data classification task. Two classification models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were developed and trained to learn preictal (pre-seizure) and interictal (normal) EEG feature vector patterns. The output of the classifiers was regularized through a post processing operation aimed at reducing false prediction rate (FPR) and making decision on the generation of prediction alarms. The proposed method was evaluated using approximately 545 h CHB-MIT scalp EEG recording of 17 patients with a total of 43 leading seizures. On the average, with SVM classifier the proposed seizure prediction algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 87.26% and false prediction rate of 0.08h-1 while with ANN classifier the algorithm achieved average sensitivity and false prediction rate of 75.49% and 0.13h-1 respectively.

Simulation results on several chaotic systems indicate that the SVM-Based GPC scheme provides an excellent performance with respect to local stabilization of the target (an originally unstable equilibrium point). Furthermore, it somewhat performs targeting, the task of steering the chaotic system towards the target by applying relatively small parameter perturbations. It considerably reduces the waiting time until the system, starting from random initial conditions, enters the local control region, a small neighborhood of the chosen target. Moreover, SVM-Based GPC maintains its performance in the case that the measured output is corrupted by an additive Gaussian noise.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.10.2787", "venue": "IEICE Transactions", "journal": "IEICE Transactions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2039115701", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61645203", "118213312", "121785530", "44604636", "64440608", "114278491", "122302201", "36451974", "12357259", "7003428", "62573541", "36897769", "10340230", "3383279", "17014935", "31570132", "60195474", "122025899", "120587498", "18320387", "122424818", "62643739", "7138354", "28637672", "118902490", "117915688", "123661614", "15480929", "5543127", "198120256", "60626450", "7230981"], "inbound_citations": ["6871506"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5783837"}

In this paper, we present a novel method for leaf recognition by combining feature extraction and machine learning. To break the weakness exposed in the traditional algorithms, we applied binary Gabor pattern BGP and extreme learning machine ELM to recognize leaves. To accelerate the leaf recognition, we also extract BGP features from leaf images with an offline manner. Different from the traditional neural network like BP and SVM, our method based on the ELM only requires setting one parameter, and without additional fine-tuning during the leaf recognition. Our method is evaluated on several different databases with different scales. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods were also conducted to evaluate the combination of BGP and ELM.

For the monitoring of large areas or dangerous region or enemy region, commonly used, such as randomly dropping the sensor nodes, and coverage is one of the main problems to solve for the WSN. Control of the coverage for WSN, can be seen as when the energy of sensor network nodes, wireless communications network bandwidth, network computing ability are limited, through placing the sensor nodes and choosing routing at the network and other means to optimize the allocation of resources of WSN, avoid blind spots in the coverage area, or get in a local minimum value. Covering algorithm needs to consider network connectivity, energy efficiency, dynamics of the network, and other issues. According to the configuration of wireless sensor nodes, coverage is divided into certainty coverage and random coverage. In the actual environment, network topology is unpredictable, and network topology changes complexly, so it seems particularly important to achieve a dynamic coverage. It is a NP problem to achieve optimal coverage for monitoring the area of unfixed and intensive signals, so we made an effective distributed approximation algorithm to ensure that the sensor nodes change rapidly to achieve optimal coverage. Assuming each sensor node can directly communicate with other nearby sensors, have the same sensing range, and have data-processing functions, and move free according to the \u201corder\u201d of the nodes surrounding. Assume that each sensor can know its position, and the positioning algorithm has been adopted. Using a neural network algorithm can solve the nodal redistribution problem of WSN according to the detected region changes. In the artificial neural network, the learning algorithm can be divided into erection and growth structure learning algorithm. Growth learning algorithm starts training from a small network structure, then gradually increases until it achieves the final request. We choose the GNG algorithm, and the improved GNG-U algorithm which is improved on the basis of the GNG algorithm. To the nonstationary input signal, if the distribution suddenly changes, using the algorithm can quickly delete unused nodes, effect nodes will unite together fast, and redistribution, reduce redundant nodes finally reach optimal coverage rapidly. Combine the improved GNG-U algorithm with wireless sensor network, the network can rapidly re-coverage the target region especially for special environments. The simulation results show that, compared with the growing neural gas algorithm, the GNG-U and improve GNG-U algorithm can reduce redundant nodes, improve mobility of the network, accelerate the rate of convergence, and arrive at the optimal re-coverage dynamically.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/15501320802575021", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2057000075", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11869174", "207102136"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62728847"}

It can be applied to various kinds of regression problems including nominal, metric and survival response variables. While classification and regression problems using random forest methodology have been extensively investigated in the past, there seems to be a lack of literature on handling ordinal regression problems, that is if response categories have an inherent ordering. The classical random forest version of Breiman ignores the ordering in the levels and implements standard classification trees. Or if the variable is treated like a metric variable, regression trees are used which, however, are not appropriate for ordinal response data. Further compounding the difficulties the currently existing VIMs for nominal or metric responses have not proven to be appropriate for ordinal response. The random forest version of Hothorn et al. utilizes a permutation test framework that is applicable to problems where both predictors and response are measured on arbitrary scales. It is therefore a promising tool for handling ordinal regression problems. However, for this random forest version there is also no specific VIM for ordinal response variables and the appropriateness of the error rate based VIM computed by default in the case of ordinal responses has to date not been investigated in the literature. We performed simulation studies using random forest based on conditional inference trees to explore whether incorporating the ordering information yields any improvement in prediction performance or variable selection. We present two novel permutation VIMs that are reasonable alternatives to the currently implemented VIM which was developed for nominal response and makes no use of the ordering in the levels of an ordinal response variable. Results based on simulated and real data suggest that predictor rankings can be improved by using our new permutation VIMs that explicitly use the ordering in the response levels in combination with the ordinal regression trees suggested by Hothorn et al. With respect to prediction accuracy in our studies, the performance of ordinal regression trees was similar to and in most settings even slightly better than that of classification trees. An explanation for the greater performance is that in ordinal regression trees there is a higher probability of selecting relevant variables for a split.

This graph reveals the most influential tweeters by identifying the largest drop in the eigenvalue of adjacency or affinity matrix of a graph when certain nodes are removed; those which, when deleted, cause the greatest drop in the eigenvalue of the graph are considered to be the most influential. The machine-learning model applied in this work utilizes a feature vector containing the accumulated sum of the rank scores of those influential users who tweet a given article, along with known altmetric features such as the user type and post counts for various social media. Finally, the supervised-learning model was trained using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers with 11 features, including the sum of the ranks of influential users who tweet a given article in our dataset.

Automated segmentation of lumen-intima and media-adventitia interfaces is valuable to identify artery occlusion. Purpose: Bifurcations, shadows and echogenic plaques usually affect proper segmentation of the vessel wall. Thus, identification of these morphological structures is an advisable step when developing segmentation techniques, which have been dealing with this issue by using different features and methods in the past. The aim of this work is to develop a simultaneous classification method for IVUS image sectors into bifurcations, shadows, echogenic plaques and normal, as an intermediate step for the arterial wall segmentation. Methods: A 22-dimensional feature vector, mainly composed by current existing methods, is computed for each column in the polar image. To deal with this multiclass classification problem, Random Forest (RF) is used as classifier. Due to the high skewness of the problem, RFs are successively trained by resampling the training data, specifically the majority class. Results: Fscore reaches 0.62, when the RF is trained with 15% of the normal samples of the training set. Thresholds found in the RF are close to the previously reported values for the features in the literature. Conclusion: Random Forest demonstrates good performance to classify morphological structures in IVUS. Random undersampling for training was useful to deal with the imbalanced data, and to manage the trade-off between precision and recall of minority classes. However, better features must be developed to improve the classification of the structures, specially in the case of the echogenic plaque.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2255748", "venue": "Symposium on Medical Information Processing and Analysis", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2581327825", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7393441", "11742924", "2467874", "2612043", "651063", "11518437", "16780176", "9588380", "16124323", "12863557", "14189293", "1212431", "12454277", "16331961", "7492226", "68829559", "14454728", "89141", "121049522", "195916780", "81944", "14889830", "6286422", "16087804"], "inbound_citations": ["86672594", "13269119"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114555833"}

The limited number of medical studies on vocal fold vasculature point out that the direction of blood vessels and amount of vasculature are discriminative features for vocal fold disorders.

The classifier is a combination of two underlying classifiers.

Posterior probabilities of both the static and changing/online classifiers are fused to assign the eventual label for the online image data. The online classifier learns at frequent intervals of time through a sparse and stable set of tracked patches, which makes it lightweight and real-time friendly.

To overcome the drawbacks, this paper proposes to apply one emerging technique, relevance vector machine (RVM), to model the diesel engine, and to predict the emissions and engine performance. With RVM, only a few experimental data sets can train the model due to the property of global optimal solution. In this study, the engine speed, load, and coolant temperature are used as the input parameters, while the brake thermal efficiency, brake-specific fuel consumption, concentrations of nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter are used as the output parameters.

Due to the lack of observed data of inundation maps, sufficient observed data are not available for developing inundation forecasting models. In this paper, the inundation depths, which are simulated and validated by a physically based two-dimensional model (FLO-2D), are used as a database for inundation forecasting. A two-stage inundation forecasting approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed to yield 1- to 6-h lead-time inundation maps during typhoons. In the first stage (point forecasting), the proposed approach not only considers the rainfall intensity and inundation depth as model input but also simultaneously considers cumulative rainfall and forecasted inundation depths. In the second stage (spatial expansion), the geographic information of inundation grids and the inundation forecasts of reference points are used to yield inundation maps.

Texture is one of the most discriminative features. The automatic classification of tissues and organs based on histology images is an open problem, due to the lack of automatic solutions when treating tissues without pathologies. Method: In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically classify cardiovascular tissues using texture information and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additionally, we realised that it is feasible to recognise several cardiovascular organs following the same process. The texture of histological images was described using Local Binary Patterns (LBP), LBP Rotation Invariant (LBPri), Haralick features and different concatenations between them, representing in this way its content. Using a SVM with linear kernel, we selected the more appropriate descriptor that, for this problem, was a concatenation of LBP and LBPri. Due to the small number of the images available, we could not follow an approach based on deep learning, but we selected the classifier who yielded the higher performance by comparing SVM with Random Forest and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Once SVM was selected as the classifier with a higher area under the curve that represents both higher recall and precision, we tuned it evaluating different kernels, finding that a linear SVM allowed us to accurately separate four classes of tissues: (i) cardiac muscle of the heart, (ii) smooth muscle of the muscular artery, (iii) loose connective tissue, and (iv) smooth muscle of the large vein and the elastic artery. The experimental validation was conducted using 3000 blocks of 100 \u00d7 100 sized pixels, with 600 blocks per class and the classification was assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation. Results: using LBP as the descriptor, concatenated with LBPri and a SVM with linear kernel, the main four classes of tissues were recognised with an AUC higher than 0.98. A polynomial kernel was then used to separate the elastic artery and vein, yielding an AUC in both cases superior to 0.98. Conclusion: Following the proposed approach, it is possible to separate with very high precision (AUC greater than 0.98) the fundamental tissues of the cardiovascular system along with some organs, such as the heart, arteries and veins.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28734525", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.06.003", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "2621792616", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["67872400", "56175580", "44134097", "119308856", "115846847", "4901874", "195873490", "1053507"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10482135"}

The variational Doppler radar analysis system (VDRAS) is an advanced convective-scale analysis system capable of providing analysis of 3-D wind, temperature, and humidity by assimilating Doppler radar observations. Although potentially useful, it is still an open question as to how to use these fields to improve nowcasting. In this study, we present results from our first attempt at developing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Box-based nOWcasting (SBOW) method under the machine learning framework using VDRAS analysis data. The key design points of SBOW are as follows: 1) The study domain is divided into many position-fixed small boxes and the nowcasting problem is transformed into one question, i.e., will a radar echo > 35 dBZ appear in a box in 30 minutes? 2) Box-based temporal and spatial features, which include time trends and surrounding environmental information, are constructed; and 3) The box-based constructed features are used to first train the SVM classifier, and then the trained classifier is used to make predictions. Compared with complicated and expensive expert systems, the above design of SBOW allows the system to be small, compact, straightforward, and easy to maintain and expand at low cost. The experimental results show that, although no complicated tracking algorithm is used, SBOW can predict the storm movement trend and storm growth with reasonable skill.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1609.04103", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/2016JD025783", "venue": "J.

Meanwhile, in the computer vision community, much effort has been dedicated to understanding how using out-of-domain images can improve the performance of machine classifiers.

Consequently, little effort has been invested in the development of algorithms for the categorization of gaze events (e.g. fixations, pursuits, saccade, gaze shifts) while the head is free, and thus contributes to the velocity signals upon which classification algorithms typically operate. Our approach was to collect a novel, naturalistic, and multimodal dataset of eye + head movements when subjects performed everyday tasks while wearing a mobile eye tracker equipped with an inertial measurement unit and a 3D stereo camera. This Gaze-in-the-Wild dataset (GW) includes eye + head rotational velocities (deg/s), infrared eye images and scene imagery (RGB + D). A portion was labelled by coders into gaze motion events with a mutual agreement of 0.74 sample based Cohen\u2019s \u03ba. This labelled data was used to train and evaluate two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and a Recurrent Neural Network model, for gaze event classification. Assessment involved the application of established and novel event based performance metrics. Classifiers achieve ~87% human performance in detecting fixations and saccades but fall short (50%) on detecting pursuit movements. Moreover, pursuit classification is far worse in the absence of head movement information. A subsequent analysis of feature significance in our best performing model revealed that classification can be done using only the magnitudes of eye and head movements, potentially removing the need for calibration between the head and eye tracking systems.

The final drawn shape is analysed through Dynamical Time Warping to generate a cost value based on how close the produced drawing is to the original shape.

Since the length of the data is theoretically infinite, it is impractical to store and ::: process all the historical data. Data streams also experience change of its underlying dis-tribution (concept drift), thus the classifier must adapt. Another challenge of data stream classification is the possible emergence and disappearance of classes which is known as (concept evolution) problem. On the top of these challenges, acquiring labels with such large data is expensive. In this paper, we propose a stream-based active learning (AL) strategy (SAL) that handles the aforementioned challenges. SAL aims at querying the labels of samples which results in optimizing the expected future error. It handles ::: concept drift and concept evolution by adapting to the change in the stream. Furthermore, as a part of the error reduction process, SAL handles the sampling bias problem and queries the samples that caused the change i.e., drifted samples or samples coming from new classes. To tackle the lack of prior knowledge about the streaming data, non-parametric Bayesian modelling is adopted namely the two representations of Dirichlet process; Dirichlet mixture models and stick breaking process.

Principal Component Analysis is a technique used for feature extraction which helps to retrieve intrinsic information from high dimensional data in eigen spaces to solve the curse of dimensionality problem. Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine are implemented on reduced data set and their performances are measured in terms of predictive accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Next, we propose a Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm-based fuzzy clustering technique using real coded encoding of cluster centers for clustering and classification. This technique is implemented on microarray cancer data to select training data using multiobjective genetic algorithm with non-dominated sorting. The two objective functions for this multiobjective techniques are optimization of cluster compactness as well as separation simultaneously. This approach identifies the solution. Support Vector Machine classifier is further trained by the selected training points which have high confidence value. Then remaining points are classified by trained SVM classifier.

A player's probability of enshrinement is likely to be affected by a large number of different variables, and can be approached by machine learning methods. In particular, I consider the use of random forests for this purpose. A random forest may be considered a black-box method for predicting the probability of Hall of Fame induction, but a number of parameters must be chosen before the forest can be grown. These parameters include fundamental aspects of the nuts and bolts of the construction of the trees that make up the forest, as well as choices among possible predictor variables. For example, one predictor that may be considered is a measure of the player's having seasons with many home runs hit, and there are multiple competing ways of measuring this. Furthermore, certain deterministic methods of searching the parameter space are partially undermined by the randomness underlying the forest's construction and the fact that, by sheer luck, two forests constructed with the same parameters may have differing qualities of fit. Using simulated annealing, I move through the parameter space in a stochastic fashion, trying many forests and sometimes moving toward a set of parameters even though its fit is apparently not as good as preceding ones. Since probabilities defined based on the votes of terminal nodes of a random forest for classification tend to be too moderate, the results of each forest considered are fed into a logistic regression to produce final probability estimates. From among four simulated annealing runs, the forest with the smallest mean squared error was selected, and analysis of the forests near it in the simulated annealing run indicate that its selection was probably not due to extraordinary \"luck.\" Predictions performed using the out-of-bag samples correctly identify 75% of Baseball Writers Association of America Hall of Fame selections, while misclassifying only 1% of non-selections.

By making use of the analysis results as constraints, the design for associative memory is performed by solving a constraint optimization problem whereby each of the stored patterns is guaranteed a substantial domain of attraction. The performance of the designed network is illustrated by means of three specific examples.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "10636951", "doi": "10.1162/089976600300015871", "venue": "Neural Computation", "journal": "Neural Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2147889476", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59645699", "17526697", "123602982", "29797176", "63372378", "198168767", "115757452", "20542150", "122013290", "7602949", "115696830", "31752533", "12749106", "29291550"], "inbound_citations": ["16071164", "12347295", "2439383", "13887352", "43591327", "1324028"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20450925"}

These methods are based on three main steps: feature extraction, classification and change detection. A set of state of the art features have been used in the tests: colour features (HSV), textural features (GLCM) and 3D geometric features. For classification purposes Conditional Random Field (CRF) has been used: the unary potential was determined using the Random Forest algorithm while the pairwise potential was defined by the fully connected CRF. In the performed tests, different feature configurations and settings have been considered to assess the performance of these methods in such challenging task. Experimental results showed that the post-classification approach outperforms the pre-classification change detection method.

As a key component of deep structure, the SAE does not only learn features by making use of data, it also obtains feature expressions at different levels of data. However, with the deep structure, it is hard to achieve good generalization performance with a fast learning speed. ELM, as a new learning algorithm for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), has attracted great interest from various fields for its fast learning speed and good generalization performance. However, ELM needs more hidden nodes than conventional tuning-based learning algorithms due to the random set of input weights and hidden biases. In addition, the existing ELM methods cannot utilize the class information of targets well. To solve this problem, a regularized ELM method based on the class information of the target is proposed. In this paper, SAE and the regularized ELM are combined to make full use of their advantages and make up for each of their shortcomings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments with measured radar HRRP data.

Fast response time and high accuracy imply using high-speed technologies and processes for student identification. In this paper, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and novel face recognition and identification approaches have been proposed and evaluated. A multimodal approach for student identification combined the power of both the traditional RFID approach and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) index. Capturing the authentic face variability from a sequence of video frames has been considered for the recognition of faces and resulted in system robustness against the variability of facial features.

However, offensive network traffic such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) plays a significant role in threatening the cloud-based services. Therefore, defense for such attacks is required to save the cloud resources. Most of the attribute selection approaches for request classification are based on static threshold statistics. These statistics are the default values used to reduce the dimensionality of data. However, these default statistics do not work well with varying network conditions and for different intensities of DDoS attack. Therefore, an adaptive statistic is required to deal with different network and incoming traffic conditions. This paper also gives an comprehensive analysis of TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol-based DDoS attack and its effects on the cloud network. Based on the analysis and above issues, this paper presents an adaptive hybrid approach for attribute selection and classification of incoming traffic. The proposed approach consists of three subsystems such as (1) preprocessing subsystem, (2) adaptive attribute selection subsystem and (3) detection and prevention subsystem. The work utilizes NSL-KDD dataset which helps in the evaluation of the proposed approach. It is concluded that the combination of Mean Absolute Deviation technique with Random Forest classifier (MAD-RF) outperforms the other combinations. Therefore, MAD-RF is selected for further analysis. MAD-RF is also capable of dealing with TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol-based DDoS attack.

A dataset composed of 577 regions with different levels of wear has been created. Two different classification processes have been carried out: the first one using three different classes (Low, Medium and High wear -L, M and H, respectively-) and the second one with just two classes: Low (L) and High (H). Classification was carried out using on the one hand kNN with five different distances and five values of k and, on the second hand, a Support Vector Machine (SVM). aZIBO performance has been compared with classical shape descriptors such as Hu and Flusser moments.

Most of the examples in the book deal with perceptual concepts based on dimensions such as colour, size, shape and sound. However, many of our everyday concepts are based on actions and functional properties. For instance most artefacts, such as chairs, clocks and telephones, are categorized on the basis of their functional properties. After giving a general presentation of conceptual spaces, I suggest how the analysis in terms of conceptual spaces can be extended to actions and functional concepts. Firstly, I will argue that \u201caction space\u201d can, in principle, be analysed in the same way as e.g. colour space or shape space. One hypothesis is that our categorization of actions to a large extent depends on our embodied \u201cperception\u201d of forces. In line with this, an action will be described as a spatio-temporal pattern of forces. When it comes to functional properties, the key idea is that the function of an object can be analysed with the aid of the actions it affords. Functional concepts can then be described as convex regions in an appropriate action space. Within Cognitive Semantics, image schemas are mainly based on perceptual and spatial dimensions (e.g. Langacker 1987; Lakoff 1987). Two exceptions are Johnson\u2019s (1987) and Talmy\u2019s (1988) work on \u201cforce dynamics\u201d that shows the importance of forces, and metaphorical uses of forces, for the semantics of many kinds of linguistic expression. I shall argue that a more developed understanding on \u201caction space\u201d would allow us to extend the semantic analyses pioneered by Johnson and Talmy. In particular, I shall make a distinction between first-person and third-person perspectives on \u201cforces\u201d. My hypothesis is that we start out from an embodied notion of force or \u201cpower\u201d that is then extended to forces that are Peter Gardenfors 242 exerted by other individuals and to forces that act on objects outside our control. 1. The problem of modelling concepts A central problem for cognitive science is how representations should be modelled. There are currently two dominating approaches to this problem. The symbolic approach starts from the assumption that cognitive systems can be described as Turing machines. On this view, cognition is seen as essentially being computation involving symbol manipulation (e.g. Fodor 1975; Pylyshyn 1984; Pinker 1997). The second approach is associationism, where associations between different kinds of information elements carry the main burden of representation. Connectionism is a special case of associationism that models associations using artificial neuron networks (e.g. Rumelhart & McClelland 1986; Quinlan 1991). Both the symbolic and the associationist approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. They are often presented as competing paradigms, but since they are used to analyse cognitive problems on different levels of granularity, they should rather be seen as complementary methodologies. However, there are several aspects of concept formation for which neither symbolic representation nor connectionism seem to offer appropriate modelling tools. In this chapter, I will advocate a third way to represent information that is based on using geometrical structures rather than symbols or connections between neurons. Using these structures, similarity relations can be modelled in a way that accords well with human (and animal) judgments. The notion of similarity is crucial for the understanding of many cognitive phenomena. I shall call this way of representing information the conceptual form since I believe that such representations can account for more of the essential aspects of human concept formation than symbolic or connectionist theories. Based on my recent book (Gardenfors 2000), I shall first present a theory of conceptual spaces as a particular framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical representations based on a number of quality dimensions. Most of the examples I discussed in my book deal with perceptual concepts based on dimensions such as colour, size, shape and sound. However, there is strong evidence that many of our everyday concepts are based on actions and functional properties. For instance, most artefacts, such as chairs, Representing actions and functional properties in conceptual spaces 243 clocks and telephones, are categorized on the basis of their functional properties (Nelson 1986; Mandler 2004). In this chapter, I shall outline how the analysis in terms of conceptual spaces can be extended to functional concepts. Firstly, I will argue that \u201caction space\u201d can, in principle, be analysed in the same way as e.g. colour space or shape space. One hypothesis is that our categorization of actions to a large extent depends on our \u201cperception\u201d of forces. In line with this, an action will be described as a spatio-temporal pattern of forces. I shall also argue that the most cognitively fundamental forces are those that act upon or emanate from one\u2019s own body. In this sense my analysis will be based on an embodied perspective. When it comes to functional properties, the key idea is that the function of an object can be analysed with the aid of the actions it affords. Functional concepts can then be described as convex regions in an appropriate action space. I shall outline a research programme indicating that action space should be seen as a special case of a conceptual space. 2. Quality dimensions As introductory examples of quality dimensions one can mention temperature, weight, brightness, pitch and the three ordinary spatial dimensions height, width and depth. I have chosen these examples because they are closely connected to what is produced by our sensory receptors (Schiffman 1982). The spatial dimensions of height, width and depth as well as brightness are perceived by the visual sensory system, pitch by the auditory system, temperature by thermal sensors and weight, finally, by the kinaesthetic sensors. However, since there are also quality dimensions that are of an abstract non-sensory character, one aim of this chapter is to argue that force dimensions are important for the analysis of action concepts and functional categories. Quality dimensions correspond to the different ways stimuli are judged to be similar or different. In most cases, judgments of similarity and difference generate an ordering relation of stimuli (Clark 1993: 114). For example, one can judge tones by their pitch that will generate an ordering of the perceptions. The general assumption is that the smaller the distance is between the representations of two objects, the more similar they are. In this way, the similarity of two objects can be defined via the distance between their representing points in the space. The dimensions form the \u201cframePeter Gardenfors 244 work\u201d used to assign properties to objects and to specify relations between them. The coordinates of a point within a conceptual space represent particular instances of each dimension, for example, a particular temperature, a particular weight, etc. The notion of a dimension should be understood literally. It is assumed that each of the quality dimensions is endowed with certain geometrical structures (in some cases they are topological or orderings). As a first example, Figure 1 illustrates such a structure, the dimension of \u201cweight\u201d which is one-dimensional with a zero point, and thus isomorphic to the half-line of non-negative numbers. A basic constraint on this dimension, commonly made in science, is that there are no negative weights.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2127513721", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["143563445", "8054340", "42604711", "14259696", "123151525", "1478680", "147728296", "15776581", "151412990", "9756778", "143997923", "1695292", "142299281", "43759520", "24569679", "146252382", "144783805", "118689009", "41058745", "679023", "54151261", "53473675", "160459267", "120067508", "46951591", "29279092", "21546685", "8409142"], "inbound_citations": ["51981634", "53948037", "214871398", "34001740", "33806623", "19711204", "205259783", "2451499", "215383415", "7734042", "53352551", "6600315", "144451525", "52183379", "17569424", "201888461", "54774009", "17840064", "54629851", "55264890", "18104984", "13996513", "55908311", "31106397", "2545450", "1630974", "11832297", "86856638", "53120421"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18383649"}

We first formulate the problem of learning robust structural SVMs when there are perturbations in the sample space, and show how we can construct corresponding bounds on the perturbations in the feature space. We then show that robustness to perturbations in the feature space is equivalent to additional regularization. For an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, the additional regularizer is based on the dual norm of the norm that constrains the ellipsoidal uncertainty. For a polyhedral uncertainty set, the robust optimization problem is equivalent to adding a linear regularizer in a transformed weight space related to the linear constraints of the polyhedron. We also show that these constraint sets can be combined and demonstrate a number of interesting special cases.

The machine learning algorithms focused in this study are Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), KStar and Support Vector Machine (SVM). An evaluation of performance among three machine learning algorithms was carried out. MLP was found to provide the highest in accuracy for classification. Accuracy of 95.7% was found for classifying a subject walking either up or down the stairs and an accuracy of 80.6% for classifying whether the subject was younger or older. An evaluation of individual features showed poor performance of classification for young and older subjects climbing up and down stairs, and at most cases failed to distinguish between the two classes. However, subsets of features were created using a sequential feature selection algorithm based on feature ranking and individual feature performance. The performance of each subset was recorded and a subset of the top four features achieved an accuracy of 81.7% for classification between young and older subjects.

The Peirce skill score (PSS) shows that the NSSL HCA applied to winter surface precipitation displays little skill, with a PSS of only 0.115.

A designed bio-signal acquisition system can measure EOG and temporalis electromyogram (EMG) signals simultaneously without additional electrodes. For real-time processing for practical application, modified sliding window algorithms are designed and applied for piecewise linear approximation (PLA).

In this paper, we target a similarity learning task in the context of image retrieval, with a focus on the model interpretability issue. An effective similarity neural network (SNN) is proposed not only to seek robust retrieval performance but also to achieve satisfactory post-hoc interpretability. The network is designed by linking the neuron architecture with the organization of a concept tree and by formulating neuron operations to pass similarity information between concepts. Various ways of understanding and visualizing what is learned by the SNN neurons are proposed. We also exhaustively evaluate the proposed approach using a number of relevant datasets against a number of state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network.

Several hybrid approaches based on soft computing techniques are able to perform both of them together but they have more computational overheads. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Simultaneous Intrinsic Model Identification (SIMI), which enable one to perform both feature selection and parameters optimization together without any additional computational overheads.

The determinants of happiness across nations were investigated by training non-linear regression support vector machine (SVM) models using the data of happiness and the country factors, and by optimizing the explanatory variables by the sensitivity analysis method. The results indicate that 20 factors satisfactorily represent the happiness data of 130 countries with the root mean squared error of 0.48 and the coefficient of determination of 0.867. A nonlinear regression technique like SVM is crucial for constructing a happiness predicting model due to the high nonlinear relationship between happiness and the explanatory variables. It was also revealed that health is the most important among various factors which influence the happiness due to the large contribution of health factors (e.g. life expectancy and mortality rate) to happiness.

It is investigated that 80% of unstructured text has location expressions e.g. place names and spatial relations. In the past few years, text has become a most important geospatial data resource as well as survey, map, satellite images and GPS. The most previous research focused on the recognition of place names in text and its integration with map services. Spatial relations play an important role in the fields of spatial data modelling, spatial query, spatial analysis, spatial reasoning and map generalization. Spatial relations in text are described in natural language with qualitative spatial expressions including place names, spatial terms, prepositions, verbs and so on. And these expressions are combined with certain syntactic patterns to represent their semantic functions. An instance of spatial relation in text can be simply formalized as (C1, P1, C2, P2, C3), where P1 and P2 are place names, and C1, C2 and C3 are the context. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a pattern recognition method popularly used in information extraction from text. This paper investigates the extraction of spatial relations based on SVM model which can implement the recognition of spatial expressions and their classification synchronously. For the SVM model, a set of feature vectors are specified, such as lexical tokens, spatial terms, syntactic structures and geographical feature types of place names, and a multi-label classifier is presented to solve the multi-classification problem. Finally, an experimental evaluation is explored in a Chinese annotation corpus. This study proves that spatial terms are important indicators for identification of spatial relations in text. However, there is serious ambiguity of their classification. Therefore, integration of much more context information could potentially improve the performance of extraction of spatial relations in text.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSDM.2011.5969102", "venue": "Proceedings 2011 IEEE International Conference on Spatial Data Mining and Geographical Knowledge Services", "journal": "Proceedings 2011 IEEE International Conference on Spatial Data Mining and Geographical Knowledge Services", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2024388076", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["63733859", "92985536", "8945340", "3160937", "13919894", "5511339", "124111950", "64394919", "18157167", "15414370"], "inbound_citations": ["17312456", "53006553", "11573042", "14378129", "52017300", "214639157", "15238321", "31833976", "2532416", "59483190", "15625721", "14288006"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6546346"}

The motivation is that a robust training process for deep learning models depends on large annotated datasets, which are expensive to be acquired, stored and processed.

The dominant data augmentation approach in the field assumes that new training samples can be obtained via random geometric or appearance transformations applied to annotated training samples, but this is a strong assumption because it is unclear if this is a reliable generative model for producing new training samples. In this paper, we provide a novel Bayesian formulation to data augmentation, where new annotated training points are treated as missing variables and generated based on the distribution learned from the training set.

Particularly in wind turbines, incipient fault detection based on vibration signature analysis plays a vital role in reliable operation and maintenance planning. The synergistic effect of non-stationary Vibration signals due to wide variation in wind speed and non-linearity due to inherent turbine load dynamics is a major challenging issue. Extraction of fault signatures from the non-stationary vibration depends on an efficacious decomposition of multi components into mono component intrinsic mode functions. In this work, an Adaptive Empirical Wavelet Decomposition (AEWD) based feature extraction technique with Quadratic Kernel Function Support Vector Machine (QKSVM) classifier is proposed to detect mechanical faults in Wind Turbine Planetary Epicyclic Gears. Instantaneous Amplitude and Frequency components are reconstructed from Empirical wavelet coefficients. Sample Entropy, Permutation Entropy, Signal descriptors (RMS, Peak, and Crest Factor) and Statistical moments are extracted to frame the hybrid feature space. Correlation analysis of hybrid features clearly shows non-linear distribution. The performance of proposed AEWD\u2013QKSVM is analyzed with practical Wind Turbine Gearbox Condition Monitoring Vibration Analysis Benchmarking Datasets.

A novel support vector regression (SVR) based digital audio watermarking scheme in the wavelet domain which using subsampling is proposed in this paper.

Then the watermark information is embedded into the low-frequency region of random one sub-audio. With the high correlation among the sub-audios, accordingly, the distributing rule of different sub-audios in the wavelet domain is similar to each other, SVR can be used to learn the characteristics of them. Using the information of unmodified template positions in the low-frequency region of the wavelet domain, the SVR can be trained well. Thanks to the good learning ability of SVR, the watermark can be correctly extracted under several different attacks.

The main drawback of standard SVM is its high computational complexity, therefore recently a new technique, the Least Squares SVM (LS\u2013SVM) has been introduced. In this paper we present an extended view of the Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LS\u2013SVR), which enables us to develop new formulations and algorithms to this regression technique. Based on manipulating the linear equation set -which embodies all information about the regression in the learning process- some new methods are introduced to simplify the formulations, speed up the calculations and/or provide better results. Keywords \u2014 Function estimation, Least\u2013Squares Support Vector Machines, Regression, System Modeling I. I NTRODUCTION HIS paper focuses on the Least Squares version of SVM [1], the LS\u2013SVM [2], whose main advantage is that it is computationally more efficient than the standard SVM method. In this case training requires the solution of a linear equation set instead of the long and computationally hard quadratic programming problem involved by the standard SVM. It must also be emphasized that LS\u2013SVM is closely related to Gaussian processes and regularization networks in that the obtained linear systems are equivalent [2]. While the least squares version incorporates all training data in the network to produce the result, the traditional SVM selects some of them (the support vectors) that are important in the regression. The use of only a subset of all vectors is a desirable property of SVMs, because it provides additional information regarding the training data and concludes in a more effective solution formulating a smaller network. Similarly to the sparseness of a traditional SVM, sparse LS-SVM solutions can also be reached by applying pruning methods [3][4]. Unfortunately if this LS\u2013SVM pruning is applied, the performance declines proportionally to the eliminated training samples, since the information (input-output relation) they described is lost. Another problem is that sparseness can be reached by iterative methods, which", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, International Journal of Computer, Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "191781529,2233629590", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "53940663", "10373909", "6535144", "17054045", "64543020", "1212353", "122208291", "62616275", "14152802", "61769312"], "inbound_citations": ["59935704", "12572028", "13973788", "8480854", "35496751", "12581634", "27030250"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12474911"}

Most existing approaches for travel time estimation assume that the route of the trip is given, which does not hold in real-world applications since the route can be dynamically changed due to traffic conditions, user preferences, etc. As inferring the path from the origin and the destination can be time-consuming and nevertheless error-prone, it is desirable to perform origin-destination travel time estimation, which aims to predict the travel time without online route information. This problem is challenging mainly due to its limited amount of information available and the complicated spatiotemporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-task Representation learning model for Arrival Time estimation (MURAT). This model produces meaningful representation that preserves various trip properties in the real-world and at the same time leverages the underlying road network and the spatiotemporal prior knowledge.

Alternative response designs (such as varying size, shape, quantity, and level of detail in training data) are being evaluated in terms of their costs and benefits for national mapping applications. Many classes of predictor variables such as spectral signatures, textural metrics, extant geospatial disturbance libraries, and bioclimatic information, are being tested for their contribution to classification models. Flexible modeling techniques, such as the Random Forests models used here, are powerful predictive tools but must be coupled with simple rule-based models reflecting expert knowledge. And decisions about appropriate modeling subpopulations are being made in light of available training data, diversity of ecological zones, and computational efficiency. We will be synthesizing results from our initial exploratory work as well as from pilot analyses conducted over 10 Landsat TM scenes representing diverse causal agents, forest types, and forest prevalence levels.

To improve the quality of images, different rain removal algorithms have been proposed recently. As the decomposition based methods do not need to impose any restrictions on the types of rain, they have a wider application prospect. However, they still have the problems of rain residue in the low-frequency components and information loss in high-frequency components. To solve these problems, we propose an image rain streak removal algorithm based on the depth of field (DoF) and sparse coding. Firstly, we decompose the image by using the combination of bilateral filtering and short-time Fourier transform, so that the contour in the low-frequency part of the image can be better preserved. Then the DoF saliency map of the image is used both to reduce the rain residue in the low-frequency components and to avoid mis-matching the background and the rain streaks with the same gradient in the high-frequency components. We use DoF saliency map as the weights for the weighted sum of the original image and the initial low-frequency image to obtain the corrected low-frequency images. The DoF saliency map is also used to twice weaken the rain streaks in the high-frequency image to generate the corrected high-frequency images. The algorithm includes four steps: image decomposition, dictionary learning, atomic clustering based on Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Machine, image revising based on DoF saliency map.

Since the number of such names is often large, several score or more, their manual entry is prohibitive. The automated extraction of these names is a problem in Named Entity Recognition (NER), but differs from typical NER due to the absence of normal English grammar in the text containing the names. In addition, since MEDLINE conventions require names to be expressed in a particular format, it is necessary to identify both first and last names of each investigator, an additional challenge. We seek to automate this task through two machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machine and structural SVM, both of which show good performance at the word and chunk levels. In contrast to traditional SVM, structural SVM attempts to learn a sequence by using contextual label features in addition to observational features. It outperforms SVM at the initial learning stage without using contextual observation features. However, with the addition of these contextual features from neighboring tokens, SVM performance improves to match or slightly exceed that of the structural SVM.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1815330.1815346", "venue": "DAS '10", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2093370758", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13968636", "8100615", "13512847", "194951", "8450924", "961425", "206787478", "10151608", "14727192", "61096945", "16392235", "775373", "11664683", "15941927", "11491870", "57157068", "14910181", "4227631", "564746", "7138354", "28637672", "15059183"], "inbound_citations": ["29005053", "5894315", "5294092"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15240247"}

In this paper, selected ML methods are applied to detect popular network covert channels. The capacity of detecting and classifying covert channels with high precision is demonstrated. A dataset was created from nine standard covert channel tools and the covert channels are then accordingly classified into patterns and labelled. Half of the generated dataset is used to train three different ML algorithms. The remaining half is used to verify the algorithms' performance. The tested ML algorithms are Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN).

INTRODUCTION The human-computer communication is one of the most challenging topics of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Since speech is the most natural and the most common way of human communication, there is a need for using it as a communication medium between human and computer. The process of extracting the meaning from an utterance by a computer and storing the meaning in a computer model is called Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Semantic analysis is the first step of the NLU process. The goal of semantic analysis is to represent what the subject intended to say.

Compared with traditional network, Software Defined network (SDN) technology contains data plane, control plane and application plane. The control plane centralized controls multiple switches instead of only one switch. Therefore, SDN has more security requirements. The existing network security equipment already can no longer adapt to the environment of SDN. Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks (DDoS) is one of the most major threats. DDoS detection is necessary for SDN switches. Support vector machine (SVM) classification technology is widely used in various fields. In this article, we will detect DDoS attacks using SVM optimized parameter c and g with cross validation-genetic algorithm (CV-GA). The experiments show that CV-GA-SVM classification performs better than others. Intr oduction In recent years, Software defined network (SDN) as a new research highlight appears in the development of computer network (1). SDN was originated from the Clean Slate project at Stanford University in the United States. With further researches, SDN which gradually obtained the wide recognition of academia and industry, has become the mainstream direction of the Internet's development in the future. The network control plane is separated from the underlying network in SDN technologies. Instead of the traditional closed control plane, the open plane controls the entire network by the centralized controller, and allows a programmable network. SDN has good openness and flexibility to bring the huge change of network. According to the SDN's architecture which defined by Open Networking Foundation (ONF) (2), SDN is divided into the infrastructure layer, the control layer, the application layer, the north interface and the south interface which connect the layers of data exchange. Dist ributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is a destruction of the effectiveness of network service. It leads that a suffered host or network can't receive and deal with the request from outside world. So the host or network cannot provide normal service for a legitimate user. Thus the attack forms a denial of ser vice. Compared with the traditional network, SDN has more flexibility and controllability so that the SDN is more vulnerable to DDoS attacks (3). Therefore, the detection of DDoS attacks is one im portant research direction of SDN security. In this paper, compared with other existing methods, we first prove the superiority of SVM based on traffic flow for DDoS detection in SDN switches. Secondly, this paper proposes a parameter optimization for SVM classification based on traffic flow to improve the quality of detection. We come up with CV-GA (cross validation - genetic algorithm) with adjusting factor to optimize parameter. At last, we compare results with un-optimized SVM.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2991/jimet-15.2015.63", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2015 Joint International Mechanical, Electronic and Information Technology Conference", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2015 Joint International Mechanical, Electronic and Information Technology Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2312161303", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1153326", "1513956", "1263511", "59889917", "206787478"], "inbound_citations": ["209382103", "4568042", "207973420", "198145907", "213868899"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62499715"}

The selection of those genes that are important for distinguishing the different sample classes being compared, poses a challenging problem in high dimensional data analysis. We describe a new procedure for selecting significant genes as recursive cluster elimination (RCE) rather than recursive feature elimination (RFE). We have tested this algorithm on six datasets and compared its performance with that of two related classification procedures with RFE.ResultsWe have developed a novel method for selecting significant genes in comparative gene expression studies. This method, which we refer to as SVM-RCE, combines K-means, a clustering method, to identify correlated gene clusters, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a supervised machine learning classification method, to identify and score (rank) those gene clusters for the purpose of classification. K-means is used initially to group genes into clusters. Recursive cluster elimination (RCE) is then applied to iteratively remove those clusters of genes that contribute the least to the classification performance. SVM-RCE identifies the clusters of correlated genes that are most significantly differentially expressed between the sample classes. Utilization of gene clusters, rather than individual genes, enhances the supervised classification accuracy of the same data as compared to the accuracy when either SVM or Penalized Discriminant Analysis (PDA) with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE and PDA-RFE) are used to remove genes based on their individual discriminant weights.ConclusionSVM-RCE provides improved classification accuracy with complex microarray data sets when it is compared to the classification accuracy of the same datasets using either SVM-RFE or PDA-RFE. SVM-RCE identifies clusters of correlated genes that when considered together provide greater insight into the structure of the microarray data. Clustering genes for classification appears to result in some concomitant clustering of samples into subgroups.Our present implementation of SVM-RCE groups genes using the correlation metric. The success of the SVM-RCE method in classification suggests that gene interaction networks or other biologically relevant metrics that group genes based on functional parameters might also be useful.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC1877816", "pubmed_id": "17474999", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-8-144", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2068474065", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["52059378", "62634291", "12501049", "207720429", "7580221", "46323653", "2809067", "16811892", "24052243", "14326237", "6160434", "123458043", "5968552", "1570296", "2914506", "18152439", "9775342", "7332938", "2711660", "9420146", "2407051", "16824215", "19916959", "6278891", "11408144", "2205818", "17702358", "1044641", "6534012", "2698102", "5612356", "10039376", "5365891"], "inbound_citations": ["14905857", "15444003", "18589182", "11498334", "7446150", "90983999", "34018224", "2476719", "31673736", "215429808", "211228581", "3663407", "2671553", "230448", "28618585", "40244301", "24349065", "14887030", "45508733", "2076042", "16669488", "16288529", "16264871", "125973989", "11785806", "472254", "6064107", "214978623", "10573838", "19108138", "6637856", "18909787", "18983273", "52903277", "16702661", "646544", "9574002", "13894733", "15196684", "215148211", "147117", "3040389"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15259731"}

Vegetation carbon use efficiency (CUE) is a key measure of carbon (C) transfer from the atmosphere to terrestrial biomass, and indirectly reflects how much C is released through autotrophic respiration from the vegetation to the atmosphere. Diagnosing the variability of CUE with climate and other environmental factors is fundamental to understand its driving factors, and to further fill the current gaps in knowledge about the environmental controls on CUE. Thus, to study CUE variability and its driving factors, this study established a global database of site-year CUE based on observations from 188 field measurement sites for five ecosystem types \u2013 forest, grass, wetland, crop and tundra. The spatial pattern of CUE was predicted from global climate and soil variables using Random Forest, and compared with estimates from Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) from the TRENDY model ensemble. Globally, we found two prominent CUE gradients in ecosystem types and latitude, that is, CUE varied with ecosystem types, being the highest in wetlands and lowest in grassland, and CUE decreased with latitude with the lowest CUE in tropics, and the highest CUE in higher latitude regions. CUE varied greatly between data-derived CUE and TRENDY-CUE, but also among TRENDY models. Both data-derived and TRENDY-CUE challenged the constant value of 0.5 for CUE, independent of environmental controls. However, given the role of CUE in controlling the spatial and temporal variability of the terrestrial biosphere C cycle, these results emphasize the need to better understand the biotic and abiotic controls on CUE to reduce the uncertainties in prognostic land-process model simulations. Finally, this study proposed a new estimate of net primary production based on CUE and gross primary production, offering another benchmark for net primary production comparison for global carbon modelling.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/bg-2019-37", "venue": null, "journal": "Biogeosciences Discussions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2912179603", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["86782821", "86564559", "128911666", "2936674", "128406519", "9997939", "56218022", "14044969", "131719157", "21743322", "83731585", "17019276", "85625822", "2594785", "22112134", "9189683", "132536927", "11784640", "29327186", "129663083", "17884011", "14036869"], "inbound_citations": ["208224635"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133732542"}

Over the last decade, there have been several attempts to extend the well-established Viola&Jones face detector algorithm to solve the problem of multi-view face detection. Recently a tree structure model for multi-view face detection was proposed. This method is primarily designed for facial landmark detection and consequently a face detection is provided. However, the effort to model inner facial structures by using a detailed facial landmark labelling resulted on a complex and suboptimal system for face detection. Instead, we adopt CDPMs, where the models are learned from partially labelled images using Latent Support Vector Machines (LSVM). Furthermore, LSVM is enhanced with data-mining and bootstrapping procedures to enrich models during the training. Furthermore, a post-optimization procedure is derived to improve the performance. This semi-supervised methodology allows us to build models based on weakly labelled data while incrementally learning latent positive and negative samples. Our results show that the proposed model can deal with highly expressive and partially occluded faces while outperforming the state-of-the-art face detectors by a large margin on challenging benchmarks such as the Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark (FDDB) 1 and the Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW) 2 databases. In addition, we validate the accuracy of our models under large head pose variation and facial occlusions in the Head Pose Image Database (HPID) 3 and Caltech Occluded Faces in the Wild (COFW) datasets 4, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a Dual-rate Hybrid Filter (DHF) to deal with the high-order position errors based on Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Kalman Filter.

As boosting is an offline training process with beforehand collected data, once learned, it cannot make use of any newly arriving ones. However, an offline boosted detector is to be exploited online and inevitably there must be some special cases that are not covered by those beforehand collected training data. As a result, the inadaptable detector often performs badly in diverse and changeful environments which are ordinary for many real-life applications. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes an incremental learning algorithm to effectively adjust a boosted strong classifier with domain-partitioning weak hypotheses to online samples, which adopts a novel approach to efficient estimation of training losses received from offline samples. By this means, the offline learned general-purpose detectors can be adapted to special online situations at a low extra cost, and still retains good generalization ability for common environments.

We use a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based NER system using local features to make predictions and then train another CRF which uses both local information and features extracted from the output of the first CRF. Using features capturing non-local dependencies from the same document, our approach yields a 12.6% relative error reduction on the F1 score, over state-of-the-art NER systems using local-information alone, when compared to the 9.3% relative error reduction offered by the best systems that exploit non-local information. Our approach also makes it easy to incorporate non-local information from other documents in the test corpus, and this gives us a 13.3% error reduction over NER systems using local-information alone. Additionally, our running time for inference is just the inference time of two sequential CRFs, which is much less than that directly model the dependencies and do approximate inference.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "P06-1141", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3115/1220175.1220316", "venue": "International Conference On Computational Linguistics And Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2117813082", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60779558", "793886", "5906107", "10977241", "17449687", "120489597", "277918", "59798638", "2840902", "775373", "7332330", "61503518", "13936575", "64084", "2282762", "1105"], "inbound_citations": ["20146175", "8090461", "15049648", "2699946", "15347922", "202573016", "2432242", "19751968", "16258006", "4107267", "18331264", "9749632", "2747277", "18877737", "30557130", "16023403", "6100834", "15619242", "629094", "17011857", "10086198", "16724787", "15287556", "809570", "2574191", "7737129", "1859014", "16519283", "11942376", "15428145", "17004586", "46894305", "52184095", "7297013", "27842487", "174799781", "8117260", "11808093", "629888", "16249768", "8621702", "3154368", "52083281", "13203069", "9422633", "18933667", "15293480", "14070342", "2575081", "15115512", "210138702", "6540554", "9033216", "1481161", "5056850", "14130954", "51980564", "102352139", "19024852", "18185101", "51867532", "24985266", "10591498", "34222962", "8123112", "17309500", "5945294", "16142903", "6814749", "2558305", "1817583", "417913", "44128386", "14396492", "1658300", "53552294", "6625416", "7138274", "56895382", "189859282", "14442009", "8516585", "7287065", "17222578", "730814", "11885145"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14735038"}

Inclusion of manganite-based material (MBM) in MRT as a magnetic refrigerant has attracted significant attention recently due to cost effectiveness of the refrigerant as well as better resistance to oxidation and corrosion as compared to the commonly used metal gadolinium refrigerant. Relative cooling power (RCP) is one of the most important parameters to be considered while assessing the usefulness of MBM. Its value can be altered through doping with external materials and accurate estimation of the dopant influence is required to achieve the right amount of RCP. This present research work proposes support vector regression (SVR) ensemble models with gravitational search algorithm (GSA) hyper-parameters optimization, for estimating RCP of MBM and to determine the influence of dopants on RCP using ionic radii and dopant concentrations as descriptors. GSA-SVR ensemble model (GSE) is developed by employing the outputs of five different SVR models as descriptors while GSA-SVR ensemble model with averaging (GSEA) uses the average of the five different SVR models as its descriptor. The novel ensemble models outperform other SVR models, specifically; GSE performs better than GSA-SVR model and the conventional SVR model with performance improvement of 269.14% and 283.61%, respectively on the basis of root mean square error (RMSE). Furthermore, GSEA outperforms GSE, GSA-SVR model and conventional SVR with performance improvement of 27.51%, 370.70%, and 389.14%, respectively on the basis of RMSE. The developed GSE and GSEA also perform better than the existing RCP model in the literature with performance improvement of 11.53% and 42.21%, respectively.

In the context of prostate cancer histopathology, gland morphology is an integral component of the Gleason grading system which enables discrimination between low and high grade disease. However, clinicians are often unable to distinguish between subtle differences in object morphology, as evidenced by high inter-observer variability in Gleason grading. Boundary-based morphologic descriptors, such as the variance in the distance from points on the boundary of an object to its center, may not have the requisite discriminability to separate objects with subtle shape differences. In this paper, we present a set of novel explicit shape descriptors (ESDs) which are capable of distinguishing subtle shape differences between prostate glands of intermediate Gleason grades (grades 3 and 4) on prostate cancer histopathology. Calculation of ESDs involves: (1) representing object morphology using an explicit shape model (e.g. medial axis); (2) aligning the shape models via a non-rigid registration scheme with a diffeomorphic constraint and quantifying shape model dissimilarity; and (3) applying a non-linear dimensionality reduction scheme (e.g. Graph Embedding) to learn a low dimensional projection encoding the shape differences between objects. ESDs are hence the principal eigenvectors in the reduced embedding space. In this work we demonstrate that ESDs in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine classifier are able to correctly distinguish between 888 prostate glands corresponding to different Gleason grades (benign, grade 3, or grade 4) of prostate cancer from 58 needle biopsy specimens with a maximum accuracy of 0.89 and corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3811112", "pubmed_id": "23850744", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2013.06.002", "venue": "Medical image analysis", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2089691539", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["10375779", "7276792", "40274954", "2675969", "9045760", "14965041", "765855", "12990717", "16902615", "129468", "6894357", "118143931", "14216000", "1246970", "61249851", "27928391", "52874011", "53335638", "2864393", "9242240", "1346547", "504932", "7428768", "620015", "2384316", "18595695", "17234600", "68606890", "1361286", "1771188", "589776", "2259431", "8027136", "45687569", "1878831", "15672987", "10596795", "36668215", "10640828", "15846190", "6528546", "30053045", "17498788", "287915", "12223255", "122892768", "744269", "5556966", "12182983", "2478952", "36027870", "32939450", "31148053", "17012087", "895701", "14848918", "29897524", "9212861", "16852524", "5736565", "14922543", "12701882", "14673541", "5410377", "7791430", "23513103", "2842191", "21076455", "14817019", "46708084"], "inbound_citations": ["12343315", "206978666", "21668987", "4377473", "3491635", "182951333", "35479521", "51614438", "80906062", "52191417", "43508566", "10959436", "140121706", "52938715", "4233232", "17609417", "206749861", "6850881", "18439748", "35033473"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6577235"}

Our model, LRML (Latent Relational Metric Learning) is a novel extension of metric learning approaches for recommendation. More specifically, instead of simple push pull mechanisms between user and item pairs, we propose to learn latent relations for each user item interaction. This helps to alleviate the potential geometric inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches. This not only enables better performance but also a greater extent of modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to larger number of interactions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn to attend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. The attention module is controlled by the user-item interaction, making the learned relation vector specific to each user-item pair. Hence, this can be interpreted as learning an exclusive and optimal relational translation for each user-item interaction. The proposed architecture not only demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance across multiple recommendation benchmarks. LRML outperforms other metric learning models by 6%-7.5% in terms of Hits@10 and nDCG@10 on large datasets such as Netflix and MovieLens20M. Moreover, qualitative studies also demonstrate evidence that our proposed model is able to infer and encode explicit sentiment, temporal and attribute information despite being only trained on implicit feedback. As such, this ascertains the ability of LRML to uncover hidden relational structure within implicit datasets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3178876.3186154", "venue": "WWW", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2783565819", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214605979", "210692966", "214693589", "50772365", "59528395", "203655515", "49300329", "207731089", "210884024", "59600086", "207758754", "62841652", "195345617", "174802656", "196831663", "210694476", "214743520", "215415783", "202687456", "150380651", "170078649", "52171583", "92979778", "139100762", "159043133", "207756532", "202549231", "199408680", "202779357", "58981833", "197928297", "4949988", "56895490", "211041929", "44154436", "53035042", "211043589", "58005362", "208130430", "202692553", "195657811", "197928079", "208268313", "83458849", "211146549", "202740911", "22475926", "198180588", "201125251", "86807571", "52097129", "51604671", "208210516", "208138060", "52137534", "86433563", "208126105", "207852823", "67749794", "86470399", "198980065"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4884763"}

This system accepts two sets of inputs: McIntosh classification of sunspot groups and solar cycle data. In order to establish a correlation between solar flares and sunspot groups, the system explores the publicly available solar catalogues from the National Geophysical Data Center to associate sunspots with their corresponding flares based on their timing and NOAA numbers. The McIntosh classification for every relevant sunspot is extracted and converted to a numerical format that is suitable for machine learning algorithms. Using this system we aim to predict whether a certain sunspot class at a certain time is likely to produce a significant flare within six hours time and if so whether this flare is going to be an X or M flare. Machine learning algorithms such as Cascade-Correlation Neural Networks (CCNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) are optimised and then compared to determine the learning algorithm that would provide the best prediction performance. It is concluded that SVMs provide the best performance for predicting whether a McIntosh classified sunspot group is going to flare or not but CCNNs are more capable of predicting the class of the flare to erupt.

With the number of opencast coal mines decreasing, it has become increasingly difficult to find coal. Low efficiencies and high casualty rates have always been problems in the process of coal exploration due to complicated geological structures in coal mining areas. Therefore, we propose a new exploration technology for coal that uses satellite images to explore and monitor opencast coal mining areas. First, we collected bituminous coal and lignite from the Shenhua opencast coal mine in China in addition to non-coal objects, including sandstones, soils, shales, marls, vegetation, coal gangues, water, and buildings. Second, we measured the spectral data of these objects through a spectrometer. Third, we proposed a multilayer extreme learning machine algorithm and constructed a coal classification model based on that algorithm and the spectral data. The model can assist in the classification of bituminous coal, lignite, and non-coal objects. Fourth, we collected Landsat 8 satellite images for the coal mining areas. We divided the image of the coal mine using the constructed model and correctly described the distributions of bituminous coal and lignite.

Weather condition is a critical factor for path planning while the raining or snowing can severely degrade the vehicle moving speed. For this reason, when the experienced drivers including most taxi drivers manually plan the paths, they always consider the weather and other related factors to find the optimal path during bad weather. However, most existing works do not consider the weather and experienced drivers' selection to make path planning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new path planning considers by analyzing the weather effect on experienced drivers' path selection. To achieve this, we study the floating car data in Beijing to discover how taxi drivers as a group of most experienced drivers select path under bad weathers.

Moreover, they update hash functions dynamically by generating new hash codes for all accumulated data over time which is clearly uneconomical. In order to solve these two problems, concept preserving hashing (CPH) is proposed. In contrast to the existing methods, CPH preserves the original concept, that is, the set of hash codes representing a concept is preserved over time, by learning a new set of hash functions to yield the same set of hash codes for images (old and new) of a concept. The objective function of CPH learning consists of three components: 1) isomorphic similarity; 2) hash codes partition balancing; and 3) heterogeneous similarity fitness.

Wildfires are one of the main threats to forest plantations, causing economic and environmental loss. Modeling wildfire occurrence provides a better understanding of the processes that drive fire activity. Furthermore, the use of spatially explicit models may promote more effective management strategies and support fire prevention policies. In this work, we assessed wildfire occurrence combining Random Forest (RF) algorithms and cluster analysis to predict and detect changes in the spatial pattern of ignition probability over time. The model was trained using several explanatory drivers related to fire ignition: accessibility, proximity to agricultural lands or human activities, among others. Specifically, we introduced the progression of eucalypt plantations on a two-year basis to capture the influence of land cover changes over fire likelihood consistently. Fire occurrences in the period 2010\u20132016 were retrieved from the Brazilian Institute of Space Research (INPE) database. In terms of the AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), the model denoted fairly good predictive accuracy (AUC \u2248 0.72). Results suggested that fire occurrence was mainly linked to proximity agricultural and to urban interfaces. Eucalypt plantation contributed to increased wildfire likelihood and denoted fairly high importance as an explanatory variable (17% increase of Mean Square Error [MSE]). Nevertheless, agriculture and urban interfaces proved to be the main drivers, contributing to decreasing the RF\u2019s MSE in 42% and 38%, respectively. Furthermore, eucalypt plantations expansion is progressing over clusters of high wildfire likelihood, thus increasing the exposure to wildfire events for young eucalypt plantations and nearby areas.

Owing to its onerous and time-consuming nature, seizure detection based on visual inspection hinders epilepsy diagnosis, monitoring, and large-scale data analysis in epilepsy research. So, there is a dire need of an automatic seizure detection scheme. Method: An automated scheme for epileptic seizure identification is developed in this study. Here we utilize a signal processing technique, namely-complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) for epileptic seizure identification. First, we decompose segments of EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions by CEEMDAN. The mode functions are then modeled by normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) pdf parameters. In this work, NIG modeling is employed in conjunction with CEEMDAN for epileptic seizure detection for the first time. The efficacy of the NIG parameters in the CEEMDAN domain is demonstrated by intuitive, graphical, and statistical analyses. Adaptive Boosting, an eminent ensemble learning based classification model, is implemented to perform classification. Results: Experimental outcomes suggest that the algorithmic performance of the proposed scheme is promising in all the cases of clinical significance. Comparative evaluation of algorithmic performance with the state-of-the-art schemes manifest that the seizure detection scheme proposed herein outperforms competing algorithms in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen\u2019s Kappa coefficient.

Phishing Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a malicious web address often created to look like legitimate URL, in order to deceive unsuspecting users. Many algorithms have been proposed to detect phishing URLs and classify them as benign or phishing. Most of these detection algorithms are based on machine learning and detect using inherent characteristics of the URLs. In this study, we examine the performance of a number of such techniques. The algorithms were tested using three publicly available datasets. Our results revealed, overall, the Random Forest algorithm as the best performing algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 97.3%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32475-9_28", "venue": "ICAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2982662379", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208121163"}

Due to the huge number of features (bands) in hyperspectral imagery, land cover classification procedures are computationally expensive and pose a problem known as the curse of dimensionality. In addition, higher correlation among contiguous bands increases the redundancy within the bands. Hence, dimension reduction of hyperspectral data is very crucial so as to obtain good classification accuracy results. This paper presents a new feature selection technique. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm is proposed to obtain reduced relevant features in the input domain of each class label. This aimed to reduce classification error and dimensionality of classification challenges. Indiana pines of the Northwest Indiana dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method through experiments of features selection and classification. The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) data mining framework is selected as a tool to implement the classification using Support Vector Machines and Neural Network. The selected features subsets are subjected to land cover classification to investigate the performance of the classifiers and how the features size affects classification accuracy. Results obtained shows that performances of the classifiers are significant.

This study is thus motivated to develop forecasting algorithms for wave elevations and wave excitation forces with the purpose of applying feedforward controllers on OFWTs. Two forecasting algorithms, the approximate Prony Method based on ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) regression, are developed and validated using wave records from tank tests. Utilizing the forecasted wave elevations and wave excitation forces, a feedforward LQR controller is designed to mitigate structural loads of an OFWT system.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.059", "venue": null, "journal": "Renewable Energy", "mag_id": "2806922792", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203134443"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116843947"}

Many studies were conducted on DNA microarray data. At present, there are several methods used in analyzing DNA microarray to help in dealing with various related research. Microarray generates large and complex data with high dimensionality issues. Thereby, the curse of dimensionality may reduce the effectiveness and performance of classifications and increase computational complexity. Therefore, feature selection techniques work to solve dimensionality issues by choosing informative genes. In this study, we proposed a new combination of feature selection methods called ChiSVMRFE based on the Chi Square Statistic and Support vector machine with Recursive Feature Elimination SVMRFE. Chi-Square used as a ranking method to calculate the weight of genes with respect to the class label, then the top ten percent of genes with the higher weights were considered as relevant and important genes.

Although plenty of efforts have been dedicated to this task, several issues still remain unsolved for generating vivid and detail-preserving personal sketch portraits. For example, quite a few artifacts may exist in synthesizing hairpins and glasses, and textural details may be lost in the regions of hair or mustache. Moreover, the generalization ability of current systems is somewhat limited since they usually require elaborately collecting a dictionary of examples or carefully tuning features/components. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning framework that generates an end-to-end photo-sketch mapping through structure and texture decomposition. In the training stage, we first decompose the input face photo into different components according to their representational contents (i.e., structural and textural parts) by using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, we utilize a branched fully CNN for learning structural and textural representations, respectively. In addition, we design a sorted matching mean square error metric to measure texture patterns in the loss function. In the stage of sketch rendering, our approach automatically generates structural and textural representations for the input photo and produces the final result via a probabilistic fusion scheme. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks suggest that our approach outperforms example-based synthesis algorithms in terms of both perceptual and objective metrics. In addition, the proposed method also has better generalization ability across data set without additional training.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1710.01453", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27831874", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2016.2623485", "venue": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "journal": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2545239134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["17485723", "6987782", "10557162", "9630592", "14312772", "1225703", "14224583", "9478502", "23200190", "4071727", "9647606", "2972501", "15158546", "436933", "1217966", "1449366", "207763512", "3960646", "8558863", "4155662", "9363077", "18874645", "6593498", "14083415", "56507745", "2130207", "15539264", "207761262", "8959607", "122933965", "16433452", "13241530", "1799558", "57227467", "15312675", "18412057", "14366466", "2832683", "10952904", "682896", "206770307"], "inbound_citations": ["13802728", "52288069", "54475569", "51604949", "59316571", "150332322", "202687705", "4951598", "201303878", "3723973", "23187131", "52306936", "19162188", "182626680", "57375717", "54439906", "23362178"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9338669"}

When using a clustering algorithm, the auxiliary information has the form of Side Information, that is a list of co-clustered points. Recent literature shows better performance of these methods with respect to totally unsupervised ones even with a small amount of Side Information. This fact suggests that the use of Semi Supervised methods may be useful especially in very difficult and noisy tasks where little a priori information is available, as is the case of data deriving from biological experiments. The two more frequently used paradigms to include Side Information into clustering are Constrained Clustering and Metric Learning. In this paper we use a Metric Learning approach as a way to improve the classical fuzzy c-means clustering through a two steps procedure: first a series of metrics (one for each cluster) that satisfy a randomly generated set of constraints are learnt based on the data; then a generalized version of the fuzzy c-means (with the metrics computed in the previous step) is executed.

In this paper, we propose a community detection algorithm called active semi-supervised community detection algorithm with label propagation. Firstly, we transform a given complex network into a weighted network, select some informative nodes using the weighted shortest path method, and label those nodes for community detection. Secondly, we utilize the labeled nodes to expand the labeled nodes set by propagating the labels of the labeled nodes according to an adaptive threshold. Thirdly, we deal with the rest of unlabeled nodes. Finally, we demonstrate our community detection algorithm with three real networks and one synthetic network.

In this paper, we present a novel face sketch synthesis method by multidomain adversarial learning (termed MDAL), which overcomes the defects of blurs and deformations toward high-quality synthesis.

The current study aims to quantify the performance of RF-classifiers to discern the geyser state. Towards this goal, we first present the data collected from the seismometer that is installed near the Chimay\\'{o} geyser. The seismic signals collected at this site contain different types of noises such as daily temperature variations, seasonal trends, animal movement near the geyser, and human activity. First, we filter the signals from these noises by combining the Butterworth-Highpass filter and an Autoregressive method in a multi-level fashion. We show that by combining these filtering techniques, in a hierarchical fashion, leads to reduction in the noise in the seismic data without removing the precursors and eruption event signals. We then use RF on the filtered data to classify the state of geyser into three classes -- remnant noise, precursor, and eruption states. We show that the classification accuracy using RF on the filtered data is greater than 90\\%.These aspects make the proposed ML framework attractive for event discrimination and signal enhancement under noisy conditions, with strong potential for application to monitoring leaks in $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ sequestration.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1810.01488", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1785/0220180306", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964253853,2894958639,2949898953", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science", "Engineering", "Physics", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["97767493", "128762248", "140174034", "108775452", "11212796", "132247055", "4573305", "128943979", "56125855", "118842086", "67361153", "214921767", "119474631", "25274907", "3611395", "206610380", "21711500", "46945308", "51888628", "26913022", "9448393", "12733161", "13473447", "3331253", "10630704", "62426288"], "inbound_citations": ["211505672"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52916936"}

Existing commercial endoscopes most often use an arc lamp to produce bright, incoherent white light, requiring large-area fiber bundles to deliver sufficient illumination power to the sample. Moreover, the power instability of these light sources creates challenges for computer vision applications. We demonstrate an alternative illumination technique using red-green-blue laser light and a data-driven approach to combat the speckle noise that is a byproduct of coherent illumination. We frame the speckle artifact problem as an image-to-image translation task solved using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). To train the network, we acquire images illuminated with a coherent laser diode, with a laser diode source made partially- coherent using a laser speckle reducer, and with an incoherent LED light source as the target domain. We train networks using laser-illuminated endoscopic images of ex-vivo, porcine gastrointestinal tissues, augmented by images of laser-illuminated household and laboratory objects. The network is then benchmarked against state of-the-art optical and image processing speckle reduction methods, achieving an increased peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 4.1 db, compared to 0.7 dB using optical speckle reduction, 0.6 dB using median filtering, and 0.5 dB using non-local means.

Distance measures have been used as natural measures of (dis)similarity and served as the foundation of various learning methods. The efficiency of distance-based learning methods heavily depends on the chosen distance metric. With increasing dimensionality and complexity of data, however, traditional metric learning methods suffer from poor scalability and the limitation due to linearity as the true signals are usually embedded within a low-dimensional nonlinear subspace. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear sparse metric learning algorithm via boosting. We restructure a global optimization problem into a forward stage-wise learning of weak learners based on a rank-one decomposition of the weight matrix in the Mahalanobis distance metric. A gradient boosting algorithm is devised to obtain a sparse rank-one update of the weight matrix at each step. Nonlinear features are learned by a hierarchical expansion of interactions incorporated within the boosting algorithm. Meanwhile, an early stopping rule is imposed to control the overall complexity of the learned metric. As a result, our approach guarantees three desirable properties of the final metric: positive semi-definiteness, low rank and element-wise sparsity.

The collected database comprises 315 AO molecules including 68 features each, inducing a problem well-suited to SVMs. The task of feature selection is crucial given the presence of noisy or redundant features, and the well-known problem of the curse of dimensionality. We propose a two-stage strategy to develop an optimal model: (1) feature selection using correlation analysis, mutual information, and SVM-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and (2) AO prediction using standard and profiled SVM formulations. A profiled SVM gives different weights to different parts of the training data to focus the training on the most important regions.ResultsIn the first stage, the SVM-RFE technique was most efficient and robust in the presence of low number of samples and high input space dimension. This method yielded an optimal subset of 14 representative features, which were all related to energy and sequence motifs. The second stage evaluated the performance of the predictors (overall correlation coefficient between observed and predicted efficacy, r; mean error, ME; and root-mean-square-error, RMSE) using 8-fold and minus-one-RNA cross-validation methods. The profiled SVM produced the best results (r = 0.44, ME = 0.022, and RMSE= 0.278) and predicted high (>75% inhibition of gene expression) and low efficacy (<25%) AOs with a success rate of 83.3% and 82.9%, respectively, which is better than by previous approaches. A web server for AO prediction is available online at http://aosvm.cgb.ki.se/.ConclusionsThe SVM approach is well suited to the AO prediction problem, and yields a prediction accuracy superior to previous methods.

The result is that the gradient boosting classifier gives the best predictive arrival delay performance of 79.7% of total scheduled American Airlines\u2019 flights in comparison to kNN, SVM and random forest. Such a predictive model based on the GBC potentially can save huge losses; the commercial airlines suffer due to arrival delays of their scheduled flights.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-1498-8_57", "venue": "Emerging Technologies in Data Mining and Information Security", "journal": "Emerging Technologies in Data Mining and Information Security", "mag_id": "2889320515", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["81985029"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70140543"}

There are a number of parameters that need to be measured which are not entirely linearly related to pollutant concentrations. Besides the complex correlations between variable water parameters that need to be analyzed also impairs the accuracy of quantitative detection. In aspects of these problems, the application of least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is used to evaluate the water contamination and various conventional water quality sensors quantitatively. The various contaminations may cause different correlative responses of sensors, and also the degree of response is related to the concentration of the injected contaminant. Therefore to enhance the reliability and accuracy of water contamination detection a new method is proposed. In this method, a new relative response parameter is introduced to calculate the differences between water quality parameters and their baselines. A variety of regression models has been examined, as result of its high performance, the regression model based on genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with LS-SVM. In this paper, the practical application of the proposed method is considered, controlled experiments are designed, and data is collected from the experimental setup. The measured data is applied to analyze the water contamination concentration. The evaluation of results validated that the LS-SVM model can adapt to the local nonlinear variations between water quality parameters and contamination concentration with the excellent generalization ability and accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach in concentration evaluation for potassium ferricyanide is proven to be more than 0.5 mg/L in water distribution systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5948656", "pubmed_id": "29565295", "doi": "10.3390/s18040938", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2793280835", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["107297044", "28363886", "3816714", "110037503", "86309242", "10312161", "10336742", "110021207", "5385019", "93242399", "16415341", "3321362", "26756342", "130050008", "7456807", "205209986", "18383392", "140601576", "128761663", "35912814", "29044567", "33827786", "28637672", "207579947", "11225382", "10786968", "84089124", "53940663", "206793615", "94052059", "45113586"], "inbound_citations": ["210880827"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4339082"}

Once integrated, these four pansharpening images and LIDAR data, were treated as independent multiple band imagery to perform the classification. Using five classes, a sample of ground truth pixels was taken for training and testing. The study used 10% of the ground truth for training and the entire ground truth for testing the robustness of the classification with and without LIDAR data.

Information about stressful life events experienced by the original 5092 CCS participants has been extracted objectively from the UPDB, without the possibility of recall bias. This information was then statistically analyzed to look for relationships between key stressors and dementia risk. The LSAD study made it possible to examine the correlation between stressors as well as look at patterns or groupings that may exist among the stressors. For this project, we will apply, compare and contrast a variety of methods to explore the relationship between stressors and dementia status. We first assessed significant associations between stressors and dementia using chisquare tests, logistic regression, and stepwise logistic regression. CART and Random Forests were also used to evaluate which variables are most predictive of dementia status. To explore interrelationships among the stressors, principal components analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis were performed. These last methods also obtain dimension reduction of the set of stressor variables to a smaller set of factors or clusters of stressors. For each of the methods, we explored some basic strategies to account for the high rate of missingness among some of the stressors. Introduction The proportion of elderly adults is expected to increase significantly both in the U.S. and worldwide. With that increase the number of adults with dementia will also grow. The costs of treatment and caregiving for individuals with dementia are significant, and the growing prevalence of dementia represents an increasingly enormous health burden. There is a pressing need to explore and better understand the causes and risk factors associated with dementia, to provide better means of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Prior research has long suggested that stressful life events may have a significant impact on outcomes in late life. This relationship led to the development of the so-called Holmes-Rahe Stress Index, which has been used to evaluate a person's risk of various illnesses such as headache, diabetes, fatigue, hypertension, chest and back pain, ulcers, infectious disease based on the stressful events, or stressors, they have experienced in the last 1-2 years. Though this measure is widely used throughout the social sciences, the short amount of time it covers is a considerable limitation. With respect specifically to dementia, research has shown that high levels of glucocorticoids released in the brain during stressful situations can lead to damage of parts of the brain responsible for learning and memory. The neural degeneration resulting from the damage to the brain due to the response to stress may increase susceptibility to dementia. This etiology is consistent with findings from various observational studies, which have demonstrated an association between dementia risk and stressors such as death of a parent during 8/10/11 4:46 PM", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "107796949", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["10803995", "30573353", "13120868", "6111738"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56150663"}

First, instance-based cascaded transfer learning was used to initialize the weight distribution of the training data and obtain instances closer to the target domain. Second, the cross-domain feature filtering algorithm was adopted to filter irrelevant features, eliminate redundant features, and obtain the co-occurrence features of the source and target domains. Moreover, the remaining features were assigned different weights and transformed into the same space to reduce the distribution difference between the domains. Third, the BPD algorithm was used to balance the examples and the co-occurrence features from multiple disease source domains and construct a more suitable classification model of the target domain. Finally, the elastic network was used to further improve the generalization performance of the model. The experimental results show that the prediction effect of the BPD model is better than that of state-of-the-art methods and has strong generalization ability and robustness.

Stereo vision could be a key component for autonomous object recognition and localization, thus enabling the system to perform low-level tasks, and allowing a human operator to perform a supervisory role. The central difficulty in stereo vision is the ambiguity in matching corresponding points in the left and right images. However, if one has a priori knowledge of the characteristics of the objects in the scene, as is often the case in telerobotics, a model-based approach can be taken. Researchers describe how matching ambiguities can be resolved by ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional points are consistent with surface models of the expected objects. A four-layer neural network hierarchy is used in which surface models of increasing complexity are represented in successive layers. These models are represented using a connectionist scheme called parameter networks, in which a parametrized object (for example, a planar patch p=f(h,m sub x, m sub y) is represented by a collection of processing units, each of which corresponds to a distinct combination of parameter values.

Feature selection in this case may be needed to improve the classifier's generalization performance (given limited training data), to reduce classification complexity, and/or to identify a minimum subset of features necessary for accurate classification, i.e., a set of putative \"biomarkers\". While there are a variety of techniques for SVM-based feature selection, many such may be unsuitable for huge feature spaces due to computational and/or memory requirements. One popular, lightweight scheme is recursive feature elimination (RFE), wherein the feature with smallest weight magnitude in the current solution is eliminated at each step. Here we propose an alternative to RFE that is stepwise superior in that it maximizes margin (in the separable case) and minimizes training error rate (in the non- separable case), rather than minimizing weight magnitude. Moreover, we formulate an algorithm that achieves this stepwise maximum margin feature elimination without requiring explicit margin evaluation for all the remaining (candidate) features - in this way, the method achieves reduced complexity. To date, we have only performed experiments on (modestly dimensioned) UC Irvine data sets, which demonstrate better classification accuracy of our scheme (both training and test) over RFE.

When only the PM2.5 concentration time series is considered without other exogenous information, accurate forecasting is important and should be efficient. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm consisting of multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. The innovation of the proposed hybrid algorithm is to decompose the original single one-dimensional (1D) PM2.5 data into multi-dimensional information which effectively mines information hidden in the 1D data. Then, it uses traditional prediction methods to forecast each sequence and to reconstruct its forecasting results to obtain the final forecasting results. Three hybrid models, Wavelet-ANN, Wavelet-ARIMA and Wavelet-SVM, are developed to forecast the 2016 PM2.5 trends in 5 Cities in China. The results showed that: (1) Hybrid models (Wavelet-ANN, Wavelet-ARIMA and Wavelet-SVM) can forecast short-term PM2.5 concentrations in China. Compared with the traditional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, hybrid models can significantly improve prediction accuracy. (2) The Wavelet-ARIMA model has higher accuracy with respect to predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In particular, it can more accurately capture the mutational points of PM2.5 concentrations, which can provide effective information support for generating warnings about atmospheric pollution.

In this paper, we provide a step toward a paradigm of kernels by incorporating data specific knowledge into existing kernels. We first find the data structure for each class adaptively in the input space via agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), and then construct the weighted Mahalanobis distance (WMD) kernels using the detected data distribution information. In WMD kernels, the similarity between two pattern images is determined not only by the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between their corresponding input patterns but also by the sizes of the clusters they reside in. Although WMD kernels are not guaranteed to be positive definite (pd) or conditionally positive definite (cpd), satisfactory classification results can still be achieved because regularizers in SVMs with WMD kernels are empirically positive in pseudo-Euclidean (pE) spaces.

This paper therefore introduces a novel approximation slack method to solve this problem, in which we propose a modified way of defining the loss functions to ensure the decomposability of the object function. During the training process, a bundle method is used to improve the computing efficiency. The results on Middlebury datasets show that proposed depth inference method solves the nondecomposability of slack scaling method and achieves relative acceptable accuracy.

Aim: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is unique for asbestos exposure. Methods: Based on the physical inventory of asbestos-cement roofing, the social-economic situation of communes, the proximity of asbestos manufacturing plants, the land use data referring to the surface of the built-up area, and the historical data on the annexations, the amount of asbestos-containing products in use was estimated by computing best Random Forest models. Per capita asbestos use is an indicator to compare the state of asbestos use among countries. MM cases in the local administrative units (provinces) were tested by the application of Moran\u2019s I and Getis and Ord statistic. Results: The total amount of asbestos roofing in Poland was estimated at 738,068,000 m2 (8.2 million tons). In total there were 28 plants in Poland located in 11 provinces throughout the country. The amount of asbestos-cement roofing in use is correlated primarily with the measurements of asbestos concentration fibers (rs = 0.597). MM raw morbidity rate was calculated, stratified by province, and classified into five groups with respect to incidence. Hotspots of MM cases are in the southern part of Poland. Conclusions: MM cases are concentrated in the same geographical areas, which may indicate an increasing impact of environmental exposure. The results of the local and global autocorrelation clearly indicate a statistically significant relationship between incidences of MM in provinces. Poland and other Eastern European countries are among countries with low MM incidence rate.

In this work, we propose to study the morphological differences between male and female faces by analyzing the averageness and symmetry of their 3D shapes. In particular, we address the following questions: (i) is there any relationship between gender and face averageness/symmetry? and (ii) if this relationship exists, which specific areas on the face are involved? To this end, we propose first to capture densely both the face shape averageness (AVE) and symmetry (SYM) using our Dense Scalar Field (DSF), which denotes the shooting directions of geodesics between facial shapes.

We learn a metric space for embedding polar radar scans using CNN and NetVLAD architectures traditionally applied to the visual domain. However, we tailor the feature extraction for more suitability to the polar nature of radar scan formation using cylindrical convolutions, anti-aliasing blurring, and azimuth-wise max-pooling; all in order to bolster the rotational invariance. The enforced metric space is then used to encode a reference trajectory, serving as a map, which is queried for nearest neighbours (NNs) for recognition of places at run-time. We demonstrate the performance of our topological localisation system over the course of many repeat forays using the largest radar-focused mobile autonomy dataset released to date, totalling 280 km of urban driving, a small portion of which we also use to learn the weights of the modified architecture. As this work represents a novel application for FMCW radar, we analyse the utility of the proposed method via a comprehensive set of metrics which provide insight into the efficacy when used in a realistic system, showing improved performance over the root architecture even in the face of random rotational perturbation.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.09438", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3003096526", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16588111", "51987374", "131778425", "198189208", "197645882", "202539999", "17969052", "14700600", "4805033", "54217283", "215570800", "34743138", "2596787", "13091446", "8915893", "380003", "206767722", "14124313", "1935003", "3888143", "53416878", "206592766", "10808461", "202122594", "3681715", "161232122", "198189052"], "inbound_citations": ["212645939", "212644726", "211677234", "215238873"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210920352"}

How to determine frailty in cardiac patients, particularly TAVR candidates, has been difficult to objectively quantify. The purpose of this research was to statistically measure which outcome tool most accurately depicted frailty in patients who underwent TAVR. Our study was performed based on the comparison between two approaches: the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), which is the current national assessment standard conducted, and the Fried scale, which tests five frailty domains: gait speed, grip strength, low physical activity, exhaustion, and weight loss. Each domain of the Fried scale was explored and compared alongside the KCCQ with those frail/not frail to the TAVR patients with complications and deaths. Low physical activity was the strongest single-frailty domain predictor. Three statistical models \u2013 Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were used to build classification systems to predict complication conditions. Comparing static numbers, such as Sensitivity, Specificity and Area under Curve (AUC), it is believed that composed models based on the five domains of the Fried scale were able to demonstrate more accurate results than the traditional KCCQ approach.

We and others have described the use of two-class machine learning to identify novel miRNAs. These methods require the generation of an artificial negative class. However, designation of the negative class can be problematic and if it is not properly done can affect the performance of the classifier dramatically and/or yield a biased estimate of performance. We present a study using one-class machine learning for microRNA (miRNA) discovery and compare one-class to two-class approaches using na\u00efve Bayes and Support Vector Machines. These results are compared to published two-class miRNA prediction approaches. We also examine the ability of the one-class and two-class techniques to identify miRNAs in newly sequenced species. Of all methods tested, we found that 2-class naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines gave the best accuracy using our selected features and optimally chosen negative examples. One class methods showed average accuracies of 70\u201380% versus 90% for the two 2-class methods on the same feature sets. However, some one-class methods outperform some recently published two-class approaches with different selected features. Using the EBV genome as and external validation of the method we found one-class machine learning to work as well as or better than a two-class approach in identifying true miRNAs as well as predicting new miRNAs. One and two class methods can both give useful classification accuracies when the negative class is well characterized. The advantage of one class methods is that it eliminates guessing at the optimal features for the negative class when they are not well defined. In these cases one-class methods can be superior to two-class methods when the features which are chosen as representative of that positive class are well defined.

Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that (1) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes/neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes/neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc.). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; (2) ELM is proposed for both generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward network and multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks (including biological neural networks); (3) homogeneous architecture-based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary/multi-class) classification. (4) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks either.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-015-9333-0", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2098290011", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1713804", "5117817", "12450925", "1417306", "877929", "1444592", "685382", "52874011", "207579947", "63335153", "15634112", "206089312", "15037168", "15589402", "2891159", "4349257", "1146461", "19445927", "9550554", "119354536", "18076010", "16907717", "206757279", "206769720", "8907667", "618769", "6110213", "18891084", "198910286", "16192658", "2727398", "15757500", "11124791", "15977147", "19290058", "19956205", "116858", "14381644", "13039271", "5516512", "25316827", "8715388", "3686496", "1087262", "5985333"], "inbound_citations": ["4678552", "77387389", "59604341", "13207519", "881524", "15216119", "56415471", "52166923", "195750782", "52985823", "56173842", "86859064", "5170601", "29831699", "55708407", "15212843", "201319397", "4345183", "210714223", "10555302", "52933652", "53565993", "27664456", "16204111", "7679252", "5348786", "44034360", "125483908", "49862522", "59232267", "196636980", "34266534", "21659244", "6219369", "108341127", "52932395", "53339243", "208329543", "12691358", "57513846", "5464760", "11650019", "24383372", "63756500", "52988144", "211988821", "53718704", "12505818", "16374652", "102486846", "52007721", "209487700", "204794393", "214667024", "20191274", "64749533", "10906016", "3550271", "4567842", "1411612", "46971492", "214820048", "52987855", "21189307", "15596239", "16139620", "10756964", "6953318", "20220120", "5679801", "58330688", "14509243", "55541315", "4229815", "209853618", "44065423", "17394996", "10267500", "35590603", "12020462", "57190317", "36138556", "30924343", "49419775", "22690605", "24684261", "19261123", "126348825", "212409061", "33091508", "4741490", "31264637", "1803922", "201676097", "58556964", "270344", "52908453", "210148979", "21937841", "52187832", "113839837", "454884", "10712184", "67392652", "8575955", "11634634", "88460427", "24343607", "18456885", "90244920", "202671943", "202570040", "68180698", "21712523", "52842097", "58950132", "15656690", "69519147", "25730785", "52910113", "14243680", "46973040", "33748323", "6000514", "18490249", "21541356", "52926154", "51977363", "9866416", "52229338", "12859200", "47748466", "795927", "17277450", "25354586", "1655107", "58674162", "12012832", "935211", "53422779", "18062091", "201145630", "5028009", "367580", "70121200", "6549308", "3871225", "58768414", "33492707", "52982570", "12881533", "73444946", "43762336", "215107431", "13306710", "52023023", "52284489", "26258096", "16645380", "58821882", "53302812", "189824802", "3781857", "210176362", "52109873", "4406424"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13936498"}

In this paper, we are interested in a more challenging task of discriminating sounds produced by the same percussion instrument. Specifically, sounds from different drums cymbals types. Cymbals are known to have indefinite pitch, nonlinear and chaotic behavior. We also identify how the sound of a specific cymbal was produced (e.g., roll or choke movements performed by a drummer). We achieve an accuracy of 96.59% for cymbal type classification and 91.54% in a classification problem with 12 classes which represent the cymbal type and the manner or region that the cymbals are struck.

Firstly, singular value decomposition (SVD) was applied to filter the current signal and then the high-dimensional fault features were constructed by extracting IMPE, the wavelet packet energy and the wavelet packet energy-entropy.

In the proposed system, we divide first the whole image into local regions and employ multiple CNNs to learn local object features.

To characterise the phenology, eight vitality and phenology-related vegetation parameters like leaf area index (LAI), Chl-SPAD content, C-content, N-content, C/N-content, canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), gravimetric water content (GWC) and vegetation height at the same time as all imaging hyperspectral measurements (AISA-EAGLE, 395\u2013973 nm). These biochemical\u2013biophysical vegetation parameters were investigated according to the different phenological macro-stages of barley. The predictive models were developed using four different types of vegetation indices (VI): (I) published VI\u2019s, (II) reflectance VI\u2019s as well as (III) VI (xy) formula combinations and (IV) a combination of all VI index types using the Library for Support Vector Machines (LibSVM) and tested with a recursive conditional correlation weighting selection algorithm (RCCW) to reduce the number of variables. To increase the performance of the model a 10-fold cross-validation was carried out for all statistical models. The GWC was found to be the most important variable for differentiating between the phenological macro-stages of barley. The most suitable model for predicting the phenological BBCH macro-stages was achieved by a model that combined all three kinds of VI\u2019s: published VI\u2019s, reflectance VI\u2019s and formula combination VI\u2019s with a classification accuracy of 84.80%. With the classification model for the reflectance VI\u2019s Y = 746 nm and for the VI formula combinations Y = (527 + 612) nm and Y = (540 + 639) nm. The best predictive model was applied to the airborne AISA-EAGLE hyperspectral data to model the phenological macro-stages of barley at the landscape level. The classification error of the best predictive model of 12.80% as well as disturbance factors such as channels and areas with weeds or ruderal vegetation lead to misclassifications of BBCH macro-stages at the landscape level. By using One Sensor At Different Scales-Approach (OSADIS), sensor-specific differences in the model building and model transfer can be eliminated. The approach described in the paper for determining the phenology based on imaging hyperspectral RS data shows that in the process of plant phonological development a number of biochemical\u2013biophysical vegetation traits in vegetation change, which can be thoroughly recorded with hyperspectral remote sensing technology. For this reason, hyperspectral RS constitutes an ideal, cost-effective and comparable approach, with whose help vegetation traits and changes can be quantified, which are key for ecological modelling.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.10.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Modelling", "mag_id": "2058890801", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["59061515", "7565259", "132531844", "2990420", "4504004", "44500487", "204757742", "20756458", "427994"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85311556"}

In this paper, based on the traditional statistical analysis literature, we propose a machine-learning ocean hydrological data processing process under big data. At the same time, based on the traditional pycnocline gradient determination method, the open Argo data set is analyzed, and the local characteristics of pycnocline are verified from several aspects combined with the current research about pycnocline. Most importantly, in this paper, the combination of kernel function and support vector machine(SVM) is extended to nonlinear learning by using the idea of machine learning and convex optimization technology. Based on this, the known pycnocline training set is trained, and an accurate model is obtained to predict the pycnocline in unknown domains. In the specific steps, this paper combines the classification problem with the regression problem, and determines the proportion of training set and test formula set by polynomial regression. Subsequently, the feature scaling of the input data accelerated the gradient convergence, and a grid search algorithm with variable step size was proposed to determine the super parameter c and gamma of the SVM model. The prediction results not only used the confusion matrix to analyze the accuracy of GridSearch-SVM with variable step size, but also compared the traditional SVM and the similar algorithm.

There is a body of literature which tries to address this challenge. We created a more expansive survey of the task by experimenting with different models and adding new loss functions to improve results. We created a database of pairs of satellite images and the corresponding map of the area. Our model translates the satellite image to the corresponding standard layer map image using three main model architectures: (i) a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which compresses the images down to a learned embedding, (ii) a generator which is trained as a normalizing flow (RealNVP) model, and (iii) a conditional GAN where the generator translates via a series of convolutions to the standard layer of a map and the discriminator input is the concatenation of the real/generated map and the satellite image. Model (iii) was by far the most promising of three models. To improve the results we also added a reconstruction loss and style transfer loss in addition to the GAN losses. The third model architecture produced the best quality of sampled images. In contrast to the other generative model where evaluation of the model is a challenging problem. since we have access to the real map for a given satellite image, we are able to assign a quantitative metric to the quality of the generated images in addition to inspecting them visually. While we are continuing to work on increasing the accuracy of the model, one challenge has been the coarse resolution of the data which upper-bounds the quality of the results of our model. Nevertheless, as will be seen in the results, the generated map is more accurate in the features it produces since the generator architecture demands a pixel-wise image translation/pixel-wise coloring.

The CSLU toolkit [3] is a research and development software environment that provides a powerful and flexible tool for research in the field of spoken language understanding. ::: ::: The objective of this paper is to design a hybrid Fuzzy HMM (FHMM) system for Arabic speech recognition. This system is based on a novel Hidden Markov Model with fuzzy logic and fuzzy integral theory. In this context, the fuzzy integral is used to relax the independence assumptions that are necessary with probability functions. Interestingly, it should be noted that one particular case in the choice of fuzzy integral (the Choquet integral), fuzzy measure (probability measure), and fuzzy intersection operator (multiplication), reduces the generalized fuzzy HMM to the classical HMM. The traditional HMM and the proposed Fuzzy HMM systems were implemented by computer simulation and a performance comparison was carried out. ::: ::: It is noticed that, there are some improvements in recognition accuracy in case of the Fuzzy HMM (FHMM) system over the classical HMM recognition system. The FHMM recognition system accuracy varies from 93.36% to 98.36% depending on the data set used whereas the classical HMM' accuracy varies from 91.27% to 94.60% for the same data sets.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/NRSC.2006.386371", "venue": "Proceedings of the Twenty Third National Radio Science Conference (NRSC'2006)", "journal": "Proceedings of the Twenty Third National Radio Science Conference (NRSC'2006)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2143184768,2036606449", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61280758", "1308710", "13618539", "1911109", "98493388", "20400548"], "inbound_citations": ["15560876", "14673562", "16843594"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15984736"}

Near infrared spectroscopy is a new method which is used to solve the problems effectively. However, the coal samples spectra had the features of high dimension, redundancy and noise. Also the data set was small and imbalanced. Therefore, this study chose Random Forest (RF) algorithm as the basic modeling algorithm. Besides, the K-means algorithm was introduced to improve the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome imbalanced data set. A comparison of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the RF model and the improved RF model indicated that the improved RF model reached an overall accuracy of 97.92%, a G-mean value of 0.9696, and an average voting rate of 83.09%. These results were 6.25%, 7.03%, 6.94% higher than the counterparts of RF model respectively. Simultaneously, they were 8.34% and 5.86% higher than SVM model in accuracy and G-mean. The results suggested that the improved RF model produced reliable accuracy, validity and stability. Its results were conformed to the analysis of the coal-forming factors. Consequently, the algorithm is applicable to identify the geographic origin of coal rapidly.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.infrared.2018.05.018", "venue": null, "journal": "Infrared Physics & Technology", "mag_id": "2803125750", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198165988"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125510919"}

The aim of this study was twofold. First, to use a multiple regression normalization strategy that accounts for subject age, height, body mass, gender, and self-selected walking speed to identify differences in spatial-temporal gait features between PD patients and controls; and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning strategies in classifying PD gait after gait normalization. Spatial-temporal gait data during self-selected walking were obtained from 23 PD patients and 26 aged-matched controls. Data were normalized using standard dimensionless equations and multiple regression normalization. Machine learning strategies were then employed to classify PD gait using the raw gait data, data normalized using dimensionless equations, and data normalized using the multiple regression approach. After normalizing data using the dimensionless equations, only stride length, step length, and double support time were significantly different between PD patients and controls ( p < 0.05); however, normalizing data using the multiple regression method revealed significant differences in stride length, cadence, stance time, and double support time. Random Forest resulted in a PD classification accuracy of 92.6% after normalizing gait data using the multiple regression approach, compared to 80.4% (support vector machine) and 86.2% (kernel Fisher discriminant) using raw data and data normalized using dimensionless equations, respectively.

Recent literature dealing with power quality establishes that support vector machine methods generally outperform traditional statistical and neural methods in classification problems involving power disturbance signals. However, the two vital issues namely the determination of the most appropriate feature subset and the model selection, if suitably addressed, could pave way for further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy and computation time. This paper addresses these issues through a classification system using two optimization techniques, the genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. This system detects the best discriminative features and estimates the best SVM kernel parameters in a fully automatic way. Effectiveness of the proposed detection method is shown in comparison with the conventional parameter optimization methods discussed in literature like grid search method, neural classifiers like Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classifier (FkNN) and hence proved that the proposed method is reliable as it produces consistently better results.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2011.08.010", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2012315090", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3675378", "203605488", "56048916", "203708844", "2978255", "56470042", "139108521", "49187219", "42097742", "119188683", "199438757", "14393017", "49573429", "49553892", "25232329", "198146543", "12311479", "15543082", "18212711"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33581646"}

GPD is more effective in encoding pose similarity by utilizing features on geometric relations among body parts, as well as temporal information such as velocities and accelerations. Based on GPD, we propose a semisupervised distance metric learning algorithm called Regularized Distance Metric Learning with Sparse Representation (RDSR), which integrates information from both unsupervised data relationship and labels.

To this end, we present an algorithm that allows a robot to make active requests to incremen-tally learn movement primitives. A movement primitive is learned on a trajectory output by a Gaussian Process. The latter is used as a library of demonstrations that can be extrapolated with confidence margins. This combination not only allows the robot to generalize using as few as a single demonstration but more importantly , to indicate when such generalization can be executed with confidence or not.

Second, we employ domain adversarial learning to eliminate the influence of domain difference between real 2D face images and 3D synthetic face images at feature level, which realizes a one-stage deep FER approach that is robust to different face poses.

In this paper, polarization and spectral information based on imagery is firstly acquired by spectropolarimeter imaging system. And then features that can represent polarization and spectral information, namely reflectance spectrum and degree of polarization spectrum, are extracted from imagery acquired respectively. As our built spectropolarimeter imaging system contains 33 bands at the range from 400 to 720nm, we proposed a custom band selection scheme which calculates the Euclidean distance of these two extracted features at each band, and select the bands which are respect to the former larger distances to achieve dimensional reduction. The reduced two features are inputted to Support Vector Machines respectively, and the degrees of membership belongs to each classes are assigned. Finally, we integrate these two features through fusion in the decision level using D-S theory. To highlight the advantages of jointly utilization of polarization and spectral information, classification results based on digital number (DN) value and any one single feature are compared to.

To achieve this goal, we introduce supervised multiview canonical correlation analysis (sMVCCA), a novel data fusion method that attempts to find a common representation for multiscale, multimodal data where class separation is maximized while noise is minimized. In doing so, sMVCCA assumes that the different sources of information are complementary and thereby act synergistically when combined.

There is consequently a strong need for highly efficient search tools for EO image databases and for search methods to automatically identify and recognize structures within EO images. Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) and automatic image annotation systems have been designed to tackle the problem of image retrieval in large image databases. These two systems achieve a common goal, that is to learn the mapping function between low-level visual features and high-level image semantics. A setup, which has hardly been explored in annotating systems and which is the rule rather than the exception, is the case when the training database used to learn the mapping function is not exhaustive regarding semantic classes present in the images. This means that there exists unknown image classes for which there is no training examples in the training database. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method for auto-annotating satellite image databases and discovering unknown semantic image classes in these databases. The idea is to incorporate into the learning process the unannotated data which by definition contain the unknown image classes. The latter are considered to be latent structures in the data that appear when we train a hierarchical latent variable model with both the labeled and unlabeled data. We also show that, in our case, the use of unlabeled data leads to more reliable estimates regarding the model parameters. We present experimental results on a synthetic dataset, making a comparison of our algorithm with a semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM) on this dataset. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our unknown image classes discovery procedure on a database of SPOT5 satellite images.

The white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes (a species complex) is currently classified by the IUCN Red List as an endangered species (EN), because its populations have decreased significantly over the last decades in a number of European countries including Italy, due mainly to habitat modifications and the introduction and spread of alien species. Data on the ecological requirements of A. pallipes are needed to quantify the effects of habitat alteration, to simulate restoration scenarios, and to implement effective conservation measures for this species. We describe here a new methodology for modelling the habitat requirements for this endangered crayfish using the mesohabitat scale approach based on data from crayfish living in small streams draining the Italian foothills of the Alps (Lombardy region) and in streams in the mountainous areas of the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park (Abruzzo region). Data from seven morphologically different streams were used to train and validate the habitat models. The Random Forests algorithm was used to identify the best and most parsimonious habitat model, and to define the lowest number of variables to be surveyed in the future. The best habitat models were applied to each stream and used to classify each mesohabitat into suitability categories. Habitat flow-rating curves were developed to analyze spatio-temporal variation of habitat availability, and habitat time series analysis were used to define detailed management schemes for environmental river management. Flow releases and water temperature regimes were assessed for individual water diversions in order (1) to represent how physical habitat changes through time, and (2) to identify stress conditions for A. pallipes created by the persistent limitation of habitat availability. Results indicated that the kind of substrate in the stream bed (such as the proportion of fine-grained substrates), the water depth (whether shallow or deep), and the available cover (such as the presence of boulders, woody debris, and undercut banks) were all significant factors governing the occurrence of crayfish. The habitat models performed well in both calibration and validation phases (with accuracy ranging from 71 to 79 % in training and from 69 to 73 % in validation) and can be considered to be a valuable tool to predict the distribution of A. pallipes over a wide range of stream types. An example of how to establish environmental standards for small streams is presented. The proposed habitat model provides a useful tool that can be applied even when other commonly used methodologies are unsuitable.

Airborne topographic lidar has become an established technique to characterize the Earth surface. Lidar provides 3D point clouds allowing for fine reconstruction of ground topography while preserving high frequencies of the relief: fine Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) is the key product. This paper addresses the problem of road detection and characterization in forested environments over large scales (>1000 km 2 ). For that purpose, an efficient pipeline is proposed, which assumes that main forest roads can be modeled as planar elongated features in the road direction with relief variation in orthogonal direction. DTMs are the only input and no complex 3D point cloud processing methods are involved. First, a restricted but carefully designed set of morphological features is defined as input for a supervised Random Forest classification of potential road patches. Then, a graph is built over these candidate regions: vertices are selected using stochastic geometry tools and edges are created in order to fill gaps in the DTM created by vegetation occlusion. The graph is pruned using morphological criteria derived from the input road model. Finally, once the road is located in 2D, its width and slope are retrieved using an object-based image analysis. We demonstrate that our road model is valid for most forest roads and that roads are correctly retrieved (>80%) with few erroneously detected pathways (10\u201315%) using fully automatic methods. The full pipeline takes less than 2 min per km 2 and higher planimetric accuracy than 2D existing topographic databases are achieved. Compared to these databases, additional roads can be detected with the ability of lidar sensors to penetrate the understory. In case of very dense vegetation and insufficient relief in the DTM, gaps may exist in the results resulting in local incompleteness (\u223c15%).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2015.12.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2215238821", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["14696488", "59795495", "14906084", "89141", "122317252", "14196694", "6666034", "129795165", "154389722", "63115125", "19015375", "134776458", "4849769", "11633435", "18005327", "7083615", "8845468", "4639776", "2351640", "129576563", "9752488", "57254450", "31131036", "16265378", "5951823", "42367542", "3556236", "9448393", "121086451", "83469865", "5092351", "128571713", "13324291", "12862305", "129877635", "500928", "3350496", "122361167", "130093819", "6763530", "16002840", "53684091"], "inbound_citations": ["13827274", "39756076", "54727950", "3908420", "66052617", "125428168", "135042926", "201741291", "46613145"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123746244"}

SERS has been proven useful for disease detection from a medium such as a cell, serum, urine, plasma, saliva, tears. The spectra displayed are noisy and complicated by the presence of other molecules, besides the targeted one.

Most deep learning approaches to domain adaptation consist of two steps: (i) learn features that preserve a low risk on labeled samples (source domain) and (ii) make the features from both domains to be as indistinguishable as possible, so that a classifier trained on the source can also be applied on the target domain. In general, the classifiers in step (i) consist of fully-connected layers applied directly on the indistinguishable features learned in (ii). In this paper, we propose a different way to do the classification, using similarity learning. The proposed method learns a pairwise similarity function in which classification can be performed by computing similarity between prototype representations of each category. The domain-invariant features and the categorical prototype representations are learned jointly and in an end-to-end fashion.

Identification of host genes associated with infectious diseases will improve our understanding about the mechanisms behind their development and help to identify novel therapeutic targets. We developed a machine learning techniques-based classification approach to identify infectious disease-associated host genes by integrating sequence and protein interaction network features. Among different methods, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model with 16 selected features for pseudo-amino acid composition (PAAC) and network properties achieved the highest accuracy of 86.33% with sensitivity of 85.61% and specificity of 86.57%. The DNN classifier also attained an accuracy of 83.33% on a blind dataset and a sensitivity of 83.1% on an independent dataset. Furthermore, to predict unknown infectious disease-associated host genes, we applied the proposed DNN model to all reviewed proteins from the database. Seventy-six out of 100 highly-predicted infectious disease-associated genes from our study were also found in experimentally-verified human-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Finally, we validated the highly-predicted infectious disease-associated genes by disease and gene ontology enrichment analysis and found that many of them are shared by one or more of the other diseases, such as cancer, metabolic and immune related diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational method to identify infectious disease-associated host genes. The proposed method will help large-scale prediction of host genes associated with infectious-diseases. However, our results indicated that for small datasets, advanced DNN-based method does not offer significant advantage over the simpler supervised machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Random Forest (RF) for the prediction of infectious disease-associated host genes. Significant overlap of infectious disease with cancer and metabolic disease on disease and gene ontology enrichment analysis suggests that these diseases perturb the functions of the same cellular signaling pathways and may be treated by drugs that tend to reverse these perturbations.

It is challenging task to transform SVM to solve multiclass problems like classifying chest X-ray images based on the lung zone location. Classified X-ray images improved image retrieval hence reducing time taken to assessed back the images. Realizing this difficulties, therefore, we proposed an application method for multiclass classification using SVM kernel to classify chest X-ray images based on nodule location in lung zones. The multiclass classification experiment is performed using four popular SVM kernels namely linear, polynomial, radial based function (RBF) and sigmoid. Overall, we obtained high classification accuracy (>90%) for three classifiers that are RBF, polynomial and linear kernel while sigmoid kernel classifier is only moderately good at 82.7% accuracy. Besides, values in the confusion matrices revealed that the RBF and polynomial classifiers managed to classify test data into all classification classes. Conversely, classifiers based on linear and sigmoid kernel have missed at least one classification class. Since each classifier work differently based on their kernel types, we noticed that it is better to view them as a complimentary rather than treating them as competing options. This condition also revealed that we can modify the original SVM classification method to handle multiclass classification problem.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering", "mag_id": "2597091454", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63261079"}

The traditional heuristic methods and the tentative methods cannot solve this problems radically. This paper, with the idea of information fusion, proposes a two-layer SVM classifier model to improve the precision of the classification. In this paper, four different groups of input features are built based on the heuristic knowledge of different angles to form four weak classifiers. By taking these four weak classifiers as the sub-classifiers, a fusional SVM is built to fuse the results of the sub-classifiers in a manner of regression, whose result is taken as the final judgment result. Simulation results on the IEEE 39-BUS and IEEE 145BUS test system show that the classification performance of the weak classifiers is evidently strengthened after fusion, and that the result after the fusion is more precise than any of the single results and the result including all the input features at once.

The Combi-QSAR approach explores all possible combinations of different independent descriptor collections and various individual correlation methods to obtain statistically significant models with high internal (for the training set) and external (for the test set) accuracy. Seven different descriptor collections were generated with commercially available MOE, CoMFA, CoMMA, Dragon, VolSurf, and MolconnZ programs; we also included chirality topological descriptors recently developed in our laboratory (Golbraikh, A.; Bonchev, D.; Tropsha, A. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2001, 41, 147-158). CoMMA descriptors were used in combination with MOE descriptors. MolconnZ descriptors were used in combination with chirality descriptors. Each descriptor collection was combined individually with four correlation methods, including k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification, Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, and binary QSAR, giving rise to 28 different types of QSAR models. Multiple diverse and representative training and test sets were generated by the divisions of the original data set in two. Each model with high values of leave-one-out cross-validated correct classification rate for the training set was subjected to extensive internal and external validation to avoid overfitting and achieve reliable predictive power. Two validation techniques were employed, i.e., the randomization of the target property (in this case, odor intensity) also known as the Y-randomization test and the assessment of external prediction accuracy using test sets. We demonstrate that not every combination of the data modeling technique and the descriptor collection yields a validated and predictive QSAR model. kNN classification in combination with CoMFA descriptors was found to be the best QSAR approach overall since predictive models with correct classification rates for both training and test sets of 0.7 and higher were obtained for all divisions of the ambergris data set into the training and test sets. Many predictive QSAR models were also found using a combination of kNN classification method with other collections of descriptors. The combinatorial QSAR affords automation, computational efficiency, and higher probability of identifying significant QSAR models for experimental data sets than the traditional approaches that rely on a single QSAR method.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "15032539", "doi": "10.1021/ci034203t", "venue": "J.

For these methods to be useful it is important that users can both choose the best model from the hundreds to thousands of models that are commonly generated for a target, and determine whether this model is likely to be correct. We have developed Random Forest Quality Assessment (RFQAmodel), which assesses whether models produced by a protein structure prediction pipeline have the correct fold. RFQAmodel uses a combination of existing quality assessment scores with two predicted contact map alignment scores. These alignment scores are able to identify correct models for targets that are not otherwise captured. Our classifier was trained on a large set of protein domains that are structurally diverse and evenly balanced in terms of protein features known to have an effect on modelling success, and then tested on a second set of 244 protein domains with a similar spread of properties. When models for each target in this second set were ranked according to the RFQAmodel score, the highest-ranking model had a high-confidence RFQAmodel score for 67 modelling targets, of which 52 had the correct fold. At the other end of the scale RFQAmodel correctly predicted that for 59 targets the highest-ranked model was incorrect. In comparisons to other methods we found that RFQAmodel is better able to identify correct models for targets where only a few of the models are correct. We found that RFQAmodel achieved a similar performance on the model sets for CASP12 and CASP13 free-modelling targets.

Although ultrasound imaging is widely used in developed countries, its availability in limited-resource settings has been dependent on device portability, associated costs, and trained healthcare workers. In recent years, as ultrasound equipment has become cheaper and portable its availability in limited-resource settings has expanded with promising trends. Yet a major constraint of ultrasound imaging is the steep learning curve to reach scanning proficiency, rendering the process challenging for inexperienced users. This thesis presents methods towards addressing the fundamental task of empowering novice sonographers to perform targeted diagnostic screening to the same level as experienced ultrasonographers. This is of particular relevance to low-resource settings where pregnant women may not be able to attend specialist obstetric care centres during their pregnancy. We address this task by introducing simplified scanning protocols and using computer vision and machine learning techniques. While aimed at low-income country healthcare needs, the research is also equally applicable to needs of developed world. Firstly, an original framework for automatic detection of frames of interest in ultrasound videos is presented. Furthermore, the merits of pre-processing images on classification accuracy, on datasets of variable size, is investigated. To this end, a classification framework for 2D ultrasound frames based on the improved Fisher vector encoding of SIFT and LP-SIFT features has been introduced. Additionally a Structured Random Forests edge detection framework is introduced for an accurate structure representation in 2D ultrasound data. Secondly, a novel framework based on video dynamics and motion patterns is presented for automatic detection of sequences of interest in real world ultrasound videos. To illustrate clinical applicability, this approach is applied to automatically identify the fetal presentation in the womb, during the third trimester of pregnancy from a predefined freehand ultrasound video sweep. A kernel dynamical textures model is utilised to model the dynamics of video sub-sequences that contain a fetal skull and those sequences that do not. A similarity kernel is then constructed between the model parameters to train a classifier. A classification accuracy of 93p was achieved using this framework. Thirdly, for the first time, the real world application of automatic analysis of predefined ultrasound videos to detect the fetal presentation and heartbeat is considered. For this application, the frames of interest are initially identified using a frame-by-frame classification framework. Moreover, a linear-chain structured graphical model is used to take into account the temporal information in the 2D predefined sweeps and to regularise the classification results. Consecutive frames of the fetal heart are further investigated for the presence of the heartbeat activity. Classification accuracy achieved using our method was about 88p. Finally, potential future directions are investigated and initial findings have been reported. These include results on a small pilot study specifically designed to perform a statistical comparison between images obtained from a standard mid-range ultrasound probe and a low-end portable ultrasound probe. Moreover, the efficacy of using a deep convolutional neural network with transfer learning is investigated and initial findings are reported.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2902291322", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69856644"}
