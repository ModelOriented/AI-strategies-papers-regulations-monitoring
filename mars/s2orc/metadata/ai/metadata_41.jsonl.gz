However, existing deep metric learning loss functions such as contrastive loss and triplet loss usually rely on delicately selected samples (pairs or triplets) for fast convergence. In this paper, we propose a new deep metric learning loss function, tuplet margin loss, using randomly selected samples from each mini-batch. Specifically, the proposed tuplet margin loss implicitly up-weights hard samples and down-weights easy samples, while a slack margin in angular space is introduced to mitigate the problem of overfitting on the hardest sample. Furthermore, we address the problem of intra-pair variation by disentangling class-specific information to improve the generalizability of tuplet margin loss.

In particular, we apply kernel variants of two typical methods, i.e., the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Metric Learning to Rank (MLR), to demonstrate the flexibility of the framework.

Cover-abundance data of woody species were collected in 330 georeferenced releves across the Park. These data were used to produce two matrices: the first one using the cover-abundance values as collected in five height layers and the second one based on merging the layers into a single cover value for each species. Automatic classifications were produced for both matrices to determine the optimal number of vegetation types. The two classification approaches both produced 14 types belonging to three macro-groups: mopane, miombo and alluvial woodlands. The results of the two classifications were compared looking at the constant, dominant and diagnostic species of each type. The classification based on separate layers was considered more effective and retained. A high-resolution map of the potential distribution of vegetation types for the whole study area was produced using Random Forest. In the model, the relationship between bioclimatic and topographic variables, known to be correlated to vegetation types, and the classified releves was used. Identified vegetation types were compared with those of other national parks within the GLTFCA, and an evaluation of the main threats and pressures was conducted. Conservation implications: Vegetation classification and mapping are useful tools for multiple purposes including: surveying and monitoring plant and animal populations, communities and their habitats, and development of management and conservation strategies.

At the same time, the volume and global scope of digital game telemetry data has opened up new experimental opportunities for studying human behavior at large scales. Prior research has demonstrated that a relation exists between learning rates and performance. Although many factors might contribute to this correlation at least one may be the presence of innate cognitive resources, as demonstrated in recent work relating IQ and performance in a Multi-player Online Battle Arena game. Here, we extend this work by examining the relationship between early learning rate and long term performance using a 400,000 player longitudinal dataset generated by new players of the widely-played MOBA League of Legends. We observed that the learning rate of new players in a competitive season explains a significant amount of variance in the performance at the end of the year. This analysis was then extended by training two multivariate classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for predicting players who by the end of the season would be considered masters (top 0.05%), based on their performance in the first 10 matches of the same season. Both classifiers performed similarly (ROC AUC 0.888 for Logistic Regression, 0.878 for Random Forest), extending the time frame for skill prediction in games based on a relatively sparse sample of early data.

Several of his preliminary experiments in some typical problems demonstrated that the classifier has an excellent performance when compared to other statistical and machine learning approaches. However, up to now there has been little further work reported pertaining to its improvements or applications. As a result, this research extends the initial work by examining its potential improvements and applicability in a new real world task such as the protein secondary structure prediction. In order to reduce the computational demand when training with large data of proteins, an interface was developed using the data parallel approach to parallelize the training phase of the classifier and other accompanying methods such as data clustering algorithms. The parallelized classifier also permitted rigorous experiments to be conducted in two other benchmark problems with disparate dimensions to determine the classifier's inherent attributes and drawbacks. The experiments showed that although the classifier performed better than some of the best methods such as Support Vector Machines and Kernel Fisher Discriminants in the small dimensional problem (dimension size = 9), its performance deteriorated significantly in the higher dimensional problem (dimension size = 60). This presented a substantial challenge because the secondary structure prediction exhibits high dimensionality as well. An improved version of the classifier was designed by introducing Multilayer Perceptrons to replace the distance measure of the classifier, which appeared to be impaired in high dimensions. The results of the secondary structure prediction demonstrated that the new classifier performed better than the original one. Moreover, at the level of sequence-to-structure prediction, its performance was comparable to the PHD (Profile network from Heidelberg) method, which is one of the best secondary structure prediction schemes.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "144473077", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2195799", "21057591"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53836829"}

They fail to consider the fact that an image represented in the plane is intrinsically a matrix, and pixels spatially close to each other may probably be correlated. Even though we have n 1 \u00d7 n 2 pixels per image, this spatial correlation suggests the real number of freedom is far less. In this paper, we introduce a regularized metric learning framework, Two-Dimensional Smooth Metric Learning (2DSML), which uses a discretized Laplacian penalty to restrict the coefficients to be two-dimensional smooth. Many existing metric learning algorithms can fit into this framework and learn a spatially smooth metric which is better for image applications than their original version.

This research aims to explore and compare the process of constructing common predictive models. Models based on an artificial neural network (the connectionist approach) and binary logistic regressions were compared in their ability to classifying malnourished subjects and those with over-weighted participants in rural areas of Bangladesh. Subjects were classified according to the indicator of nutritional status measured by body mass index (BMI). This study also investigated the effects of different factors on the BMI level of a sample population of 460 adults of six villages in Bangladesh. Demographic, enthropometric and clinical data were collected based on a total of 460 participants aged over 30 years from six villages in Bangladesh that were identified as mainly dependent on wells contaminated with arsenic. Out of 460(140 male and 320 females) participants 186(40.44%) were identified as malnourished (BMI 18.5 gm). Among other factors, arsenic exposures were found as significant risk factors for low body mass index (BMI) with a higher value of odds ratio.

The input image is filtered to reduce the noise in the preprocessing phase. In the second phase, Bounding Box (BB) is used to identify/locate the tumor region in the filtered image. Subsequently, in the third phase, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the exact tumor location. Finally, the brain tumor is localized absolutely by the proposed tumor detection method. Moreover, the proposed method is evaluated with the publicly available standard dataset and compared with a contemporary method. The experimental results concluded that the proposed method has higher tumor detection accuracy than the existing method.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-8204-7_6", "venue": "Innovations in Electronics and Communication Engineering", "journal": "Innovations in Electronics and Communication Engineering", "mag_id": "2889440533", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125887037"}

CINs include DNA copy number alterations (CNAs), i.e., regions of aberrantly increased or decreased DNA. For this reason, it is a challenge to identify both the regions that have CNAs and the genes whose expression could be deregulated (i.e., increased or decreased) because of gain or loss of their copies. In this paper we focus on the role of copy number alteration in assessing prognosis of patients with CRC. Specifically, we show that the inference of the CRC progression benefits from exploiting CNA information when a particular relational representation of patients is given. The employed framework outperforms standard approaches where patients are represented through a set of available attributes. Documentation and software are available at http://bimib.disco.unimib.it/people/claudia.cava/soft. The data set for this analysis was provided by IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori Milano (INT) and deposited at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE16125). Methods Tissue specimens from 53 consecutive sporadic CRCs were obtained from previously untreated patients lacking family history and high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI) who underwent surgical resection at the \u201cFondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori\u201d (INT) Milano, between 1998 and 2000. After surgery all patients continued to be treated in INT, where their clinical course was constantly recorded. Tumor specimens containing more than 70% neoplastic cells and their surrounding normal mucosa were selected by an experienced pathologist from cryopreserved tissue and used in a previous study of genetic features associated to colorectal carcinogenesis (Frattini et al, 2004). Microarray production was done following standard protocols by AROS Applied Biotechnology AS (Aarhus, Denmark). 51 DNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipVR Human Mapping 250K NspI (SNP arrays). Raw intensity CEL files of the SNP arrays were processed with CNAG program v.2.0 (Copy-Number Analysis for Affymetrix GeneChips; Santa Clara, CA (Nannya et al, 2005) to detect chromosomal CNAs . Some samples were excluded due to poor quality hybridizations and unknown stage tumor progression (Reid et al, 2009). Also, stage-I patients were excluded because of the lack of instances in the considered data set. The selected cohort can be finally summarized as follows: 10 type-II patients, 10 type-III patients and 23 type-IV patients. In order to quantify relationships between patients expressing the CCR progression, we first define a dissimilarity function over both an \u201cadvanced-stage\u201d patient group and a specific \u201crepresentative\u201d base group e.g., patients with the lowest stage (\u201cprototype\u201d), then we classify patients according to the induced representations. In other words, the considered dissimilarity values quantify, by construction, subject differences due to different CNA information belonging to each subject. While in a \u201cstandard\u201d case-control classification subjects are discriminated on its own set of attribute values, the dissimilarity function D(fx, fy) is given through an estimation of the difference between the obtained CNA mean value frequency distributions fx and fy. In order to give a definition for D which can express dissimilarity between any pair of patients x and y (based on the CNA mean value frequency distribution fx and fy), we employ the symmetrised Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Cover et al, 1991) between any pair of distribution fx and fy. Results and Discussion The first issue of our investigation was to check the capability, for a given standard approach, of distinguishing patient groups. For this, we considered the following case - control study: (i) stage II (as control group) vs stage III (as case group); (ii) stage III (as control group) vs stage IV (as case group); (iii) stage II (as control group) vs stage IV (as case group). All our evaluations employ a class of algorithms widely used in the machine learning community (i.e., the Support Vector Machine (Cristianini et al, 2000) within a k-fold cross-validation process. For the \u201cstandard\u201d case, SVMs are given (input) matrices where patients are represented through the sequence of chromosomes as attributes, and each i-th component of the sequence is given by the CNA mean value associated to the chromosome i. Moreover, all experiments are evaluated by standard indices which are broadly applied in this context to measure the precision and recall capability of an inference system; i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), see for example (Davis et al, 2006). Table 1a) shows the performances when the classifiers are applied to the standard representations as discussed above. The standard approach is not able to discriminate both stage III from stage-IV patients (20% specificity) and stage II from stage-IV patients (30% specificity). On this basis, we used CNAs information to represent patients through dissimilarities as reported above. Table 1b) reports the inference performance when the dissimilarity representation is applied. We obtained substantially better accuracies reporting higher values of performances (>=80%) for the whole set of the applied indices. We showed that even a prediction analysis, concerning the progression of CRC, as characterized by the given staging classification system (Duke), benefits from exploiting CNA information when a specific representation of patients is considered. We point out that, in this work, the choice of a dissimilarity representation (i.e., the KL-divergence) has been addressed to obtain a function providing an estimation of the difference between the obtained CNA mean value frequency distributions for each pair of patients. More specific measures may be tested in future analysis. Interesting questions on these arguments are reported in (Pekalska et al, 2005). Also the choice of a correct prototype set can be critical in this approach, and may change the results being investigated. This is another question which we are immediately interested for future analysis. Here we did not study the best possible prototype set, instead, the rationale for our choice was simply to employ a group of patients with a presumably low number of accumulated alterations. Numerical experiments indicate that the application of the applied representation for the considered data provide high precision and recall performances outperforming typical standard approaches where patients are represented through their set of available attributes. These results clearly suggest broader investigations either on different data sets or different CRC staging classification systems (Horton et al, 2005). References Cover T M, et al.

Uganda was chosen as a case-study because it presents a reliable national biomass reference dataset. As a result of this thesis, aboveground woody biomass for the year circa-2000 was mapped at national scale in Uganda at 30-m spatial resolution on the basis of Landsat ETM+ images, a national land cover dataset and field data using an object-oriented approach. A regression tree-based model (Random Forest) produced good results (cross-validated R\u00b2 0.81, RMSE 13 Mg/ha) when trained with a sufficient number of field plots representative of the vegetation variability. This study demonstrated that in certain contexts Landsat data can effectively spatialize field biomass measurements and produce accurate and detailed estimates of biomass distribution at national scale. This approach tended to provide conservative biomass estimates and its limitations were mainly related to the saturation of the optical signal at high biomass density and to the cloud cover. When compared with the Uganda national biomass dataset, the map produced in this study presented higher agreement than other five regional/global biomass maps. The comparative analysis showed strong disagreement between the products, with estimates of total biomass of Uganda ranging from 343 to 2201 Tg and different spatial distribution patterns.

For this reason, in this work, we look at three statistical factor analysis methods\u2014Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), Chi-Square Factor Optimization, and Gini Importance\u2014to measure the significance of GCFs. From a total of 15 frequently used GCFs, 11 most effective ones (i.e., altitude, slope angle, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, distance from river, distance from fault, river density, fault density, land use, and lithology) were finally selected. In addition, 917 spring locations were identified and used to train and test three machine learning algorithms, namely Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest (RF). The resultant trained models were then applied for groundwater potential prediction and mapping in the Haraz basin of Mazandaran province, Iran. MDA has been successfully applied for soil erosion and landslide mapping, but has not yet been fully explored for groundwater potential mapping (GPM). Although other discriminant methods, such as LDA, exist, MDA is worth exploring due to its capability to model multivariate nonlinear relationships between variables; it also undertakes a mixture of unobserved subclasses with regularization of non-linear decision boundaries, which could potentially provide more accurate classification. For the validation, areas under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) were calculated for the three algorithms.

Then, the best non-dominated solution is selected using a non-zero-sum bi-matrix game with fuzzy goals. In the next step, to have an equitable waste load allocation, some possible coalitions among dischargers are formed and treatment costs are reallocated to discharges and side payments are calculated. To develop probabilistic rules for real-time waste load allocation, the proposed model is applied considering several scenarios of pollution loads and the results are used for training and testing BNs and PSVMs. The applicability and efficiency of the methodology are examined in a real-world case study of the Zarjub River in the northern part of Iran.

Experiments conducted in real-world urban scenarios demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. I. INTRODUCTION Urban environments are complex scenes where often multiple objects interact and move. In order to navigate and understand such environment a robot should be able to detect and track multiple classes of objects: most im- portant pedestrians and cars. The ability to reliably detect these objects in real-world environments is crucial for a wide variety of applications including video surveillance and intelligent driver assistance systems. Pedestrians are partic- ularly difficult to detect because of their high variability in appearance due to clothing, illumination and the fact that the shape characteristics depend on the view point. In addition, occlusions caused by carried items such as backpacks or briefcases, as well as clutter in crowded scenes can render this task even more complex, because they dramatically change the shape of a pedestrian. Cars are large objects that dramatically change their shape with respect to the viewpoint: for example a side view of a car is totally different from its back view. Shape symmetries can easily create false detections and shadows can drive off detection systems. Our goal in this paper is to detect pedestrians and cars and localize them in 3D at any point in time. In particular, we want to provide a position and a motion estimate that can be used in a mobile robotic application. The real- time constraint makes this task particularly difficult and requires faster detection and tracking algorithms than the existing approaches. Our work makes a contribution into this direction. The approach we propose is multimodal in the sense that we use laser range data and images from a camera cooperatively. This has the advantage that both geometrical structure and visual appearance information are available for a more robust detection. Managing detection of multiple classes in laser range data is a complex task due the problem of data segmentation. Often range data is grouped in consistent clusters and then classified, using heuristic rules and therefore creating a strong prior in the algorithm. In this paper, we propose an elegant solution to train and classify range data using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) through the use of a boosted set of features. Moreover each scan point will be labeled with a probability of owning to a certain class. In order to manage occlusions in complex visual scenarios a new extension of the Implicit Shape Model (ISM) for camera data classification has been developed. Finally, each detected object is tracked using a greedy data association method and multiple Extended Kalman Filters that use different motion models. This way, the filter can cope with a variety of different motion patterns for several persons simultaneously. In particular, the major contributions of this work are: \u2022 An improved version of the image-based object detector by Leibe et al. (14). It consists in several extensions to the Implicit Shape Model (ISM) in the training step, in the detection step and in the capability of coping with multiple classes. We introduce an automatic subpart extraction that is used to build an improved hypotheses selection, the concept of superfeatures that define a favorable feature selection that maintaining information richness. Moreover we introduce an automatically gen- erated probability template map to ease the multiclass hypothesis selection. \u2022 The combined use of Conditional Random Fields and camera detection to track objects in the scene.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proc. of the Workshop on Safe Nav. in Open and Dyn.

This has turned attention to machine learning techniques capable of extracting \"symbolic\" descriptions from data. At the cutting-edge of such techniques is Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Given a set of observations and background knowledge encoded as a set of logical descriptions, an ILP system attempts to construct explanations for the observations. The explanations are in the same language as the observations and background knowledge - usually a subset of first-order logic. This contrasts with algorithms like decision-trees, and neural networks which employ simple propositional logic representations. This, along with the flexibility to include background knowledge - which can even include other propositional algorithms - allow a form of data analysis and decision-support that is, in principle, unmatched by first-generation methods. Bio/chemical applications of ILP have largely been concerned with determining \"structure-activity\" relationships (SARs). The task here is to obtain rules that predict the activity of a compound, like toxicity, from its chemical structure. The representation language adopted by ILP systems allows the development of compact, chemist-friendly \"theories\", and ILP systems have progressively been shown to be capable of handling 1, 2, and 3-dimensional descriptions of chemical structure. Empirical results in predicting mutagenicity and carcinogenicity suggest that structure-activity relations found by ILP systems achieve at least the same predictive power of traditional SAR techniques, with fewer limitations (like the need for alignment, pre-determination of structural features etc.) In some cases, they have found novel structural features that significantly improve the predictive capabilities of traditional 1 and 2-dimensional SAR methods.

Introduction A classical machine learner is developed by collecting samples of data to represent the entire population. This data set is usually subdivided into two or more dataset. Part of the dataset set is commonly use for developing the machine learner, and the remaining data is use for evaluation. Often this data set is imbalanced; the data consists of only a very small minority of the data. Imbalanced machine learners tend to perform poorly with the classification of fraud detection, network intrusion, rare disease diagnosing, etc [1, 2]. This is due to imbalanced sampling during developing the machine learner. During the testing phase these rare cases are unseen during the training phase and are usually misclassified. Leo Breiman, a statistician from University of California at Berkeley, developed a machine learning algorithm to improve classification of diverse data using random sampling and attributes selection.

To address this issue, we formulate the downlink channel prediction as a deep transfer learning (DTL) problem, where each learning task aims to predict the downlink CSI from the uplink CSI for one single environment. Specifically, we develop the direct-transfer algorithm based on the fully-connected neural network architecture, where the network is trained on the data from all previous environments in the manner of classical deep learning and is then fine-tuned for new environments. To further improve the transfer efficiency, we propose the meta-learning algorithm that trains the network by alternating inner-task and across-task updates and then adapts to a new environment with a small number of labeled data. Simulation results show that the direct-transfer algorithm achieves better performance than the deep learning algorithm, which implies that the transfer learning benefits the downlink channel prediction in new environments.

In this paper, we introduce a new methodology that combines random forests and active contour model for the automated segmentation of the gliomas from multimodal volumetric MR images. Specifically, we employ a feature representations learning strategy to effectively explore both local and contextual information from multimodal images for tissue segmentation by using modality specific random forests as the feature learning kernels. Different levels of the structural information is subsequently integrated into concatenated and connected random forests for gliomas structure inferring. Finally, a novel multiscale patch driven active contour model is exploited to refine the inferred structure by taking advantage of sparse representation techniques.

In particular, the community detection problem in networks is well-known due to the instances with hundreds to thousands of vertices. In the literature, the heuristics to detect communities in networks that use a local search are those that achieve the partitions with the best solution values.

Furthermore, traditional sequence-to-sequence autoencoders using maximum log-likelihood often require dataset covering all the possible spatiotemporal characteristics to perform well. This is infeasible or impractical in reality. We propose TREP, a practical pedestrian trajectory representation learning algorithm which captures the environmental constraints and the pedestrian dynamics without the need of any training dataset. By formulating a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder with a spatial-aware objective function under the paradigm of actor-critic reinforcement learning, TREP intelligently encodes spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories with the capability of handling diverse trajectory patterns.

Often, the atoms are chosen from a so called over-complete dictionary. Formally, an over-complete dictionary is a collection of atoms such that the number of atoms exceeds the dimension of the signal space, so that any signal can be represented by more than one combination of different atoms. Sparseness is one of the reasons for the extensive use of popular transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform, the wavelet transform and the Singular Value Decomposition. The aim of these transforms is often to reveal certain structures of a signal and to represent these structures using a compact and sparse representation. Sparse representations have therefore increasingly become recognized as providing extremely high performance for applications as diverse as: noise reduction, compression, feature extraction, pattern classification and blind source separation. Sparse representation ideas also build the foundations of wavelet denoising and methods in pattern classification, such as in the Support Vector Machine and the Relevance Vector Machine, where sparsity can be directly related to learnability of an estimator. The technique of finding a representation with a small number of significant coefficients is often referred to as Sparse Coding. Decoding merely requires the summation of the relevant atoms, appropriately weighted. However, unlike a transform coder with its invertible transform, the generation of the sparse representation with an over-complete dictionary is non-trivial. Indeed, the general problem of finding a representation with the smallest number of atoms from an arbitrary dictionary has been shown to be NP-hard. This has led to considerable effort being put into the development of many sub-optimal schemes. These include algorithms that iteratively build up the signal approximation one coefficient at a time, e.g. Matching Pursuit, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and those that process all the coefficients simultaneously, e.g. Basis Pursuit, Basis Pursuit De-Noising and the Focal Underdetermined System Solver family of algorithms.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "viXra", "mag_id": "97080108", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59668215"}

In dismantling tasks, robots are expected to be able to find and remove very small parts such as screws and bolts. Such recognition of small parts is difficult for robots. The article describes a vision-based hierarchical recognition applied to dismantling tasks where large structures are detected at first, thus small parts attached to these structures are detected easier. Regarding the items in the ceiling side, after the dismantling task of the ceiling panels, it is necessary to remove carefully the screws that once held these panels to the light gauge steel (LGS), with the purpose of reusing it. With the pose detection of the large structure (LGS) and considering a robot arm with a stereo camera on its tip, a trajectory near that structure can be computed to detect the small parts, in this case the screws. The large structure is detected by using a process of line detection in 2D and its 3D pose is measured with the stereo camera. During the motion along the structure, the screws are detected by applying a multi-template matching process to every captured image. Followed by, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), which recognizes those screw candidates with high true positive rate and low false positive one. These rates are improved with a temporal multi-image integration for tracking the screw candidates. In the experiment, 10 actual screws distributed in 1.1 m along a linear segment on the LGS are successfully recognized with a few false positives and with a final computed 3D position of 2 mm in average. Feasibility of methodology is evaluated by experimentation under different lighting conditions in a realistic environment.

An accurate and interpretable method is necessary for diagnosing patients with breast cancer for well-performed treatment. Nowadays, a great many of ensemble methods have been widely applied to breast cancer diagnosis, capable of achieving high accuracy, such as Random Forest. However, they are black-box methods which are unable to explain the reasons behind the diagnosis. To surmount this limitation, a rule extraction method named improved Random Forest (RF)-based rule extraction (IRFRE) method is developed to derive accurate and interpretable classification rules from a decision tree ensemble for breast cancer diagnosis. Firstly, numbers of decision tree models are constructed using Random Forest to generate abundant decision rules available. And then a rule extraction approach is devised to detach decision rules from the trained trees. Finally, an improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is employed to seek for an optimal rule predictor where the constituent rule set is the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. The developed method is evaluated on three breast cancer data sets, i.e., the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, Wisconsin Original Breast Cancer (WOBC) dataset, and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) breast cancer dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed method can primely explain the black-box methods and outperform several popular single algorithms, ensemble learning methods, and rule extraction methods from the view of accuracy and interpretability.

Among the different types of malware, zero-day malware is problematic because it cannot be removed by antivirus systems. Existing malware detection mechanisms use stored malware characteristics, which hinders detecting zero-day attacks where altered malware is generated to avoid detection by antivirus systems. To detect malware including zero-day attacks robustly, this paper proposes a novel method called transferred deep-convolutional generative adversarial network (tDCGAN), which generates fake malware and learns to distinguish it from real malware. The data generated from a random distribution are similar but not identical to the real data: it includes modified features compared with real data. The detector learns various malware features using real data and modified data generated by the tDCGAN based on a deep autoencoder (DAE), which extracts appropriate features and stabilizes the GAN training. Before training the GAN, the DAE learns malware characteristics, produces general data, and transfers this capacity for stable training of the GAN generator. The trained discriminator passes down the ability to capture malware features to the detector, using transfer learning. We show that tDCGAN achieves 95.74% average classification accuracy which is higher than that of other models and increases the learning stability. It is also the most robust against modeled zero-day attacks compared to others.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2018.04.092", "venue": "Inf.

To address this issue, we propose a multi-feature fusion with adaptive graph learning model for unsupervised Re-ID. Our model aims to negotiate comprehensive assessment on the consistent graph structure of pedestrians with the help of special information of feature descriptors. Specifically, we incorporate multi-feature dictionary learning and adaptive multi-feature graph learning into a unified learning model such that the learned dictionaries are discriminative and the subsequent graph structure learning is accurate. An alternating optimization algorithm with proved convergence is developed to solve the final optimization objective.

As indicated in its name, NI-LPA is an improved version of LPA which maintains its simplicity and enhances its accuracy. In fact, we adopt the LPA strategy to allow a node to contain a set of labels.

Defect regions are segmented from background images using their distinguishing texture characteristics. This method locates candidate defect regions directly in the DCT (Discrete cosine transform) domain using the intensity variation information encoded in the DCT coefficients. More precisely, defect detection employs DCT analysis of each individual non-overlapping region of the image to determine potentially defective blocks, which are further grown and merged to form a defect region on the image.

The motivations for this work is to understand the relationship between Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived terrestrial water change (Delta TWS) data and GWL, so that Delta TWS could be used as a proxy measurement for GWL. In our study, we have selected five observation wells from different geographic regions in India. The datasets are unevenly spaced time series data which restricts us from applying standard time series methodologies and therefore in order to model and predict GWL with the help of Delta TWS, we have built Linear Regression Model (LRM), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Comparative performances of LRM, SVR and ANN have been evaluated with the help of correlation coefficient (rho) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the actual and fitted (for training dataset) or predicted (for test dataset) values of GWL. It has been observed in our study that Delta TWS is highly significant variable to model GWL and the amount of total variations in GWL that could be explained with the help of Delta TWS varies from 36.48% to 74.28% (0.3648 <= R-2 <= 0.7428). We have found that for the model GWL similar to Delta TWS, for both training and test dataset, performances of SVR and ANN are better than that of LRM in terms of rho and RMSE. It also has been found in our study that with the inclusion of meteorological variables along with Delta TWS as input parameters to model GWL, the performance of SVR improves and it performs better than ANN. These results imply that for modelling irregular time series GWL data, Delta TWS could be very useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, application-based researchers in machine learning and deep learning have started developing solutions for many practical problems. Handwriting recognition is one such area of interest. Bangla, being the seventh most spoken language in the world, is not an exception. However, unlike English, there have not been concerted formal attempts in building a benchmark in comparing the different approaches reported in the literature, mainly because of the lack of openly and freely available datasets and diversity of the approaches without formal comparative studies. In this research paper, we seek to rectify this gap. We have focused on benchmarking five robust algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), on all publicly available Bangla handwriting digits datasets, including Ekush, NumtaDB, CMARTdb, and BDRW. NumtaDB itself is a collection of five handwriting datasets. We have worked on fine-tuning these algorithms by finding the best possible hyper-parameters of these algorithms. It is our hope that Sankhya will work as a beginning point of an open and verifiable benchmarking process that we plan to repeat every two years for now on and set a standard for testing and validating newer and novel algorithms that will be reported in this area in the future. In addition, we have extensively compared our research with other states of the art research and our versions of these algorithms are now outperforming every reported result on these datasets.All the datasets we used are open-sourced. In addition, we are making the.csv version of these datasets available in public GitHub. Of all the models we tested, the Sankhya CNN model performed the best for all these datasets, which we fine-tuned specifically for Bangla character recognition.

However, only a few studies have been conducted in the field of hour-ahead forecasting.

Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for hour-ahead price prediction. All the models are examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide.

Different from traditional temporal modeling methods, male and female gait traits are competitively learned by the addition of gender labels. Shape appearance and temporal dynamics of both genders are integrated into a sequential model called mixed conditional random field (CRF) (MCRF), which provides an open framework applicable to various spatiotemporal features. In this paper, for the spatial part, pyramids of fitting coefficients are used to generate the gait shape descriptors; for the temporal part, neighborhood-preserving embeddings are clustered to allocate the stance indexes over gait cycles. During these processes, we employ evaluation functions like the partition index and Xie and Beni's index to improve the feature sparseness. By fusion of shape descriptors and stance indexes, the MCRF is constructed in coordination with intra- and intergender temporary Markov properties. Analogous to the maximum likelihood decision used in hidden Markov models (HMMs), several classification strategies on the MCRF are discussed. We use CASIA (Data set B) and IRIP Gait Databases for the experiments.

However, both deep learning and adversarial training rely on the availability of a large amount of labeled data and usually do not generalize well to new, unseen classes when only a few training samples are accessible. To address this problem, we explicitly introduce a new challenging problem -- how to learn a robust deep model with limited training samples per class, called defensive few-shot learning in this paper. Simply employing the existing adversarial training techniques in the literature cannot solve this problem. This is because few-shot learning needs to learn transferable knowledge from disjoint auxiliary data, and thus it is invalid to assume the sample-level distribution consistency between the training and test sets as commonly assumed in existing adversarial training techniques. In this paper, instead of assuming such a distribution consistency, we propose to make this assumption at a task-level in the episodic training paradigm in order to better transfer the defense knowledge. Furthermore, inside each task, we design a task-conditioned distribution constraint to narrow the distribution gap between clean and adversarial examples at a sample-level. These give rise to a novel mechanism called multi-level distribution based adversarial training (MDAT) for learning transferable adversarial defense. In addition, a unified $\\mathcal{F}_{\\beta}$ score is introduced to evaluate different defense methods under the same principle. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDAT achieves higher effectiveness and robustness over existing alternatives in the few-shot case.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.06968", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2989050727", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3310672", "3879949", "206594692", "3973828", "6628106", "18268744", "195908774", "9059612", "41312633", "88524574", "3488815", "17504174", "3947794", "123234552", "67413369", "13753923", "52898972", "52962648", "8909022", "51928102", "4412459", "59222747"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208138174"}

The main task of GA is to modify and sort proteins for transport throughout the cell. Proteins permeate through the GA on the ER (Endoplasmic Reticulum) facing side (cis side) and depart on the other side (trans side). Based on this phenomenon, we get two types of GA proteins, namely, cis-Golgi protein and trans-Golgi protein. Any dysfunction of GA proteins can result in congenital glycosylation disorders and some other forms of difficulties that may lead to neurodegenerative and inherited diseases like diabetes, cancer and cystic fibrosis. So, the exact classification of GA proteins may contribute to drug development which will further help in medication. In this paper, we focus on building a new computational model that not only introduces easy ways to extract features from protein sequences but also optimizes classification of trans-Golgi and cis-Golgi proteins. After feature extraction, we have employed Random Forest (RF) model to rank the features based on the importance score obtained from it. After selecting the top ranked features, we have applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the sub-Golgi proteins. We have trained regression model as well as classification model and found the former to be superior. The model shows improved performance over all previous methods. As the benchmark dataset is significantly imbalanced, we have applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to the dataset to make it balanced and have conducted experiments on both versions.

These limitations result in erroneous crop evapotranspiration (ET c ) estimates, especially for non-standard conditions (e.g. plastic mulch). We present Support Vector Machine (SVM), a data-driven model based on statistical learning theory, for predicting generic K c and ET c using a uniquely large dataset (10 seasons) from lysimeters for multiple crop-seasons combination under the plastic mulch conditions. The data used in this study were obtained from six years of lysimeter-based measurements ( Shukla et al., 2006, 2012, 2014a, 2014b; Shukla and Knowles, 2011 ) for two distinctly different crop types (vine and erect) under two contrasting irrigation methods, drip and sub-irrigation. The SVM-based models predicted bell pepper (erect crop; r 2 = 0.71) and watermelon (vine crop; r 2 = 0.82) K c as a function of time, water table depth, and number of rainfall events. The time since transplant represents the plant growth and, therefore, transpiration. The water table depth and rainfall events capture the effect of surface soil moisture on evaporation. The crop type-specific model is robust since it works for two different irrigation methods and growing seasons (spring and fall). The SVM model was superior to the Artificial Neural Network and Relevance Vector Machine models, two data-driven models used in hydrology. The errors in predicting ET c from the SVM model were only 2.6% and 11.2% for watermelon and bell pepper, respectively, highlighting the model accuracy. For both crops, the SVM predicted K c values were not statistically different from the actual K c values. In contrast, the FAO-56 values were significantly lower than the actual K c values for both bell pepper ( p = 0.016) and watermelon ( p = 0.025). When evaluated in the context of watershed-scale budgets, the SVM model improved the accuracy in ET c estimates by 49.3 mm over the FAO-56 method, and this improvement represents 70% (70.7 mm) of the observed surface flow. Improved accuracy of the SVM model makes it useful in deriving local K c using readily available hydro-climatic data for applications ranging from field-scale water management to watershed-scale modeling. The proposed model can be used to develop region-specific K c to improve ET c estimates.

We propose innovative generalizations of SNR for multiclass cancer discrimination through introduction of two indices, Gene Dominant Index and Gene Dormant Index (GDIs). These two indices lead to the concepts of dominant and dormant genes with biological significance. We use these indices to develop methodologies for discovery of dominant and dormant biomarkers with interesting biological significance. The dominancy and dormancy of the identified biomarkers and their excellent discriminating power are also demonstrated pictorially using the scatterplot of individual gene and 2-D Sammon's projection of the selected set of genes. Using information from the literature we have shown that the GDI based method can identify dominant and dormant genes that play significant roles in cancer biology. These biomarkers are also used to design diagnostic prediction systems.Results and discussionTo evaluate the effectiveness of the GDIs, we have used four multiclass cancer data sets (Small Round Blue Cell Tumors, Leukemia, Central Nervous System Tumors, and Lung Cancer). For each data set we demonstrate that the new indices can find biologically meaningful genes that can act as biomarkers. We then use six machine learning tools, Nearest Neighbor Classifier (NNC), Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with linear kernel, and SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel, where both SVMs are used in conjunction with one-vs-all (OVA) and one-vs-one (OVO) strategies. We found GDIs to be very effective in identifying biomarkers with strong class specific signatures. With all six tools and for all data sets we could achieve better or comparable prediction accuracies usually with fewer marker genes than results reported in the literature using the same computational protocols. The dominant genes are usually easy to find while good dormant genes may not always be available as dormant genes require stronger constraints to be satisfied; but when they are available, they can be used for authentication of diagnosis.ConclusionSince GDI based schemes can find a small set of dominant/dormant biomarkers that is adequate to design diagnostic prediction systems, it opens up the possibility of using real-time qPCR assays or antibody based methods such as ELISA for an easy and low cost diagnosis of diseases. The dominant and dormant genes found by GDIs can be used in different ways to design more reliable diagnostic prediction systems.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2620271", "pubmed_id": "18842155", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-425", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2101820646", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2914506", "17338385", "119479891", "7534766", "3069530", "1737490", "207720429", "5748856", "2625269", "1069019", "10205866", "22529915", "4419580", "86730427", "27521837", "5594451", "29740202", "41828449", "23828324", "121587", "22723403", "33326446", "19707018", "8061295", "7717479", "20812807", "24172254", "3074501", "11415834", "2761259", "1029963", "40653830", "21836298", "25341330", "21052858", "35415423", "44320782", "6362814"], "inbound_citations": ["54093226", "174784", "13983477", "215676286", "215188440", "1227509", "7129500", "211118199", "25282045", "13533609", "59235", "11417497", "54436425", "14881209"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1244049"}

Visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VisNIR) is an attractive surrogate to time-consuming and costly classical soil assessment protocols. It highly depends on selecting appropriate data mining methods for regression analysis. In this study, performance of a state of the art learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM), was evaluated through comparing with the other calibration methods proposed in the literature for predicting lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn) concentrations. Solid samples collected from a mine waste dump (n = 120) were scanned using a Fieldspec3 portable spectroradiometer with a measurement range of (350\u20132500 nm) in a laboratory. Transformation of the reflectance spectra to absorbance was followed by three pre-processing scenarios including Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SG), first derivative (FD) and second derivative (SD). Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural networks with two learning algorithms models (back propagation and extreme learning machine), were calibrated on spectral features selected by genetic algorithm, and then applied to predict soil metal concentrations. The best prediction accuracy was obtained by FD-ELM method with R 2 p, RMSEp, concordance correlation coefficient and RPD values of 0.93, 63.01, 0.98 and 5.92 for Pb and 0.87, 167.90, 0.91 and 5.62 for Zn, respectively. Study of the prediction mechanism proved that element sorption by spectrally active Fe-oxide and clay contents of the soil was the major mechanism by which the spectrally featureless Pb and Zn ions can be predicted. The spatial patterns of predicted toxic elements showed that FD-ELM had the most similarity with those maps obtained by interpolating measured values. Over all, it is concluded that reflectance spectroscopy combined with the ELM algorithm is a rapid, inexpensive and accurate tool for indirect evaluation of Pb and Zn and mapping their spatial distribution in dumpsite soils of Sarcheshmeh copper mine.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.12.025", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2782072844", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21749095", "201248236", "158172350", "214732405", "215317748", "208322098", "155233698", "116418117"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49252139"}

In this study an approach to recognize known faces based on Eigen vectors and a hybrid Meta-heuristic feature selection algorithm is proposed. The eigenvectors which are covariance matrix of the face images together describes the difference between face images. Face recognition problem is viewed as a two dimensional recognition problem. Initially the face images are projected in to face space and using Principal component analysis the eigenvectors with high Eigenvalues are extracted to reduce the dimension of the feature vector. Further to select the best feature vectors which increase the classification accuracy is selected by using a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm using Genetic algorithm (GA) and Bacteria Foraging Optimization (BFO). In this study the Support vector machine (SVM) and Back propagation neural network (BPNN) are used for classification. Automatic face recognition by computers is now becoming popular area for research and there now many successful techniques are invented due to advancements in the field of computing over past few decades. Face recognition system involves finding mathematical representation of the face images and matching processes. A face recognition system can be used both verification and identification purposes. This paper further explores the face recognition using Eigenfaces combined with a hybrid meta-heuristic approach for selecting the features. The known face images are classified using classifiers namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) separately. The performance of the both the classifiers used are compared finally to identify the suitable classifier which could be used efficiently for face recognition problem.

However, in order to achieve state-of-the-art results, complex hand-crafted feature filters and/or support vector classifiers with nonlinear kernels are needed. Compared with hand-crafted features, unsupervised feature learning is a popular alternative, which results in feature filters adapted to the problem domain at hand. Although both color and intensity are important cues for remote sensing image classification and color images are commonly used for unsupervised feature learning, most of the existing algorithms do not take into account interrelationships between intensity and color information. We address this problem using quaternion representation for color images and propose unsupervised learning of quaternion feature filters, as well as feature encoding using quaternion orthogonal matching pursuit (Q-OMP). By using quaternion representation, we are able to jointly encode intensity and color information in an image. We obtain local descriptors by soft thresholding and computing absolute values of scalar and three vector parts of the quaternion-valued sparse code. Local descriptors are pooled, power-law transformed, and normalized, yielding the resulting image representation. The experimental results on UC Merced Land Use and Brazilian Coffee Scenes datasets are comparable or better than the state of the art, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed method for quaternion feature learning is able to adapt to the characteristics of the available data, and being fully unsupervised, it emerges as a viable alternative to both hand-crafted representations and convolutional neural networks, especially in application scenarios with scarce-labeled training data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2513898", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2291467501", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["993769", "207316336", "206691461", "4358477", "14958228", "308212", "6670425", "21226824", "15629913", "1440386", "16513805", "1912619", "14187161", "17606900", "27625235", "13921907", "62091811", "5765252", "16087592", "13976978", "15879207", "7718467", "206725404", "55453487", "13904304", "5822303", "121836876", "36933021", "14090736", "13939545", "16735964", "8335239", "17043025", "1226293", "15065876", "15192218", "10402702", "9560434", "961425", "10546515", "90113"], "inbound_citations": ["3823778", "10460408", "84181095", "20351644", "199012732", "204208840", "3046524", "2257926", "212705230", "127826248", "52927307", "3682921", "22270920", "15191138"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31429268"}

Although ADHD was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century, its diagnosis is still confronted with many problems. Method A novel classification approach that discriminates ADHD and nonADHD groups over the time-frequency domain features of event-related potential (ERP) recordings that are taken during Stroop task is presented. Time-Frequency Hermite-Atomizer (TFHA) technique is used for the extraction of high resolution time-frequency domain features that are highly localized in time-frequency domain. Based on an extensive investigation, Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) was used to obtain the best discriminating features. Results When the best three features were used, the classification accuracy for the training dataset reached 98%, and the use of five features further improved the accuracy to 99.5%. The accuracy was 100% for the testing dataset.

This has been an outstanding issue for about two decades which hampered the development of kernel-based methods. We introduce Isolation Kernel which is solely dependent on data distribution, requiring neither class information nor explicit learning to be a classifier. In contrast, existing data dependent kernels rely heavily on class information and explicit learning to produce a classifier. We show that Isolation Kernel approximates well to a data independent kernel function called Laplacian kernel under uniform density distribution. With this revelation, Isolation Kernel can be viewed as a data dependent kernel that adapts a data independent kernel to the structure of a dataset. We also provide a reason why the proposed new data dependent kernel enables SVM (which employs a kernel through other means) to improve its predictive accuracy. The key differences between Random Forest kernel and Isolation Kernel are discussed to examine the reasons why the latter is a more successful tree-based kernel.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3219819.3219990", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2883617201", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14294002", "10844956", "961425", "2614279", "16420570", "7553535", "34199059", "2552688", "13926591", "245216", "125253656", "1420642", "159563833", "47325215", "11581488", "2643381", "14958572"], "inbound_citations": ["58069493", "210932033", "195776116", "57365944", "214647334", "196186482", "195344971"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49294996"}

When compared to data derived from image-based point clouds, airborne laser scanning produced slightly more accurate estimates of timber volume, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.3% using multiple linear regression. In comparison, RMSEs for volume estimates derived from image-based point clouds were 28.3% and 29.0%, respectively, using Semi-Global Matching and enhanced Automatic Terrain Extraction methods. Multiple linear regression was the best-performing parameter estimation method when compared to k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine. In many countries, aerial imagery is acquired and updated on regular cycles of 1\u20135 years when compared to more costly, once-off airborne laser scanning surveys. This study demonstrates point clouds generated from such aerial imagery can be used to enhance the estimation of forest parameters at a stand and forest compartment level-scale using small area estimation methods while at the same time achieving sampling error reduction and improving accuracy at the forest enterprise-level scale.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/f8060215", "venue": null, "journal": "Forests", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2625031578", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["15586911", "73632754", "10343448", "34849665", "19035352", "31131036", "127743410", "84325732", "167379333", "199370401", "11497038", "83858785", "85724198", "17544334", "123050030", "11600907", "16355556", "2850611", "52230565", "197535381", "129708896", "1255792", "11735853", "13283956", "54736234", "60271866", "18814132", "131295186", "60488129", "16555807", "59076046", "129803791", "132988241", "132851746", "131328838", "85131899"], "inbound_citations": ["147700520", "208269572", "85505286", "91190359", "116391091", "54695575", "208224397", "214937028", "46975181"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31168330"}

Power system disturbances are often caused by faults on transmission lines. When fault occurs on a transmission system, the protective relay detects the fault and initiates the tripping operation, which isolates the affected part from the rest of the power system. Based on the fault section identified, rapid and corrective restoration procedures can thus be taken to minimize the power interruption and limit the impact of outage on the system. The approach is particularly important for post-fault diagnosis of any mal-operation of relays following a disturbance in the neighboring line connected to the same substation. This may help in improving the fault monitoring/diagnosis process, thus assuring secure operation of the power systems. In this paper we compare SVMs with radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) in data sets corresponding to different faults on a transmission system.

The proposed system makes use of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to enhance the quality of the input MR images. Thereafter, two-dimensional PCA (2DPCA) strategy is employed to extract the features and subsequently, a PCA+LDA approach is used to generate a compact and discriminative feature set. Finally, a new learning algorithm called MDE-ELM is suggested that combines modified differential evolution (MDE) and extreme learning machine (ELM) for segregation of MR images as pathological or healthy. The MDE is utilized to optimize the input weights and hidden biases of single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFN), whereas an analytical method is used for determining the output weights. The proposed algorithm performs optimization based on both the root mean squared error (RMSE) and norm of the output weights of SLFNs. The suggested scheme is benchmarked on three standard datasets and the results are compared against other competent schemes.

Currently there are only around 36 experimental 3D structures available for TMBs in PDB (at 30% sequence identity). Furthermore, with large amounts of sequence data available from high-throughput methods, it is imperative to develop accurate and fast computational methods for their identification and topology prediction. Here, we present a concept for a fast method to identify TMBs and predict their topology. The method uses sparse encoded amino acid data as input and employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to generate accurate topologies. The topologies in the training phase are divided into pre-barrel state, outer-loop state, inner-loop state and the transmembrane beta-strand state. In the first stage, 4 separate SVMs are used to predict the local state preference for each residue. A profile generated from the probabilities thus obtained is used as input to the HMM stage to determine the overall topology. If the number of predicted strands is between 8 and 24, then the given sequence is identified as a TMB. We see the application of our method in the proteome-wide topology prediction of TMBs, where current methods might have a limitation due to the time consuming homologous sequence search step.

This task is highly challenging, especially when there exists only single image per person in the database. In this paper, we present an algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis distance for person re-identification. Our method has two distinctive features: (1) to obtain the best separability of the training data, we first minimize the intra-class distances to the most extent by forcing intra-class distances to be zero, and (2) to promote the generalization ability of the learned metric, we then maximize the minimum margin between different classes. Inspired by the simple geometric intuition that a regular simplex maximizes its minimum side length, provided the sum of all side length is fixed, our method, called EquiDistance constrained Metric Learning (EquiDML), applies least-square regression technique to map images of the same person to the same vertex of a regular simplex, and images of different persons to different vertices of a regular simplex.

In this paper, we consider the problem of learning image categorizers on large image sets (e.g. > 100k images) using bag-of-visual-words (BOV) image representations and Support Vector Machine classifiers. We experiment with three approaches to BOV embedding: 1) kernel PCA (kPCA) [15], 2) a modified kPCA we propose for additive kernels and 3) random projections for shift-invariant kernels [14].

In this paper a new resampling method is proposed combining an oversampling and an undersampling technique. Several tests have been developed aiming at assessing the efficiency of the proposed method. Four classifiers based, respectively, on Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, labelled Self-Organizing Map and Bayesian Classifiers have been developed and applied for binary classification on the following four datasets: a synthetic dataset, a widely used public dataset and two datasets coming from industrial applications.

Most existing methods generally learn part detectors to discover discriminative regions for better performance. However, not all localized parts are beneficial and indispensable for classification, and the setting for number of part detectors relies heavily on prior knowledge as well as experimental results. As is known to all, when we describe the object of an image into text via natural language, we only focus on the pivotal characteristics, and rarely pay attention to common characteristics as well as the background areas. This is an involuntary transfer from human visual attention to textual attention, which leads to the fact that textual attention tells us how many and which parts are discriminative and significant. So textual attention of natural language descriptions could help us to discover visual attention in image. Inspired by this, we propose a visual-textual attention driven fine-grained representation learning (VTA) approach, and its main contributions are: (1) Fine-grained visual-textual pattern mining devotes to discovering discriminative visual-textual pairwise information for boosting classification through jointly modeling vision and text with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which automatically and adaptively discovers discriminative parts. (2) Visual-textual representation learning jointly combine visual and textual information, which preserves the intra-modality and inter-modality information to generate complementary fine-grained representation, and further improve classification performance.

A novel method to identify the idle running period and eliminate noise is developed using discrete wavelet decomposition (DWD) and fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Statistical features are extracted from each clean acoustic signal segment to better represent and quantify grinding process. A new k-fold eXtreme Gradient Boosting (k-fold-XGBoost) algorithm after training and optimization is integrated into the material removal (MR) model. The test results indicate that the values forecasted by the model are consistent with the measured values. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of material removal evaluated by the model is 4.373%, which shows a better performance than the reported results which are in the range of 6.4 to 8.72%. In comparison with other prediction models, such as optimally pruned extreme learning machine and random forest and support vector regression, k-fold-XGBoost model shows superior results for the same datasets.

Specifically, the application of a Genetic Clustering Algorithm and of the Random Forests algorithm (RF) is explored. Clinical appendicitis prediction involves the estimation of at least 15 clinical and laboratory factors (features). The contribution of each factor to the prediction is not known. Thus, the goal of abdominal pain data analysis is not restricted to the classification of the data, but includes the exploration of the underlying data structure. In this study a genetic clustering algorithm is employed for the later task and its performance is compared to a classical K-means clustering approach. For classification purposes, tree methods are frequently used in medical applications since they often reveal simple relationships between variables that can be used to interpret the data. They are however very prone to overfitting problems. Random Forests, applied in this study, is a novel ensemble classifier which builds a number of decision trees to improve the single tree classifier generalization ability. The application of the above mentioned algorithms to real data resulted in very low error rates, (less than 5%), indicating the usefulness of the respective approach. The most informative diagnostic features as proposed by the algorithms are in accordance with known medical expert knowledge.

However, one intrinsic limitation of the commonly adopted 1-D graph convolution is that it only exploits graph connectivity for feature smoothing, which may lead to inferior performance on sparse and noisy real-world attributed networks. To address this problem, we propose to explore relational information among node attributes to complement node relations for representation learning. In particular, we propose to use 2-D graph convolution to jointly model the two kinds of relations and develop a computationally efficient dimensionwise separable 2-D graph convolution (DSGC). Theoretically, we show that DSGC can reduce intra-class variance of node features on both the node dimension and the attribute dimension to facilitate learning. Empirically, we demonstrate that by incorporating attribute relations, DSGC achieves significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods on node classification and clustering on several real-world attributed networks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.12038", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2976166297", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["141460877", "45875271", "60545", "15483870", "9340872", "17133491", "16902615", "5892518", "807019", "24140077", "17682909", "13999578", "14675158", "331378", "3636539", "22191393", "15437128", "47390681", "19188052", "3016223", "1690180", "62359231", "207238980", "4755450", "11920160", "10443309", "12670695", "19908368", "6027413", "14249137", "3144218", "714639", "17797070", "22049936", "8393918", "174800708", "2340317", "301319", "943660", "51608273", "1957433", "14560245", "3051291", "155093091", "201642", "206756462", "62016134", "9743839", "2282762", "3292002", "52877454", "28464262", "207238964", "19140125", "1391775", "14038806", "10374037", "7265538", "6259129", "2452205", "7008752", "53036450", "3973810", "7827877", "174798309", "53786372", "51606615", "54559476", "508435", "56517517", "1061056", "6464234", "1052837", "4899764"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202888622"}

Within the area of Systems Biology these models provide graph-based descriptions of bio-molecular interactions which describe cellular activities such as gene regulation, metabolism and transcription. One of the key advantages of the approach taken, Inductive Logic Programming, is the availability of background knowledge on existing known biochemical networks from publicly available resources such as KEGG and Biocyc. The topic has clear societal impact owing to its application in Biology and Medicine. Moreover, object descriptions in this domain have an inherently relational structure in the form of spatial and temporal interactions of the molecules involved. The relationships include biochemical reactions in which one set of metabolites is transformed to another mediated by the involvement of an enzyme. Existing genomic information is very incomplete concerning the functions and even the existence of genes and metabolites, leading to the necessity of techniques such as logical abduction to introduce novel functions and invent new objects.

Methods In the discovery phase, a public blood-based microarray dataset of 110 patients with known CAD was analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis to identify candidate hub genes. In the training set with 151 CAD patients, bioinformatically identified hub genes were experimentally verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and statistically filtered with the SVM algorithm to develop a GES. Internal and external validation of GES was performed in patients with suspected CAD from two validation cohorts (n = 209 and 206). Results The discovery phase screened 15 network-centric hub genes significantly correlated with the Duke CAD Severity Index. In the training cohort, 12 of 15 hub genes were filtered to construct a blood-based GES12, which showed good discrimination for higher modified Gensini scores (AUC: 0.798 and 0.812), higher Sullivan Extent scores (AUC: 0.776 and 0.778), and the presence of obstructive CAD (AUC: 0.834 and 0.792) in two validation cohorts. A nomogram comprising GES12, smoking status, hypertension status, low density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and body mass index further improved performance, with respect to discrimination, risk classification, and clinical utility, for prediction of coronary stenosis severity.

A Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) model using a non linear Schrodinger wave equation (SWE) is proposed here to explain the tracking of the Motor Imagery (MI) based EEG signal of the BCI user. It is shown that if the potential field of the SWE is excited by the raw EEG data using a self-organized learning scheme, then the probability density function (pdf) associated with the EEG signal is transferred to the probability amplitude function which is the response of the SWE. In this scheme, the EEG data is encoded in terms of a particle like wave packet which helps to recover the EEG signal by de-noising the raw data. Thus the filtered EEG signal is a wave packet which glides along and moves like a particle. This estimated EEG signal is then fed as an input to the feature extractor to obtain the Hjorth features. These features are then used to train the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results show that the accuracy of the classifier output using the filtered EEG and the wave packet generated feature is better compared to that using the raw EEG signal.

The respondents were asked to read the paragraphs and record their voices while reading the data. The empirical test shows that during the pre-processing of data records, Vietnamese have longer range of duration as compared to Filipinos because of their manners in reading and intensity on accent-bearing syllables. In constructing the speech recognition model, four classification algorithms were used, namely: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour), Naive-Bayes, SMO (Support Vector Machine) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). The evaluation of the training set in terms of accuracy, correctly classified instances and incorrectly classified instances are evaluated by the performance of the developed system. As the data established, the results show that SMO and MLP performed better for all the given datasets, with accuracy rates ranging from 99.2694% for MLP and 98.7179% for SMO.

They are widely demanded in network information services, intelligent accompanying robots, and so on. A Human-Computer dialogue system typically consists of three parts, namely Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Dialogue Management (DM) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Each part has several different subtasks. Each subtask has been received lots of attentions, many improvements have been achieved on each subtask, respectively. But systems built in traditional pipeline way, where different subtasks are assembled sequently, suffered from some problems such as error accumulation and expanding, domain transferring. Therefore, researches on jointly modeling several subtasks in one part or cross different parts have been prompted greatly in recent years, especially the rapid developments on deep neural networks based joint models. There is even a few work aiming to integrate all subtasks of a dialogue system in a single model, namely end-to-end models. This paper introduces two basic frames of current dialogue systems and gives a brief survey on recent advances on variety subtasks at first, and then focuses on joint models for multiple subtasks of dialogues. We review several different joint models including integration of several subtasks inside NLU or NLG, jointly modeling cross NLG and DM, and jointly modeling through NLU, DM and NLG. Both advantages and problems of those joint models are discussed.

METHODS: Treatment naive patients with glioma (n = 49; 67% glioblastoma; 74% left temporal) completed neurocognitive testing [WAIS-III Digit Span (DS); Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA); HVLT-R Total Recall; Trail Making Test A & B (TMT)]. Demographically-adjusted scores that were at or below -1.5 SDs were considered impaired. Presurgical T1, gadolinium-enhanced T1, T2, and FLAIR MRI were used to define 3D tumor boundaries. Using these sequences, 4 normalized tumor compartment volumes (necrosis; edema; non-enhancing; enhancing) were computed with an automated, validated, volumetric segmentation pipeline. Random Forest classifier in Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software (WEKA) was used to predict the impairment for each neurocognitive test using different combinations of the volumetric compartments. RESULTS: Neurocognitive impairment was relatively common across measures [DS, 22%; COWA, 20%; TMT-A, 17%; TMT-B, 54%; HVLT-R Total Recall, 55%]. The gadolinium-enhancing compartment volume alone yielded the best classification accuracy for COWA [AUC = 0.72, TP = 82%, FP = 27%], HVLT-R Total Recall [AUC = 0.71, TP = 65%, FP = 37%], and TMT-A [AUC = 0.51, TP = 75%, FP = 65%]. Non-enhancing compartment volume alone was most predictive of DS [AUC = 0.71, TP = 74%, FP = 46%] and necrosis volume alone was most predictive of TMT-B [AUC = 0.66, TP = 63%, FP = 38%]. Including combinations of varying compartments did not convey predictive advantage over the single predictor models. CONCLUSION: Differing tumor compartment volumes were predictive of neurocognitive impairment across a variety of domains. Specifically, gadolinium-enhancing volume most accurately classified impairment in processing speed, verbal fluency, and verbal learning, non-enhancing volume best classified attentional impairment, and necrosis showed greatest accuracy for executive functioning. These findings suggest that relationships between tumor volume and neurocognitive functioning may vary by tumor compartment.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/neuonc/nov223.12", "venue": null, "journal": "Neuro-oncology", "mag_id": "2549325208", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78526966"}

In this study we evaluate the robustness of six classification algorithms and ten filter-based feature selection techniques, specifically to study how the different techniques are impacted by particularly challenging datasets in order to find the techniques which are less sensitive to class noise. To investigate the robustness of the classification algorithms and feature selection techniques, we injected artificial noise (which varied both in terms of noise level and noise distribution) into 12 relatively noise-free bioinformatics datasets, creating a spectrum of noisy datasets with three levels of learning difficulty (Easy, Moderate, and Hard). We then used ten feature rankers from three different families, along with six classification techniques, to build predictive models. We found that the Random Forest 100 learner is the least sensitive to class noise, and thus is a good candidate for classification across all rankers and learning difficulty levels. Logistic Regression, on the other hand, gave the worst performance across all rankers and learning difficulty levels. Additionally, we found that some rankers were successful at ameliorating the difficulty of hard datasets for all learners other than Logistic Regression, meaning that with these rankers the datasets act as though they are less noisy.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IRI.2014.7051900", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI 2014)", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE 15th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI 2014)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2085995984", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207148183", "23947840", "6778315", "6054025", "379259", "10647676", "9921469", "52059378", "43173326", "5540354", "5467854", "18885326", "140109802", "3331253"], "inbound_citations": ["15103854"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14455294"}

Ecosystem health depicts the capacity of system to respond to external perturbations and still maintain structure and function. In this study, we explored the effects of abiotic factors on ecosystem health of Taihu Lake in 2013, China from a system-level perspective. Spatiotemporal heterogeneities of eco-exergy and specific eco-exergy served as thermodynamic indicators to represent ecosystem health in the lake. The results showed the plankton community appeared more energetic in May, and relatively healthy in Gonghu Bay with both higher eco-exergy and specific eco-exergy; a eutrophic state was likely discovered in Zhushan Bay with higher eco-exergy but lower specific eco-exergy. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) approach was used to explain the non-linear relationships between two indicators and abiotic factors. This analysis revealed water temperature, inorganic nutrients, and total suspended solids greatly contributed to the two indicators that increased. However, pH rise driven by inorganic carbon played an important role in undermining ecosystem health, particularly when pH was higher than 8.2.

Visual cues are usually sparse and vague under this scenario. An action sequence is divided into overlapped spatial-temporal volumes to make reliable and comprehensive use of the observed features. Within each volume, we represent successive poses by time series of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and movements by time series of Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF). Supervised Principle Component Analysis (SPCA) is applied to seek a subset of discriminantly informative principle components (PCs) to reduce the dimension of histogram vectors without loss of accuracy.

For instance, patient behavior monitoring systems can analyze patient behavior based on patient movement and pose predictions. Although pose tracking methods have improved over the years, anomalous pose estimates, even if infrequent, can result in troublesome events, such as error information on the patient behaviors, which can lead to false diagnosis and requires human labor intensive processes to identify those anomalous poses. This cost could be mitigated by correcting or identifying anomalous pose estimates in an automated fashion. Thus, we present an anomaly analysis framework for clinical human pose estimates to address these concerns.In this study, we define anomalous human pose estimates by a thresholded euclidean distance between manually labeled joints and computer vision based predictions of joint locations. For our study, we annotated and analyzed a new human pose dataset from a clinical setting to study the subject-wise sensitivity and accuracy of anomaly detection on our proposed variational autoencoder (VAEs) } based frameworks. For our study, we performed anomaly analysis and detection based on our frameworks with PatientPose , a 2D pose estimator designed for the clinic setting. We demonstrate a strategy to correct anomalous to improve pose estimation accuracy and quantify and consider design-tradeoffs for our anomalous pose detection method. We also compare our method with classic anomaly detection methods such as Isolation Forest and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) with time-domain input.

In the last decade there has been considerable progress in developing learning procedures for these networks that allow them to automatically construct their own internal representations [6-8, 10]. The learning procedures are typically applied in networks that map input vectors to output vectors via a few layers of \"hidden\" units. The network learns to dedicate particular hidden units to particular pieces or aspects of the input vector that are relevant in determining the output. The network generally learns to use distributed representations [5] in which each input vector is represented by activity in many different hidden units, and each hidden unit is involved in representing many different input vectors. Within the connectionist community, there has been a long and unresolved debate between those who favor localist representations in which each processing element corresponds to a meaningful concept [3, 11] and those who favor distributed representations. The major criticism of distributed representations has been that they cannot handle structured knowledge properly and this criticism has motivated many of the papers in this issue. Another criticism has been the unintelligibility of distributed representations. As soon as there are several hidden layers, it becomes very difficult to say what each hidden unit is representing. Other things being equal, it is clearly desirable to understand how a system performing a task such as medical diagnosis arrives at a particular conclusion and to provide this information to the user. A large pattern of activities or set of learned weights is not a convincing explanation. If, however, the large set of weights performs consistently better than an alternative system that can explain its reasoning, it might be better to settle for the system that works best.

The out-of-sample extension problem is a critical issue that must be properly solved in this regard. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have excellent global search capabilities. This paper proposes a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) optimized by a GA for the solution of the out-of-sample extension problem. The prediction performance of a GRNN mainly depends on the appropriateness of the chosen smoothing factor. The essence of the GA optimization is the determination of the optimal smoothing factor of the GRNN, the optimized form of which is subsequently used to forecast the low-dimensional embeddings of the test samples. A GA can be used to obtain a better smoothing factor in a larger search space, resulting in enhanced prediction performance.

The semantic role labeling task (SRL) involves identifying which groups of words act as arguments to a given predicate.

The approach mainly focuses on improving the task of SRL by adding the similar words and selectional preferences to the existing lexical features, thereby avoiding data sparsity problem.

Input images are mapped to the YCbCr colour space, binarized and resized to 70x70 pixels. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is then performed on these binary images using their pixels as features. This method recognized signer-dependent signs with an accuracy of 100% and signer-independent signs with an accuracy of 62.37% for 32 unique classes and which increases to 78.49% when considering 23 classes, with very similar signs grouped together. Multi class Support Vector Machine (SVM) were employed as a classification method after processing the images, giving a result of 39.78% for 32 unique classes and 55.91% for 23 classes.

First, we constructed the PSMs estimation model as a regression model in deep learning. Then, we converted the estimation task into an image reconstruction task by image color mapping. We fulfilled the above task by designing an image generator and an image discriminator in the proposed maps' estimation GANs (MEGANs).

With the training process of MEGANs, the abilities of the generator and the discriminator are enhanced continually until reaching a balance, which means a high-accuracy PSMs estimation is achieved.

The decentralized classification fusion problem was the reason to use the belief function-based decision fusion approach in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). With the consideration of improving the belief function fusion approach, we have proposed four classification techniques, namely Enhanced K-Nearest Neighbor (EKNN), Enhanced Extreme Learning Machine (EELM), Enhanced Support Vector Machine (ESVM), and Enhanced Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (ERELM). In addition, WSNs are prone to errors and faults because of their different software, hardware failures, and their deployment in diverse fields. Because of these challenges, efficient fault detection methods must be used to detect faults in a WSN in a timely manner. We have induced four types of faults: offset fault, gain fault, stuck-at fault, and out of bounds fault, and used enhanced classification methods to solve the sensor failure issues. Experimental results show that ERELM gave the first best result for the improvement of the belief function fusion approach. The other three proposed techniques ESVM, EELM, and EKNN provided the second, third, and fourth best results, respectively. The proposed enhanced classifiers are used for fault detection and are evaluated using three performance metrics, i.e., Detection Accuracy (DA), True Positive Rate (TPR), and Error Rate (ER).

Characterizing the geospatial relationship between present AECs and their bioclimatic controls will provide insights into potential future shifts in AECs as climate changes. The major objectives of this study are to quantify empirical relationships between bioclimatic variables and the current geospatial distribution of six dryland AECs of the inland Pacific Northwest of the United States; and apply bioclimatic projections from downscaled climate models to assess geospatial shifts of AECs under current production practices. Two Random Forest variable selection algorithms, VarSelRF and Boruta, were used to identify relevant bioclimatic variables. Three bioclimatic variables were identified by VarSelRF as useful for predictive Random Forest modeling of six AECs: (1) Holdridge evapotranspiration index; (2) spring precipitation (March, April and May); and (3) precipitation of the warmest four-month season (June, July, August and September). Super-imposing future climate scenarios onto current agricultural production systems resulted in significant geospatial shifts in AECs. The Random Forest model projected a 58% and 63% increase in area under dynamic annual crop-fallow-transition (AC-T) and dynamic grain-fallow (GF) AECs, respectively. By contrast, a 46% decrease in area was projected for stable AC-T and dynamic annual crop (AC) AECs across all future time periods for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. For the same scenarios, the stable AC and GF AECs showed the least declines in area (8% and 13%, respectively), compared to other AECs. Future spatial shifts from stable to dynamic AECs, particularly to dynamic AC-T and dynamic GF AECs would result in more use of fallow, a greater hazard for soil erosion, greater cropping system uncertainty, and potentially less cropping system flexibility.

Unfortunately, rigid fixtures and special purpose robotic tools often have to be customized for varying geometries. Alternatively, it is possible to operate in a semi-structured environment, defined by the use of softer fixtures (e.g. pickup bin) and softer robotic tools (e.g. suction cups or compliant pads) that can be used for many assembly applications without modification, but they demand specific motion plans that can tolerate greater positional uncertainty. We have developed a system that supports autonomous generation of parameterized fine motion plans for assembly that are robust under positional uncertainty and compliance introduced by the use of a suction cup instead of a gripper. To accomplish this a classifier is trained, implemented and tested for performance in the semi-structured environment for distinguishing between a failed or successful assembly.

Generally, the method of selecting and qualifying team member is often based on familiarity and personal relationships, in which the competency difference of each team candidate was not highly prioritized. Thus, this would affect project performance and potential of success. This research aims to propose method in recruiting team members based on the matching of appropriateness between individual competency and organizational expectation and expectable outcomes from each project. The applied feature selection methods were 1) Information Gain (IG) and 2) Chi Squared (CHI) in the selection of the appropriate personal characteristics. To characterize personal basic competencies all three methods such as Naive Bayes: NB, Support Vector Machine: SVM and Decision Tree: DTREE were adopted. The results show that Feature selection with Information Gain, yielded better consistence but less time reduction compared to the Chi Squared. Moreover, with competency-based qualifying method, there was 8.02% team classification efficiency increased, compared to personal relationship based method. Conclusively, team selection method based on the appropriate feature, with individual competency-based and classification by support vector machine method demonstrates the best performance in which F 1 measured is 88.16%", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDIM.2014.6991428", "venue": "Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)", "journal": "Ninth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2014)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2006269622", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23511819", "21895572", "154417584", "68135294", "27538714", "45410318", "14311264", "6810945", "2427083", "106425970"], "inbound_citations": ["199540970"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14049836"}

Real-time closed-loop neural feedback control requires the analysis of action potential traces within several milliseconds after they have been recorded from the brain. The current generation of spike clustering algorithms were mostly designed for off-line use and also require a significant amount of computational resources. A new spike clustering algorithm, termed \"Enhanced Growing Neural Gas (EGNG)\", was therefore developed that is computationally lightweight and memory conserved. The EGNG algorithm can adapt to changes of the electrophysiological recording environment and can classify both pre-recorded and streaming action potentials. Approach. The algorithm only uses a small number of EGNG nodes and edges to learn the neural spike distributions which eliminates the need of retaining the neural data in the system memory to conserve computational resources. Most of the computations revolve around calculating Euclidian distances, which is computationally inexpensive and can be implemented in parallel using digital circuit technology. Main results. EGNG was evaluated off-line using both synthetic and pre-recorded neural spikes. Streaming synthetic neural spikes were also used to evaluate the ability of EGNG to classify action potentials in real-time. The algorithm was also implemented in hardware with a Field Programming Gate Array (FPGA) chip, and the worse-case clustering latency was 3.10 \u00b5s, allowing a minimum of 322,580 neural spikes to be clustered per second. Significance. The EGNG algorithm provides a viable solution to classification of neural spikes in real-time and can be implemented with limited computational resources as a front-end spike clustering unit for future tethered-free and miniaturized closed-loop neural feedback systems.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31071700", "doi": "10.1088/1741-2552/ab208c", "venue": "Journal of neural engineering", "journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "mag_id": "2944584528", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208234968"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149445153"}

SVM is a classical and effective method for fault classification of small sample, while it has difficulties in recognizing fault types, and its classification process is quite complicated. However, through analyzing the amplitude spectrums of CSBS can confirm the fault types more reliable and easy. Therefore, CSBS is merged into SVM for fault diagnosis. Firstly, CSBS utilize a couple of channels to synthesize the complex signals to acquire the parameters of positive and backward precession. The amplitude spectrums of each frequency are able to be composed through making full use of positive and backward precession parameters. Then, amplitude characteristic vectors can be employed as the input of SVM for fault status classification, and the amplitude spectrums of CSBS can confirm the types. There are two obvious advantages of this new method. On the one hand, CSBS can extract features more comprehensive that make the classification accuracy higher. On the other hand, through analyzing the amplitude spectrums of CSBS can get a more reliable diagnosis result. Finally, through a case study, this new method proved to be more reliable and efficient for fault diagnosis.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/chicc.2016.7554393", "venue": "2016 35th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)", "journal": "2016 35th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["63759679", "10208754", "7138354", "112000674", "122248239", "112445355", "206720046", "124848180", "40261067", "6039668"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23920499"}

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Max-Boost-GAN, which is demonstrated to boost the generative ability of GANs when the error of generation is upper bounded. Moreover, the Max-Boost-GAN can be used to learn the generation functions from two marginal probability distributions as the input, and samples of higher visual quality and variety could be generated from the joint probability distribution. Finally, novel objective functions are proposed for obtaining convergence during training the Max-Boost-GAN.

{"paper_id": "38814438", "title": "Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics", "authors": [{"first": "Jean", "middle": [], "last": "Christophe Nebel", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Since the term \u2018bioinformatics\u2019 was coined in 1970 [1], the field of bioinformatics has become relatively mature allowing high-throughput whole genome sequencing and making computer-aided drug design an essential part of drug discovery. With the needs of addressing ever more complex problems in a faster and more accurate manner, the bioinformatics community has exploited many different paradigms. Among them, \u2018Computational Intelligence\u2019 has proved particularly effective since nature-inspired computational approaches are able to extract patterns from large volumes of data, infer rules from sets of examples and adapt according to changing data and/or contexts [2]. Many of those methods have been applied to bioinformatics; they include: Artificial Immune Systems [3], Bayesian Networks [4], Evolutionary Algorithms [5], Fuzzy Logic [6], Hidden Markov Models [7], Neural Networks [8], Rough Sets [9], Support Vector Machines (SVM) [10] and Swarm Intelligence [11]. In this special issue, we present six papers that illustrate the latest applications of Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics.Since more and more protein structure prediction tools are now available, it is crucial to be able to assess the quality of the generated models. Using features extracted from sequence alignment between a target and its template(s), Deng et al. [12] developed a SVM-based method to predict the quality score of a model. High correlation between predicted and actual values showed the effectiveness of their method. Unlike the previous case, the choice of features may not be intuitive. As a consequence, selection methods are required before classification to prevent redundancy and the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. To design a system to identify and classify nuclear receptors into sub-families, Wang and Xiao [13], first, applied the sequential forward selection heuristic method to select the most appropriate sequence based features and, second, fed them to an SVM classifier. Rigorous evaluation revealed average prediction accuracies well-over 90%, which makes their predictor extremely valuable for the discovery of new drug-targets. When analysing data such as gene expression data where the number of features can be two orders of magnitude higher than the number of samples, advanced feature reduction is essential to produce robust classifiers. Xu et al. [14] presented a new procedure based on the discriminative or predictive ability of variables via bootstrapped ROCAUCs (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves). Simulations demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed methodology to build predictive models from bioinformatics data.Since generally combining predictions of a set of classifiers produces more accurate predictions than the individual classifiers, Nguyen et al. [15] adopted an assemble approach in order to reconstruct metabolic networks. Taking advantage of the duality between metabolic gap filling and protein function prediction, they designed an indirect approach based on retrofitting outputs from several function predictors. Conducted experiments established the validity of their original approach, which would benefit further from integration of additional classifiers.Also building on the fact that convergent predictions from different sources provide a way to increase result reliability, Holien et al. [16] used two docking algorithms to gain insights into interactions between inhibitors of a picornavirus RNA polymerase and their target. Discovery of structure-activity relationships should contribute to the design of more potent drugs for the treatment of infections.Exploiting tools relying on dynamic programming and suffix arrays, Anupama et al. [17] performed an evolutionary analysis of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats (CRISPRs) in archaea genomes. In addition to identification of novel CRISPRs, authors presented evidence supporting that CRISPRs are the product of horizontal gene transfer.As demonstrated by these articles, usage of Computational Intelligence has been spreading in bioinformatics. The excellent match between this paradigm and, the nature and complexity of bioinformatics problems makes it suitable for a wide range of applications from sequence annotation, microarray interpretation to protein structure analysis. There is no doubt that in the coming years the impact of Computational Intelligence will grow further, leading to even better understanding of biological data.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4172/jpb.S9-e001", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Proteomics & Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1980622561", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38814438"}

In the Optical Character Recognition (OCR), we need to erase all seals due to some special reason like improving the performance of invoices and receipts recognition. However, owing to the diversity of the shape, color and position of the seals, it is very difficult to erase all seals without affecting the original information of the invoices and receipts. At present, there are two common methods to erase seals, one is from the perspective of computer graphics, the other is from the perspective of computer software, like PhotoShop. Nevertheless, the common weakness is the poor robustness and inefficient. So, In this paper, We propose an end-to-end network for erasing seals, and we have four contributions. (1) We first propose a universal framework to do the seals erasing by using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). (2) Training the seals erasing network by the images synthesised by scripts and seals crawled on the website, instead of spending high cost to collect images by ourselves. (3) In terms of speed, due to using end-to-end predict script, using our method to erase all seals on the 512 * 512 RGB image with padding is only 800 ms, much faster than the traditional methods.

Disabled patients with appropriate physical care and cognitive ability to communicate with their social environment continue to live with a reasonable quality of life over extended periods of time. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique which utilizes light in the near-infrared range (700 to 1000 nm) to determine cerebral oxygenation, blood flow and metabolic status of localized regions of the brain. In this paper, we describe a study conducted to test the feasibility of using multichannel NIRS in the development of a BCI. We used a continuous wave 20-channel NIRS system over the motor cortex of 5 healthy volunteers to measure oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes during left-hand and right-hand motor imagery. We present results of signal analysis indicating that there exist distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses which could be utilized in a pattern classifier towards developing a BCI. We applied two different pattern recognition algorithms separately, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to classify the data offline.

All p-values obtained in different tests were corrected for multiplicity by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR).ResultsThe results indicate that this panel of NAPEs is able to distinguish female PD patients from the corresponding healthy controls. Further to this, the observed downregulation of these NAPEs is in line with the results in plasma of a mouse model of Parkinson\u2019s (6-OHDA).ConclusionsIn the current study we have shown the downregulation of NAPEs in plasma of PD patients and we thus speculate that these lipids might serve as candidate biomarkers for PD.

Ensemble learning approaches have been used previously to tackle this challenge. However, passive scheme based implementation leads to poor efficiency while increasing high computational cost. This paper presents a novel integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive ensemble learning (CSE-UAEL) to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI) related EEG classification. The proposed method first employs an exponentially weighted moving average model to detect the covariate shifts in the common spatial pattern features extracted from MI related brain responses. Then, a classifier ensemble was created and updated over time to account for changes in streaming input data distribution wherein new classifiers are added to the ensemble in accordance with estimated shifts. Furthermore, using two publicly available BCI-related EEG datasets, the proposed method was extensively compared with the state-of-the-art single-classifier based passive scheme, single-classifier based active scheme and ensemble based passive schemes.

This paper presents an improved approach for tracking and recovering the 3D position and orientation of a human hand using the Kinect sensor. The basic idea of the proposed method is to solve an optimization problem that minimizes the discrepancy in 3D shape between an actual hand observed by Kinect and a hypothesized 3D hand model. Since each of the 3D hand pose has 23 degrees of freedom, the hand articulation tracking needs computational excessive burden in minimizing the 3D shape discrepancy between an observed hand and a 3D hand model. For this, we first created a 3D hand model which represents the hand with 17 different parts. Secondly, Random Forest classifier was trained on the synthetic depth images generated by animating the developed 3D hand model, which was then used for Haar-like feature-based classification rather than performing per-pixel classification. Classification results were used for estimating the joint positions for the hand skeleton. Through the experiment, we were able to prove that the proposed method showed improvement rates in hand part recognition and a performance of 20-30 fps. The results confirmed its practical use in classifying hand area and successfully tracked and recovered the 3D hand pose in a real time fashion.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3837/tiis.2015.08.023", "venue": "TIIS", "journal": "TIIS", "mag_id": "2296394598", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1801469"}

Different from perturbation-based attacks, we propose to synthesize unrestricted adversarial examples entirely from scratch using conditional generative models. Specifically, we first train an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) to model the class-conditional distribution over data samples. Then, conditioned on a desired class, we search over the AC-GAN latent space to find images that are likely under the generative model and are misclassified by a target classifier.

Remote sensing techniques are more efficient and appropriate for estimating forest canopy cover (CC) than traditional methods, especially at large scales. In this study, we evaluated the CC of black locust plantations on the Loess Plateau using random forest (RF) regression models. The models were established using the relationships between digital hemispherical photograph (DHP) field data and variables that were calculated from satellite images. Three types of variables were calculated from the satellite data: spectral variables calculated from a multispectral image, textural variables calculated from a panchromatic image (Tpan) with a 15 \u00d7 15 window size, and textural variables calculated from spectral variables (TB+VIs) with a 9 \u00d7 9 window size. We compared different mtry and ntree values to find the most suitable parameters for the RF models. The results indicated that the RF model of spectral variables explained 57% (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.06) of the variability in the field CC data. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were more important than other spectral variables. The RF model of Tpan obtained higher accuracy (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.05) than the spectral variables, and the grey level co-occurrence matrix-based texture measure\u2014Correlation (COR) was the most important variable for Tpan.

However, such an analysis needs for an initial reconstruction stage that is devoted to map the studied voice recordings onto phase space. Mapping is usually carried out using a uniform embedding. Nonetheless, the uniform embedding might be no the optimal for biosignal processing having different timescales, i.e. a short lag is optimal for high frequency components whereas a long lag is related to low frequency components and modulations, so, to get a unique optimal value lag leads to inadequate processing for both timescales.

There is however a trade-off between the expressive power of the representation and the computational costs.

Searching the hypothesis space bounded below by a bottom clause is the basis of several state-of-the-art ILP systems (e.g. Progol and Aleph). However, the structure of the search space and the properties of the refinement operators for theses systems have not been previously characterised. The contributions of this thesis can be summarised as follows: (i) characterising the properties, structure and morphisms of bounded subsumption lattice (ii) analysis of bounded refinement operators and stochastic refinement and (iii) implementation and empirical evaluation of stochastic search algorithms and in particular a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach for bounded subsumption. In this thesis we introduce the concept of bounded subsumption and study the lattice and cover structure of bounded subsumption. We show the morphisms between the lattice of bounded subsumption, an atomic lattice and the lattice of partitions. We also show that ideal refinement operators exist for bounded subsumption and that, by contrast with general subsumption, efficient least and minimal generalisation operators can be designed for bounded subsumption. In this thesis we also show how refinement operators can be adapted for a stochastic search and give an analysis of refinement operators within the framework of stochastic refinement search. We also discuss genetic search for learning first-order clauses and describe a framework for genetic and stochastic refinement search for bounded subsumption.

However, obtaining labeled data is very expensive, time consuming and difficult in real-life practical situations as labeling a data set requires the effort of a human expert. On the other side, unlabeled data are often plentiful which makes it relatively inexpensive and easier to obtain. Semi-Supervised Learning methods strive to utilize this plentiful source of unlabeled examples to increase the learning capacity of the classifier particularly when amount of labeled examples are restricted. Since SSL techniques usually reach higher accuracy and require less human effort, they attract a substantial amount of attention both in practical applications and theoretical research. A novel semi-supervised methodology is offered in this study. This algorithm utilizes a new method to predict the class labels of unlabeled examples in a corpus and incorporate them into the training set to build a better classifier. The approach presented here depends on a meaning calculation, which computes the words\u2019 meaning scores in the scope of classes. Meaning computation is constructed on the Helmholtz principle and utilized to various applications in the field of text mining like feature extraction, information retrieval and document summarization. Nevertheless, according to the literature, ILBOM is the first work which uses meaning calculation in a semi-supervised way to construct a semantic smoothing kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM). Evaluation of the proposed methodology is done by performing various experiments on standard textual datasets. ILBOM's experimental results are compared with three baseline algorithms including SVM using linear kernel which is one of the most frequently used algorithms in text classification field.

Since existing equations are incapable of estimating the discharge coefficient of stepped spillway accurately, other approaches such as data driven techniques can be employed as an alternative which are useful in modeling processes when the physical knowledge is limited. For this purpose, Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as data driven methods were applied for the modeling discharge coefficient of the stepped spillways using data derived from physical models and original experiments under nappe and skimming flow regimes. The input parameters included different dimensionless geometric and hydraulic parameters of napped and skimming regimes data. The obtained results indicated that the applied methods have a high capability in the modeling of discharge coefficient for the stepped spillways. The model comprised of four input parameters used for modeling of the discharge coefficient in nappe flow showed more accurate results (%RMSE = 0.042, 0.328 and R2 = 0.966, 0.961 for the SVM and GEP models, respectively). In skimming flow data, the model with five input parameters produced RMSE = 0.015, 0.357 and R2 = 0.987, 0.979 in SVM and GEP, respectively. A comparison of the GEP and SVM results with the obtained results from the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) showed that the performance of the linear model (i.e., MLR) was not suitable because the phenomenon of discharge coefficient is inherently complex and nonlinear. The results of sensitivity analysis for both proposed methods showed that the Fr1 and H/y1 parameters in nappe flow and Fr1 and Re parameters in skimming flow had the most important influence on modeling of the stepped spillways discharge coefficient. The results also revealed that the SVM relatively surpassed the GEP in the modeling of discharge coefficient.

All soil logTC models showed excellent performance based on all three methods with R2 > 0.86, bias 2.70% , and ratio of prediction error to inter-quartile range (RPIQ) > 4.54. PLSR performed substantially better than SVM to scale and transfer models. Upscaled soil TC models performed somewhat better in terms of model fit (R2), RPD, and RPIQ, whereas downscaled models showed less bias and smaller RMSE based on PLSR.

As a result, we found the following: LDA reaches 89,5% of accuracy to discriminante Mass or Non-Mass and 95,2% to discriminate Benign or Malignant in DDSM database and in MIAS database we obtained 85 % to discriminate Mass or Non-Mass and 88% of to discriminate Benign or Malignant; SVM reaches 99,6% of accuracy to discriminate Mass or Non-Mass and 99,5% to discriminate Benign or Malignat in DDSM database and in MIAS database we obtained 97% to discriminate Mass or Non-Mass and 100% to discriminate Benign or Malignant.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITAB.2007.4407389", "venue": "2007 6th International Special Topic Conference on Information Technology Applications in Biomedicine", "journal": "2007 6th International Special Topic Conference on Information Technology Applications in Biomedicine", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2159188841", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14187059", "21347213", "1963774", "9353234", "3334390", "56649461", "198120196", "194951", "204014056", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["122128145", "14339720", "1956277", "30879422"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15426773"}

Then, fault location algorithm is ac- tivated as the result of fault classification. Different kinds of methods such as multilevel wavelet transform and support vector machine have been combined in a set to determine fault classification and location at every time.

Our previous work showed the tissue-specific textures can be enhanced by extracting the tissue-specific MRF from the to-be-reconstructed subject\u2019s previous full-dose CT (FdCT) scans. However, the same subject\u2019s FdCT scans might not be available in some applications. To address this limitation, we have also investigated the feasibility of extracting the tissue-specific textures from an existing FdCT database instead of the to-be-reconstructed subject. This study aims to implement a machine learning strategy to realize the feasibility. Specifically, we trained a Random Forest (RF) model to learn the intrinsic relationship between the tissue textures and subjects\u2019 physiological features. By learning this intrinsic correlation, this model can be used to identify one MRF candidate from the database as the prior knowledge for any subject\u2019s current ULdCT image reconstruction. Besides the conventional physiological factors (like body mass index: BMI, gender, age), we further introduced another two features LungMark and BodyAngle to address the scanning position and angle. The experimental results showed that the BMI and LungMark are two features of the most importance for the classification. Our trained model can predict 0.99 precision at the recall rate of 2%, which means that for each subject, there will be 3390*0.02 = 67.8 valid MRF candidates in the database, where 3,390 is the total number of candidates in the database. Moreover, it showed that introducing the ULdCT texture prior into the RF model can increase the recall rate by 3% while the precision remaining 0.99.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2512787", "venue": "Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2920636585", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["40103780", "12215253", "40513319", "46043475", "20118944", "20922780", "58616105", "2469856"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86507100"}

In this paper we are trying to classify a war scene from the natural scene. For this purpose two set of image categories are taken viz., opencountry & war tank. By using Haar and Daubechies(db4) wavelets, features are extracted from the images. The extracted features are trained and tested with (i) Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) using feed forward back propagation algorithm and (ii) Support Vector Machines(SVM) using radial basis kernel function with p=5. The comparative results are proving efficiency of Artificial Neural Networks towards war scene classification problems by using Wavelet feature extraction method. Although this study has been the first step of the research in the area of scene classification, the results have shown that the war scenes can be successfully classified from opencountry.

Photovoltaic (PV) systems have experienced a wide and high increase in their adoption as an energy source over the last years. Hence, it has become increasingly important to understand technical challenges, facing high penetration of PV systems on the grid, especially considering the effects of uncertainty and intermittency of this source on power quality, reliability and stability of the electric distribution system. On the other hand, the connections for distributed generators, by PV panels, changes the voltage profile on low voltage power systems. This fact can affect the distribution networks onto which they are attached causing overvoltage, undervoltage, frequency oscillations and changes in protection design. In order to predict these disturbances, due to this PV penetration, this article analyzes seven training algorithms used in artificial neural networks, with NARX architecture, for the generated active power estimating, and thus the state of the distribution network onto which these micro generators are connected and then compare their best statistical results with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Kalman filter (KF) techniques. The results show that the best training algorithm used for the ANN learning obtained a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.02%, while the SVM and KF techniques obtained 0.33% and 3.41%, respectively. Taking in account the other statistical analysis, we concluded that artificial neural networks are more suitable for this type of problem than SVM and KF.

Through recent advances using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for cross-modal generation, several generative methods have been investigated for ZSL to classify unseen categories with synthetic samples. However, these GAN-based ZSL approaches still struggle to generate samples with semantic consistency and significant between-class discrepancy while preserving within-class diversity, which are vital to building classifiers for unseen classes. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a robust dual-stream GAN to synthesize satisfactory samples for zero-shot visual classification. In more detail, the inter-class discrepancy is maximized by a backbone compatibility loss, which drives the center of the synthesized samples to move towards the center of real samples of the same class while moving further away from samples of different classes. Secondly, in order to preserve the intra-class diversity ignored by most extant paradigms, we propose a stochastic dispersion regularization to encourage the synthesized samples to be distributed at arbitrary points in the visual space of their categories. Finally, unlike previous methods that project visual samples back into semantic space and consequently cause an information degradation problem, we design a dual-stream generator to synthesize visual samples and reconstruct semantic embedding simultaneously, thereby ensuring semantic consistency.

Thus, reducing these, it would decrease the number of crashes on the road and, with that, the human, sanitary and environmental costs. There is a clear need of establishing these bases, since in a close future, on the automotive world, the driver will have a higher information volume to manage and, this management must be done adequately for the correct incorporation of the cutting edge technologies on the vehicle without having negative effects. In this project it has been studied the current normative, both the European and the global one, for the HMI's design implemented in the vehicles. After that, the current technology for the interaction with this HMI is analyzed and, thinking on the future, it is evaluated the best communication channel between the driver and his car. To conclude the project, and after analyzing different communication ways, some conclusions have been reached, for instance the interaction with the radio functionalities is better through the physical commands on the steering wheel, on the other hand, the navigation functionalities are better controlled through voice. Furthermore, the implementation based on gestures is proposed for several functions.

These moderated sampling probabilities are, inspired by empirical Bayes, learned from the data at hand. We demonstrate the co-data moderated Random Forest (CoRF) with two examples. In the first example we aim to predict the presence of a lymph node metastasis with gene expression data. We demonstrate how a set of external p-values, a gene signature, and the correlation between gene expression and DNA copy number can improve the predictive performance. In the second example we demonstrate how the prediction of cervical (pre-)cancer with methylation data can be improved by including the location of the probe relative to the known CpG islands, the number of CpG sites targeted by a probe, and a set of p-values from a related study. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The proposed method is able to utilize auxiliary co-data to improve the performance of a Random Forest.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1706.00641", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5745983", "pubmed_id": "29281963", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-017-1993-1", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2620723361,2952746199", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16923292", "6640794", "761622", "16300010", "2208574", "89141", "12140952", "15245447", "17266511", "206420153", "214750992", "27157154", "15291004", "2003897", "21014710", "122906757", "19011676", "27787589", "4464124", "5720941", "20087850", "18937759", "16042833", "17715957", "2491118", "4719949", "8600246", "5883609", "122185949", "11534580", "13443255", "214946103", "2526787"], "inbound_citations": ["53410802", "215425641", "214714681"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7750150"}

First, we transfer information from known to novel categories by incorporating external knowledge, such as linguistic or expert-specified information, e.g., by a mid-level layer of semantic attributes. Second, we exploit the manifold structure of novel classes. More specifically we adapt a graph-based learning algorithm - so far only used for semi-supervised learning -to zero-shot and few-shot learning. Third, we improve the local neighborhood in such graph structures by replacing the raw feature-based representation with a mid-level object- or attribute-based representation.

Aiming at debiasing feature selection in RFs, we propose a new RF algorithm, called xRF, to select good features in learning RFs for high-dimensional data. We first remove the uninformative features using p-value assessment, and the subset of unbiased features is then selected based on some statistical measures. This feature subset is then partitioned into two subsets. A feature weighting sampling technique is used to sample features from these two subsets for building trees.

We consider two ways of encoding the reaction mechanism in descriptors, and also three approaches that encode only the overall chemical reaction. Both cross-validation and also an external test set are used.ResultsThe three descriptor sets encoding overall chemical transformation perform better than the two descriptions of mechanism. SVM and RF models perform comparably well; kNN is less successful. Oxidoreductases and hydrolases are relatively well predicted by all types of descriptor; isomerases are well predicted by overall reaction descriptors but not by mechanistic ones.ConclusionsOur results suggest that pairs of similar enzyme reactions tend to proceed by different mechanisms. Oxidoreductases, hydrolases, and to some extent isomerases and ligases, have clear chemical signatures, making them easier to predict than transferases and lyases. We find evidence that isomerases as a class are notably mechanistically diverse and that their one shared property, of substrate and product being isomers, can arise in various unrelated ways.The performance of the different machine learning algorithms is in line with many cheminformatics applications, with SVM and RF being roughly equally effective. kNN is less successful, given the role that non-local information plays in successful classification.

Design Retrospective cohort study, minimal follow-up time of 2 years.

Patients or Participants Pre-menopausal women (18+) who have had an EA for heavy menstrual bleeding between January 2004 & April 2013. A total number of 446 patients were eligible for analysis. Interventions Used ablation methods were Cavatherm (Veldana Medical SA, Morges, Switzerland), Gynecare Thermachoice (Ethicon, Sommerville, US.) and Thermablate EAS (Idoman, Ireland). Used interventions and other ablation techniques had the same outcomes according to previously published literature.

The random forest model was trained in MATLAB (2018b) using the TreeBagger function in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. The prediction model based on a multivariate logistic regression analysis had an AUC of 0.71. The machine learning model had an AUC of 0.63 and an AUC of 0.65 after hyperparameter optimization. Conclusion Based on the preliminary results, we can conclude that the random forest model in this case is not better than the logistic regression model to predict the outcome of surgical re-intervention within two years after EA. In summary, the performance of a random forest clinical prediction model is not necessarily superior to a logistic regression model.

This work shows how machine learning can be used for the prediction of a cut-in manoeuvre of a vehicle, which we refer to as target vehicle, from a host vehicle perspective. A real-life driving experiment was performed to measure several cut-ins that were manually annotated. Measurements are gathered with a lidar installed on the host vehicle and consequently used to train several well-known machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Adaboost and an Ensemble of the previous models. The Ensemble model achieves the best results. This method is capable of predicting cut-ins prior to their occurrence, with an $f_{1}$ score of 62:28% on the test set.

A key issue in this approach is the policy for working set selection. We would like to find policies that realize (as well as possible) three goals simultaneously: ''(fast) convergence to an optimal solution'', ''efficient procedures for working set selection'', and ''a high degree of generality'' (including typical variants of SVM-optimization as special cases). In this paper, we study a general policy for working set selection that has been proposed in [Nikolas List, Hans Ulrich Simon, A general convergence theorem for the decomposition method, in: Proceedings of the 17th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, 2004, pp. 363-377] and further analyzed in [Nikolas List, Hans Ulrich Simon, General polynomial time decomposition algorithms, in: Proceedings of the 17th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, 2005, pp. 308-322]. It is known that it efficiently approaches feasible solutions with minimum cost for any convex quadratic optimization problem. Here, we investigate its computational complexity when it is used for SVM-optimization. It turns out that, for a variable size of the working set, the general policy poses an NP-hard working set selection problem. But a slight variation of it (sharing the convergence properties with the original policy) can be solved in polynomial time. For working sets of fixed size 2, the situation is even better. In this case, the general policy coincides with the ''rate certifying pair approach'' (introduced by Hush and Scovel). We show that maximum rate certifying pairs can be found in linear time, which leads to a quite efficient decomposition method with a polynomial convergence rate for SVM-optimization.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.tcs.2007.03.041", "venue": "Theor.

This method can also locate and separate different signals at the same time. Second, after the camera points in the direction of the estimated angle, the proposed state-transition support vector machine is used to provide favorable discriminability for human behavior identification. A new Markov random field (MRF) function based on the localized contour sequence (LCS) is also presented while the system computes transition probabilities between states. Such LCS-based MRF functions can effectively smooth transitions and enhance recognition. The experimental results show that the average error of DOA decreases to around 7\u00b0, which is better than those of the baselines.

Four study areas with different sensors and scene characteristics were investigated. First, the Digital Surface Model (DSM) was generated for the first and last pulses and then the differences between the first and last pulses (FP-LP) were computed. A total of 25 uncorrelated feature attributes have been generated from the aerial images, the lidar intensity image, DSM and FP-LP. The generated attributes were applied in seven separate groups which include those from: Red, Green and Blue bands of the aerial image; Intensity/IR image; DSM; FP-LP and the Total group of attributes. Finally, SVMs were used to automatically classify buildings, trees, roads and ground from aerial images, lidar data and the generated attributes, with the most accurate average classifications of 95% being achieved. The Gaussian Radius Basis Function (RBF) kernel model was applied to find the separating hyperplane for the SVMs classification. A binary image was then generated by converting the digital numbers of roads and grass to one while the digital numbers of buildings and trees were converted to zeros and all DSM\u2019s pixels which correspond to a pixel value of one in the binary image were interpolated into a grid DTM. The interpolated DTM was then smoothed by a low-pass filter to remove low vegetation and other objects which might be classified as ground. After that the original 3D lidar point clouds was compared against the smoothed DTM and labeled as ground or non-ground based on a predefined threshold of 30 cm. To meet the objectives, the filtered data was compared against reference data that was generated manually and both omission and commission errors were calculated. Further, we evaluated the contributions of each group of attributes to the quality of the filtering process. The results showed that the accuracy of the results was improved by fusing lidar data with multispectral images regardless of the complexity of the terrain being filtered.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2142692619", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["38424007", "55732144"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17681380"}

In addition, the land outside the National Park belongs to two different systems of ownership, namely \u201ccommon\u201d (i.e. community-owned) and \u201cnot-common\u201d (privately or governmentally owned) land. In this paper, we investigated how the state of protection and the ownership affected the land use and land cover. We derived maps using Landsat images from 1989, 1998 and 2014 by supervised classification with Random Forests. To compensate for the lack of ground data we inferred past land use and land cover from recent observations combining photographs, Google Earth images and change detection. We could identify four classes, namely shrub land, forest, patchy vegetation and agricultural area. The Matobo National Park showed a stable composition of land cover during the study period and the main changes were observable in the surroundings. Outside the national park, forest increased by about 7%. The common lands have changed substantially and their agricultural area decreased. We attribute this development to the Fast Track Land Reform, which took place in the early 2000s.

Developing novel genotypic methods that offer the ability to distinguish clinical from environmental strains could help to focus on more relevant (virulent) Legionella species in control efforts. Mixed-genome microarray data can be used to perform a comparative-genome analysis of strain collections, and advanced statistical approaches, such as the Random Forest algorithm are available to process these data. Methods: Microarray analysis was performed on a collection of 222 Legionella pneumophila strains, which included patient-derived strains from notified cases in the Netherlands in the period 2002-2006 and the environmental strains that were collected during the source investigation for those patients within the Dutch National Legionella Outbreak Detection Programme. The Random Forest algorithm combined with a logistic regression model was used to select predictive markers and to construct a predictive model that could discriminate between strains from different origin: clinical or environmental. Results: Four genetic markers were selected that correctly predicted 96% of the clinical strains and 66% of the environmental strains collected within the Dutch National Legionella Outbreak Detection Programme. Conclusions: The Random Forest algorithm is well suited for the development of prediction models that use mixed-genome microarray data to discriminate between Legionella strains from different origin. The identification of these predictive genetic markers could offer the possibility to identify virulence factors within the Legionella genome, which in the future may be implemented in the daily practice of controlling Legionella in the public health environment. \u00a9 2012 Euser et al.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3475688", "pubmed_id": "23094048", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047437", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2156710026", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6661143", "11140539", "209173493", "22431158", "27256249", "33200746", "25860011", "37585745", "9948351", "39910068", "39827775", "32871284", "24757726", "40551485", "32886385", "15245447", "7469708", "11801266", "8832357", "782044", "8277971", "6174711", "21437817", "26381279", "7870316", "21375872", "5449255", "206774611"], "inbound_citations": ["214999476", "16406248", "583618", "1508972", "15401285"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5276930"}

It can be seen as a single, multi-class text classification task. It is concerned with writing style rather than topic matter. The scalability issue in traditional AA studies concerns the effect of data size, the amount of data per candidate author. This has not been probed in much depth yet, since most stylometry researches tend to focus on long texts per author or multiple short texts, because stylistic choices frequently occur less in such short texts. This paper investigates the task of authorship attribution on short historical Arabic texts written by10 different authors. Several experiments are conducted on these texts by extracting various lexical and character features of the writing style of each author, using N-grams word level (1,2,3, and 4) and character level (1,2,3, and 4) grams as a text representation. Then Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is employed in order to classify the texts to their authors. This is to show robustness of NB classifier in doing AA on very short-sized texts when compared to Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using dataset (called AAAT) which consists of 3 short texts per author\u2019s book, it is shown our method is at least as effective as Information Gain (IG) for the selection of the most significant n-grams. Moreover, the significance of punctuation marks is explored in order to distinguish between authors, showing that an increase in the performance can be achieved. As well, the NB classifier achieved high accuracy results.

In this paper, rough set classification (RSC), a modern learning algorithm, is used to rank the features extracted for detecting intrusions and generate intrusion detection models. Feature ranking is a very critical step when building the model. RSC performs feature ranking before generating rules, and converts the feature ranking to minimal hitting set problem addressed by using genetic algorithm (GA). This is done in classical approaches using Support Vector Machine (SVM) by executing many iterations, each of which removes one useless feature. Compared with those methods, our method can avoid many iterations. In addition, a hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to increase the convergence speed and decrease the training time of RSC. The models generated by RSC take the form of \u201cIF-THEN\u201d rules, which have the advantage of explication. Tests and comparison of RSC with SVM on DARPA benchmark data showed that for Probe and DoS attacks both RSC and SVM yielded highly accurate results (greater than 99% accuracy on testing set).", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "15323002", "doi": "10.1631/jzus.2004.1076", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2038065607", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["33479437", "14384192", "961425", "35168774", "115300554"], "inbound_citations": ["32128937", "16850664", "2573593", "36354415", "12148309", "18018414", "15015694"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5292333"}

Different from other transfer learning methods, it considers both spatial alignment and probability adaptation, so that, the probability distribution of the source domain data and the target domain data is as consistent as possible in the same feature space. The method first performs FSA, which maps the source domain and the target domain data to a low-dimensional common mapping space through different mapping matrices for preserving the structural information.

In the third step, the Common Spatial Pattern method is applied on fundamental sub-bands to prepare discriminative feature vector.

A key challenge is that accumulated number of observations in in-vitro drug responses varies greatly among different cancer types, where some tissues (such as bone and prostate) are understudied than the others. Thus, we aim to develop a drug synergy prediction model for understudied data-poor tissues as overcoming data scarcity problem. Results We collected a comprehensive set of genetic, molecular, phenotypic features for cancer cell lines from six different databases. We developed a drug synergy prediction model based on deep neural networks to integrate multi-modal input and utilize transfer learning from data-rich tissues to data-poor tissues. We showed improved accuracy in predicting drug synergy in understudied tissues without enough drug combination screening data nor after-treatment transcriptome. Our synergy prediction model can be used to rank synergistic drug combinations in understudied tissues and thus help prioritizing future in-vitro experiments.

However, the performance of face alignment is degraded greatly when the face image is partially occluded. In order to achieve better mapping between facial appearance features and shape increments, we propose a robust and occlusion-free face alignment algorithm in which a face de-occlusion module and a deep regression module are integrated into a cascaded deep generative regression model. The face de-occlusion module is a disentangled representation learning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which aims to locate occlusions and recover the genuine appearance from partially occluded face image. The deep regression module can enhance facial appearance representation by utilizing the recovered faces to obtain more accurate regressors. Then, by the cascaded deep generative regression model, we recover the partially occluded face image and achieve accurate locating of landmarks gradually. It is interesting to show that the cascaded deep generative regression model can effectively locate occlusions and recover more genuine faces, which can be further used to improve the performance of face alignment.

Previous attempts at constructing predictive models have been hindered by undersampling, and restriction to linear associations among variables, among other problems. To address these problems, we propose a novel Bayesian data-mining method called Bayesian Outcome Prediction with Ensemble Learning (BOPEL). BOPEL uses a Bayesian-network representation with boosting, to allow the detection of nonlinear multivariate associations, and incorporates resampling-based feature selection to prevent over-fitting caused by undersampling. We demonstrate the use of this approach in predicting conversion to AD in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), based on structural magnetic-resonance and magnetic-resonance- spectroscopy data. This study includes 26 subjects with amnestic MCI: the converter group (n = 8) met MCI criteria at baseline, but converted to AD within five years, whereas the non-converter group (n = 18) met MCI criteria at baseline and at follow-up. We found that BOPEL accurately differentiates MCI converters from non-converters, based on the baseline volumes of the left hippocampus, the banks of the right superior temporal sulcus, the right entorhinal cortex, the left lingual gyrus, and the rostral aspect of the left middle frontal gyrus. Prediction accuracy was 0.81, sensitivity was 0.63 and specificity was 0.89.

Effective segmentation of the LV is challenging due to low contrast, signal dropout and acoustic noise. In the situation where low level and region-based image cues are unable to define the LV boundary, shape prior models are critical to infer shape. These models perform well when there is low variability in the underlying shape subspace and the shape instance produced by appearance cues does not contain gross errors, however in the absence of these conditions results are often much poorer. In this paper, we first propose a shape model to overcome the problem of modelling complex shape subspaces. Our method connects the implicit relationship between image features and shape by extending graph regularized sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to jointly learn the structure and connection between two low dimensional manifolds comprising image features and shapes, respectively. We extend conventional NMF learning to an online learning-based approach where the input image is used to leverage the learning and connection of each manifold to the most relevant subspace regions. This ensures robust shape inference and a shape model constructed from contextually relevant shapes. A fully automatic segmentation approach using a probabilistic framework is then proposed to detect the LV endocardial border.

To this end, in this paper, we introduce the application of self- similarity surfaces for human action recognition.

These surfaces are obtained by matching a small patch, centered at a pixel, to its larger surroundings, aim- ing to capture similarities of a patch to its neighborhood. Once these surfaces are computed, we propose to transform these surfaces into Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG), which are then used to train Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Our novelty lies in recognizing the utility of these selfsimilarity surfaces for human action recognition. In addition, in contrast to Shechtman & Irani (CVPR'07), we compute only a few of these surfaces (two per frame) for our task.

Gait rehabilitative therapy has been widely adopted to help patients maximize community participation and living independence. To further improve the precision and efficiency of rehabilitative therapy, more objective methods need to be developed based on sensory data. In this paper, an algorithmic framework is proposed to provide classification of gait disorders caused by two common neurological diseases, stroke and Parkinson's Disease (PD), from ground contact force (GCF) data. An advanced machine learning method, multi-task feature learning (MTFL), is used to jointly train classification models of a subject's gait in three classes, post-stroke, PD and healthy gait. Gait parameters related to mobility, balance, strength and rhythm are used as features for the classification. Out of all the features used, the MTFL models capture the more important ones per disease, which will help provide better objective assessment and therapy progress tracking. To evaluate the proposed methodology we use data from a human participant study, which includes five PD patients, three post-stroke patients, and three healthy subjects. Despite the diversity of abnormalities, the evaluation shows that the proposed approach can successfully distinguish post-stroke and PD gait from healthy gait, as well as post-stroke from PD gait, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of at least 0.96. Moreover, the methodology helps select important gait features to better understand the key characteristics that distinguish abnormal gaits and design personalized treatment.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1612.02562", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CHASE.2017.78", "venue": "2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)", "journal": "2017 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949872497,2563060925", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["60320724", "31984607", "18078438", "16981562", "8348650", "11014310", "961861", "215652272", "125056589", "46166474", "20657277", "12334926", "40740060", "11226305", "13966138", "13715042", "2745737", "30765466", "25013446", "215219298", "8119890", "5041192", "55631959", "25703411", "44212158", "14555340", "46258746", "33338590", "3012051"], "inbound_citations": ["50785058", "3012051", "208205997", "73425357", "201098822", "53566279"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3012051"}

Existing object detection pipelines usually detect small objects through learning representations of all the objects at multiple scales. However, the performance gain of such ad hoc architectures is usually limited to pay off the computational cost. In this work, we address the small object detection problem by developing a single architecture that internally lifts representations of small objects to super-resolved ones, achieving similar characteristics as large objects and thus more discriminative for detection. For this purpose, we propose a new Perceptual Generative Adversarial Network (Perceptual GAN) model that improves small object detection through narrowing representation difference of small objects from the large ones. Specifically, its generator learns to transfer perceived poor representations of the small objects to super-resolved ones that are similar enough to real large objects to fool a competing discriminator. Meanwhile its discriminator competes with the generator to identify the generated representation and imposes an additional perceptual requirement - generated representations of small objects must be beneficial for detection purpose - on the generator.

Our main contribution is a novel system for automatic postnatal gestational age estimation using small sets of images of a newborn's face, foot and ear. Our two-stage architecture makes the most out of Convolutional Neural Networks trained on small sets of images to predict broad classes of gestational age, and then fuses the outputs of these discrete classes with a baby's weight to make fine-grained predictions of gestational age using Support Vector Regression. On a purpose-collected dataset of 130 babies, experiments show that our approach surpasses current automatic state-of-the-art postnatal methods and attains an expected error of 6 days.

Various methods of missense variants pathogenicity prediction have been developed by now.

Our meta-predictor combines outputs of various existing predictors, supplements them with an extended set of stability and structural features of the protein, as well as its physicochemical properties, and adds information about allele frequency from various datasets. We used such a supervised gene-specific meta-predictor approach to train the model on the CFTR gene, and to predict pathogenicity of about 1,000 variants of unknown significance that we collected from various publicly available and internal resources. Our CFTR-specific meta-predictor based on the Random Forest model performs better than other machine learning algorithms that we tested, and also outperforms other available tools, such as CADD, MutPred, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2. Our predicted pathogenicity probability correlates well with clinical measures of Cystic Fibrosis patients and experimental functional measures of mutated CFTR proteins. Training the model on one gene, in contrast to taking a genome wide approach, allows taking into account structural features specific for a particular protein, thus increasing the overall accuracy of the predictor. Collecting data from several separate resources, on the other hand, allows to accumulate allele frequency information, estimated as the most important feature by our approach, for a larger set of variants.

Recently, high-throughput techniques have been successfully used to investigate different aspects of the cell behaviour, opening new perspectives in fields such as molecular biology, medicine, and pharmacology. These advancements have led to the arising of new areas of research such as pharmacogenomics: the discipline studying the influence of genetic variations on drug response having the objective of optimizing drug therapies so to ensure the maximum of efficacy and the minimum of side effects. A crucial step in pharmacogenomics is the discovery of genes (biomarkers) that are responsible for drug responses. By using each gene as a 'feature' and the drug response as the 'class' to be predicted, the problem can be casted as the one of 'finding the set of features that allows the best prediction of the class'. This is a known machine learning task known as the 'feature selection problem'. Feature selection algorithms are usually classified into two categories: filter and wrapper approaches. In literature, several filter methods have been described for the task of detecting biomarkers. However, the kind of statistical analysis carried on by filter approaches cannot capture interactions among genes. Wrapper methods use the prediction performances of a given machine learning approach to assess the usefulness of a subset of genes. They consider reciprocity among genes and obtain remarkable performances. Nevertheless, the information about genes interactions in biological pathways is still missed. Methods. In this work we propose an integrated approach to detect biomarkers liable for cell lines responses to drug administration. Specifically, our approach integrates: i) a filter and a wrapper technique for biomarker discovering, and ii) different sources of knowledge, namely transcriptional profiles, drugs activity, and pathways interactions. The proposed approach is composed by two steps. In the first step, we apply a filter method to identify a set candidate biomarkers. This is a pre-processing method exploiting a priori knowledge about gene expression levels and gene interactions. In detail, we identify differential expressed genes using the Rank Product methodology. Then, we perform a pathway analysis for extracting genes (i.e. network hubs and bottlenecks) that are likely to be responsible for the measured differential gene expression levels. In the second step, we utilize a wrapper approach to single out biomarkers. To this purpose, we use multiple runs of a genetic algorithm to asses the importance of each candidate biomarker. Results. We use the NCI60 DNA panel to test our approach. It consists in an in vitro screening of several chemical compounds over 60 human cancer cell-lines. We select 118 drugs whose mechanisms of action are known. To assess the quality of the proposed approach, we compare the obtained accuracies to those of a rough wrapper technique, namely Random Forests. Random Forests has been considered standard 'tool-box of methods' for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data. We outperform Random Forests approach. Finally, we analyze the extracted biomarkers by using the 'Ingenuity systems' showing that they are strictly related to the targets of administrated drugs.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14806/ej.18.A.393", "venue": null, "journal": "EMBnet.journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1970355663", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42692040"}

We addressed this question with imaging of intrinsic optical signals from macaque VI.

We used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to determine the relative amount of information about a given attribute at each cortical location.

When there is a change in data, the classification models need to be adaptive to the changes.

This paper focuses on adaptive supervised learning techniques, where adaptivity to changes in data over time is achieved by selective training set methodology. These selective training set methods typically can be used plugging in various base classifiers. In this work we consider accuracy (generalization error) as the primary performance measure for concept drift learners. In this paper our research follows the three main drift types, starting from sudden drift, via gradual drift to reoccurring concepts. We give methodological contributions to concept drift phenomenon under real time application i.e. Electricity pricing contexts and expected change types. In this paper, a proposed methodology consist of four algorithms, first algorithm i.e. Optimal Window Resizing Algorithm under sudden drift to determine the optimal window length at a given time, identify to what extent a change point is different from the start of the training window and how this difference can be used to improve the accuracy of an adaptive learner. Second algorithm i.e. Gradual Drift algorithm which would unify two selection criteria: similarity in time and feature space to improve accuracy of an adaptive learner. Third algorithm i.e. Reoccurring Concept drift where previously seen patterns reoccur, but it is not certain when exactly and in what form they will repeat.

The optimization criterion for these machines is maximizing the margin between two classes, i.e. the distance between two parallel hyperplanes that split the vectors of each one of the two classes, since larger is the margin separating classes, smaller is the VC dimension of the learning machine, which theoretically ensures a good generalization performance (Vapnik, 1998), as it has been demonstrated in a number of real applications (Cristianini, 2000). In its formulation is applicable the kernel trick, which improves the capacity of these algorithms, learning not being directly performed in the original space of data but in a new space called feature space; for this reason this algorithm is one of the most representative of the called Kernel Machines (KMs). Main theory was originally developed on the sixties and seventies by V. Vapnik and A. Chervonenkis (Vapnik et al., 1963, Vapnik et al., 1971, Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik, 1998), on the basis of a separable binary classification problem, however generalization in the use of these learning algorithms did not take place until the nineties (Boser et al., 1992). SVMs has been used thoroughly in any kind of learning problems, mainly in classification problems, although also in other problems like regression (Scholkopf et al., 2004) or clustering (Ben-Hur et al., 2001). The fields of Optic Character Recognition (Cortes et al., 1995) and Text Categorization (Sebastiani, 2002) were the most important initial applications where SVMs were used. With the extended application of new kernels, novel applications have taken place in the field of Bioinformatics, concretely many works are related with the classification of data in Genetic Expression (Microarray Gene Expression) (Brown et al., 1997) and detecting structures between proteins and their relationship with the chains of DNA (Jaakkola et al., 2000).

Despite the efforts of its designers, APIs may suffer from a number of issues (such as incomplete or erroneous documentation, poor performance, and backward incompatibility). To maintain a healthy client base, API designers must learn these issues to fix them. Question answering sites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), has become a popular place for discussing API issues. These posts about API issues are invaluable to API designers, not only because they can help to learn more about the problem but also because they can facilitate learning the requirements of API users. However, the unstructured nature of posts and the abundance of non-issue posts make the task of detecting SO posts concerning API issues difficult and challenging. In this paper, we first develop a supervised learning approach using a Conditional Random Field (CRF), a statistical modeling method, to identify API issue-related sentences.

This survey presents an overview of existing research in metric learning, including recent progress on scaling to high-dimensional feature spaces and to data sets with an extremely large number of data points. A goal of the survey is to present as unified as possible a framework under which existing research on metric learning can be cast. The first part of the survey focuses on linear metric learning approaches, mainly concentrating on the class of Mahalanobis distance learning methods. We then discuss nonlinear metric learning approaches, focusing on the connections between the nonlinear and linear approaches. Finally, we discuss extensions of metric learning, as well as applications to a variety of problems in computer vision, text analysis, program analysis, and multimedia.

A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering technique was also employed to find homogeneous extracted sub-series9 clusters. As a complementary feature, extraction criterion of Mutual Information (MI) was utilized for proper cluster agent choice to impose to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) models (Feed Forward Neural Network, FFNN; Extreme Learning Machine, ELM; and Least Square Support Vector Machine, LSSVM) to predict the runoff of the LRW sub-basins.

The proposed method not only considers the prediction of the outlet runoff but also covers predictions of interior sub-basins behavior. The outcomes showed that the proposed AI-models combined with the SOM and MI tools enhanced the MS runoff prediction efficiency up to 23% in comparison with the Markovian-based models.

The resulting classifier, referred to as an ensemble classifier, is generally found to be more accurate than any of the individual classifiers making up the ensemble. As accuracy is the primary concern, much of the research in the field of land cover classification is focused on improving classification accuracy. This study compares the performance of four ensemble approaches (boosting, bagging, DECORATE and random subspace) with a univariate decision tree as base classifier. Two training datasets, one without ant noise and other with 20 percent noise was used to judge the performance of different ensemble approaches. Results with noise free data set suggest an improvement of about 4% in classification accuracy with all ensemble approaches in comparison to the results provided by univariate decision tree classifier. Highest classification accuracy of 87.43% was achieved by boosted decision tree. A comparison of results with noisy data set suggests that bagging, DECORATE and random subspace approaches works well with this data whereas the performance of boosted decision tree degrades and a classification accuracy of 79.7% is achieved which is even lower than that is achieved (i.e. 80.02%) by using unboosted decision tree classifier.

Fault present limiters (FCLs) are able to avoid all of these troublesome activities by restricting currents during faults and by improving the robustness of generator. The DUAL FCL positioning strategy is confirmed in a power network containing four buses in a ring agreement. The system receives power from turbo-generators (36 MW).

Recent research has shown that nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than their linear counterparts, but most of them cannot extract sufficient significant information which leads to a less efficient classification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called FDDL-ELM, which combines the discriminative power of extreme learning machine (ELM) with the reconstruction capability of sparse representation. Firstly, the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is adopted to perform spatial filtering on raw EEG data to enhance the task-related neural activity. Secondly, the Fisher discrimination criterion is employed to learn a structured dictionary and obtain sparse coding coefficients from the filtered data, and these discriminative coefficients are then used to acquire the reconstructed feature representations.

The restriction to positive semi definite kernels and a hilbert space is common to simplify the mathematical derivations of the respective learning methods, but is also limiting because more recent research indicates that non-metric, and therefore non positive semi definite, data representations are often more effective. This challenge is addressed by multiple approaches and recently dedicated algorithms for so called indefinite learning have been proposed. Along this line, the Kr\u0115in space Support Vector Machine (KSVM) and variants are very efficient classifiers for indefinite learning problems, but with a non-sparse decision function. This very dense decision function prevents practical applications due to a costly out of sample extension. We focus on this problem and provide two post processing techniques to sparsify models as obtained by a Kr\u0115in space SVM approach. In particular we consider the indefinite Core Vector Machine and indefinite Core Vector Regression Machine which are both efficient for psd kernels, but suffer from the same dense decision function, if the Kr\u0115in space approach is used. We evaluate the influence of different levels of sparsity and employ a Nystrom approach to address large scale problems.

Accurate and periodic wound assessment is important for optimal wound care. Automated wound diagnosis is beneficial for the aging population, to obtain a treatment-related decision for clinicians. Wound healing analysis can be done using image pre-processing, segmentation, and classification, with visual evaluation by a learned clinician. In this paper, we proposed fuzzy c-means clustering for wound image segmentation, in conjunction with the standard computational learning schemes: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayesian (NB) and Random Forest (RF). These techniques are useful for classifying the percent of wounded tissue in a segmented region. The color features observed in the imagery were expected to be helpful to enhance resolution. The histogram sampling method was found useful to provide a wider separation between wounded portions in the color space. The overall accuracy of our paradigm was measured with respect to images judged by an expert clinician, who manually traced the wound portions, i.e., for groundtruth images versus segmented wound images. The outcome of the proposed technique provided a 93.75% overall accuracy; whereas, using the Random Forest scheme with Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Naive Bayesian, we obtained 84.29%, 85.67%, and 78.66% accuracy, using manual segmentation as groundtruth.

Especially in advanced maths, the meaning of characters and symbols is highly domain dependent, and only limited information can be gained from considering individual formulae and their structures. Although many approaches have been proposed for semantic interpretation of mathematical formulae, most of them rely on the limited semantics from maths representation languages whereas very few use maths context as a source of information. This thesis presents a novel approach for principal extraction of semantic information of mathematical formulae from their context in documents. We utilised different supervised machine learning (SML) techniques (i.e. Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM) combined with Rprop- and Rprop+ optimisation algorithms) to detect definitions of simple and compound mathematical expressions, thereby deriving their meaning. The learning algorithms demand annotated corpus which its development considered as one of this thesis contributions. The corpus has been developed utilising a novel approach to extract desired maths expressions and sub-formulae and manually annotated by two independent annotators employing a standard measure for inter-annotation agreement.

Numerous publications show that SVMs outperform other learning methods in various areas. However, SVMs have a weak performance with large-scale data sets because of high computational complexity. One approach to overcome this limitation is the incremental learning approach where a large-scale data set is divided into several subsets and trained on those subsets updating the core information extracted from the previous subset. This approach also has a drawback that the core information is accumulated during the incremental procedure. When the large-scale data set has a special structure (e.g., in the case of unbalanced data set), the standard SVM might not perform properly. In this study, a novel approach based on the reduced convex hull concept is developed and applied in various applications. In addition, the developed concept is applied to the Support Vector Regression (SVR) to produce better performance. From the performed experiments, the incremental revised SVM significantly reduces the number of support vectors and requires less computing time. In addition the incremental revised SVR produces similar results with the standard SVR by reducing computing time significantly. Furthermore, the filter concept developed in this study may be utilized to reduce the computing time in other learning approach.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2565172639", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64266589"}

In this paper, we propose an integrated hierarchical learning framework, which is capable to perform the unsupervised feature learning, diagnostics and prognostics modeling together. The proposed method is based on Auto-Encoders (trained by considering the L1-norm penalty) and Extreme Learning Machines (trained by considering the L2-norm penalty). The proposed method is applied on two different case studies considering the diagnostics of motor bearings and prognostics of turbofan engines, also the performances are compared with other commonly applied PHM approaches and machine learning tools.

When coupled with transfer learning methods, Bayesian optimisation can leverage data from other function optimisations. A crucial requirement of transfer learning, however, is to restrict the transfer of knowledge only from related functions. Since the relatedness is not known a priori, selection of useful sources is an important problem. To address this problem, we propose a new method for optimal source selection for transfer learning in Bayesian optimisation. Using multi-armed bandits for source selection, we construct a new technique for identifying the optimal source and then use it for transfer learning in Bayesian optimisation. We show theoretically that the proposed technique is guaranteed to select the most related source and thus helps to improve the optimisation efficiency.

Separate models were trained for each outcome period, and several predictive models were tested. Random Forest models had good performance and calibration for all outcome periods, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of at least 0.96. This high performance was found to be due to non-linear interactions among variables in the data.

It is currently unknown how sensitive model performance is to changes in these configurations for the task of sentence classification. We thus conduct a sensitivity analysis of one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of architecture components on model performance; our aim is to distinguish between important and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence classification. We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex models) due to their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance, which makes it a modern standard baseline method akin to Support Vector Machine (SVMs) and logistic regression.

Many solutions have been presented in literature to deal with the problem of huge amount of data or imbalancing separately. In this paper we assessed the performances of a novel method, Parallel Selective Sampling (PSS), able to select data from the majority class to reduce imbalance in large data sets. PSS was combined with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. PSS-SVM showed excellent performances on synthetic data sets, much better than SVM. Moreover, we showed that on real data sets PSS-SVM classifiers had performances slightly better than those of SVM and RUSBoost classifiers with reduced processing times.

First, the gray difference between the image and the background is expanded by an adaptive nonlinear grayscale transformation. The improved OTSU threshold segmentation is used to extract the cracks, and the fracture points in the extracted results are connected by combining the extension direction of the fracture skeleton line and the gray feature of the crack edge to obtain the complete crack image. At the same time, the number of bifurcation points of the fracture skeleton line is calculated, a gray projection histogram of $X$ axis and $Y$ axis is obtained. Then, the classification characteristics of the cracks, such as the peak ratio of the gray histogram, the distribution ratio of the projection interval, and the mean square deviation ratio of the gray histogram are calculated. The obtained features are used as input to train a support vector machine classifier, which is then used to perform crack classification.

The k-fold cross-validation (k-fold CV) and the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) are two popular methods to obtain the best parameters setting. However, the computational costs of them are prohibitively expensive, especially for large-scale problems. Based on the observation of Smooth Support Vector Machine (SSVM) updating from the computation point of view, we proposed two efficient updating strategies by the Sherman-MorrisonWoodbury formula to reduce the cost of finding the Hessian inverse in this work. We introduced our two updating strategies in the k-fold CV and the LOOCV. It will dramatically reduce the computational cost and still can have the exact answers. In the experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of SSVM with we proposed strategies on several datasets. Two different types of datasets are chosen to demonstrate the advantage of two different strategies.

This new paradigm is changing into a personalized medicine where the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease is focused on individual patients. This paradigm is known as P4 medicine. Among other key benefits, P4 medicine aspires to detect diseases at an early stage and introduce diagnosis to stratify patients and diseases to select the optimal therapy based on individual observations and taking into account the patient outcomes to empower the physician, the patient, and their communication. This paradigm transformation relies on the availability of complex multi-level biomedical data that are increasingly accurate, since it is possible to find exactly the needed information, but also exponentially noisy, since the access to that information is more and more challenging. In order to take advantage of this information, an important effort is being made in the last decades to digitalize medical records and to develop new mathematical and computational methods for extracting maximum knowledge from patient records, building dynamic and disease-predictive models from massive amounts of integrated clinical and biomedical data. This requirement enables the use of computer-assisted Clinical Decision Support Systems for the management of individual patients. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) are computational systems that provide precise and specific knowledge for the medical decisions to be adopted for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and management of patients. The CDSS are highly related to the concept of evidence-based medicine since they infer medical knowledge from the biomedical databases and the acquisition protocols that are used for the development of the systems, give computational support based on evidence for the clinical practice, and evaluate the performance and the added value of the solution for each specific medical problem.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4995/Thesis/10251/17195", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2105788088", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["12577343", "52986498"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62565595"}

In this work, we investigate an agreement on the definitive features which should be used in phishing detection. We apply Fuzzy Rough Set (FRS) theory as a tool to select most effective features from three benchmarked data sets. The selected features are fed into three often used classifiers for phishing detection. To evaluate the FRS feature selection in developing a generalizable phishing detection, the classifiers are trained by a separate out-of-sample data set of 14,000 website samples. The maximum F-measure gained by FRS feature selection is 95% using Random Forest classification. Also, there are 9 universal features selected by FRS over all the three data sets. The F-measure value using this universal feature set is approximately 93% which is a comparable result in contrast to the FRS performance.

{"paper_id": "117090176", "title": "Learning with Feed-forward Neural Networks: Three Schemes to Deal with the Bias/Variance Trade-off", "authors": [{"first": "Enrique", "middle": ["Romero"], "last": "Merino", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In terms of the Bias/Variance decomposition, very flexible (i.e., complex) Supervised Machine Learning systems may lead to unbiased estimators but with high variance. A rigid model, in contrast, may lead to small variance but high bias. There is a trade-off between the bias and variance contributions to the error, where the optimal performance is achieved. In this work we present three schemes related to the control of the Bias/Variance decomposition for Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs) with the (sometimes modified) quadratic loss function: 1. An algorithm for sequential approximation with FNNs, named Sequential Approximation with Optimal Coefficients and Interacting Frequencies (SAOCIF). Most of the sequential approximations proposed in the literature select the new frequencies (the non-linear weights) guided by the approximation of the residue of the partial approximation. We propose a sequential algorithm where the new frequency is selected taking into account its interactions with the previously selected ones. The interactions are discovered by means of their optimal coefficients (the linear weights). A number of heuristics can be used to select the new frequencies. The aim is that the same level of approximation may be achieved with less hidden units than if we only try to match the residue as best as possible. In terms of the Bias/Variance decomposition, it will be possible to obtain simpler models with the same bias. The idea behind SAOCIF can be extended to approximation in Hilbert spaces, maintaining orthogonal-like properties. In this case, the importance of the interacting frequencies lies in the expectation of increasing the rate of approximation. Experimental results show that the idea of interacting frequencies allows to construct better approximations than matching the residue. 2. A study and comparison of different criteria to perform Feature Selection (FS) with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and the Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) procedure within the wrapper approach. FS procedures control the Bias/Variance decomposition by means of the input dimension, establishing a clear connection with the curse of dimensionality. Several critical decision points are studied and compared. First, the stopping criterion. Second, the data set where the value of the loss function is measured. Finally, we also compare two ways of computing the saliency (i.e., the relative importance) of a feature: either first train a network and then remove temporarily every feature or train a different network with every feature temporarily removed. The experiments are performed for linear and non-linear models. Experimental results suggest that the increase in the computational cost associated with retraining a different network with every feature temporarily removed previous to computing the saliency can be rewarded with a significant performance improvement, specially if non-linear models are used. Although this idea could be thought as very intuitive, it has been hardly used in practice. Regarding the data set where the value of the loss function is measured, it seems clear that the SBS procedure for MLPs takes profit from measuring the loss function in a validation set. A somewhat non-intuitive conclusion is drawn looking at the stopping criterion, where it can be seen that forcing overtraining may be as useful as early stopping. 3. A modification of the quadratic loss function for classification problems, inspired in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the AdaBoost algorithm, named Weighted Quadratic Loss (WQL) function. The modification consists in weighting the contribution of every example to the total error. In the linearly separable case, the solution of the hard margin SVM also minimizes the proposed loss function. The hardness of the resulting solution can be controlled, as in SVMs, so that this scheme may also be used for the non-linearly separable case. The error weighting proposed in WQL forces the training procedure to pay more attention to the points with a smaller margin. Therefore, variance tries to be controlled by not attempting to overfit the points that are already well classified. The model shares several properties with the SVMs framework, with some additional advantages. On the one hand, the final solution is neither restricted to have an architecture with so many hidden units as points (or support vectors) in the data set nor to use kernel functions. The frequencies are not restricted to be a subset of the data set. On the other hand, it allows to deal with multiclass and multilabel problems in a natural way. Experimental results are shown confirming these claims. A wide experimental work has been done with the proposed schemes, including artificial data sets, well-known benchmark data sets and two real-world problems from the Natural Language Processing domain. In addition to widely used activation functions, such as the hyperbolic tangent or the Gaussian function, other activation functions have been tested. In particular, sinusoidal MLPs showed a very good behavior. The experimental results can be considered as very satisfactory. The schemes presented in this work have been found to be very competitive when compared to other existing schemes described in the literature. In addition, they can be combined among them, since they deal with complementary aspects of the whole learning process.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1548974228", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117090176"}

Firstly, the algorithm uses the following parameters as input: horizontal reflectivity, differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, specific differential phase, standard deviation of horizontal reflectivity [SD(Zh)] and standard deviation of differential phase [SD($\\Phi_{DP}$)]. Secondly, the hydrometeor classification model is built through the processing of fuzzification, rule judgment, integration and deblurring. Due to errors in radar measurements and antenna beam broadening at longer distances, the result of the hydrometeor classification is inaccurate. To account for radar measurement errors and beam broadening, it makes some modifications based on the original algorithm. These modifications include an estimate of the confidence factors and the parameters of the melting layer. The confidence factors characterize the possible impacts of the radar measurement errors. The parameters of the melting layer are determined as functions of azimuth with polarimetric radar measurements. These additions provide greater flexibility in algorithm optimization while also improving the discrimination between liquid and frozen hydrometeors. Finally, the algorithm is verified using dual-polarization radar data collected by a S-band dual-polarization weather radar in Beijing.

In the position phase, a direction-adaptive grey projection method followed by an enhancing process was put forwarded for the initial positioning of image feature region of the Brake Shoe. And then based on edge information, a threshold-relaxation method was adopted to precisely extract the contour of the Braked Shoe. In the recognition phase, besides some ordinary shape descriptors such as rectangular degree, solidity, compactness, circularity, etc., two new shape descriptors, respectively named as contour smoothness and contour concave\u2013convex were proposed to establish the recognition characters vector.

It essentially focuses on extracting or learning feature representations followed by a matching model using a distance metric. In fact, person reidentification is a difficult task because, first, no universal feature representation can perfectly identify the amount of pedestrians in the gallery obtained by a multicamera system. Although different features can be fused into a composite representation, the fusion still does not fully explore the difference, complementarity, and importance between different features. Second, a matching model always has a limited amount of training samples to learn a distance metric for matching probe images against a gallery, which certainly results in an unstable learning process and poor matching result. In this paper, we address the issues of person reidentification by the ensemble theory, which explores the importance of different feature representations, and reconcile several matching models on different feature representations to an optimal one via our proposed weighting scheme.

Currently, it is planned that by 2020, China\u2019s natural gas consumption will account for at least 10% of the total primary energy consumption, have an orderly and improved energy structure, and achieved energy-saving and emission-reduction targets. Therefore, the accurate prediction of natural gas consumption becomes significantly important. Firstly, based on the research status of forecasting methods and the factors which affect natural gas consumption, this paper used the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to obtain the input layer weight, and used the optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm to obtain the hidden layer threshold; by using PSO-ELM as the base predictor and the AdaBoost algorithm, we have constructed the natural gas consumption integrated learning prediction model. Secondly, from the perspective of different provinces and industries, we deeply analyze the current status of natural gas consumption, and the random forest algorithm is used to extract the core influencing factors of natural gas consumption as the independent variables of the prediction model. Finally, data on China\u2019s natural gas consumption from 1995 to 2017 are selected, then the feasibility analysis and comparative analysis with other methods are performed. The results show: 1) Using the random forest algorithm to extract the core influencing factors, economic growth, population, household consumption and import dependence degree are significantly representative. 2) Based on the AdaBoost integrated learning algorithm, transforming the weak predictor with poor prediction effect into a strong predictor with strong prediction effect, compared with PSO-ELM, AdaBoost-ELM and ELM algorithm, with R-Square as 0.9999, Mean Square Error (MSE) as 0.8435, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as 0.2379, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as 0.0008, effectively validated the significant effect of the AdaBoost-PSO-ELM prediction model. 3) Based on the AdaBoost-PSO-ELM prediction model, predict the natural gas core influencing factors and natural gas consumption in the year of 2018\u20132030.

Unlike most existing pedestrian detection methods which only consider low resolution feature maps, we incorporate fine-grained information into convolutional features to make them more discriminative for human body parts. Specifically, we propose a pedestrian attention mechanism which efficiently identifies pedestrian regions. Our method encodes fine-grained attention masks into convolutional feature maps, which significantly suppresses background interference and highlights pedestrians. Hence, our graininess-aware features become more focused on pedestrians, in particular those of small size and with occlusion. We further introduce a zoom-in-zoom-out module, which enhances the features by incorporating local details and context information. We integrate these two modules into a deep neural network, forming an end-to-end trainable pedestrian detector.

Despite significant progress, our study shows that performance of state-of-the-art thermal image pedestrian detectors still has much room for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to overcome the challenge faced by the thermal image pedestrian detectors, which employ intensity based Region Of Interest (ROI) extraction followed by feature based validation. The most striking disadvantage faced by the first module, ROI extraction, is the failed detection of cloth insulted parts. To overcome this setback, this paper employs an algorithm and a principle of region growing pursuit tuned to the scale of the pedestrian. The statistics subtended by the pedestrian drastically vary with the scale and deviation from normality approach facilitates scale detection. Further, the paper offers an adaptive mathematical threshold to resolve the problem of subtracting the background while extracting cloth insulated parts as well. The inherent false positives of the ROI extraction module are limited by the choice of good features in pedestrian validation step. One such feature is curvelet feature, which has found its use extensively in optical images, but has as yet no reported results in thermal images. This has been used to arrive at a pedestrian detector with a reduced false positive rate. This work is the first venture made to scrutinize the utility of curvelet for characterizing pedestrians in thermal images. Attempt has also been made to improve the speed of curvelet transform computation. The classification task is realized through the use of the well known methodology of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The proposed method is substantiated with qualified evaluation methodologies that permits us to carry out probing and informative comparisons across state-of-the-art features, including deep learning methods, with six standard and in-house databases. With reference to deep learning, our algorithm exhibits comparable performance. More important is that it has significant lower requirements in terms of compute power and memory, thus making it more relevant for depolyment in resource constrained platforms with significant size, weight and power constraints.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.infrared.2016.03.012", "venue": null, "journal": "Infrared Physics & Technology", "mag_id": "2316449345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["66940696", "126406170"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123320470"}

We used the multifractal singularity spectrum, the largest Lyapunov exponent, and approximate entropy to quantify the chaotic nonlinear dynamics of these EEG signals. As confirmed by Wilcoxon rank sum test, largest Lyapunov exponent over left frontal-central cortex exhibited a significant difference between ADHD and the age-matched control groups. Further, mean approximate entropy was significantly lower in ADHD subjects in prefrontal cortex. The singularity spectrum was also considerably altered in ADHD compared to control children. Evaluation of these features was performed by two classifiers: a Support Vector Machine and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network. For better comparison, subject classification based on frequency band power was assessed using the same types of classifiers. Nonlinear features provided better discrimination between ADHD and control than band power features.

In this work, we take an orthogonal approach to the above and turn our attention to the generator. We propose to model the data generator by means of a high-order polynomial using tensorial factors. We design a hierarchical decomposition of the polynomial and demonstrate how it can be efficiently implemented by a neural network. We show, for the first time, that by using our decomposition a GAN generator can approximate the data distribution by only using linear/convolution blocks without using any activation functions.

Most of these methods fall into the category known as standard learning, being supervised models (guided by pre-labeled examples) aimed to classify new patterns into exactly one category. This way, machine learning is in charge of getting rid of junk emails, labeling people in a picture, or detecting a fraudulent transaction when using a credit card. Aside from unsupervised learning methods, which are usually applied to group similar patterns, infer association rules and similar tasks, some non-standard supervised machine learning problems have been faced in late years. Among them, multilabel learning is arguably the most popular one. These algorithms aim to produce models in which each data pattern may be linked to several categories at once. Thus, a multilabel classifier generates a set of outputs instead of only one as a standard classifier does. However, software tools for multilabel learning tend to be scarce. This paper provides multilabel researchers with a comprehensive review of the currently available multilabel learning software.

It is then tested for timely estimation of maize grain yields and their year-on-year variability in Burkina Faso. Outputs from the SARRA-O crop model were used as a proxy for observed data for calibration. The final remote sensing-based yield model was constructed on the interaction between aboveground biomass at flowering (AGB-F) and crop water stress (Cstr) over the reproductive and maturation phases. Various vegetation and drought-related indices were derived from different spectral domains and tested. Model performance was evaluated by cross-validation against (a) simulated yields and (b) independent yields from ground surveys aggregated at village level. The results showed that the RF (Random Forest) model outperformed the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) model for year-on-year yield estimation at the end of the season when compared to simulated yields. Surface soil moisture (SSM) information, as a proxy for soil water available for plant growth, together with information on the temperature of the canopy cover, helped to improve the RF maize yield model, impacting more particularly the estimation of crop water stress. Lastly, two months before harvest the RF model predicted 46% of the observed end-of-season maize grain yield variability. The combined remote sensing, crop model and machine learning method is thus an effective approach for estimating and forecasting inter-annual maize crop yields in environments where field data are scarce, such as in most parts of the African continent. However, more research is needed to better retrieve the spatial variability of yields in order to strengthen current agricultural monitoring systems, and to address societal challenges, such as declining food security.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eja.2019.04.007", "venue": null, "journal": "European Journal of Agronomy", "mag_id": "2945365803", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203987197", "204244316", "211142604"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182629319"}

Based on this idea, the problem of data sparseness can be alleviated effectively.

The resultant embeddings are beneficial to downstream tasks such as vertex classification and link prediction. A vast majority of real-world networks are coupled with a rich set of vertex attributes, which could be potentially complementary in learning better embeddings. Existing attributed network embedding models, with shallow or deep architectures, typically seek to match the representations in topology space and attribute space for each individual vertex by assuming that the samples from the two spaces are drawn uniformly. The assumption, however, can hardly be guaranteed in practice. Due to the intrinsic sparsity of sampled vertex sequences and incompleteness in vertex attributes, the discrepancy between the attribute space and the network topology space inevitably exists. Furthermore, the interactions among vertex attributes, a.k.a cross features, have been largely ignored by existing approaches. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose Nettention, a self-attentive network embedding approach that can efficiently learn vertex embeddings on attributed network. Instead of sample-wise optimization, Nettention aggregates the two types of information through minimizing the difference between the representation distributions in the low-dimensional topology and attribute spaces. The joint inference is encapsulated in a generative adversarial training process, yielding better generalization performance and robustness. The learned distributions consider both locality-preserving and global reconstruction constraints which can be inferred from the learning of the adversarially regularized autoencoders. Additionally, a multi-head self-attention module is developed to explicitly model the attribute interactions.

Failure to account for correlation among observations may result in a classification algorithm overfitting the training data and producing overoptimistic estimated error rates and may make subsequent classifications unreliable. Current common practice for dealing with replicated data is to average each subject replicate sample set, reducing the dataset size and incurring loss of information. In this manuscript we compare three approaches to dealing with cluster-correlated data: unmodified Breiman's Random Forest (URF), forest grown using subject-level averages (SLA), and RF++ with subject-level bootstrapping (SLB). RF++, a novel Random Forest-based algorithm implemented in C++, handles cluster-correlated data through a modification of the original resampling algorithm and accommodates subject-level classification. Subject-level bootstrapping is an alternative sampling method that obviates the need to average or otherwise reduce each set of replicates to a single independent sample. Our experiments show nearly identical median classification and variable selection accuracy for SLB forests and URF forests when applied to both simulated and real datasets. However, the run-time estimated error rate was severely underestimated for URF forests. Predictably, SLA forests were found to be more severely affected by the reduction in sample size which led to poorer classification and variable selection accuracy. Perhaps most importantly our results suggest that it is reasonable to utilize URF for the analysis of cluster-correlated data. Two caveats should be noted: first, correct classification error rates must be obtained using a separate test dataset, and second, an additional post-processing step is required to obtain subject-level classifications. RF++ is shown to be an effective alternative for classifying both clustered and non-clustered data.

Assumed that gait dysfunctions represent a major motor symptom for both pathologies, gait analysis can provide clinicians with subclinical information reflecting subtle differences between these diseases. In this scenario, data mining can be exploited in order to differentiate PD patients at different stages of the disease course and PSP using all the variables acquired through gait analysis. Methods A cohort of 46 subjects (divided into three groups) affected by PD patients at different stages and PSP patients was acquired through gait analysis and spatial and temporal parameters were analysed. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique was used to balance our imbalanced dataset and cross-validation was applied to provide different training and testing sets. Then, Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees were implemented. Results Accuracy, error, precision, recall, specificity and sensitivity were computed for each group and for both algorithms, including 16 features. Random Forests obtained the highest accuracy (86.4%) but also specificity and sensitivity were particularly high, overcoming the 90% for PSP group. Conclusion The novelty of the study is the use of a data mining approach on the spatial and temporal parameters of gait analysis in order to classify patients affected by typical (PD) and atypical Parkinsonism (PSP) based on gait patterns.

In controlled acquisition scenarios, iris segmentation is well handled by simple segmentation schemes, which modeled the iris borders by circles and assumed that the iris can only be occluded by eyelids. However, such simple models tend to fail when the iris is strongly occluded or off-angle, or when the iris borders are not sharp enough. In this thesis, we propose a complete segmentation system working efficiently despite the above-mentioned degradations of the input data. After a study of the recent state of the art in iris recognition, we identified four key issues that an iris segmentation system should handle when being confronted to images of poor quality, leading this way to four key modules for the complete system: \u2022 The system should be able locate the pupil in the image in order to initialize more complex algorithms. To address this problem, we propose an original and effective way to first segment dark elements in the image that can lead to mistakes of the pupil localization process. This rough segmentation detects high frequency areas of the image and then the system uses the pupil homogeneity as a criterion to identify the pupil area among other dark regions of the image. \u2022 Accurate segmentation of the iris texture in the eye image is a core task of iris segmentation systems. We propose to segment the iris texture by Active Contours because they meet both the requirement in robustness and accuracy required to perform segmentation on large databases of degraded images. We studied several Active Contours that varies in speed, robustness, accuracy and in the features they use to model the iris region. We make a comparative evaluation of the algorithms\u2019 influence on the system performance. \u2022 A complete segmentation system must also accurately estimate the iris shape in occluded regions, in order to format the iris texture for recognition. We propose a robust and accurate scheme based on a variational formulation to fit an elliptic model on the iris borders. We explicitly derive evolution equations for ellipses using the Active Contours formalism. We also propose an effective way to limit the sensitivity of this process to initial conditions. This part of our work is currently under review for final acceptance in the international journal Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU). \u2022 Finally, we address the main issue of automatic detection of segmentation failures of the system. Few works in the literature address measuring the quality of a segmentation algorithm, critical task for an operational system. We propose in this thesis a set of novel quality measures for segmentation and show a correlation between each of them with the intrinsic recognition performance of the segmented images. We perform fusion of the individual quality measures via a Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm, in order to propose a more robust global segmentation quality score", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "359864345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127387893"}

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised HSI classification method inspired by the generative adversarial networks (GANs). Unlike the supervised methods, the proposed HSI classification method is semi-supervised, which can make full use of the limited labeled samples as well as the sufficient unlabeled samples. Core ideas of the proposed method are twofold. First, the three-dimensional bilateral filter (3DBF) is adopted to extract the spectral-spatial features by naturally treating the HSI as a volumetric dataset. The spatial information is integrated into the extracted features by 3DBF, which is propitious to the subsequent classification step. Second, GANs are trained on the spectral-spatial features for semi-supervised learning. A GAN contains two neural networks (i.e., generator and discriminator) trained in opposition to one another. The semi-supervised learning is achieved by adding samples from the generator to the features and increasing the dimension of the classifier output.

In this work, the use of error-correcting-based learning techniques is proposed to cope with the complex syntactic variability which is generally exhibited by natural language. In our approach, a complex task is modeled in terms of a basic finite state model, F, and a stochastic error model, E.

E should account for general vocabulary variations, word disappearance, superfluous words, and so on.

However, it remains a challenging issue to achieve robust classification results in the case that the data are from nonlinear subspaces. In this paper, we propose a kernel low-rank MTL (KL-MTL) method to handle multiple features from the 2-D variational mode decomposition (2-D-VMD) domain for multi-/hyperspectral classification. On the one hand, a nonrecursive 2-D-VMD method is applied to extract various features [i.e., intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)] of the original data concurrently. Compared with the existing 2-D empirical mode decomposition, 2-D-VMD has much stronger mathematical foundation and does not need any recursive sifting process. On the other hand, KL-MTL is proposed for classification by taking the extracted IMFs as features of multiple tasks. In KL-MTL, the low-rank representation formulated by nuclear norm can capture global structure of multiple tasks, while the kernel tricks are utilized for nonlinear extension of the low-rank MTL. Moreover, the optimization problem in KL-MTL is solved by the inexact augmented Lagrangian method.

A large body of spike sorting algorithms have been developed that typically project spikes into a low-dimensional feature space and cluster them through iterative computations. However, there is no reached consensus on the optimal feature space or the best way of segmenting spikes into clusters, which often leads to the requirement of human intervention. It is hence desirable to effectively and efficiently utilize human knowledge in spike sorting while keeping a minimum level of manual intervention. Furthermore, the iterative computations that are commonly involved during clustering are inherently slow and hinder real-time processing of large-scale recordings. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot spike sorting paradigm that employs a deep adversarial representation neural network to learn from a handful of annotated spikes and robustly classify unseen spikes sharing similar properties to the labeled ones. Once trained, the deep neural network can implement a parametric function that encodes analytically the categorical distribution of spike clusters, which can be significantly accelerated by GPUs and support processing hundreds of thousands of recording channels in real time. The paradigm also includes a clustering routine termed DidacticSortto aid users for labeling spikes that will be used to train the deep neural network.

On the other hand, mean differences between groups are not informative about the discriminative value of neuroimaging data to predict the group of individual subjects. In this paper, we go beyond mean differences analyses, and explore to what extent individual BPD patients can be differentiated from controls (25 subjects in each group), using a combination of automated-morphometric tools for regional cortical thickness/volumetric estimation and Support Vector Machine classifier. The approach included a feature selection step in order to identify the regions containing most discriminative information. The accuracy of this classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-subject-out procedure. The brain regions indicated as containing relevant information to discriminate groups were the orbitofrontal, rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, middle temporal cortices, among others. These areas, which are distinctively involved in emotional and affect regulation of BPD patients, were the most informative regions to achieve both sensitivity and specificity values of 80% in SVM classification.

The impact of shadows on the classification process was explored for different pixel sizes ranging from 0.03 to 1.00 m.

However, a persistent challenge in DNA methylome analysis is the accurate identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between samples. Sensitive and specific identification of DMRs among different conditions requires accurate and efficient algorithms, and while various tools have been developed to tackle this problem, they frequently suffer from inaccurate DMR boundary identification and high false positive rate. Results We present a novel Histogram Of MEthylation (HOME) based method that takes into account the inherent difference in the distribution of methylation levels between DMRs and non-DMRs to discriminate between the two using a Support Vector Machine. We show that generated features used by HOME are dataset-independent such that a classifier trained on, for example, a mouse methylome training set of regions of differentially accessible chromatin, can be applied to any other organism\u2019s dataset and identify accurate DMRs. We demonstrate that DMRs identified by HOME exhibit higher association with biologically relevant genes, processes, and regulatory events compared to the existing methods.

Some of these features are useful for prediction, but others are spurious or redundant. Feature selection is commonly used to determine the utility of a feature. Typically, features are selected in an all-or-none fashion for inclusion in a model. We describe an alternative approach that has received little attention in the literature: determining the relative importance of features via continuous weights, and performing multiple iterations of model training to iteratively reweight features such that the least useful features eventually obtain a weight of zero. We explore feature selection by employing iterative reweighting for two classes of popular machine learning models: L1 penalized linear models and Random Forests. ::: Recent studies have shown that incorporating importance weights into L1 models leads to improvement in predictive performance in a single iteration of training. In Chapter 3, we advance the state-of-the-art by developing an alternative method for estimating feature importance based on subsampling. Extending the approach to multiple iterations of training, employing the importance weights from iteration n to bias the training on iteration n + 1 seems promising, but past studies yielded no benefit to iterative reweighting. In Chapter 4, we obtain a significant reduction of 7.48% in the error rate over standard L1 penalized algorithms, and nearly as large an improvement over alternative feature selection algorithms such as Adaptive Lasso, Bootstrap Lasso, and MSA-LASSO using our improved estimates of feature importance. ::: In Chapter 5, we consider iterative reweighting in the context of Random Forests and contrast this with a more standard backward-elimination technique that involves training models with the full complement of features and iteratively removing the least important feature.

Firstly, we extract the Line feature which contains the location and direction information. The Line feature fully reflects the relative spatial relationship between adjacent joint points, thus it shows good spatial characteristic. Secondly, especially for long time series, the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory has good time characteristics and long-term memory function, which can learn the further history and future information on the timeline. Therefore, BLSTM can catch more important information with continuous motion capture data on the timeline.

Our dataset happens to be the case that the input and output sequence are not aligned. Thus CTC is suitable for processing continuous motion sequences of variable length.

The specific facial prior knowledge could be leveraged for better super-resolving face images. We present a novel deep end-to-end trainable Face Super-Resolution Network (FSRNet), which makes full use of the geometry prior, i.e., facial landmark heatmaps and parsing maps, to super-resolve very low-resolution (LR) face images without well-aligned requirement. Specifically, we first construct a coarse SR network to recover a coarse high-resolution (HR) image. Then, the coarse HR image is sent to two branches: a fine SR encoder and a prior information estimation network, which extracts the image features, and estimates landmark heatmaps/parsing maps respectively. Both image features and prior information are sent to a fine SR decoder to recover the HR image. To further generate realistic faces, we propose the Face Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (FSRGAN) to incorporate the adversarial loss into FSRNet.

To be well-accepted by humans, robots should efficiently understand meanings of their partners' motions and body language, and respond accordingly. Learning concepts by imitation brings them this ability in a user-friendly way. This paper presents a fast and robust model for Incremental Learning of Concepts by Imitation (ILoCI). In ILoCI, observed multimodal spatio-temporal demonstrations are incrementally abstracted and generalized based on both their perceptual and functional similarities during the imitation. In this method, perceptually similar demonstrations are abstracted by a dynamic model of mirror neuron system. An incremental method is proposed to learn their functional similarities through a limited number of interactions with the teacher. Learning all concepts together by the proposed memory rehearsal enables robot to utilize the common structural relations among concepts which not only expedites the learning process especially at the initial stages, but also improves the generalization ability and the robustness against discrepancies between observed demonstrations. Performance of ILoCI is assessed using standard LASA handwriting benchmark data set.

Our study addresses the question whether biological health or lived health is more predictive of self-reported general health (SRGH). This is a psychometric study using cross-sectional data from the Spanish Survey on Disability, Independence and Dependency Situation. Data was collected from 17,739 people in the community and 9,707 from an institutionalized population. The following analysis steps were performed: (1) a biological health and a lived health score were calculated for each person by constructing a biological health scale and a lived health scale using Samejima\u2019s Graded Response Model; and (2) variable importance measures were calculated for each study population using Random Forest, with SRGH as the dependent variable and the biological health and the lived health scores as independent variables. The levels of biological health were higher for the community-dwelling population than for the institutionalized population. When technical assistance, personal assistance or both were received, the difference in lived health between the community-dwelling population and institutionalized population was smaller.

Moreover, recent research such as the few-shot learning can create highly realistic personalized fake images with only a few images. Therefore, the threat of Deepfake to be used for a variety of malicious intents such as propagating fake images and videos becomes prevalent. And detecting these machine-generated fake images has been quite challenging than ever. In this work, we propose a light-weight robust fine-tuning neural network-based classifier architecture called Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network (FDFtNet), which is capable of detecting many of the new fake face image generation models, and can be easily combined with existing image classification networks and finetuned on a few datasets. In contrast to many existing methods, our approach aims to reuse popular pre-trained models with only a few images for fine-tuning to effectively detect fake images. The core of our approach is to introduce an image-based self-attention module called Fine-Tune Transformer that uses only the attention module and the down-sampling layer. This module is added to the pre-trained model and fine-tuned on a few data to search for new sets of feature space to detect fake images. We experiment with our FDFtNet on the GANsbased dataset (Progressive Growing GAN) and Deepfake-based dataset (Deepfake and Face2Face) with a small input image resolution of 64x64 that complicates detection.

Also, the easy repeatability of data acquisition offers the opportunity to monitor temporal surface changes, which are essential to identifying developing or active slides. Specific methods are needed to detect and map surface changes due to landslide activities. In this paper, we present a methodology that is based on fusing probabilistic change detection and landslide surface feature extraction utilizing multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to map surface changes demonstrating landslide activity. The proposed method was tested in an area with numerous slides ranging from 200 m2 to 27,000 m2 in area under low vegetation and tree cover, Zanesville, Ohio, USA. The surface changes observed are probabilistically evaluated to determine the likelihood of the changes being landslide activity related. Next, based on surface features, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) quantifies and maps the topographic signatures of landslides in the entire area. Finally, these two processes are fused to detect landslide prone changes. The results demonstrate that 53 out of 80 inventory mapped landslides were identified using this method.

Safe and reliable maintenance of railway infrastructure is critical to ensure that rail systems run safely and punctually.

In this paper, we propose a novel supervised method for automatically classifying electrification assets of railway networks using mobile laser scanning data. A hierarchical Conditional Random Field (CRF) was investigated in order to apply both smoothness constraint and spatial regularities, to improve the classification result made by local supervised classifiers. We use a multi-scale line representation of original data, which implicitly combines object geometry cues and makes computation efficient. Our approach focuses on learning the spatial regularities at multiple representation scales to thoroughly understand the railway electrification scene. The spatial regularities are formulated as relative spatial location in a middle range for different line primitive scales and relative displacement in a full range for the final coarsest line primitive scale.

Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can lead to high quality hashing. However, the cost of annotating data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing to a new domain. Moreover, the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the data at training and test stage may come from different distributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data through semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), which leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence, for better understanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically, a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented, which mainly consists of four components: a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations, an adversary stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones, a hash stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing three losses, i.e., adversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample, triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing. Our framework also achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep hash models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1804.08275", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3077136.3080842", "venue": "SIGIR '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2733548594,2953196795", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16119713", "1282515", "1578969", "2605321", "1033682", "1658773", "1799558", "14309770", "195908774", "1307328", "8383593", "206592854", "357776", "12803511", "1099052", "15816664", "7908490", "13199382", "11758569", "1563370", "2930547", "1501682", "7544257", "8662607", "15783377", "18760271", "11321040"], "inbound_citations": ["201650349", "49300447", "212628603", "53038181", "211170919", "13969696", "198904734", "208175678", "52956502", "198920237", "58666662", "198967776", "208158159", "102354106", "53784602", "174797842", "202779769", "3662488", "53232927", "52165579", "204862638", "206670777", "209696502", "59600011", "201666368", "56178972", "52283767", "210839653", "13782944", "59599721", "202540031", "59337648", "202767746"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4080754"}

In this paper we propose an algorithm to detect and recognize road markings from panoramic images. Our algorithm consists of four steps.

Second, we extract the distance between the center and the boundary at regular angular steps of each considered potential road marking segment into a feature vector. Third, each segment is classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, by modeling the lane markings, previous false positive detected segments can be rejected based on their orientation and position relative to the lane markings.

There are some datasets available for the popular problems like item recognition and classification or self-driving cars, however, it is very limited for the industrial robotics field. In previous work, we have trained a multi-objective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the robot body in the image and estimate 3D positions of the joints by using just a 2D image, but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots (UR).

Its size does not stop growing day by day. Web page classification becomes crucial due to this overwhelming amount of data. Web pages contain many noisy contents that bias textual classifiers and lead them to lose focus on their main subject. Web pages are related to each other either implicitly by users' intuitive judgments or explicitly by hyperlinks. Thus, the use of those links in order to correct a class assigned by textual classifier to a web page can be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a post classification corrective approach called Clique Based Correction (CBC) that uses the query-log to build an implicit neighborhood, and collectively corrects classes assigned by a textual classifier to web pages of that neighborhood. This correction helps improve text classifier's results by correcting wrongly assigned categories. When two web pages are linked to each other, they may share the same topic, but when more web pages (three for example) are all related to each other, the probability that those web pages share the same subject becomes stronger. The proposed method operates in four steps. In the first step, it builds a graph called implicit graph, whose vertices are web pages and edges are implicit links. In the second step, it uses a text classifier to determine classes of all web pages represented by vertices in the implicit graph. In the third step, it extracts cliques of web pages from the implicit graph. In the fourth step, it assigns a class to every clique using a voting process. Each web page will be labeled using the class of its clique. This adjustment leads to improvements of results provided by the text classifier. We conduct our experiments using three classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), NB (Nai\u0308ve Bayes) and KNN (K Nearest Neighbors), on two subsets of ODP (Open Directory Project). Results show that: (1) when applied after SVM, NB or KNN, CBC helps bringing improvements on results.

Both the rates of genetic improvement in the early cycles and limits to genetic improvement in the later cycles are affected by interactions among the factors. All genomic selection methods provided greater rates of genetic improvement (per cycle) than phenotypic selection, but phenotypic selection provided the greatest long term responses.

User behavior analysis can make Web service more intelligent and secure. Recently, tree structures have become a popular way for storing and manipulating huge amount of data. The classification of these data can facilitate storage, retrieval, indexing, query answering and different processing operations. In this paper, we propose User- Classifier algorithm for rule based classification of tree structured data that to classify web log user. This algorithm is based on extracting special tree pattern from training dataset. Our experiments show that User- Classifier reduces running time. In the case of complete classification, User- Classifier shows the best classification quality. With the continuous growth of data in web, different knowledge discovery tasks have become increasingly important. In this paper we intend to focus on the classification task. This task can be defined as follow: Given a set of training data classified into some predefined categories, learn to automatically categorize new data. Classifying based on using only the content of trees ignores a significant amount of structural information hidden in the structure of trees. Therefore, recently (mainly from 2003) a growing interest has been emerged to develop new approaches which use the structural information of trees. (Zaki and Aggarwal, 2006) Discussed the idea of constructing structural rules and proposed XRule algorithm for classification of XML documents. During the training phase, this algorithm finds the structures which are most related to the class variable. During the testing phase these structures are used to perform the structural classification. (Zaki and Aggarwal, 2006) Showed that this classifier is significantly more effective than text classifiers due to its ability in use of distinguishing structures. For real datasets, the accuracy of XRule is 2- 4% better than CBA (Liu et al., 1998) and SVM (Joachims, 2002). Based on our best knowledge and to the time of writing this paper, XRule is the most effective algorithm for classification of tree structured data. In rule based classifiers (such as XRule), pattern extraction phase plays an important role on the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Different types of tree patterns can be extracted from a forest of trees. In this paper, we improve XRule by using different types of patterns. We propose User- Classifier a structural classifier based on closed induced tree patterns. We show that in the complete classification User- Classifier gives the best classification quality compared to XRule. Furthermore, its running time and complexity are always less than XRule.

This work reports the compiling of a large training set and implementation of a framework of programs for sequence feature extraction, generating input for a Support Vector Machines algorithm for characterizing the coding potential of transcripts from a transcriptome.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-73731-5_14", "venue": "BSB", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1505918288", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30975246", "39895917", "29526436", "4784420", "215172137"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38777647"}

However, the lack of faulty samples in the training process remains as a difficulty for data-driven AFD of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) subsystems, such as air handling units (AHU). Existing works show that semi-supervised learning theories can effectively alleviate the issue by iteratively inserting newly tested faulty data samples into the training pool when the same fault happens again. However, a research gap exists between theoretical AFD algorithms and real-world applications. First, for real-world AFD applications, it is hard to predict the time when the same fault happens again. Second, the training set is required to be pre-defined and fixed before being packed into the building management system (BMS) for automatic HVAC fault diagnosis. The semi-supervised learning process of iteratively absorbing testing data into the training pool can be irrelevant for industrial usage of the AFD methods. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is well-known as an unsupervised learning technique to enrich the training pool with fake samples that are close to real faulty samples. In this study, a hybrid generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed combining Wasserstein GAN with traditional classifiers to perform fault diagnosis mimicking the real-world scenarios with limited faulty training samples in the training process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for fault diagnosis problems of AHU subsystem.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en12030527", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2911935588", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["110006616", "110838712", "107748670", "110242125", "110156505", "115088813", "112717541", "1033682", "54074211", "2057420", "96436862", "8758543", "14124313", "3248075"], "inbound_citations": ["210931393", "209779010", "202561166", "207902134", "198190461", "201847626"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:96427907"}

Characterization of mix and testing of beams of high strength and ultra strength concrete have been described briefly. Methodologies for evaluation of fracture energy, critical stress intensity factor and critical crack tip opening displacement have been outlined. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is the extension of SVMs to solve regression and prediction problems. The main characteristics of SVR includes minimizing the observed training error, attempts to minimize the generalized error bound so as to achieve generalized performance. Four Support Vector Regression (SVR) models have been developed using MATLAB software for training and prediction of fracture characteristics. It is observed that the predicted values from the SVR models are in good agreement with those of the experimental values.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engfracmech.2012.11.014", "venue": null, "journal": "Engineering Fracture Mechanics", "mag_id": "1989941975", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["189819495", "73524204", "137975283", "181888040", "23204130"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135472978"}
