This paper presents an integrated concept for vegetation type mapping in a dry savanna ecosystem based on local scale in-situ botanical survey data with high resolution (Landsat) and coarse resolution (MODIS) satellite time series. In this context, a semi-automated training database generation procedure using object-oriented image segmentation techniques is introduced. A tree-based Random Forest classifier was used for mapping vegetation type associations in the Kalahari of NE Namibia based on inter-annual intensity- and phenology-related time series metrics. The utilization of long-term inter-annual temporal metrics delivered the best classification accuracies (Kappa = 0.93) compared with classifications based on seasonal feature sets. The relationship between annual classification accuracies and bi-annual precipitation sums was conducted using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Increased error rates occurred in years with high rainfall rates compared to dry rainy seasons. The variable importance was analyzed and showed high-rank positions for features of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the blue and middle infrared bands, indicating that soil reflectance was crucial information for an accurate spectral discrimination of Kalahari vegetation types. Time series features related to reflectance intensity obtained increased rank-positions compared to phenology-related metrics.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs1040620", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2032701790", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["127849344", "203837770", "164243396", "85142595", "128601219", "127346000", "32452253", "206687930", "83538931", "128442529", "17398081", "126461579", "131196455", "55211914", "60993494", "140569394", "120565892", "17928997", "22121218", "89141", "131528125", "5707430", "128905702", "53457184", "54075615", "59333901", "130662260", "56271114", "14819110", "18810437", "60587885", "11451672", "122539622", "62739295", "129380559", "197676146", "55268910", "33789960", "55531704", "84213169"], "inbound_citations": ["54782466", "15862022", "85263146", "128750045", "14581240", "29219469", "53469693", "56212043", "92677228", "229028", "211012352", "1286898", "208344040", "21710569", "34850529", "215428112"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5400331"}

{"paper_id": "66632642", "title": "Facial attributes recognition using computer vision to detect drowsiness and distraction in drivers", "authors": [{"first": "Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez", "middle": [], "last": "Vill\u00e1n", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Driving is an activity that requires a high degree of concentration on the part of the person who performs it, since the slightest negligence is sufficient to provoke an accident with the consequent material and/or human losses. According to the most recent study published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2013, it was estimated that 1.25 million people died as a result of traffic accidents, whereas between 20 and 50 million did not die but consequences resulted in chronic conditions. Many of these accidents are caused by what is known as inattention. This term encloses different conditions such as distraction and drowsiness, which are, precisely, the ones that cause more fatalities. Many publications and research have tried to set figures indicating the consequences of inattention (and its subtypes), but there is no exact number of the accidents caused by inattention since all these studies have been carried out in different places, different time frames and, therefore, under different conditions. Overall, it has been estimated that inattention causes between 25% and 75% of accidents and near-accidents. A study on drowsiness while driving in ten European countries found that fatigue risks increasing reaction time by 86% and it is the fourth leading cause of death on Spanish roads. Distraction is also a major contributor to fatal accidents in Spain. According to the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT), distraction is the first violation found in fatal accidents, 13.15% of the cases. Overall, considering both distraction and drowsiness, the latest statistics on inattentive driving in Spanish drivers are alarming, appearing as the leading cause of fatalities (36%), well above excessive speed (21%) or alcohol consumption (11%). The reason for this PhD thesis is the direct consequences of the abovementioned figures and its purpose is to provide mechanisms to help reduce driver inattention effects using computer vision techniques. The extraction of facial attributes can be used to detect inattention robustly. Specifically, research establishes a frame of reference to characterize distraction in drivers in order to provide solid foundations for future research [1]. Based on this research [1], an architecture based on the analysis of visual characteristics has been proposed, constructed and validated by using techniques of computer vision and automatic learning for the detection of both distraction and drowsiness [2], integrating several innovative elements in order to operate in a completely autonomous way for the robust detection of the main visual indicators characterizing the driver\u2019s both distraction and drowsiness: (1) a review of the role of computer vision technology applied to the development of monitoring systems to detect distraction [3]; (2) a face processing algorithm based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect facial attributes [4]; (3) detection unit for the presence/absence of the driver using both a marker and a machine learning algorithm [2]; (4) robust face tracking algorithm based on both the position of the camera and the face detection algorithm [2]; (5) a face alignment and normalization algorithm to improve the eyes state detection [3]; (6) driver drowsiness detection based on the eyes state detection over time [2]; (7) driver distraction detection based on the position of the head over time [2]. This architecture has been validated, firstly, with reference databases testing the different modules that compose it, and, secondly, with users in real environments, obtaining in both cases, excellent results with a suitable computational load for the embedded devices in vehicle environments [2]. In connection with the tests performed in real-world settings, 16 drivers were involved performing several activities imitating different signs of sleepiness and distraction. Overall, an accuracy of 93.11% is obtained considering all activities and all drivers [2]. Additionally, other contributions of this thesis have been experimentally validated in controlled settings, but are expected to be included in the abovementioned architecture: (1) glasses detection algorithm prior to the detection of the eyes state [3] (the eyes state can not be accurately obtained if the driver is wearing glasses or sunglasses [1]); (2) face recognition and spoofing detection algorithm to identify the driver [5]; (3) physiological information (Heart Rate, Respiration Rate and Heart Rate Variability) are extracted from the users face [6] (using this information, cognitive load and stress can be obtained [1]); (4) a real-time big data architecture to process a large number of relatively small-sized images [7].

Both convolutional and deconvolutional layers are the major source of performance overhead for GANs and directly impacts the efficiency of GAN-based systems.

To solve above problem, we present a face inpainting network based on weighted face similarity (WFS-Net) to generate a better restoration. Firstly, according to the structural similarity index (SSIM), a weighted similar face set (WSFS) can be built to provide more reference information for the recovery of missing regions. And then, WFS-Net is designed to fill the damaged face image by exploring the relationship between the missing region and the available information, which include the known parts of the damaged image and its WSFS.

Proved reserves are dominated by concealed reservoirs, but concealed reservoirs are difficult to find. The prediction for favorable reservoir is a key in the process of exploration and development, but the traditional prediction methods of favorable reservoir rely on analysis of geological prospectors according to commonly used seismic attributes, which leads to low exploration efficiency. To improve effectiveness of the prediction for favorable reservoir, this paper introduces a multi-classification Twin Support Vector Machine (MTWSVM) method suitable for the case of insufficient reservoir label samples caused by fewer drilling data, which is used to identify favorable reservoirs. Since each sub-classifier of existing MTWSVM uses the same penalty parameters and kernel parameters, ignoring the differences between different classes, it cannot play the best role of each sub-classifier. We propose a multi-classification Twin Support Vector Machine based on hybrid parameters (HP-MTWSVM). This algorithm selects appropriate parameters for different sub-classifiers, maintaining the diversity of classifiers. Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM) is facing the problem that its parameters are difficult to be appointed. Additionally, HP-MTWSVM algorithm introduces a large number of parameters. This paper further proposes a hybrid parameter multi-classification Twin Support Vector Machine based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO-HP-MTWSVM). This method uses GWO to optimize the parameters of HP-MTWSVM. Experiments show that the prediction accuracy of GWO-HP-MTWSVM is more than 64%, better than that of manual prediction in complex concealed reservoirs.

Water, forest, agricultural areas, grasslands, transport network, urban, airport- industrial units and barren land- mine land cover/use classes adapted from CORINE nomenclature were used as main land cover/use classes to identify. To fulfil the aims of this research, recently acquired dated 08/02/2016 Sentinel-2 and dated 22/02/2016 Landsat-8 images of Istanbul were obtained and image pre-processing steps like atmospheric and geometric correction were employed. Both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images were resampled to 30m pixel size after geometric correction and similar spectral bands for both satellites were selected to create a similar base for these multi-sensor data. Maximum Likelihood (MLC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classification methods were applied to both data sets to accurately identify eight different land cover/ use classes.

For instance, one could estimate the impact of a new drug to improve the survive rate. In this paper, we conduct causal inference with observational studies based on potential outcome framework (PO) (Rubin, 2005). The central problem for causal effect inference in PO is dealing with the unobserved counterfactuals and treatment selection bias. The state-of-the-art approaches focus on solving these problems by balancing the treatment and control groups (Sun and Nikolaev, 2016). However, during the learning and balancing process, highly predictive information from the original covariate space might be lost. In order to build more robust estimators, we tackle this information loss problem by presenting a method called Adversarial Balancing-based representation learning for Causal Effect Inference (ABCEI), based on the recent advances in representation learning. ABCEI uses adversarial learning to balance the distributions of treatment and control group in the latent representation space, without any assumption on the form of the treatment selection/assignment function. ABCEI preserves useful information for predicting causal effects under the regularization of a mutual information estimator. The experimental results show that ABCEI is robust against treatment selection bias, and matches/outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

When these systems employ real vibration data obtained from bearings artificially damaged, they have to cope with a very limited number of training samples. Moreover, an important issue that has been little investigated in the literature is the presence of noise, which disturbs the vibration signals, and how this affects the identification of bearing defects. In this paper, a new strategy based on the fusion of different Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed in order to reduce noise effect in bearing fault diagnosis systems. Each SVM classifier is designed to deal with a specific noise configuration and, when combined together - by means of the Iterative Boolean Combination (IBC) technique - they provide high robustness to different noise-to-signal ratio. In order to produce a high amount of vibration signals, considering different defect dimensions and noise levels, the BEAring Toolbox (BEAT) is employed in this work.

In this study, we aim to identify the main environmental factors driving fire severity in extreme fire events in Pinus fire prone ecosystems, providing management recommendations for reducing fire effects. The study case was a megafire (11,891 ha) that occurred in a Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by Pinus pinaster Aiton in NW Spain. Fire severity was estimated on the basis of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio from Landsat 7 ETM +, validated by the field Composite Burn Index. Model predictors included pre-fire vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index), pre-fire vegetation structure (canopy cover and vertical complexity estimated from LiDAR), weather conditions (spring cumulative rainfall and mean temperature in August), fire history (fire-free interval) and physical variables (topographic complexity, actual evapotranspiration and water deficit). We applied the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to assess the influence of these environmental factors on fire severity. Models explained 42% of the variance using a parsimonious set of five predictors: NDWI, NDVI, time since the last fire, spring cumulative rainfall, and pre-fire vegetation vertical complexity. The results indicated that fire severity was mostly influenced by pre-fire vegetation greenness. Nevertheless, the effect of pre-fire vegetation greenness was strongly dependent on interactions with the pre-fire vertical structural arrangement of vegetation, fire history and weather conditions (i.e. cumulative rainfall over spring season). Models using only physical variables exhibited a notable association with fire severity. However, results suggested that the control exerted by the physical properties may be partially overcome by the availability and structural characteristics of fuel biomass. Furthermore, our findings highlighted the potential of low-density LiDAR for evaluating fuel structure throughout the coefficient of variation of heights. This study provides relevant keys for decision-making on pre-fire management such as fuel treatment, which help to reduce fire severity.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.051", "venue": null, "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management", "mag_id": "2899208325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201290721", "204764158", "146452692"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92293702"}

In an ACO algorithm, the activities of ants have significance for solving different combinatorial optimization problem which selects most relevant features. Through several iterations filter based method finds the optimal feature subset. Based on the similarity between features the feature relevance will be computed, that shows to the minimization of the redundancy. To validate the proposed feature selection method Support Vector Machine classification is applied. The accuracy of classification for whole feature set and the reduced feature subset are compared.

Since the choice of most relevant semantic information depends on the task, it is desirable to develop approaches which can be adopted for different tasks at hand and which separate the aspects related to surroundings from object entities. In the proposed work we present an efficient approach for detecting generic objects in urban environments from videos acquired by a moving vehicle by means of semantic segmentation. Compared to traditional approaches for semantic labeling, we strive to detect variety of objects, while avoiding the need for large amounts of training data required for recognizing individual object categories and visual variability within and across the categories. In the proposed approach we exploit the features providing evidence about widely available non-object categories (such as sky, road, buildings) and use informative features which are indicative of the presence of object boundaries to gather the evidence about objects. We formulate the object/non-object semantic segmentation problem in the Conditional Random Field Framework, where the structure of the graph is induced by the minimum spanning tree computed over 3D reconstruction, yielding an efficient algorithm for an exact inference.

This hypothesis was reconsidered by increasing the number of datasets and pooling the results across the individual datasets. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were applied to identify 10 studies for an updated and more synthetic analysis. Alpha diversity metrics and the relative risk of obesity based on those metrics were used to identify a limited number of significant associations with obesity; however, when the results of the studies were pooled using a random effects model significant associations were observed between Shannon diversity, number of observed OTUs, and Shannon evenness and obesity status. They were not observed for the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutesor their individual relative abundances. Although these tests yielded small P-values, the difference between the Shannon diversity index of non-obese and obese individuals was 2.07%. A power analysis demonstrated that only one of the studies had sufficient power to detect a 5% difference in diversity. When Random Forest machine learning models were trained on one dataset and then tested using the other 9 datasets, the median accuracy varied between 33.01 and 64.77% (median=56.68%). Although there was support for a relationship between the microbial communities found in human feces and obesity status, this association was relatively weak and its detection is confounded by large interpersonal variation and insufficient sample sizes. Importance As interest in the human microbiome grows there is an increasing number of studies that can be used to test numerous hypotheses across human populations. The hypothesis that variation in the gut microbiota can explain or be used to predict obesity status has received considerable attention and is frequently mentioned as an example for the role of the microbiome in human health.

Thus, a Q-learning algorithm for task scheduling based on Improved Support Vector Machine (ISVM) in WSNs, called ISVM-Q, is proposed to optimize the application performance and energy consumption of networks. Energy consumption of task scheduling is associated with a reward of nodes in the learning process. To solve the \u201cdimensionality disaster\u201d problem of Q-learning, SVM is introduced as a value function approximation. Parameterizations of SVM function can strengthen the interpretation characteristics by using experience knowledge.

So there is a need for discriminants whose decision regions focus on tightly circumscribing the positive class, while still taking account of negatives in zones where the two classes overlap.

A semi-supervised learning technique has been developed that uses the unlabeled data during training of the system. We have shown that simply relying upon the use of large corpora during training for performance improvement is not in itself sufficient.

In this contribution, different ANN structures are assessed and the NNs with 2-7-1, 2-4-1, 2-7-1 and 2-5-1 structures having a linear transfer function (purelin) and a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (tansig) transfer function in the output and hidden layer are found to give the least difference between the network outputs and the experimental data for the thermal conductivity, viscosity, specific heat capacity, and density, respectively. Moreover, new correlations for thermal conductivity and viscosity of the nanofluid are proposed and the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) methods are also presented for comparative purposes. It is observed that all models performed in a very comparable fashion, giving an idea of the easy nature of the problem. So it is recommended to train simple linear models like LASSO or SVM for such problems and perhaps the complex NNs are not necessary in some cases of practical prediction applications such as cooling or heating systems containing nanofluids. Furthermore, finding the optimal conditions is another crucial aspect of engineering problems.

Additionally, we propose a fast method to design such measurement matrices for a given $G$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this method by requiring $5\\text{-}10\\times$ fewer measurements than random Gaussian measurement matrices for comparable recovery performance.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1902.09698", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2917358381", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["20404279", "22341613", "49669789", "459456", "13603634"], "inbound_citations": ["213334242"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67855507"}

Fact extraction, or relationship extraction, is a process where natural language text is scanned to find instances of a predetermined class of facts (e.g. birthday(x,y)). A framework for training statistical fact extractors from example is used wherein a set of examples and a target model are used to annotate an automatically collected corpus. This annotation is then used to provide training data for classifiers (Phrase Conditional Likelihood and Native Bayes) or sequence models (Conditional Random Fields). ::: Fact extractors are used in two information retrieval tasks. In question answering the set of candidate answers is narrowed using fine-grained proper noun ontological facts (is-a(X, Y)) extracted from a corpus by rote classifiers leading to higher performance. Extracted facts are also used for name-referent disambiguation, or cross-document coreference, where one personal name may refer to multiple potential people in the world. The distinguishing biographic facts for each person, such as birthday(x,y) and occupation (x,y), are automatically extracted from plain text and these biographic facts are used along with other statistical methods to distinguish between mentions of each of the referents. ::: This dissertation presents novel techniques for fusion which integrate facts extracted from multiple sources. For the task of biographic fact extraction, fusion of factual information extracted from multiple documents improves the precision of the resulting information. Further improvements result from cascaded fact extraction, where certain facts are extracted and fused and then these facts are used to extract additional information. The technique of cascaded fact extraction and fusion is also applied to time-bounded facts, where a cascade of fact extractors produce a timeline of corporate management succession. ::: Collectively, this research demonstrates the utility of multi-document fact extraction and fusion. It shows that facts can serve as a building-block for deeper text processing such as finding coreferent names in a series of documents, finding the answers to questions, and constructing a timeline for time-variable facts. The key aspects to the process are training with minimal supervision, high-performance statistical fact extraction, fusion across multiple sources of information, and cascaded extraction.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "147379627", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["12678156", "6819305", "1917423", "18242929", "14594940", "53249501", "16175257", "16683860", "54224204", "13010239", "6383505", "10391983", "8582271", "6605684", "16660914", "5155732"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57804249"}

Many traditional classification and clustering algorithms have been adapted or directly applied to protein sequences or structures. To capture protein functionality, new algorithms have recently been proposed specifically aiming at incorporating protein functions. In this paper, we review some of the classification and clustering algorithms for proteins. We divide algorithms into four categories based on their use of dissimilarity measure, density characteristics, computational modeling and information of evidence. The algorithm based on information of evidence analyzes the biomolecular sequences as discrete-valued n-tuples such that discrete values rather than their variables are selected as evidence for the final groupings. The advantage of this approach is that the configuration of the final clusters does not depend on a reliable distance measure, a predefined computational model of the clusters, reliability of the adaptive learning method or a measure of the density function.

Feature learning is very effective to improve the classification performances. However, the current feature learning approaches are mostly based on a simple intrinsic structure. To represent the complex intrinsic spatial-spectral of HSI, a novel feature learning algorithm, termed spatial-spectral hypergraph discriminant analysis (SSHGDA), has been proposed on the basis of spatial-spectral information, discriminant information, and hypergraph learning. SSHGDA constructs a reconstruction between-class scatter matrix, a weighted within-class scatter matrix, an intraclass spatial-spectral hypergraph, and an interclass spatial-spectral hypergraph to represent the intrinsic properties of HSI. Then, in low-dimensional space, a feature learning model is designed to compact the intraclass information and separate the interclass information. With this model, an optimal projection matrix can be obtained to extract the spatial-spectral features of HSI. SSHGDA can effectively reveal the complex spatial-spectral structures of HSI and enhance the discriminating power of features for land-cover classification.

We used two groups of predictors: one included climate factors only, and the other had both climate factors and soil factors. Important findings The SVM based on both predictor groups predicted the potential distribution of P. edulis, and the potential habitat expended and migrated northward with time. Factor importance analysis showed that the climate factors correlated with warm conditions played a driving role in the simulation of the potential habitat of P. edulis, while soil factors associated with soil texture and pH mainly impacted the simulation as limiting factors. However, the prediction using both climate and soil predictors performed with higher efficiency, and the intensity of the potential habitat expending and migrating was less than that of the group of climate factors only.

In this paper, we present a deep adversarial metric learning (DAML) framework to generate synthetic hard negatives from the original negative samples, which is widely applicable to existing supervised deep metric learning algorithms. Different from existing sampling strategies which simply ignore numerous easy negatives, our DAML aim to exploit them by generating synthetic hard negatives adversarial to the learned metric as complements. We simultaneously train the feature embedding and hard negative generator in an adversarial manner, so that adequate and targeted synthetic hard negatives are created to learn more precise distance metrics. As a single transformation may not be powerful enough to describe the global input space under the attack of the hard negative generator, we further propose a deep adversarial multi-metric learning (DAMML) method by learning multiple local transformations for more complete description. We simultaneously exploit the collaborative and competitive relationships among multiple metrics, where the metrics display unity against the generator for effective distance measurement as well as compete for more training data through a metric discriminator to avoid overlapping.

Their capability of addressing a wide audience gives them influence over their audience, which companies seek to exploit.

In this paper, we propose a predictive and adaptive model named as Influential Blogger based Case-Based Reasoning (IB-CBR) model for the recognition of unseen influential bloggers. It incorporates self-prediction and self-adaptation (self-management) capabilities which are the essence of an automated system.

Although up to 80% of cases can be characterised by either abnormal chromosome number (hyper- or hypo-diploidy) or a specific chromosome translocation, a significant proportion of cases do no exhibit any major chromosome abnormality. Indeed, no common gene mutation has been found to be associated with childhood leukaemia. This suggests that epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation, may also play a significant role in ALL pathogenesis. Understanding the specific epigenetic changes associated with this disease is therefore of paramount importance for predicting onset and disease outcome and understanding disease aetiology. From our cohort of over 450 cases of childhood leukaemia we analysed 12 cases of childhood ALL that carried the TEL/AML1 (RUNX1/ETV6) chromosome translocation using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27K bead chip arrays. These interrogate 27,578 CpG methylation sites across the human genome covering 14,495 RefSeq gene promoters. We analysed matching leukaemia and remission bone marrow with the aim of identifying DNA methylation signatures associated with this leukaemia subtype. We used a number of computational methods to determine the DNA methylation signatures associated with childhood ALL including LIMMA, Centroid Analysis and Support Vector Machine Modelling. This identified 16 probes sufficient to define a leukaemia sample from a remission sample based on methylation level. We are currently validating our results using high throughput SEQUENOM and performing gene pathway and network analyses to look for commonly affected genes associated with leukaemia. These methylation changes we have identified may help refine the diagnosis of childhood ALL and identify cellular pathways subject to epigenetic disruption in ALL.

This research proposes an automatic novel technique for the depth estimation of single 2D images via transfer learning of pre-trained deep learning model. This is a challenging problem, as a single 2D image does not carry any cues regarding depth. To tackle this, the pool of available images is exploited for which the depth is known. By following the hypothesis that the color images having similar semantics are most probably to have similar depth. Along these lines, the depth of the input image is predicted through corresponding depth maps of semantically similar images available in the dataset, fetched by high-level features of pre-trained deep learning model followed by a classifier (i.e., K-Nearest Neighbor). Afterward, a Cross Bilateral filter is applied for the removal of fallacious depth variations in the depth map.

An example of this strategy is a recently developed subspace-projection-based multinomial logistic regression technique able to characterize mixed pixels, which are also an important concern in the analysis of hyperspectral data. In this letter, we extend the subspace-projection-based concept to support vector machines (SVMs), a very popular technique for remote sensing image classification. For that purpose, we construct the SVM nonlinear functions using the subspaces associated to each class.

On the other hand, not much has been explored on how to provide treatment recommendations after disease detection. Deep learning (DL) methods applied using transfer learning tends to drastically reduce the amount of data, time and resources needed to build this type of model which generalizes well on new data. Hence, this study utilizes pre-trained DL architectures such as VGG16, VGG19 and SqueezeNet as feature extractors along with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the classifier to detect 27 distinct classes of (plant, disease) combination which also includes healthy plants. Out of all the hybrid models, VGG16+SVM performed the best with the highest f1 score of 96.16%, with one of the fastest overall computational time recorded using only CPU\u2019s.

T-SNE projection of NG will construct a low-dimensional space where local similarities of high-dimensional data space are preserved to a great extent.

This paper presents a framework for video-based surveillance where target detection is integrated with tracking to improve detection results. In contrast to methods that apply target detection and tracking sequentially and independently from each other, we feed the results of tracking back to the detection stage in order to adaptively optimize the detection threshold and improve system robustness. First, the initial target locations are extracted using background subtraction. To model the background, we employ Support Vector Regression (SVR) which is updated over time using an on-line learning scheme. Target detection is performed by thresholding the outputs of the SVR model. Tracking uses shape projection histograms to iteratively localize the targets and improve the confidence level of detection. For verification, additional information based on size, color and motion information is utilized. Feeding back the results of tracking to the detection stage restricts the range of detection threshold values, suppresses false alarms due to noise, and allows to continuously detect small targets as well as targets undergoing perspective projection distortions. We have validated the proposed framework in two different application scenarios, one detecting vehicles at a traffic intersection using visible video and the other detecting pedestrians at a university campus walkway using thermal video.

The inherent fluctuations in the power generated by wind mills may affect their optimal integration in the electric grid and therefore, accurate prediction is highly desired. To cater these fluctuations and highly nonlinear mapping, we present an ensemble approach, where the auxiliary predictor is constructed with Radial Basis Function (RBF) network and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) and various neural networks are then employed as base regressors. Use of RVM is based on its established advantages for robust prediction on unseen data to address the overfitting issue in training phase. AxP is used for suitable weight initialization to base predictors and provides initial decision space to base learners. Further, an ensemble of neural networks based on GP is developed which utilizes the base predictions of neural networks as well as the auxiliary information generated by AxP. The GP ensemble based forecasting engine is thus robust to minor variations in the data as compared to the individual base regressors. We also employ information-theoretic feature selection on physical measurements of the wind mills. Results have been extracted in the form of statistical performance indices including mean absolute error, standard deviation error and mean square error. These error measures are compared with the other existing wind power prediction techniques. These results present better wind power estimates and reduced prediction error. Paired t-test for the proposed model with other machine learning based models is carried out for further evaluation. Overall, these comparisons validate the importance of auxiliary predictor in ensemble model of GP and ANNs.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106151", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Soft Computing", "mag_id": "3003714201", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213319662"}

Natural history of IPF is unknown and the prediction of disease progression at the time of diagnosis is notoriously difficult. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been used for the diagnosis of IPF, but not generally for monitoring purpose. The objective of this work is to develop a novel predictive model for the radiological progression pattern at voxel-wise level using only baseline HRCT scans. Mainly, there are two challenges: (a) obtaining a data set of features for region of interest (ROI) on baseline HRCT scans and their follow-up status; and (b) simultaneously selecting important features from high-dimensional space, and optimizing the prediction performance. We resolved the first challenge by implementing a study design and having an expert radiologist contour ROIs at baseline scans, depending on its progression status in follow-up visits. For the second challenge, we integrated the feature selection with prediction by developing an algorithm using a wrapper method that combines quantum particle swarm optimization to select a small number of features with random forest to classify early patterns of progression. We applied our proposed algorithm to analyze anonymized HRCT images from 50 IPF subjects from a multi-center clinical trial. We showed that it yields a parsimonious model with 81.8% sensitivity, 82.2% specificity and an overall accuracy rate of 82.1% at the ROI level. These results are superior to other popular feature selections and classification methods, in that our method produces higher accuracy in prediction of progression and more balanced sensitivity and specificity with a smaller number of selected features.

In this article, a broad convolutional neural network (BCNN) is designed with incremental learning capability for solving the aforementioned issues.

Our results show just a slight difference in accuracy between implementation using full dataset features and the proposed much smaller dataset (almost 63% of original features set). This reduction in dimensionality is significant for the realtime systems especially when the accuracy reduction is slight. From there, we present a framework enabling a significant reduction in features. This opens the door for future work under which a wider set of classification algorithms will be tested in order to achieve the dimensionality reduction and an increase in performance accuracy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.146", "venue": "2017 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 15th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 3rd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)", "journal": "2017 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 15th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 3rd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2795183095", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17358263", "14728818", "6246617", "30946225", "17358263", "5856832", "1232809", "1048051", "18384606", "903089", "363051", "167315", "2677211", "5716727", "18983346"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4571327"}

The motivation for generating a scale-space representation of a given data set originates from the basic observation that real-world objects are composed of different structures at different scales.

In this paper we propose Laplacian pyramid auto-encoders, a straightforward modification of the deep convolutional auto-encoder architecture, for unsupervised representation learning. The method uses multiple encoding-decoding sub-networks within a Laplacian pyramid framework to reconstruct the original image and the low pass filtered images. The last layer of each encoding sub-network also connects to an encoding layer of the sub-network in the next level, which aims to reverse the process of Laplacian pyramid generation.

Statistical methods that can provide data-driven insights into production performance are gaining in popularity. Unfortunately, the application of advanced statistical algorithms remains somewhat of a mystery to petroleum engineers and geoscientists. The objective of this paper is to provide some clarity to this issue, focusing on: (a) how to build robust predictive models, and (b) how to develop decision rules that help identify factors separating good wells from poor performers. The data for this study come from wells completed in the Wolfcamp shale formation in the Permian Basin. Data categories used in the study included well location and assorted metrics capturing various aspects of well architecture, well completion, stimulation, and production. Predictive models for the production metric of interest are built using simple regression and other advanced methods such Random Forests, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting Machine and Multidimensional Kriging. The data fitting process involves splitting the data into a training set and a test set, building a regression model on the training set and validating it with the test set. Repeated application of a \u201ccross-validation\u201d procedure yields valuable information regarding the robustness of each regression modeling approach. Furthermore, decision rules that can identify extreme behavior in production wells (i.e., top x% of the wells versus bottom x% as ranked by the production metric) are generated using the classification and regression tree algorithm. The resulting decision tree provides useful insights as to what variables (or combinations of variables) can drive production performance into such extreme categories.

In a computer, usually there exists a single processor implementing a sequence of arithmetic and logical operations, nowadays at speeds approaching billion operations per second. However this type of devices has ability neither to adapt their structure nor to learn in the way that human being does. An Artificial Neural Model (ANM) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems, such as the brain, process information. The key element of this paradigm is the novel mathematical structure of the information processing system.

For the above problems, a novel tunnel rock burst prediction probability model is proposed based on actual rock burst cases analysis. Firstly, six quantitatively characteristic parameters, namely the maximum tangential stress, the uniaxial compressive strength, the uniaxial tensile strength, the stress coefficient, the rock brittleness coefficient and the elastic energy index were extracted from rock burst cases, and the probability distribution function and correlation of those parameters were determined. Secondly, the multi-dimensional joint probability distribution function of six characteristic parameters was constructed under the framework of Copula theory, and then the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) which was optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm served as the intelligent response surface model to reflect the nonlinear mapping relationship between six parameters and the tunnel rock burst prediction level. Subsequently, the Copula-LSSVM rock burst prediction probability model was established, and the Weibull distribution function of rock burst prediction grade was obtained with the application of the Monte Carlo simulation method. Lastly, six rock burst cases of the Jinping II Hydropower Station are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and analysis was done on the influence of parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty on the prediction results.

Existing research usually only focusing on the associations between individual or very limited type of molecules. But the interactions between molecules shouldn\u2019t be isolated but interconnected and influenced. In this study, we revealed, constructed and analyzed a large-scale molecular association network of multiple biomolecules in human cells by modeling all associations among lncRNA, miRNA, protein, circRNA, microbe, drug, and disease, in which various associations are interconnected and any type of associations can be predicted. More specifically, we defined the molecular associations network and constructed a molecular associations dataset containing 105546 associations. Then, each node is represented by its attribute feature and network embedding learned by Structural Deep Network Embedding. Moreover, Random Forest is trained to predict any kind of associations. And we compared the features and classifiers under five-fold cross-validation. Our method achieves a remarkable performance on entire molecular associations network with an AUC of 0.9552 and an AUPR of 0.9338. To further evaluate the performance of our method, a case study for predicting lncRNA-protein interactions was executed. The experimental results demonstrate that the systematic insight for understanding the synergistic interactions between various molecules and complex diseases. It is anticipated that this work can bring beneficial inspiration and advance related systems biology and biomedical research. Author Summary The interactions between the various biomolecules in the cells should not be isolated, but interconnected and influenced. There have been many valuable studies on the interactions between two individual molecules. Based on a systematic and holistic perspective, we revealed and constructed a large-scale molecular associations network by combining various associations in human living cells, including miRNA-lncRNA association, miRNA-disease association, miRNA-protein interaction, lncRNA-disease association, protein-protein interaction, protein-disease association, drug-protein interaction, drug-disease interaction, and lncRNA-protein interaction. To model and analyze this molecular associations network, we employed the network representation learning model to learn how to represent the node. Each node in the network can be represented by network embedding and its own attribute information. Any node can be classified. And any type of the associations in this network can be predicted, which can be considered as link prediction task. Our work provides a new systematic view and conceptual framework to understand complex diseases and life activities. It is anticipated that our study can advance related biological macromolecules, systems biology and biomedical research, and bring some meaningful inspiration.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/693051", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2953450146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["34673503", "46920940", "217929", "3780827", "57189729", "20652131", "59233842", "215207077", "46979495", "3699940", "215615197", "14725909", "215435719", "5519177", "13771970", "54447248", "9430177", "28590494", "54476578", "215100342", "52956319", "52956980", "14675158", "3051291", "8399404", "3952914", "207238964", "205234301", "53103637", "1969204", "53197570", "6765130", "52347163", "18837723", "2832168", "5445756"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198240975"}

We found that the proposed model achieves better results than other models such as Hidden Markov Model or conventional CRF which are directly applied to text. The proposed model can be applied for improvement of terrorism event extraction and ontology creation systems, especially with the focus towards their effective role in Open Source Intelligence. We describe briefly the existing systems along with possible improvements with incorporation of the presented model at different levels.

In this paper, we take a new perspective that aims to leverage rich user-item interaction data (user interaction data for short) for improving the KGC task. Our work is inspired by the observation that many KG entities correspond to online items in application systems. However, the two kinds of data sources have very different intrinsic characteristics, and it is likely to hurt the original performance using simple fusion strategy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adversarial learning approach by leveraging user interaction data for the KGC task. Our generator is isolated from user interaction data, and serves to improve the performance of the discriminator. The discriminator takes the learned useful information from user interaction data as input, and gradually enhances the evaluation capacity in order to identify the fake samples generated by the generator. To discover implicit entity preference of users, we design an elaborate collaborative learning algorithms based on graph neural networks, which will be jointly optimized with the discriminator. Such an approach is effective to alleviate the issues about data heterogeneity and semantic complexity for the KGC task.

Much effort has gone into mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) research over the past decade. Yet, even today, mobile ad-hoc networking is seen as a relatively new area of research. The reason for this can be traced to the fact that the maturity in truly understanding these networks is still alarmingly low and actual deployment of these networks rare. There are plenty of techniques in route finding and link establishment in MANET based on various concepts such as \u201cpro-active\u201d, \u201creactive\u201d, \u201cpower awareness\u201d, \u201ccross-layering\u201d etc. Most of these techniques are rather restrictive, taking into account a few of the several aspects that go into effective route establishment. The several factors that decide and influence the routing have to be considered as a whole in the difficult task of finding the best solution in route finding and optimization. The inputs to the system are manifold and apparently unrelated. Most of the parameters are imprecise or non-crisp in nature. The uncertainty and imprecision lead to think that intelligent routing techniques are essential and important in evolving robust and dependable solutions to route finding. The obvious method by which this can be achieved is the deployment of soft computing techniques such as Neural Nets, Fuzzy Logic and Genetic algorithms.

Multi-view spectral clustering methods based on similarity matrixes or graphs are pretty popular. Generally, these algorithms learn informative graphs by directly utilizing original data. However, in the real-world applications, original data often contain noises and outliers that lead to unreliable graphs. In addition, different views may have different contributions to data clustering. In this paper, a novel Multiview Subspace Clustering method unifying Adaptive neighbours and Metric learning (MSCAM), is proposed to address the above problems. In this method, we use the subspace representations of different views to adaptively learn a consensus similarity matrix, uncovering the subspace structure and avoiding noisy nature of original data. For all views, we also learn different Mahalanobis matrixes that parameterize the squared distances and consider the contributions of different views. Further, we constrain the graph constructed by the similarity matrix to have exact c (c is the number of clusters) connected components. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve this optimization problem.

As a solution to the problems associated with NDT applications, there is a need to establish an intelligent analysis system that supports a portable testing environment, which allows various types of inputs and provides sufficient data regarding damage severity in the tested structure. Approach: This research investigated possible fast NDT systems and algorithms and provides a novel approach that allows engineers and researchers to pinpoint defects in real time. The system was based on incident signals on a composite surface being detected and analyzed. Any damage in the composite causes a change in the detected signal. The proposed technique is suitable for high volume monitoring and inspection of safety critical components non-destructively. It unified through conversion the extracted information from irrelevant background using the developed Classification Algorithm with the ability to correlate obtained data to level of damage and it is effect on the structure overall performance. Results: The feasibility of using time measurements to establish the integrity of RIM composites using a handheld, low frequency, electronic tapping device has been studied. The relationship between damage and component thickness had also been established. Conclusion: A mathematical model describing the composite time response and its relation to both level of damage and tensile strength was presented. An excellent agreement between the model and the testing data was observed.

The proposed method enables person and gender independent facial action unit detection. The decision level fusion is used by employing the Random Forests classifiers to combine geometric and LBP based features. Unlike the previous methods which suffer from the diversity among different persons and normalize features utilizing neutral faces, our method extracts features on a single 3D face data.

A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k.

By using a lexicon built to scale, we show that simple retrieval operations applied to a large corpus of words correctly predict an interaction of word frequency by spelling-tosound regularity in naming, a frequency main effect in lexical decision, sensitivity to orthographically defined syllable-like structures in lexical decision, and an interaction of number of syllables with word frequency in naming. Reading is a highly practised skill that seems almost effortless. Nevertheless, there is little consensus about the processes that a skilled reader uses when reading. The formal study of reading includes several specialized topics, each with a distinct literature: letter recognition, word identification, sentence understanding, and text comprehension. Over the last two decades, the word-identification literature has established several benchmark phenomena in naming and lexical-decision tasks. For example, highfrequency words are named more quickly than low-frequency words, but the advantage is smaller for words whose pronunciation is consistent with spelling-to-sound rules (regular words) than for those whose spelling is not (irregular words). Second, although participants can confirm the lexical status of high-frequency words faster than lowfrequency words, the corresponding interaction of frequency with spelling-to-sound consistency is attenuated in the lexical-decision task (e.g., Seidenberg, Waters, Barnes, & Tannenhaus, 1984).1 In addition, words with many orthographic neighbours are named more quickly than words with few neighbours, and nonwords with many word neighbours are slower to reject in lexical decision (e.g., Andrews, 1989). Over the same period, the literature has converged on a conceptual framework within which to discuss accounts of word identification. The framework is based on stimulus classification using a detector as a processing unit. A typical account might include a detector for subletter visual features, letters, groups of letters, phonemes, and words. Each detector is activated either when appropriate conditions occur in the environment or when activation is passed to it from detectors earlier in the processing chain. Although the details differ from account to account, there is wide agreement that activation of appropriate detectors is the currency of processing, in either a localist or distributed system. In McClelland and Rumelhart's (1981) words: \"For every relevant unit in the system we assume there is an entity called a node\" (p. 378). Likewise, Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) note that \"each word processing trial begins with the presentation of a letter string, which the simulation program then encodes into a pattern of activation over the orthographic units\" (p. 527). Naming a word is achieved by activating the appropriate phonological units. Early models hard wired the orthographic-to-phonological connections, whereas later models allowed the system to learn the appropriate connections. Naming exhibits rule-like regularities: For example, words that conform to spelling-to-sound rules are named faster than those that do not follow the rules; that is, naming is slowed when the reader cannot take advantage of spellingto-sound rules. Connectionist theorists argue, however, that rule-like behaviour can be derived, without a rule-based processor, from interactions among detectors during stimulus classification (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989).2 By contrast, Coltheart (1978) staunchly defends the idea of phonological activation by a separate rule-based processor in addition to direct activation as part of the stimulus classification process (Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, & Haller, 1993). \u2026", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "10646202", "doi": "10.1037/h0087318", "venue": "Canadian journal of experimental psychology = Revue canadienne de psychologie experimentale", "journal": "Canadian journal of experimental psychology = Revue canadienne de psychologie experimentale", "mag_id": "1978421445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["26251668", "18642243", "13881111", "6290623", "34244733", "5088309", "9400723", "29991384", "15107440", "28477885", "9374593", "24593123", "31225485", "6761672", "5414206", "10528300"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32818822"}

Most previous methods of predicting folding rate require the tertiary structure of a protein as an input.

Here we developed a method, SeqRate, to predict both protein folding kinetic type (two-state versus multi-state) and real-value folding rate using features extracted from only protein sequence with support vector machines. On a standard benchmark dataset, the accuracy of folding kinetic type classification is 80%. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the mean absolute difference between predicted and experimental folding rates (sec-1) in the base-10 logarithmic scale are 0.81 and 0.79 for two-state protein folders, and 0.80 and 0.68 for three-state protein folders.

Because the difficulty of the fault identification is related with the existence of Ambiguity Groups, the Unsupervised Learning scheme is employed to detect them and decompose training data set into subsets, on which two stages of classifiers are trained. The first set (considered \u201csimple\u201d) is processed by the simpler machine learning algorithm. The second set is used to train the more complex classifier (operating in the uncertainty conditions). The proposed scheme is generic, therefore various algorithms can be implemented. In the presented case, the Self Organizing Map (SOM) is used in the first stage, while Random Forest (RF) \u2013 in the second one. To verify the approach, the 3rd order Bessel highpass filter was analyzed. The architecture was confronted against the traditional approach (where the standalone classifiers are employed).

The environmental effects - temperature, humidity, light exposure, and anticoagulant - on the bloodstain age estimation process were explored. The color values from the digital images were extracted and correlated with time since deposition. Magenta had the highest correlation (R(2)=0.966) and was used in subsequent experiments. The Samsung Galaxy S Plus was the most suitable smartphone as its magenta decreased exponentially with increasing time and had highest repeatability (low variation within and between pictures). The quantifiable color change observed is consistent with well-established hemoglobin denaturation process.

We have used homogeneity, contrast, correlation, entropy and local homogeneity, which were the best texture features to improve the classification algorithm. Two kernels have been considered, the RBF kernel based on Euclidean minimum distance (EMD) and a RBF kernel based on the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). The proposed approach was tested on common scenes of urban imagery. Results showed, especially with the use of Haralick texture features, that SVMs using RBF kernel based on EMD outperform the SVMs with RBF kernel based on SAM in term of the global accuracy and Kappa coefficeint.

There are two fundamental concepts underpinning the field of CS. The first is the use of random transformations to project high-dimensional measurements onto a much lower-dimensional domain. The second is the use of sparse regression to reconstruct the original signal. This assumes that a sparse representation exists for this signal in some known domain, manifested by a dictionary. The original formulation for CS specifies the use of an penalised regression method, the Lasso. Whilst this has worked well in literature, it suffers from two main drawbacks. First, the level of sparsity must be specified by the user, or tuned using sub-optimal approaches. Secondly, and most importantly, the Lasso is not probabilistic; it cannot quantify uncertainty in the signal reconstruction. This paper aims to address these two issues; it presents a framework for performing compressive sensing based on sparse Bayesian learning. Specifically, the proposed framework introduces the use of the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), an established sparse kernel regression method, as the signal reconstruction step within the standard CS methodology. This framework is developed within the context of ultrasound signal processing in mind, and so examples and results of compression and reconstruction of ultrasound pulses are presented. The dictionary learning strategy is key to the successful application of any CS framework and even more so in the probabilistic setting used here. Therefore, a detailed discussion of this step is also included in the paper. The key contributions of this paper are a framework for a Bayesian approach to compressive sensing which is computationally efficient, alongside a discussion of uncertainty quantification in CS and different strategies for dictionary learning. The methods are demonstrated on an example dataset from collected from an aerospace composite panel. Being able to quantify uncertainty on signal reconstruction reveals that this grows as the level of compression increases. This is key when deciding appropriate compression levels, or whether to trust a reconstructed signal in applications of engineering and scientific interest.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.07.036", "venue": null, "journal": "Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2885038042", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["149055", "2269521", "1431305", "63756969", "109137762", "7596571", "62607675", "24377008", "18985330", "62537786", "6943186", "115653106", "117819162", "14427335", "2387582", "2429822", "59657829", "121570279", "15413966", "15179374", "4193919", "6723676", "58716623", "11797924", "386508", "206797074", "29976552", "14208692", "6254191", "1218517", "60909389", "556331", "303727", "2590898", "120495185", "52801445", "1912619", "44430276", "116219960"], "inbound_citations": ["203622445", "167218972", "208212798", "69975711"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55365881"}

We tested the hypothesis that climate variables are important to understand these relationships at all spatial scales. We analyzed the influence of climate on WNV infection rate of mosquitoes and number of human cases in New York and Connecticut using Random Forests, a machine learning technique. During model development, 66 climate-related variables based on temperature, precipitation and soil moisture were tested for predictive skill. We also included 20\u201321 non-climatic variables to account for known environmental effects (e.g., land cover and human population), surveillance related information (e.g., relative mosquito abundance), and to assess the potential explanatory power of other relevant factors (e.g., presence of wastewater treatment plants). Random forest models were used to identify the most important climate variables for explaining spatial-temporal variation in mosquito infection rates (abbreviated as MLE). The results of the cross-validation support our hypothesis that climate variables improve the predictive skill for MLE at county- and trap-scales and for human cases at the county-scale. Of the climate-related variables selected, mean minimum temperature from July\u2013September was selected in all analyses, and soil moisture was selected for the mosquito county-scale analysis.

Aspects also have crucial importance on sentiment classification in which sentiments are matched with aspect-level expressions. A preliminary step in both aspect extraction and aspect based sentiment analysis is to detect aspect terms and opinion targets. In this paper, we propose a sequential learning approach to extract aspect terms and opinion targets from opinionated documents.

Often, it is the rare event that is of interest and the cost of misclassifying the rare event is higher than misclassifying the usual event. When the data is highly skewed toward the usual, it can be very difficult for a learning system to accurately detect the rare event. There have been many approaches in recent years for handling imbalanced data sets, from under-sampling the majority class to adding synthetic points to the minority class in feature space. However, distances between time series are known to be non-Euclidean and non-metric, since comparing time series requires warping in time. This fact makes it impossible to apply standard methods like SMOTE to insert synthetic data points in feature spaces. We present an innovative approach that augments the minority class by adding synthetic points in distance spaces. We then use Support Vector Machines for classification.

However, only a fraction of the missense mutations observed in tumor genomes are expected to be cancer causing. Distinguishing tumorigenic \"driver\" mutations from their neutral \"passenger\" counterparts is currently a pressing problem in cancer research.CHASM trains a Random Forest classifier on driver mutations from the COSMIC databases and uses background nucleotide substitution rates observed in tumor sequencing data to model tumor type-specific passenger mutations. Each missense mutation is represented by quantitative features that fall into five major categories: physiochemical properties of amino acid residues; scores derived from multiple sequence alignments of protein or DNA; region-based amino acid sequence composition; predicted properties of local protein structure; and annotations from the UniProt feature tables. Both a software package and a Web server implementation of CHASM are available to facilitate high-throughput prioritization of somatic missense mutations from large, multi-tumor exome sequencing studies.

Such automated interpretations can be particularly valuable information in the case of missing or damaged core samples. There exists, however, a need to evaluate said machine learning algorithms in the case where available wireline logs contain a wide range of different logs which are highly-sampled. This paper explores different machine learning algorithms and architectures for lithology classification using wireline data from project area Jundah East, 60 km north-west of Wandoan, Queensland, which is well known for coal mineralisation. We used seven well logs each containing 19 wireline logs sampled at 1 cm-1, available through the Queensland Digital Exploration (QDEX) data system. Three popular supervised machine learners, namely the Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron (an artificial neural network), are tested under two architectures: committee (one classifier per well log) and singular (one classifier for all well logs). The results show the Naive Bayes classifier, although computationally simple, achieves good results in general when training using a committee architecture on a large data set. For coal classification in particular, it achieved the sensitivity score of 0.79 and the specificity score of 0.97. While the committee and singular architectures generated similar results, the committee architecture provides the benefits of faster computation time as well as a flexible platform for the training of additional well logs.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1071/ASEG2015ab208", "venue": null, "journal": "Exploration Geophysics", "mag_id": "2110533824", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56173842", "203642208", "211016993", "145966196"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129349384"}

Meanwhile, it inevitably poses the risk of generating and disseminating false information by both benign and malicious users. Despite there has been considerable research on false information detection from both the opinion-based and fact-based perspectives, they mostly focus on tailored solutions for a particular domain and carry out limited work on leveraging multi-faceted clues such as textual cues, behavioral trails, and relational connection. We propose a novel dual-stream attentive random forest that is capable of selecting clues of discriminative information from individuals, collective information (e.g., texts), and correlations of entities (e.g., social interactions) adaptively. In particular, we use an interpretive attention model for learning textual contents. The model treats the important and unimportant content differently when constructing the textual representation and employs a multilayer perceptron to capture the hidden complex relationships among features of side information.

The goal of this paper is to show the power of SIDRA for quick and accurate signal detection and classification. We first diagnose the power of the method with simulated light curves and try it on a subset of the Kepler space mission catalogue. We use five classes of simulated light curves (CONSTANT, TRANSIT, VARIABLE, MLENS and EB for constant light curves, transiting exoplanet, variable, microlensing events and eclipsing binaries, respectively) to analyse the power of the method. The algorithm uses four features in order to classify the light curves. The training sample contains 5000 light curves (1000 from each class) and 50000 random light curves for testing. The total SIDRA success ratio is $\\geq 90\\%$. Furthermore, the success ratio reaches 95 - 100$\\%$ for the CONSTANT, VARIABLE, EB, and MLENS classes and 92$\\%$ for the TRANSIT class with a decision probability of 60$\\%$. Because the TRANSIT class is the one which fails the most, we run a simultaneous fit using SIDRA and a Box Least Square (BLS) based algorithm for searching for transiting exoplanets. As a result, our algorithm detects 7.5$\\%$ more planets than a classic BLS algorithm, with better results for lower signal-to-noise light curves.

However, hearing persons rarely know sign languages, creating barriers to inclusion. The increasing progress of mobile technology, along with new forms of user interaction, opens up possibilities for overcoming such barriers, particularly through the use of gesture recognition through smartphones. This Literature Review discusses works from 2009 to 2017 that present solutions for gesture recognition in a mobile context as well as facial recognition in sign languages. Among a diversity of hardware and techniques, sensor-based gloves were the most used special hardware, along with brute force comparison to classify gestures. Works that did not adopt special hardware mostly used skin color for feature extraction in gesture recognition. Classification algorithms included: Support Vector Machines, Hierarchical Temporal Memory and Feedforward backpropagation neural network, among others. Recognition of static gestures typically achieved results higher than 80%. Fewer papers recognized dynamic gestures, obtaining results above 90%. However, most experiments were performed under controlled environments, with specific lighting conditions, and were only using a small set of gestures. In addition, the majority of works dealt with a simple background and used special hardware (which is often cumbersome for the user) to facilitate feature extraction. Facial expression recognition achieved high classification results using Random-Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron. Despite the progress being made with the increasing interest in gesture recognition, there are still important gaps to be addressed in the context of sign languages.

In principles, LMNN learns a more efficient metric in the input space by using a linear mapping as the outcome of a convex optimization problem. However, one of the greatest weak points of LMNN is the strong reliance of its optimization paradigm on how the neighboring points are chosen. In this paper, it is mathematically proved for the first time that the regular way of choosing the target points can lead to non-feasible optimization conditions regardless of the number of chosen neighboring points. We present a mathematical approach to categorize the target points into feasible and infeasible exemplars, an also we provide a feasibility measure for preference of the target candidates. In our proposed Feasibility Based-LMNN algorithm, we use the above clue to construct the optimization problem based on the most promising general mapping directions in the input space. Our empirical results shows that via using the proposed FB-LMNN approach the optimization problem will converge in a better optimum point, and therefor leads to better classification on the well-known benchmark datasets.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1610.05710", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ESANN 2018 proceedings", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950392284,2964189006,2535288021", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["168956", "55485900", "47325215", "13417115", "7299391", "12799509", "14860923", "207105691", "7208464", "1398236", "11319685", "2441932", "17038663", "17011836", "123368220"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12000063"}

In practice, it is too difficult to get a large number of training samples, and it cannot achieve a better convergence state due to the limited dataset. In order to solve this question, a new method using a deep migration hybrid model is put forward, which makes it easier to realize voiceprint recognition for small samples. Firstly, it uses Transfer Learning to transfer the trained network from the big sample voiceprint dataset to our limited voiceprint dataset for the further training. Fully-connected layers of a pre-training model are replaced by restricted Boltzmann machine layers. Secondly, the approach of Data Augmentation is adopted to increase the number of voiceprint datasets. Finally, we introduce fast batch normalization algorithms to improve the speed of the network convergence and shorten the training time. Our new voiceprint recognition approach uses the TLCNN-RBM (convolutional neural network mixed restricted Boltzmann machine based on transfer learning) model, which is the deep migration hybrid model that is used to achieve an average accuracy of over 97%, which is higher than that when using either CNN or the TL-CNN network (convolutional neural network based on transfer learning).

Obtaining high-confidence classification results for imbalanced class issues is highly important in practice.

We introduce an extended margin criterion and disagreement performance to evaluate the efficiency of XGB in imbalanced learning situations and examine the effect of minority class spectral separability on model performance. The results suggest that the uncertainty of XGB associated with correct classification is stable. The average probability-based margin of correct classification provided by XGB is 0.82, which is about 46.30% higher than that by random forest (RF) method (0.56). Moreover, the performance uncertainty of XGB is insensitive to spectral separability after the sample imbalance reached a certain level (minority:majority > 10:100). The impact of sample imbalance on the minority class is also related to its spectral separability, and XGB performs better than RF in terms of user accuracy for the minority class with imperfect separability. The disagreement components of XGB are better and more stable than RF with imbalanced samples, especially for complex areas with more types. In addition, appropriate sample imbalance helps to improve the trade-off between the recognition accuracy of XGB and the sample cost.

In this article, we consider denoising and prediction as separate problems for flows, as opposed to discrete time dynamical systems, and show that the use of smooth splines is more effective at removing noise. Combination of smooth splines and kernel based regression yields predictors that are more accurate on benchmarks typically by a factor of 2 or more. We prove that kernel based regression in combination with smooth splines converges to the exact predictor for time series extracted from any compact invariant set of any sufficiently smooth flow.

The IPSO is proposed to optimize them, and then the SVM-IPSO model is applied to the bi-directional prediction of carbon fiber production. The predictive accuracy of SVM is mainly dependent on its parameters, and IPSO is thus exploited to seek the optimal parameters for SVM in order to improve its prediction capability. Inspired by a cell communication mechanism, we propose IPSO by incorporating information of the global best solution into the search strategy to improve exploitation, and we employ IPSO to establish the bi-directional prediction model: in the direction of the forward prediction, we consider productive parameters as input and property indexes as output; in the direction of the backward prediction, we consider property indexes as input and productive parameters as output, and in this case, the model becomes a scheme design for novel style carbon fibers.

In other words, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the SVM-IPSO model in dealing with the problem of forecasting.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5455220", "pubmed_id": "28787927", "doi": "10.3390/ma8010117", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2040914336", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": ["98377773", "136984839", "95350554", "136599219", "137369569", "41273478", "54020219", "137257962", "111055383", "36998002", "39069221", "13717687", "12774329", "7363014", "38069406", "3909717", "120391712", "121763941", "3036436", "2518446", "108769731", "135559152", "110259045", "2336304", "19710619", "7138354", "108464382", "11225382", "7367791", "207603317", "11973794"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11699782"}

This study examined such a comparison over the Okanagan Valley and Kamloops region of British Columbia where good quality soil pit and soil survey data were available. A standard set of environmental variables including vegetative, climatic, and topographic indices were used to predict soil Great Groups in accordance with the Canadian System of Soil Classification. The pit-derived training dataset was developed using n = 478 points from the British Columbia Soil Information System while the polygon-derived training dataset was developed through random sampling of single-component soil survey map units based on an area-weighted approach. In both cases, the training points were intersected with a suite of 18 environmental covariates, reduced from 27 covariates using principal component analysis, and submitted to a machine-learner for predictions at a 100 m spatial resolution. Four single-model learners (CART, k -nearest neighbor, multinomial logistic regression, and logistic model tree) and five ensemble-model learners (CART with bagging, k -nearest neighbor with bagging, multinomial logistic regression with bagging, logistic model trees with bagging, and Random Forest) were compared. Surfaces of prediction uncertainty were produced using ignorance uncertainty and results were validated using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Predictions made using polygon-derived training data were consistently higher in accuracy across all models where the Random Forest model was the most effective learner with C = 61% accuracy when using pit-derived training data and C = 68% accuracy when using polygon-derived training data. Comparing single-model and ensemble-learner models, the bagging algorithm resulted in a 2\u201311% increase in accuracy when using pit-derived training data.

Enterography magnetic resonance imaging (E-MRI) has been proven to be a useful diagnostic tool for disease activity assessment. However, the manual classification process by expert radiologists is time-consuming and expensive. This paper proposes the evaluation of an automatic Support Vector Machine (SVM) based supervised learning method for CD classification. A real E-MRI dataset composed of 800 patients from the University of Palermo Policlinico Hospital (400 patients with histologically proved CD and 400 healthy patients) has been used to evaluate the proposed classification technique. For each patient, a team of radiology experts has extracted a vector composed of 20 features, usually associated with CD, from the related E-MRI examination, while the histological specimen results have been used as the ground-truth for CD diagnosis. The dataset composed of 800 vectors has been used to train and validate the SVM classifier. Automatic techniques for feature space reduction have been applied and validated by the radiologists to optimize the proposed classification method, while K-fold cross-validation has been used to improve the SVM classifier reliability. The measured indexes (sensitivity: 97.07%, specificity: 96.04%, negative predictive value: 97.24%, precision: 95.80%, accuracy: 96.54%, error: 3.46%) are better than the operator-based reference values reported in the literature.

A training dataset of 1172 patients was evaluated with a 10-stratified-fold cross-validation scheme. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) was the metric for the predictive ability. The results were assessed by only considering the output after applying the model to the test set, which was composed of the remaining 391 patients. Results The AUC score obtained by the dense tissue percentage (0.55) was compared to a machine learning-based classifier results. The classifier, apart from the percentage of dense tissue of both views, firstly included global geometric features such as the distance of dense tissue to the pectoral muscle, dense tissue eccentricity or the dense tissue perimeter, obtaining an accuracy of 0.56. By the inclusion of a global feature based on local histograms of oriented gradients, the accuracy of the classifier was significantly improved (0.61). The number of well-classified patients was improved up to 236 when it was 208. Conclusion Relative geometric features of dense tissue over the breast and histograms of standardized local texture features based on sliding windows scanning the whole breast improve risk prediction beyond the dense tissue percentage adjusted by geometrical variables. Other classifiers could improve the results obtained by the conventional Random Forests used in this study.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31319940", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.05.022", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "2946517359", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211120010"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182472711"}

Contrary to TSVM, we show that the optimization of TELM results in a purely combinatorial search over the unknown labels. Some preliminary results on an artifical dataset show substained improvements with respect to a standard ELM model.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-04129-2_3", "venue": "WIRN", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2597464189,122153844", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59342666", "7138354", "10125108", "15037168", "70866", "86426456", "116858", "6794505"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25951611"}

The absence of recommendations regarding the number of trees involved in RF ensembles could make the number of trees very large. This can increase the computational complexity of RF. Recommendations for not pruning the decision tree further aggravates the condition. This research attempts to build an efficient RF ensemble while maintaining its accuracy, especially in problem activity. Data collection is performed using an accelerometer sensor on a smartphone device. The data used in this research are collected from five peoples who perform 11 different activities. Each activity is carried out five times to enrich the data. This study uses two steps to improve the efficiency of the classification of the activity: 1) Optimal splitting criteria for activity classification, 2) Measured pruning to limit the tree depth in RF ensemble. The first method in this study can be applied to determine the splitting criteria that are most suitable for the classification problem of activities using Random Forest. In this case, the decision model built using the Gini Index can produce the highest accuracy.

It has become a crucial capability needed by many applications in public space video surveillance. However, it remains a challenging task due to the subtle inter-class similarity and large intra-class variation found in person images. Current CNN-based approaches have focused and investigated traditional identification or verification frameworks. Such approaches typically use the whole input image including the background and fail to pay attention to specific body parts, deviating the feature representation learning from informative parts. In this article, we introduce a self-attention mechanism coupled with cross-resolution to improve the feature representation learning of person re-identification task. The proposed self-attention module reinforces the most informative parts from a high-resolution image using its internal representation at the low-resolution. In particular, the model is fed with a pair of images on a different scale and consists of two branches. The upper branch processes the high-resolution image and learns high dimensional feature representation while the lower branch processes the low-resolution image and learns a filtering attention heatmap. The feature maps on the lower branch are subsequently weighted to reflect the importance of each patch of the input image using a softmax operation; whereas, on the upper branch, we apply a max pooling operation to downsample the high-resolution feature map before element-wise multiplied with the attention heatmap. Our attention module helps the network learn the most discriminative visual features of multiple regions of the image and is specifically optimized to attend and enforce feature representation at different scales. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets show that network architectures augmented with our self-attention module systematically improve their accuracy and outperform various state-of-the-art models by a large margin.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3377352", "venue": null, "journal": "ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3010001990", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11212020", "15678547", "4459186", "14811466", "14795862", "3332134", "6506243", "1921173", "40461189", "25539509", "3198903", "1633753", "7546954", "13740328", "206594692", "6203757", "12209503", "52289810", "59605992", "51902730", "10070153", "9179956", "938105", "3489845", "3458516", "14124239", "2057858", "6523475", "868693", "17195923", "656536", "8495258", "1602319", "5584770", "46757477", "50785503", "51876005", "4418812", "52084273", "1322267", "10013306", "206593880", "15172651", "13756489", "7693739", "52953066", "1806714", "2304733", "4331913", "17487206", "6082175", "13757035", "4234245", "9110612", "3043202", "10363459", "13676613", "1055111", "8849206", "13678604", "24819310", "480975", "7134752", "1822018", "14991802", "4549119", "2683207", "206595765", "2035600"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214794081"}

Therefore, efficient utilization of resources is required to meet the growing diversity in user's behavior and wireless services that mark the future of wireless communication. Automatic classification of wireless signals based on their modulation schemes is a crucial technology that enables wireless transceivers to utilize the resources efficiently. Traditional feature-based approaches lack generalization, and versatility by relying on single classifier predictions. In this paper, two adaptive boosting (Adaboost) based wireless signal classifiers called SigmaBoost and KNNAdaboost are proposed. Adaboost generates an optimal prediction rule by combining the prediction of many weak component classifiers (CCs). However, sometimes it overfits on real-world scenarios with noisy data. That makes the choice of CC vital for its success in classifying wireless signals. Therefore, two well-known classifiers support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) are used as CCs in proposed schemes respectively. In SigmaBoost an adaptive decrementing mechanism is introduced, which decreases the value of Gaussian radial function (RBF) of SVM kernel as boosting progresses. It not only ensures the generation of weak RBFSVM component classifiers but also improves diversity across the ensemble. Signal spectral features and higher-order cumulants are used as input features. The experimental results demonstrate significant gain in the performance of SigmaBoost, as compared to KNNAdaboost and other single classifier-based approaches. Hence, SigmaBoost can be used in multimedia-enabled IoT for quick discrimination of wireless signals to ensure better radio spectrum management.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950989", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2985246794", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["195882527", "181613532", "54437754", "69715901", "69955559", "57866408", "115196467", "58675292", "13596286", "2405012", "15816568", "11797437", "43535334", "16979351", "34499354", "14949452", "20613243", "23935236", "180747", "10897610", "35188655", "20799465", "31355910", "29409552", "15660601", "7433172", "3074096", "3449450", "174820216", "195775247", "52289805", "73729162", "52818750", "63751177", "61291571", "6644398", "32149675", "5763461"], "inbound_citations": ["214594349"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207971608"}

This limits the learning capabilities of serendipity oriented algorithms. Therefore, in the absence of any known deep learning algorithms for recommending serendipitous items and the lack of large serendipity oriented datasets, we introduce SerRec our novel transfer learning method to recommend serendipitous items. SerRec uses transfer learning to firstly train a deep neural network for relevance scores using a large dataset and then tunes it for serendipity scores using a smaller dataset.

However, the numerical solution provides accurate seepage analysis with a complex flow domain. This paper explores the effect of the hydraulic conductivity (K) and the anisotropy ratio (Ky/Kx) on the optimum hydraulic design of HWRS, utilizing the linked simulation-optimization (S-O) model approach. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) solver is linked with trained surrogate models to find the optimum solution at a minimum cost. The surrogate models are built based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique, which are trained and tested by using several data sets simulated by the numerical seepage modelling code (SEEPW). The optimum solutions obtained by the S-O model show that the K value and Ky/Kx ratio have significant influences on the optimum design of HWRS. An evaluation of the method was conducted by comareing seepage design variables obtained for the optimum design via the S-O model, with those obtained as SEEPW solutions. These evaluations demonstrated a good match.

SRAN classifier uses a sequential learning algorithm, employing self-adaptive thresholds to select the appropriate training samples and discard redundant samples to prevent over-training. These selected training samples are then used to evolve the network architecture efficiently. Since, the number of features extracted from the MR images is large, a feature selection scheme (to reduce the number of features needed) using an Integer-Coded Genetic Algorithm (ICGA) in conjunction with the SRAN classifier (referred to here as the ICGA-SRAN classifier) have been developed.

In this paper we systematically study information obtained from sequences and structures and compare their contributions in this prediction problem. Particularly, different geometrical and network topological properties of protein structures are evaluated to improve interface residue prediction accuracy.ResultsWe have quantified the impact of structural information on the prediction accuracy in comparison to the purely sequence based approach using two machine learning techniques: Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines. The highest AUC of 0.83 was achieved by a Support Vector Machine, exploiting PSI-BLAST profile, accessible surface area, betweenness-centrality and retention coefficient as input features.

In this paper, we study the Learning an Embedding Space for Regions (LESR) problem, wherein we aim to produce vector representations of discrete regions. Recent studies have shown that embedding geospatial regions in a latent vector space can be useful in a variety of urban computing tasks. However, previous studies do not consider regions across multiple modalities in an end-to-end framework. We argue that doing so facilitates the learning of greater semantic relationships among regions. We propose a novel method, RegionEncoder, that jointly learns region representations from satellite image, point-of-interest, human mobility, and spatial graph data. We demonstrate that these region embeddings are useful as features in two regression tasks and across two distinct urban environments. Additionally, we perform an ablation study that evaluates each major architectural component.

{"paper_id": "144017924", "title": "Review of Connectionism: A Hands-On Approach.", "authors": [{"first": "Joseph", "middle": [], "last": "MacInnes", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "MICHAEL R. W. DAWSON Connectionism: A Hands-On Approach Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2005, 208 pages (ISBN 1-4051-3074-1, US$69.95 Hardcover) Reviewed by JOSEPH MACINNES This book is intended to be a practical introduction to connectionist models and neural networks. The book uses as examples, simple connectionist models that have been studied over the years, with each chapter dedicated to a slightly more complex model or problem than the previous. The author also provides links to a web page where sample programs can be downloaded, allowing the reader to use these programs as they progress through the book. Although the book is well written, it falls short of its objective of being an introduction to connectionism. The book does not claim to be focused on connectionist theory, but its lack of a theoretical basis makes it difficult to follow. Throughout the book, there are references to another work by the author entitled Minds and Machines, which the reader can reference for the theoretical basis and background of connectionist models, and this may indicate the preferred use of the current book. Although this review does not include the Mind and Machines book (and this reviewer has not even read it), it is likely that \"Connectionism\" fits better as a workbook for its counterpart than it does as a standalone text. The first chapter exemplifies this problem as there is no introduction of note, and a novice reader (for whom this book is written) will be left without a clear definition of connectionism and how it relates to cognitive psychology. Much of this chapter is of the author's own history and progression from \"parallel distributed processing\" models. This chapter reads more as a prelude than introduction and would benefit from an additional chapter introducing terminology and use of connectionist models in psychology. Readers of this book should have been introduced to the major concepts before starting this text, and then directed to begin at Chapter 2. Later chapters seem to be arranged as a history of connectionism, with progressive chapters tackling later (and more advanced) concepts and implementations. Early chapters cover simple distributed memory before covering the perceptron and eventually hidden unit training. Again, the lack of a theoretical basis for connectionism makes the chapters seem as a sequential set of articles but taken on an individual basis, the chapters provide a very good layperson's description of their respective topics. The chapter on perceptrons, in particular, is an excellent introduction into what an activation function is, possible variants of activation functions, and learning rules. One of the biggest claims of the book is the inclusion of sample software, which can be downloaded from the author's website, allowing the readers to gain first-hand knowledge of three different types of networks: distributed associative memory with the \"James\" program, perceptron learning with the Rosenblatt program, and multilayer nets with the Rumelhart program.

In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Frechet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset.

Multi-index OD quantification, i.e., to simultaneously quantify a set of clinical indices including 2 vertical diameters (cup and disc), 2 whole areas (disc and rim), and 16 regional areas, is an untouched challenge due to its complexity of the multi-dimensional nonlinear mapping and various visual appearance across patients. In this paper, we propose a novel multitask ensemble learning framework (DMTFs) to automatically achieve accurate multi-types multi-index OD quantification. DMTFs creates an ensemble of multiple OD quantification tasks (OD segmentation and indices estimation) that are individually accurate and mutually complementary, and then learns the ensemble under a multi-task learning framework which is formed as a tree structure with a root network for shared feature representation, two branches for task-specific prediction, and a multitask ensemble module for aggregation of multi-index OD quantification. DMTFs models the consistency correlation between OD segmentation and indices estimation tasks to conform to the accurate multi-index OD quantification. Experiments on the ORIGA datasets show that the proposed method achieves impressive performance with the average mean absolute error on 20 indices of \\(0.99\\,\\pm \\,0.20\\), \\(0.73\\,\\pm \\,0.14\\) and \\(1.23\\,\\pm \\,0.24\\) for diameters, whole areas and regional area, respectively.

To date, a look at the scientific literature on the construction and use of synchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) support environments reveals that most researchers have focused either on exchanging information or on constructing and presenting posts. In this work, an intelligent collaborative synchronous CMC platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. The concept maps related to the learning topics are first outlined by the instructor. After each learner issues a post on the synchronous CMC platform, a feature selection approach is adopted to derive the input parameters of a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners' posts are related to the concept maps previously outlined by the instructor. Meanwhile, learner peers from the same group are asked to provide comments on the synchronous CMCs, and a group grading module is established in this work to evaluate the quality of the synchronous CMCs. If the evaluation results from the classifier and the group grading module are inconsistent, the instructor or the teaching assistant is consulted to verify the evaluation results. Notably, a feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to learners in cases where the synchronous CMC support system detects that the learners have strayed astray from the expected learning topics in their posts. The classification rates for the one-class SVM classifier can reach up to 97.06%, and the average pre-test and post-test grades were 51.94 and 66.77, respectively, which revealed that the junior high school students participating in synchronous CMC activities related to natural science were benefited by the proposed intelligent synchronous CMC platform.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2015.11.009", "venue": "Appl.

The state-of-the-art of the adversarial feature learning model named Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN), forces generative models to align with an arbitrarily complex distribution in a latent space. However, BiGAN only matches single data distribution without exploiting multi-domain structure, which means the learned latent representation could not transfer to related target domains. Recent research has proved that GANs combined with Cycle Consistent Constraints are effective at image translation. Therefore, we propose a novel framework named Transferable Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks combining with Cycle-Consistent Constraints (Cycle-TBiGAN) be applied in cross-domain translation, which aims at learning an alignment latent feature representation and achieving a mapping function between domains. Our framework is suitable for a wide variety of domain adaption scenarios. We show the surprising results in the task of image translation without prior ground-truth knowledge.

The current interest lies in the unraveling of a disorder-to-order transitioning code embedded in the amino acid sequences of IDPs / IDPRs. Disordered proteins are characterized by an enormous amount of structural plasticity which makes them promiscuous in binding to different partners, multi-functional in cellular activity and atypical in folding energy landscapes resembling partially folded molten globules. Also, their involvement in several deadly human diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases) makes them attractive drug targets, and important for a biochemical understanding of the disease(s). The study of the structural ensemble of IDPs is rather difficult, in particular for transient interactions. When bound to a structured partner, an IDPR adapts an ordered conformation in the complex. The residues that undergo this disorder-to-order transition are called protean residues, generally found in short contiguous stretches and the first step in understanding the modus operandi of an IDP / IDPR would be to predict these residues. There are a few available methods which predict these protean segments from their amino acid sequences; however, their performance reported in the literature leaves clear room for improvement. With this background, the current study presents 'Proteus', a random forest classifier that predicts the likelihood of a residue undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a potential partner protein. The prediction is based on features that can be calculated using the amino acid sequence alone. Proteus compares favorably with existing methods predicting twice as many true positives as the second best method (55% vs. 27%) with a much higher precision on an independent data set. The current study also sheds some light on a possible 'disorder-to-order' transitioning consensus, untangled, yet embedded in the amino acid sequence of IDPs. Some guidelines have also been suggested for proceeding with a real-life structural modeling involving an IDPR using Proteus.

In this study, the effectiveness of plot-level metrics (i.e., distributional, canopy volume and Weibull-fitted metrics) and individual-tree-summarized metrics (i.e., maximum, minimum and mean height of trees and the number of trees from the individual tree detection (ITD) results) derived from UAV-LiDAR point clouds were assessed, then these metrics were used to fit estimation models of six forest structural attributes by parametric (i.e., partial least squares (PLS)) and non-parametric (i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Random Forest (RF)) approaches, within a Ginkgo plantation in east China. In addition, we assessed the effects of UAV-LiDAR point cloud density on the derived metrics and individual tree segmentation results, and evaluated the correlations of these metrics with aboveground biomass (AGB) by a sensitivity analysis.

However, most current works in the area lack an effective framework for learning the part-whole relationships within the data and learning useful spatiotemporal representations. To tackle this problem and other issues associated with multimodal biological signal analysis, we propose an architecture composed of a capsule attention mechanism following a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Our model learns both temporal and hierarchical/spatial dependencies in the data through the LSTM and capsule feature representation layers. To better explore the discriminative ability of the learned representations, we study the effect of the proposed capsule attention mechanism including the number of dynamic routing iterations as well as other parameters.

First, the chapters were categorized by places of revelation using Support Vector Machine and naive Bayesian classifiers separately, and their results were compared to each other, as well as to the existing traditional Islamic and western orientalists classifications. The chapters were categorized into Meccan (revealed in Mecca) and Medinan (revealed in Medina). After that, chapters of each category were clustered using a kind of fuzzy-single linkage clustering approach, in order to correspond to the major phases of Prophet Mohammad\u2019s life. The major phases of the Prophet\u2019s life were manually derived from the Quranic text, as well as from the secondary Islamic literature e.g hadiths, exegesis. Previous studies on computing the places of revelation of Quranic chapters relied heavily on features extracted from existing background knowledge of the chapters. For instance, it is known that Meccan chapters contain mostly verses about faith and related problems, while Medinan ones encompass verses dealing with social issues, battles\u2026etc. These features are by themselves insufficient as a basis for assigning the chapters to their respective places of revelation. In fact, there are exceptions, since some chapters do contain both Meccan and Medinan features. In this study, features of each category were automatically created from very few chapters, whose places of revelation have been determined through identification of historical facts and events such as battles, migration to Medina\u2026etc. Chapters having unanimously agreed places of revelation were used as the initial training set, while the remaining chapters formed the testing set. The classification process was made recursive by regularly augmenting the training set with correctly classified chapters, in order to classify the whole testing set. Each chapter was preprocessed by removing unimportant words, stemming, and representation with vector space model. The result of this study shows that, the two classifiers have produced useable results, with an outperformance of the support vector machine classifier. This study indicates that, the proposed methodology yields encouraging results for arranging Quranic chapters by phases of Prophet Mohammad\u2019s messengership.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2186192008", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["9969235", "15469406", "62575341", "28637672", "2427083", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["45017348", "6507044", "63934058", "30783551", "59378628", "126396891"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110367097"}

The underlying model is a probabilitic transducer, computed by using grammatical inference techniques, that allows us to learn both the structure and the probabilities of the model. Beyond the fact that the learned transducers are neither deterministic nor stochastic in the standard terminology, they are conditional, thus independant from the distributions of the input strings.

When the system sees the same person\u2019s face or hears the same voice it can then use a summary of the last conversation with this person to remind the wearer.

Preliminary results show that combining different face recognition and speaker identification technology by meta-classification is dramatically more effective than weighted interpolation.

Solving the QA problem consists of two major steps: relevant fact selection and answering the question. Existing methods usually combine the two steps to solve the problem.

In this paper, we propose to separate the two steps and only consider the problem of relevant fact selection. We used a graphical probabilistic model Conditional Random Field (CRF) to model the interdependent relationship among the chaining facts in order to select the relevant ones. In our experiments on a benchmark dataset, we are able to select correctly all relevant facts from 13 tasks out of 19 tasks (F-scores of the rest of the 6 tasks range from 0.8 to 0.97).

The experimental work underlying this paper dealt with the cellular organization (cytoarchitecture) and connections of the hippocampus in the mouse, monkey, and human brain, and contributions emerging from this analysis may be divided in factual and theoretical components. As we shall see, Lorente de No advanced our knowledge of hippocampal circuitry in several important ways. However, his real genius emerged from theoretical considerations of the physiology of individual neurons and then of interconnected groups of neurons. From this he made the remarkable prediction that conduction in axons and dendrites must be fundamentally different: while conduction in axons is by way of all-or-none impulses that are followed by a refractory period, conduction at dendrites was predicted to be subthreshold, additive, and nonrefractory. In short, he proposed that the neuron is a summation apparatus that generates a pattern of impulses in the axon.

Hence, in the proposed framework a similarity score for each attribute is obtained as a weighted combination of all the hidden layer features of the parent model.

Topographic lidar scanning has become an established technique to characterize the Earth surface: and reconstruct the topography. For flood hazard modeling in coastal areas, the key step before terrain modeling is the discrimination of land and water surfaces within the delivered point clouds. Therefore, instantaneous shoreline, river borders, inland waters can be extracted as a basis for more reliable DTM generation. This paper presents an automatic, efficient, and versatile workflow for land/water classification of airborne topographic lidar data. For that purpose, a classification framework based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is designed. First, a set of features, based only 3D lidar point coordinates and flightline information, is defined. Then, the SVM learning step is performed on small but well-targeted areas thanks to an automatic region growing strategy. Finally, label probabilities given by the SVM are merged during a probabilistic relaxation step in order to remove pixel-wise misclassification. Results over two large areas show that survey of millions of points are labelled with high accuracy (>95%) and that small features of interest are still well classified though we work at low point densities (2-3pts/m2). Finally, our approach provides a strong basis for further discrimination of coastal land-cover classes and habitats.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721092", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1963507465", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128488331", "56339904", "18199603", "2357415", "14650249", "25842396", "119815306"], "inbound_citations": ["56260307"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17442909"}

However, existing methods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the\"knowledge\"in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This may lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be complete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and entities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature of KG when incorporating it into recommender system. In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge graph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we transfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a user likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies directed by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that the director relation plays a critical role when the user makes the decision, thus help to understand the user's preference at a finer granularity. Technically, we contribute a new translation-based recommendation model, which specially accounts for various preferences in translating a user to an item, and then jointly train it with a KG completion model by combining several transfer schemes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods. Further analysis verifies the positive effect of joint training on both tasks of recommendation and KG completion, and the advantage of our model in understanding user preference.

The ability of multivariable analysis methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify the saffron samples according to their geographical origin have been investigated. Both PCA and HCA have shown an overlapping of E-nose responses. Moreover, the SVM analysis of the E-nose database reached a 66.07% success rate in the recognition of the saffron sample odour. On the other hand, good discrimination has been reached using PCA and HCA in the VE-tongue characterization case, besides a 100% accuracy in the saffron flavour recognition was attained. To validate the proposed electronic sensing systems, analytical chemical methods such as SPME-GC-MS and UV-Vis spectrophotometry were used. These analytical methods could be helpful tools to identify the composition of volatile compounds of the analysed saffron samples. Moreover, UV-Vis spectrophotometry was also used to determine the non-volatile profile of the samples from different geographic origins. It is demonstrated that the electronic sensing systems' findings are in a satisfactory correlation with the analytical methods.

In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome (defined by pairs of points in 3-D space) is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the GraphNet regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or GraphNet regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and GraphNet regularized SVM with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme.

In fact, one of the major challenges faced by city authorities of developing countries is to control air pollution, which might cause chronic diseases and financial concerns to the residents. Although a few air quality monitoring and air pollution control measures exist, these solutions are not remaining as assets to cities. In this paper, a revenue oriented, cloud microservice based air quality prediction framework is proposed for smart cities.

Therefore, splicing data of 80 UM patients were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) SpliceSeq and RNA sequence data of UM and patient clinical features were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to identify survival related splicing events in UM. As a result, a total of 37996 AS events of 17911 genes in UM were detected, among which 5299 AS events of 3529 genes were significantly associated with UM patients\u2019 survival. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that this survival related splicing genes are corelated with mRNA catabolic process and ribosome pathway. Based on survival related splicing events, seven types of prognostic markers and the final overall prognostic signature could independently predict the overall survival of UM patients. Finally, an 11 spliced gene was identified in the final signature. On the basis of these 11 genes, we constructed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and evaluated it with leave-one-out cross-validation. The results showed that the 11 genes could determine short- and long-term survival with a predicted accuracy of 97.5%.

In practical use, partial least squares-based gene selection approaches can obtain gene subsets of good qualities, but are considerably time-consuming. In this paper, we propose to integrate partial least squares based recursive feature elimination (PLS-RFE) with two feature elimination schemes: simulated annealing and square root, respectively, to speed up the feature selection process. Inspired from the strategy of annealing schedule, the two proposed approaches eliminate a number of features rather than one least informative feature during each iteration and the number of removed features decreases as the iteration proceeds. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches, we perform extensive experiments on six publicly available microarray data with three typical classifiers, including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest-Neighbor and Support Vector Machine, and compare our approaches with ReliefF, PLS and PLS-RFE feature selectors in terms of classification accuracy and running time. Experimental results demonstrate that the two proposed approaches accelerate the feature selection process impressively without degrading the classification accuracy and obtain more compact feature subsets for both two-category and multi-category problems. Further experimental comparisons in feature subset consistency show that the proposed approach with simulated annealing scheme not only has better time performance, but also obtains slightly better feature subset consistency than the one with square root scheme.

An external validation on new climate stations and years that were not used for model training indicated the ability of the model to predict Tair with a RMSE of 2.61 \u00b0C and a R2 of 0.89. The resulting model can be applied to the entire MSG SEVIRI time series since 2004. It hence allows for spatio-temporal pattern analysis as well as for the detection of trends which is relevant in the context of climate change.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2019.02.006", "venue": "Int.

In this paper, a performance comparison between different machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (C4.5), Naive Bayes (NB) and k Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (original) datasets is conducted. The main objective is to assess the correctness in classifying data with respect to efficiency and effectiveness of each algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity.

With the remarkable success of pair-based metric learning losses, recent works have proposed the use of generated synthetic points on metric learning losses for augmentation and generalization. However, these methods require additional generative networks along with the main network, which can lead to a larger model size, slower training speed, and harder optimization. Meanwhile, post-processing techniques, such as query expansion and database augmentation, have proposed the combination of feature points to obtain additional semantic information. In this paper, inspired by query expansion and database augmentation, we propose an augmentation method in an embedding space for pair-based metric learning losses, called embedding expansion. The proposed method generates synthetic points containing augmented information by a combination of feature points and performs hard negative pair mining to learn with the most informative feature representations. Because of its simplicity and flexibility, it can be used for existing metric learning losses without affecting model size, training speed, or optimization difficulty. Finally, the combination of embedding expansion and representative metric learning losses outperforms the state-of-the-art losses and previous sample generation methods in both image retrieval and clustering tasks.

An RF is ensemble of decision tree classifiers with injection of several sources of randomness. It demonstrates a set of improvement over single decision and regression trees and is comparable or superior to major classification tools such as support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive boosting (Adaboost) with respect to accuracy, interpretability, robustness and processing speed. RF can be generally divided into training process and predicting process. Recently with emergence of large-scale data mining applications, the RF training process implemented in software on a single computer can no longer induce a complex RF model within reasonable amount of time. Alternative solutions involving computer clusters and GPUs usually come with disadvantages with respect to Performance/Power ratio and are not feasible for portable/embedded applications. In this work a set of FPGA-based implementations of the RF training process are proposed. FPGA devices allow construction of efficient custom hardware architectures and feature lower power consumption than typical GPPs or GPUs therefore are suitable for portable/embedded applications. The proposed hardware training architectures take advantage of different types of inherent parallelism in the RF training algorithm and distribute the workload to a set of parallel workers.

Research efforts dedicated to representation learning, especially representation learning using deep learning, has shown us ways to automatically learn relevant features from vast amounts of potentially noisy, raw data. However, most of the methods are inadequate to handle heterogeneous information networks which pretty much represents most real world data today. The methods cannot preserve the structure and semantic of multiple types of nodes and links well enough, capture higher-order heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and ensure coverage of nodes for which representations are generated. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient algorithm, motif2vec that learns node representations or embeddings for heterogeneous networks. Specifically, we leverage higher-order, recurring, and statistically significant network connectivity patterns in the form of motifs to transform the original graph to motif graph(s), conduct biased random walk to efficiently explore higher order neighborhoods, and then employ heterogeneous skip-gram model to generate the embeddings.

Automated lipreading approaches have recently been used in such applications as biometric identification, silent dictation, forensic analysis of surveillance camera capture, and communication with autonomous vehicles. However, lipreading is a difficult process that poses several challenges to human- and machine-based approaches alike. This is due to the large number of phonemes in human language that are visually represented by a smaller number of lip movements (visemes). Consequently, the same viseme may be used to represent several phonemes, which confuses any lipreader. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the machine learning approach for the real-time visual recognition of spoken words. Our focus on real-time performance is motivated by the recent trend of using lipreading in autonomous vehicles.

In this paper, we extend ELMs for both semi-supervised and unsupervised tasks based on the manifold regularization, thus greatly expanding the applicability of ELMs. The key advantages of the proposed algorithms are as follows: 1) both the semi-supervised ELM (SS-ELM) and the unsupervised ELM (US-ELM) exhibit learning capability and computational efficiency of ELMs; 2) both algorithms naturally handle multiclass classification or multicluster clustering; and 3) both algorithms are inductive and can handle unseen data at test time directly. Moreover, it is shown in this paper that all the supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised ELMs can actually be put into a unified framework. This provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of random feature mapping, which is the key concept in ELM theory.

Automated parameter-search methods potentially represent a more rapid and less labor-intensive alternative to choosing parameters manually. Here we compare the performance of four different parameter-search methods on several single-neuron models. The methods compared are conjugate-gradient descent, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and stochastic search. Each method has been tested on five different neuronal models ranging from simple models with between 3 and 15 parameters to a realistic pyramidal cell model with 23 parameters. The results demonstrate that genetic algorithms and simulated annealing are generally the most effective methods. Simulated annealing was overwhelmingly the most effective method for simple models with small numbers of parameters, but the genetic algorithm method was equally effective for more complex models with larger numbers of parameters.

Frame-based cameras have an average frame-rate of 30 fps, causing motion blur when capturing fast motion, e.g. hand gesture. Rather than wastefully sending entire images at a fixed frame rate, neuromorphic vision sensors only transmit the local pixel-level changes induced by the movement in a scene when they occur. This leads to advantageous characteristics, including low energy consumption, high dynamic range, a sparse event stream, and low response latency. In this study, a novel representation learning method was proposed: Fixed Length Gists Representation (FLGR) learning for event-based gesture recognition. Previous methods accumulate events into video frames in a temporal duration (e.g. 30 ms) to make the accumulated image-level representation. However, the accumulated-frame-based representation waives the friendly event-driven paradigm of neuromorphic vision sensors. New representation is urgently needed to fill the gap in non-accumulated-frame-based representation and exploit the further capabilities of neuromorphic vision. The proposed FLGR is a sequence learned from mixture density autoencoder and preserves nature of event-based data better. FLGR has a data format of fixed length, and it is easy to feed to sequence classifier. Moreover, an RNN-HMM hybrid was proposed to address the continuous gesture recognition problem. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was applied for FLGR sequence classification while a hidden Markov model(HMM) is employed for localizing the candidate gesture and improving the result in a continuous sequence. A neuromorphic continuous hand gestures dataset (Neuro ConGD Dataset) was developed with 17 hand gestures classes for the community of the neuromorphic research. Hopefully, FLGR can inspire the study on the event-based highly efficient, high-speed, and high-dynamic-range sequence classification tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6380225", "pubmed_id": "30809114", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2019.00073", "venue": "Front.

G binds to specific ephrin receptors on the host membrane. Ephrin binding changes the configurational density of G that activates F, which, in turn, mediates fusion. To understand how ephrin binding causes G to activate F, we use molecular dynamics in conjunction with machine learning1 and filter out the set of residues in the G head domain whose configurational densities are shifted equivalently by different ephrins, B2, B3, and a double mutant of B2. These three ephrins all trigger viral fusion, but with different potencies. We find that these three ephrins induce statistically equivalent shifts in the configurational densities of about one-quarter of the residues in the G head domain. This surprisingly expansive communal change in G includes most of the residues that have been shown experimentally to be important to F activation. This suggests that this set of residues contain the signaling pathways that connect the G-ephrin interface to the G stalk domain that activates F. The distribution of these residues in the G head domain is consistent with two models of signal transduction: one in which the ephrin-binding signal transduces to the F-activating G stalk domain via changes in the head-stalk interface, and the other in which the signal transduces via changes in the G head domain dimer interface. In general, this study shows how machine learning can be utilized along with molecular simulations to filter out quantitatively conserved patterns in changes in protein structure and dynamics.1) Leighty RE.; Varma S.

Accurate predictions of bus travel time are necessary to know whether the travel time over target intervals between pairs of adjacent bus stops is stable or not. For this purpose, at first, we classified intervals between adjacent bus stops into two classes: stable and unstable. Next, we identified two statistically significant factors: variations of travel time in the same time periods over days and correlation of travel time between eight time-periods, which influence the bus travel time in the current time-period over unstable intervals. Then, we developed nonlinear dynamical models for predicting bus travel time over each unstable interval between adjacent bus stops for 7 time periods in a day. The proposed method basically utilizes time series methods based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF).

Moreover, many cohorts have the problem of imbalanced classes where the number of patients belonging to each class is not the same. With this kind of dataset, biologists need to identify a small number of informative genes that can be used as biomarkers for a disease.ResultsThis paper introduces a Balanced Iterative Random Forest (BIRF) algorithm to select the most relevant genes for a disease from imbalanced high-throughput gene expression microarray data. Balanced iterative random forest is applied on four cancer microarray datasets: a childhood leukaemia dataset, which represents the main target of this paper, collected from The Children\u2019s Hospital at Westmead, NCI 60, a Colon dataset and a Lung cancer dataset. The results obtained by BIRF are compared to those of Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), Multi-class SVM-RFE (MSVM-RFE), Random Forest (RF) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. The results of the BIRF approach outperform these state-of-the-art methods, especially in the case of imbalanced datasets. Experiments on the childhood leukaemia dataset show that a 7% \u223c 12% better accuracy is achieved by BIRF over MSVM-RFE with the ability to predict patients in the minor class. The informative biomarkers selected by the BIRF algorithm were validated by repeating training experiments three times to see whether they are globally informative, or just selected by chance. The results show that 64% of the top genes consistently appear in the three lists, and the top 20 genes remain near the top in the other three lists.ConclusionThe designed BIRF algorithm is an appropriate choice to select genes from imbalanced high-throughput gene expression microarray data. BIRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially the ability to handle the class-imbalanced data. Moreover, the analysis of the selected genes also provides a way to distinguish between the predictive genes and those that only appear to be predictive.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3766035", "pubmed_id": "23981907", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-14-261", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2162500454", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["379259", "2528506", "37623516", "20289701", "61649919", "15245447", "2827580", "2098577", "6060487", "7272237", "120386719", "1135137", "9061359", "12929471", "38543082", "5575774", "7159780", "2914506", "17210997", "8544683", "194951", "4074916", "5225892", "23293969", "3831616", "16549644"], "inbound_citations": ["18568711", "215131172", "46989264", "11894061", "22526678", "51614401", "16549644", "197637227", "197537433", "10984812", "69472461", "52129279", "215017246", "212444603", "17019", "215553363", "18714254", "196657232", "211058823", "10175940", "215592168", "4347706", "5513995", "25420332", "4413783", "196635181", "32072791", "14629126"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16549644"}

The information enclosed in hyperspectral data permits the characterization, recognition and classification of the land covers with enhanced accuracy and robustness. On the other hand, quite a lot of vital complications must be considered during the classification process of hyperspectral data, among which the maximum quantity of spectral channels, the spatial unevenness of the spectral signature, shape discovery of the images and the value of data. Above all, the maximum quantity of spectral channels and low number of labeled training samples pose the setback of the curse of dimensionality and, accordingly, result in the possibility of overfitting the training data. With the aim of solving all these complications, in this study presented the framework of Support Vector Machine (SVM) together with Fuzzy Sigmoid Kernel Function (SVM FSK) in the circumstance of HSI classification and analyzing their features in the hyperspectral domain. A Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) model is employed for the purpose of dimensionality reduction of HSI. The KFDA dimensionality reduction scheme depends on the selection of the kernel in a higher dimensional HSI feature space. In order to enhance the gradient level of spatial information, employed Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD) with Gaussian Firefly Algorithm (GFA) (IEMD GFA) to boost the mixed pixel wise SVM FSK cl assification accuracy. During the process of IEMD scheme, the identifiable of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) of spectral band, weight values of IMFs are computed with the help of GFA. In order to identify the shape of HSI, novel hybrid scheme depending on the canny operator and fuzzy entropy theory is formulated. This scheme computes the fuzzy entropy of gradients from an image to make a decision on the threshold for the canny operator. For the purpose of detecting the edges and to discover the shape of the object Weibull Probability Density Function (WPDF) scheme is used. The obtained both spectral and spatial pixels are classified using SVM FSK and estimated by using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The proposed SVM FSK is assessed with hyperspectral AVIRIS Indian Pine dataset. It shows that the proposed dimensionality reduction with SVM FSK classification shows improved classification accuracy in terms of parameters like overall accuracy, standard deviation and mean.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.19026/rjaset.11.2242", "venue": null, "journal": "Research Journal of Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology", "mag_id": "2499692870,2368924411", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55211687"}

The three regression algorithms are the regression of support vector machine (R-SVM), the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and the multiple regression analysis (MRA), while the three classification algorithms are the classification of support vector machine (C-SVM), the naive Bayesian (NBAY), and the Bayesian successive discrimination (BAYSD). In general, when all these six algorithms are used to solve a real-world problem, they often produce different solution accuracies. When an algorithm is applied to a real-world problem, its solution accuracy is expressed with the total mean absolute relative residual for all samples, R(%). In this paper, three criteria have been proposed: 1) nonlinearity degree of a studied problem based on R(%) of MRA (weak if R(%) 30); 2) solution accuracy of a given algorithm application based on its R(%) (high if R(%) 30); and 3) results availability of a given algorithm application (applicable if R(%)<10, and inapplicable if R(%)\u226510). A case study of naturally fractured layer productivity at an oilfield in Sichuan Province of China has been used to validate the proposed approach. This case study consists of two problems: regression and classification. For the regression problem, R-SVM, BPNN and MRA are inapplicable because their R(%) values are 4620, 44 and 5980, respectively. For the classification problem, however, C-SVM, NBAY and BAYSD are all applicable since their R(%) values are 0, 5.9 and 9.1, respectively. From the case study, it is concluded that: a) the three proposed criteria, and the rules of conversion from real number to integer number are practical; b) R(%) of MRA is used to measure the nonlinearity degree of a studied problem, and thus MRA should be used as a first choice; c) for classification problems, the preferable algorithm is C-SVM, NBAY, or BAYSD if the problems nonlinearity is weak or moderate, and BAYSD can also serve as a promising dimension-reduction tool; d) for regression problems, the preferable algorithm is BPNN, but MRA can serve as a promising dimension-reduction tool only when the problems are linear; e) if BPNN is inapplicable for a regression problem, it is proposed to change the problem from regression to classification by reasonable conversion rules, then apply C-SVM, NBAY, or BAYSD; and f) comparing with C-SVM, BAYSD is conditionally better.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.12783/jpsr.2015.0402.03", "venue": "Journal of Petroleum Science Research", "journal": "Journal of Petroleum Science Research", "mag_id": "2482534576", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["113042816"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124648755"}

Based on different forms of benthic macroinvertebrate data using relative abundance of family level taxonomic groups, metrics and traits collected during spring 2010 at 96 lotic sites across northern Portugal, the procedure employs components of top down and bottom up analytical processes and introduces the concept of niche breadth to assess biological quality element response to environmental and stressor parameters across different spatial levels. Random Forest classification revealed that fractal and non-fractal land use metrics at basin and local level were extremely important determinants of Water Framework Directive determination of \u201cGood\u201d ecological quality, particularly at the local scale. The amount of urbanization at the lower spatial level was a particularly important determinant of ecological quality, while the extent and type of forest (especially coniferous) was more important at higher, river basin scale. Distance-based linear models (DISTLM) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) were used to determine associations between invertebrate data and non-redundant environmental predictors selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Results revealed a stronger association between invertebrate traits and selected environmental predictors compared to the other types of invertebrate data, although some association between invertebrate relative abundance and eutrophication was detected. Principal Components Analyses (PCA) were run for the non-redundant sets of predictors for each macroinvertebrate data set to extract an environmental quality gradient along the first axis. Niche breadth, calculated for candidate indicators to avoid bias resulting from expert judgement, was distributed by rank along its respective PCA gradient. Five candidate indicators for each data type were selected for their preference for the most pristine sites and five were selected due to their close link with the most degraded streams. Candidate bioindicators for impacted sites tended to be stenobiotic in character, due to the impoverished structural and functional diversity associated with such conditions. Finally Partial Least Squares Regression was used to refine and validate selected candidate metrics, to produce a comprehensive final list of macroinvertebrate measures of ecological quality.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.06.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "1992815723", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14065", "210818242", "3447709", "90949811", "215490552", "73678713", "55007074"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:83661501"}

In this paper, an instance-based transfer learning method combined with gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) is proposed to develop a wind power quantile regression model. Based on the spatial cross-correlation characteristic of wind power generations in different zones, the proposed model utilizes wind power generations in correlated zones as the source problems of instance-based transfer learning. By incorporating the training data of source problems into the training process, the proposed model successfully reduces the prediction error of wind power generation in the target zone. To prevent negative transfer, this paper proposes a method that properly assigns weights to data from different source problems in the training process, whereby the weights of related source problems are increased, while those of unrelated ones are reduced. Case studies are developed based on the dataset from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014).

A powerful approach to addressing the genetic complexity in admixed populations is to infer ancestry. Ancestry inference including the proportion of an individual's genome coming from each population and its ancestral origin along the chromosome of an admixed population requires the use of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) from reference ancestral populations. AIMs exhibit substantial differences in allele frequency between ancestral populations. Given the huge amount of human genetic variation data available from diverse populations, a computationally feasible and cost-effective approach is becoming increasingly important to extract or filter AIMs with the maximum information content for ancestry inference, admixture mapping, forensic applications, and detecting genomic regions that have been under recent selection. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To address this gap, we present MI-MAAP, an easy-to-use web-based bioinformatics tool designed to prioritize informative markers for multi-ancestry admixed populations by utilizing feature selection methods and multiple genomics resources including 1000 Genomes Project and Human Genome Diversity Project. Specifically, this tool implements a novel allele frequency-based feature selection algorithm, Lancaster Estimator of Independence (LEI), as well as other genotype-based methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). We demonstrated that MI-MAAP is a useful tool in prioritizing informative markers and accurately classifying ancestral populations. LEI is an efficient feature selection strategy to retrieve ancestry informative variants with different allele frequency/selection pressure among (or between) ancestries without requiring computationally expensive individual-level genotype data. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: MI-MAAP has a user-friendly interface which provides researchers an easy and fast way to filter and identify AIMs. MI-MAAP can be accessed at https://research.cchmc.org/mershalab/MI-MAAP/login/.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7119171", "pubmed_id": "32245404", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-020-3462-5", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3014097457", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214784530"}

As the main objective in machining processes is to produce a high-quality surface finish which, however, can be measured only at the end of the machining cycle, a more preferable method would be to monitor the quality during the cycle. Motivated by that premise,do not interrupt the machining process, results of investigation on the relationship between audible sound emitted during process and the resulted surface finish are reported in this paper. Through experiments with AISI 52100 hardened steel, this paper shows that such a correlation does exist between the surface roughness and the sound energy, and based on that correlation, a new quality monitoring method is proposed using Support Vector Machines (SVM) approached by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Obtained results shown that this method can identify three different levels of surface roughness achieving an average accuracy of 100.00%.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.107102", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Acoustics", "mag_id": "2983210627", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209769983"}

A multiscale CHARN model, which is an incorporation of wavelet decomposition analysis with a CHARN model estimated by SVR, is proposed and investigated using real-world data sets. To exploit the locality advantage of wavelets, we use wavelet analysis and combine it with SVR. Wavelets are able to economically describe phenomena that are heterogeneous. Recent studies on heterogeneous agents in financial markets theoretically support advocated scale-based analysis of markets, and, of course, the multiscale CHARN model proposition, since it is believed that each scale corresponds to each heterogeneous agent who acts differently in the market. Our objective is to improve the accuracy of estimation by applying multiscale decomposition. The results of applying SVR to estimate the CHARN model in a single resolution on real-world time series indicate that it outperforms the technical benchmarks.

We find, in particular, that the IBK and Random Forest learning algorithms have the highest cross-validated prediction accuracy of 81% and 80% respectively, thus supporting the claim that the decision to procure an audit is not made arbitrarily, but rather systematically, and therefore is amenable to analysis. Second, we use logistic regression to identify those characteristics that may systematically influence the decision to procure an independent audit.

Although various safety models have been developed including the models introduced in the first edition of Highway Safety Manual (HSM) by American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), these models try to link roadway design features, such as lane with, should width, horizontal curve and vertical grade design with crash occurrences at disaggregated level and require the detailed inputting data and complex application procedures. Transportation planning mainly deals with type and functionality of roadway or roadway network. The HSM crash prediction modes for urban and suburban roadway are complex involving several sub-models for different types of collisions, which makes it hard for transportation planning applications.This paper introduces an innovative crash prediction model with so-called Support Vector Machines (SVM). Being a branch of machine learning, SVM focuses on the recognition of patterns and regularities in data. The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been made possible by many important developments in the underlying algorithms, techniques and readily available open-source programming code. Motivated by lack of suitable safety models for transportation planning, this study used the SVM with crash data from Louisiana urban roadways to develop safety models for urban 2-lane roadway, multi-lane roadway and freeways with satisfactory results.

Atkinson (atkinson@ra.msstate.edu) Mississippi State University, Department Counselor Education and Educational Psychology, Box 9727, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA Learners can carry out new procedures or solve new problems that are quite similar to those on which they were trained, but they have difficulty when the novel cases involve more than minor changes from what they had previously studied. This transfer difficulty seems to stem from a tendency by many learners to memorize the steps of how equations are filled out rather than learning the deeper, conceptual knowledge that is implicit in the details. One type of knowledge structure that appears to aid procedural generalization is one organized by subgoals (Catrambone, 1998). A subgoal represents a meaningful conceptual piece of an overall solution procedure and can serve as a guide to which part of a previously-learned solution procedure needs to be modified for a novel problem. In the domain of mathematical problem solving there are often computationally-friendly solution approaches in which multiple solution steps are collapsed into a single formula. These formulas allow for the easy calculation of the solution by simply inserting the correct values into the formula. A major drawback of this approach is that it is restricted to solving a narrow range of problems that fall into predefined problem categories corresponding to solution formulas. A good example of such a contrast is the process of calculating sum of squared deviation scores (SS) for the variance terms in t-tests and analyses of variance (ANOVAs). The conceptual formula for SS in a t-test, translates directly into the sum of squared \u2211 ( X \u2212 X ) deviations. This clearly captures how the variance term measures the amount of spread about the mean. In contrast, the computational formula for SS, \u2211 X ( \u2211 X ) 2 N permits the learner to calculate SS directly from raw scores which can lead to more efficient calculations, however, the computational formula conceals the notion of spread. We were also interested in the relative effectiveness of overview information presented to learners either before they studied an example or after they studied an example. Overview information offered as a pre- instructional aid might, like advance organizers, provide an organizing cognitive structure for receiving new material (Ausubel, 1968). However, a pre- example overview runs the risk of appearing too abstract and non-contextualized. A post-example overview might supplement or reinforce what was illustrated in the examples, thereby facilitating the integration and application of recently acquired procedural knowledge. Procedure and Hypothesis Participants (N = 112) studied a t-test example and a two-group ANOVA example that used either a conceptual or computational approach. Overview information either preceded or followed each example. Participants then solved two near transfer problems (a t- test problem and a two-group ANOVA problem) and a far transfer problem (a three-group ANOVA problem that required an adaptation of how variance was calculated). We hypothesized that consistent with a subgoal-learning approach, learners who studied examples with conceptually-oriented equations would transfer more successfully to novel problems compared to learners who studied examples using computationally-oriented equations. Results and Discussion The conceptual group outperformed the computational group on the 2-group ANOVA problem; this is a bit surprising because all participants studied a 2-group ANOVA example. One possible explanation for this finding is that the conceptual equations are easier to implement and to check for errors. The conceptual group was also more successful on the 3-group ANOVA problem which is consistent with the hypothesis that these participants were better able to modify the equation. There was no effect due to the position of the overview. This suggests several possibilities including: the material simply was not very effective; positioning of such material does not matter for learning in this domain; learners may have been less inclined to pay attention to it because the overview material essentially recapitulates the information provided in the examples (with a bit of elaboration) but without numbers.

Land cover changes and consequent management entail discrepancies in carbon sequestration provided by forest ecosystems and its accounting. Currently there is a lack of sufficient and harmonized data for Ukraine that can be used for the robust and spatially explicit assessment of forest provisioning and regulation of ecosystem services. In the frame of this research, we established an experimental polygon (area 45 km2) in Northern Ukraine aiming at estimating main forest carbon stocks and fluxes and determining the impact caused by natural disturbances and harvest for the study period of 2010\u20132015. Coupled field inventory and remote sensing data (RapidEye image for 2010 and SPOT 6 image for 2015) were used. Land cover classification and estimation of biomass and carbon pools were carried out using Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method, respectively. Remote sensing data indicates a ca. 16% increase of carbon stock, while ground-based computations have shown only a ca. 1% increase. Net carbon fluxes for the study period are relatively even: 5.4 Gg C\u00b7year\u22121 and 5.6 Gg C C\u00b7year\u22121 for field and remote sensing data, respectively. Stand-replacing wildfires, as well as insect outbreaks and wind damage followed by salvage logging, and timber harvest have caused 21% of carbon emissions among all C sources within the experimental polygon during the study period. Hence, remote sensing data and non-parametric methods coupled with field data can serve as reliable tools for the precise estimation of forest carbon cycles on a regional spatial scale.

Recent development in computational method offers an opportunity to use glycan structure databases and de novo algorithms for extracting valuable information from MS or MS/MS data. However, detecting low-intensity peaks that are buried in noisy data sets is still a challenge and an algorithm for accurate prediction and annotation of glycan structures from MS data is highly desirable. The present study describes a novel algorithm for glycan structure prediction by matching glycan isotope abundance (mGIA), which takes isotope masses, abundances, and spacing into account. We constructed a comprehensive database containing 808 glycan compositions and their corresponding isotope abundance. Unlike most previously reported methods, not only did we take into count the m/z values of the peaks but also their corresponding logarithmic Euclidean distance of the calculated and detected isotope vectors. Evaluation against a linear classifier, obtained by training mGIA algorithm with datasets of three different human tissue samples from Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) in association with Support Vector Machine (SVM), was proposed to improve the accuracy of automatic glycan structure annotation. In addition, an effective data preprocessing procedure, including baseline subtraction, smoothing, peak centroiding and composition matching for extracting correct isotope profiles from MS data was incorporated. The algorithm was validated by analyzing the mouse kidney MS data from CFG, resulting in the identification of 6 more glycan compositions than the previous annotation and significant improvement of detection of weaker peaks compared with the algorithm previously reported.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22882827", "doi": "10.1016/j.aca.2012.07.009", "venue": "Analytica chimica acta", "journal": "Analytica chimica acta", "mag_id": "2093627441", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21721536", "2305968"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33941134"}

Participants and Methods: Anatomical trajectories of left (LH) and right (RH) lateral ventricle volumes across the three study-waves were quantified using the Longitudinal Stream in Freesurfer 5.3 and modelled using a linear mixed-effects (LME) algorithm. All participants (N = 74, mean age 60.7 yrs at inclusion, 48 females) performed the Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT). Response time on the third condition was used as a measure of response inhibition (RI) and divided into three classes (fast, medium and slow). The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used for calculating the relative importance of selected LV volume features from the LME model in predicting RI class. Finally, the two most important extracted features were fed into a 10-fold cross-validation framework, estimating the accuracy, precision and recall of the RI class prediction. Results: Four LME based features were selected to characterize LV volume trajectories: steepness of LV volume change and the LV volume at the time of inclusion, each from the right and left hemisphere. The XGBoost procedure selected the steepness measure from the right and the volume at inclusion from the left hemisphere as the two most important features to predict RI performance. The 10-fold cross validation procedure showed a recall, precision and accuracy score (.40 - .50) that were clearly above chance level.

In this work, we are proposing a framework for story classification (SC) using keyword and part-of-speech (POS) features. For improving the performance of SC system, feature reduction techniques and combinations of various POS tags are explored. Further, we investigated the performance of SC by dividing the story into parts depending on its semantic structure. In this work, stories are (i) manually divided into parts based on their semantics as introduction, main, and climax; and (ii) automatically divided into equal parts based on number of sentences in a story as initial, middle, and end. We have also examined sentence increment model, which aims at determining an optimum number of sentences required to identify story genre by incremental selection of sentences in a story. Experiments are conducted on Hindi and Telugu story corpora consisting of 300 and 150 short stories, respectively. The performance of SC system is evaluated using different combinations of keyword and POS-based features, with three well-established machine learning classifiers: (i) Naive Bayes (NB), (ii) k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and (iii) Support Vector Machine (SVM). Performance of the classifier is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and effectiveness of classifier is measured using precision, recall, and F-measure. From the classification results, it is observed that adding linguistic information boosts the performance of story classification. In view of the structure of the story, main, and initial parts of the story have shown comparatively better performance. The results from the sentence incremental model have indicated that the first nine and seven sentences in Hindi and Telugu stories, respectively, are sufficient for better classification of stories.

Subthreshold resonance refers to the ability of neurons to exhibit a peak in their voltage amplitude response to oscillatory input currents at a preferred non-zero (resonant) frequency. Phase-resonance refers to the ability of neurons to exhibit a zero-phase (or zero-phase-shift) response to oscillatory input currents at a non-zero (phase-resonant) frequency. We adapt the classical phase-plane analysis approach to account for the dynamic effects of oscillatory inputs and develop a tool, the envelope-plane diagrams, that captures the role that conductances and time scales play in amplifying the voltage response at the resonant frequency band as compared to smaller and larger frequencies. We use envelope-plane diagrams in our analysis. We explain why the resonance phenomena do not necessarily arise from the presence of imaginary eigenvalues at rest, but rather they emerge from the interplay of the intrinsic and input time scales. We further explain why an increase in the time-scale separation causes an amplification of the voltage response in addition to shifting the resonant and phase-resonant frequencies. This is of fundamental importance for neural models since neurons typically exhibit a strong separation of time scales. We extend this approach to explain the effects of nonlinearities on both resonance and phase-resonance. We demonstrate that nonlinearities in the voltage equation cause amplifications of the voltage response and shifts in the resonant and phase-resonant frequencies that are not predicted by the corresponding linearized model. The differences between the nonlinear response and the linear prediction increase with increasing levels of the time scale separation between the voltage and the gating variable, and they almost disappear when both equations evolve at comparable rates. In contrast, voltage responses are almost insensitive to nonlinearities located in the gating variable equation.

Beyond the original bottom-up models, the use of top-down categorization information has been applied to semantic segmentation to improve performance. An excellent example of such a top-down scheme is to integrate a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model with sparse dictionary learning. However, the existing solutions merely consider the discrimination of dictionaries to obtain better sparse codes, without considering the inherent data locality characteristics. In this paper, we explore such characteristics and propose a novel semantic segmentation framework based on an innovative CRF model with locality-consistent dictionary learning. In particular, we propose two new locality-consistent dictionary learning strategies by capturing the local consistencies in the feature space and the label space.

There exists an urgent need for an efficient technique for early detection of epileptic seizures at its initial stage in order to save the lives of thousands of epileptic patients annually. Now a days, internet of things in combination with machine learning techniques and cloud computing services has emerged as a powerful technology to resolve many problems in healthcare sector. This paper also presents an automatic epileptic seizure detection system and its layered architecture for early detection of epileptic seizures using existing communication technologies in collaboration with machine learning and cloud computing. This model transmits sensed EEG signals from patient\u2019s scalp to cloud through 4G cellular network or Wi-Fi network. At cloud, EEG signals are processed using Fast Walsh Hadamard transform and higher order spectra (HOS) based feature extraction for extracting higher order statistics and entropy-based features. The correlation-based feature selection algorithm has been employed for reducing the dimensionality of EEG datasets so as to tackle the problem of large volume of data and to reduce delays in service offered to the end user. Random Forest algorithm has been employed for classification of EEG signals into three different seizure stages, viz., normal, preictal and ictal. For performance analysis, other well-known machine learning algorithms like Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Basis function neural network and C4.5 Decision Tree are also considered.

The Sheikhupura industrial zone, which includes industries such as tanneries, leather, chemical, textiles, and colour and dyes, contributes massive amounts of untreated effluents that are released directly into drains and used for the irrigation of crops and vegetables. This practice causes not only soil contamination with an excessive amount of heavy metals, but is also considered a source of toxicity in the food chain, i.e., bioaccumulation in plants and ultimately in human body organs. The objective of this research study was to assess the spatial distribution of the heavy metals chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), at three depths of soil using geostatistics and the selection of significant contributing variables to soil contamination using the Random Forest (RF) function of the Boruta Algorithm. A total of 60 sampling locations were selected in the study area to collect soil samples (180 samples) at three depths (0\u201315 cm, 15\u201330 cm, and 60\u201390 cm). The soil samples were analysed for their physico-chemical properties, i.e., soil saturation, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), pH, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and Cr, Cd, and Pb using standard laboratory procedures. The data were analysed with comprehensive statistics and geostatistical techniques. The correlation coefficient matrix between the heavy metals and the physico-chemical properties revealed that electrical conductivity (EC) had a significant (p \u2264 0.05) negative correlation with Cr, Cd, and Pb. The RF function of the Boruta Algorithm employed soil depth as a classifier and ranked the significant soil contamination parameters (Cr, Cd, Pb, EC, and P) in relation to depth. The mobility factor indicated the leachate percentage of heavy metals at different vertical depths of soil. The spatial distribution pattern of Cr, Cd, and Pb revealed spatial variability regarding subsoil horizons. Significant contamination was discovered near the Deg drain and the Bed Nallah irrigated area that indicated a high Cr topsoil contamination, and in a homogenous pattern in Cd and Pb (p < 0.05). Consequently, different soil management strategies can be adopted in an industrial irrigated area to reduce the contamination load of heavy metals in soil.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/su10030799", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainability", "mag_id": "2791124839", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204917795", "106405608"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159018792"}

To satisfy VR users' delay target, the BSs can change the image transmission format for each image requested by users so as to reduce the downlink traffic load. Meanwhile, the VR users can directly rotate the already received VR image and use the rotated VR images at a later time to further reduce the downlink traffic load. This 360\u00b0 image transmission and image rotation problem is then formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' successful transmission probability which is defined as the probability that the delay of tracking information and image transmission for each VR user satisfies the VR delay requirement.

That is because computer capacity has shown remarkable progress and the task of person re-identification plays a critical role in video surveillance systems. In short, person re-identification aims to find an individual again that has been observed over different cameras. It has been reported that KISS metric learning has obtained the state of the art performance for person re-identification on the VIPeR dataset . However, given a small size training set, the estimation to the inverse of a covariance matrix is not stable and thus the resulting performance can be poor. In this paper, we present regularized smoothing KISS metric learning (RS-KISS) by seamlessly integrating smoothing and regularization techniques for robustly estimating covariance matrices. RS-KISS is superior to KISS, because RS-KISS can enlarge the underestimated small eigenvalues and can reduce the overestimated large eigenvalues of the estimated covariance matrix in an effective way. By providing additional data, we can obtain a more robust model by RS-KISS. However, retraining RS-KISS on all the available examples in a straightforward way is time consuming, so we introduce incremental learning to RS-KISS. We thoroughly conduct experiments on the VIPeR dataset and verify that 1) RS-KISS completely beats all available results for person re-identification and 2) incremental RS-KISS performs as well as RS-KISS but reduces the computational cost significantly.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2255413", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1998443077", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["783186", "17336043", "17572432", "7146270", "60624573", "6485959", "1157726", "16824129", "7973738", "2233106", "14952808", "6469259", "2198160", "14723701", "13985613", "2823003", "14909631", "15225312", "3961724", "2059819", "10726702", "209928701", "14627589", "6213726", "144828484", "206478781", "16051814", "15165243", "2546918", "16301822", "10070153", "10157879", "12927093", "130535382", "8443684", "10174367", "15371642", "132448134", "18780193", "2225258", "4649480", "4650461", "14146409", "206742596", "8195115", "7164794", "2371570", "260235", "7751620", "47325215", "13055399", "2643381", "9548634", "14532880", "11113049"], "inbound_citations": ["22738434", "3993307", "9443293", "12088157", "36293481", "19936786", "53081905", "3295351", "18540307", "11358041", "7420230", "202158599", "45442301", "3886458", "8246916", "4872833", "480975", "53109274", "13709956", "51924615", "12262728", "32552082", "57201650", "46967885", "52006274", "25068035", "22962964", "28429672", "3470977", "202718975", "51902730", "565409", "52884174", "73611195", "30831461", "127308432", "14663209", "51866529", "12470642", "2449063", "201072245", "17924737", "215602784", "15352079", "14926665", "23170425", "55834146", "56718748", "40858751", "5568968", "6541447", "7998337", "8078899", "36242877", "53082760", "14390842", "202558844", "13900015", "17405327", "4646089", "51881836", "3221073", "198172599", "53082034", "13309728", "5841489", "28540413", "57379362", "1221442", "7379933", "39411489", "53082739", "1389523", "5081518", "17541301", "209331188", "209331188", "1259407", "32523567", "30056608", "1396427", "206663197", "4857212", "31441463", "28931639", "13781967", "3978486", "11267730", "59607027", "5805953", "6809718", "568909", "16847459", "2814112", "16999377"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4854422"}

The optimum feature selection brings down the computational complexity and also removes the redundant features in the feature vector. Methodology: Colour moments computed from R, G, B, RG, GB, RB component images are taken as one feature vector. The average wave energy values of horizontal, vertical and diagonal details of images decomposed up to five levels using wavelet transform are considered as second feature vector. The ship ISAR images measured with high resolution Radar are used as data set to test the classification performance of the two feature sets, which is explored uniquely in this work. Genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization techniques are used to find the optimum feature sets. Probabilistic neural network is used to compare the classification accuracy achieved with full length feature vectors and optimum feature vectors of the two considered feature sets. Findings: Data set of two ships is taken. The data of each ship is divided in to two parts training data and test data. The feature vectors computed from training set are used to train the classifier and that computed from test set are used to test the classification accuracy. The number of variables (number of features in the feature vector) of optimization algorithms Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is varied to find the optimum feature set to classify the ship ISAR image data. The function that computes the classification accuracy is used as the objective function of the optimization algorithms. From the initial feature vector of thirty colour moments a set of four features is identified that gives 100% accuracy for both the targets considered. From starting set of fifteen average energy levels, a set of four energy levels identified by PSO and the set of three energy levels are found to be more effective in classification of the ship ISAR images with classification accuracy of 66.6% for the first target and 75% for the second target. Both the optimization techniques performed in similar way. Other optimization algorithms can be explored to find feature combinations that classify ship ISAR images with better accuracy. Application: Classification based on ISAR images has application in automatic non-cooperative target recognition, development of monitoring systems for surveillance along transportation corridors etc. to avoid illegal immigration.

Unknown to many, there exists an arguably even simpler and more versatile learning mechanism, namely, the Tsetlin Automaton. Merely by means of a single integer as memory, it learns the optimal action in stochastic environments. In this paper, we introduce the Tsetlin Machine, which solves complex pattern recognition problems with easy-to-interpret propositional formulas, composed by a collective of Tsetlin Automata. To eliminate the longstanding problem of vanishing signal-to-noise ratio, the Tsetlin Machine orchestrates the automata using a novel game. Our theoretical analysis establishes that the Nash equilibria of the game are aligned with the propositional formulas that provide optimal pattern recognition accuracy. This translates to learning without local optima, only global ones. We argue that the Tsetlin Machine finds the propositional formula that provides optimal accuracy, with probability arbitrarily close to unity. In four distinct benchmarks, the Tsetlin Machine outperforms both Neural Networks, SVMs, Random Forests, the Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression. It further turns out that the accuracy advantage of the Tsetlin Machine increases with lack of data. The Tsetlin Machine has a significant computational performance advantage since both inputs, patterns, and outputs are expressed as bits, while recognition of patterns relies on bit manipulation. The combination of accuracy, interpretability, and computational simplicity makes the Tsetlin Machine a promising tool for a wide range of domains, including safety-critical medicine. Being the first of its kind, we believe the Tsetlin Machine will kick-start completely new paths of research, with a potentially significant impact on the AI field and the applications of AI.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1804.01508", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2796362437", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3074096", "42185255", "17724147", "5105248", "23928738", "2710871", "2975999", "10953544", "19121327", "5951073", "17917274", "5661688", "7311818", "45799111", "26573771", "1606725", "38161331", "3752831", "206624564", "125412752", "24092740", "206624564", "118505797", "5915714", "13252401", "16699982", "39448550", "124430577", "2975999", "37837179", "14542261", "2936324", "2309950", "162184102", "11715509", "120462794", "39484782", "16151060", "6002655", "10485293"], "inbound_citations": ["209439954", "150373938", "52195410", "56170006", "150373678", "202577244", "211020652", "208513942", "162184102", "215238311", "208635932"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4597378"}

The dynamic modulus (|E*|), among HMA mechanical property parameters, not only is important for HMA pavement design but also in determining HMA pavement performance associated with pavement response. Previously employed approaches for development of the predictive |E*| models concentrated on multivariate regression analysis of database. In this paper, SVM-based |E*| prediction models were developed using the latest comprehensive |E*| database containing 7,400 data points from 346 HMA mixtures. The developed SVM models were compared with the existing multivariate regression-based |E*| model as well as the artificial neural networks (ANN) based |E*| models developed recently by the writers. The prediction performance of SVM model is better than multivariate regression-based model and comparable to the ANN.

Our study aims to create novel brain\u2013computer interfaces (BMIs) to control human mental (NBMICM), which are used to detect human mental conditions i.e., preferences, thinking, and consciousness, choose stimuli to control these mental conditions, and evaluate these choices. It is important to detect the preferences on stimuli. If the stimuli related to the preference can be detected, the NBCIMC can provide stimuli to the user based on their emotions by detecting their favorite stimuli. The proposed method adopted EEG recording technique, extraction techniques of EEG features and detection methods of preferences. EEG recording employs a simple electroencephalograph, for which the measurement position is the left frontal lobe (Fp1) of the brain. We assume that the differences of the EEG activities on the patterns of preference are expressed in the association between the changes of the power spectra on each frequency band of the EEG. To calculate the association, we employ the gray theory model. The EEG feature is extracted by calculating the gray association degree, then, the preferences are detect using a support vector machine (SVM). Experiments are conducted to test the effectiveness of this method, which is validated by a mean accuracy rate >88% on the favorite sound detection.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is currently an active research area and successfully solves classification problems in many domains. This study used three strategies to construct the hybrid SVM-based credit scoring models to evaluate the applicant's credit score from the applicant's input features. Two credit datasets in UCI database are selected as the experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of the SVM classifier. Compared with neural networks, genetic programming, and decision tree classifiers, the SVM classifier achieved an identical classificatory accuracy with relatively few input features. Additionally, combining genetic algorithms with SVM classifier, the proposed hybrid GA-SVM strategy can simultaneously perform feature selection task and model parameters optimization.

However, it is difficult to use these learned semantics for real image editing. A common practice of feeding a real image to a trained GAN generator is to invert it back to a latent code. However, we find that existing inversion methods typically focus on reconstructing the target image by pixel values yet fail to land the inverted code in the semantic domain of the original latent space. As a result, the reconstructed image cannot well support semantic editing through varying the latent code. To solve this problem, we propose an in-domain GAN inversion approach, which not only faithfully reconstructs the input image but also ensures the inverted code to be semantically meaningful for editing. We first learn a novel domain-guided encoder to project any given image to the native latent space of GANs. We then propose a domain-regularized optimization by involving the encoder as a regularizer to fine-tune the code produced by the encoder, which better recovers the target image. Extensive experiments suggest that our inversion method achieves satisfying real image reconstruction and more importantly facilitates various image editing tasks, such as image interpolation and semantic manipulation, significantly outperforming start-of-the-arts.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2004.00049", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3014359333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2057420", "196834421", "199516373", "9957731", "52889459", "3621348", "84591", "6104263", "195345534", "1033682", "209377041", "10894094", "196831582", "980236", "3568073", "211022860", "49657329", "15763546", "9150225", "53979046", "3366315", "18500294", "102350964", "198897678", "14124313", "208202489", "8317437", "46898260", "195069523", "14924561"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214743564"}

This is called mandatory leaf node prediction (MLNP) and is particularly useful when the leaf nodes have much stronger semantic meaning than the internal nodes. However, while there have been a lot of MLNP methods in hierarchical multiclass classification, performing MLNP in hierarchical multilabel classification is much more difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel MLNP algorithm that (i) considers the global hierarchy structure; and (ii) can be used on hierarchies of both trees and DAGs. We show that one can efficiently maximize the joint posterior probability of all the node labels by a simple greedy algorithm.

However, many of the existing methodologies do so in a completely random way, without having control of the perturbation process, which can generate unhelpful base predictors that can affect the final performance or the need to use some pruning strategy. In this paper we introduce tEnsemble, a new and simple approach that seeks an adequate balance between diversity and accuracy. This is done by using a previously optimized template feature set, which serves to guide the perturbation process on the feature space in a controlled manner.

For the first time, this paper explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with convolutions applied in the temporal dimension for SITS classification. The goal is to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the contribution of temporal CNNs for SITS classification. More precisely, this paper proposes a set of experiments performed on a million Formosat-2 time series. The experimental results show that temporal CNNs are 2 to 3 % more accurate than RF. The experiments also highlight some counter-intuitive results on pooling layers: contrary to image classification, their use decreases accuracy. Moreover, we provide some general guidelines on the network architecture, common regularization mechanisms, and hyper-parameter values such as the batch size. Finally, the visual quality of the land cover maps produced by the temporal CNN is assessed.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.10166", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs11050523", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963131120,2953344658,2900573306", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121203649", "7872419", "84179581", "5010713", "129494315", "52300595", "21605657", "61806713", "6883318", "5281276", "132993057", "5713883", "11110712", "135310826", "195908774", "206592766", "16359388", "14303613", "9367123", "33264528", "23216142", "55763741", "949777", "6510239", "3346868", "3557295", "52276856", "11212020", "786357", "5808102", "32340139", "3523851", "34858249", "57443897", "2167514", "10328909", "206594692", "52195012", "206592484", "6628106", "10940950", "6212000", "6844431", "554434", "3907864", "51935821", "12455770", "9560434", "7172528", "5575601", "6287870", "20692766", "133358670", "129114844", "215387075", "8975988", "57146809", "58374281", "26309611", "89141", "15700257", "6944647", "632197", "53019704", "2615628", "2640364", "14579938", "9639040", "15538812", "49869699", "53166683"], "inbound_citations": ["204838392", "201646245", "208038577", "195584256", "204008671", "208138193", "208175971", "211535305", "202572652", "208000922", "212414434", "210697659", "198418718", "204701163", "204701904", "209901013"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53754958"}

The classical ELM model consists of a linear combination of a fixed number of nonlinear expansions of the input vector. Learning in ELM is hence equivalent to finding the optimal weights that minimize the error on a dataset. The update works in batch mode, either with explicit feature mappings or with implicit mappings defined by kernels. Although an online version has been proposed for the former, no work has been done up to this point for the latter, and whether an efficient learning algorithm for online kernel-based ELM exists remains an open problem. By explicating some connections between nonlinear adaptive filtering and ELM theory, in this brief, we present an algorithm for this task. In particular, we propose a straightforward extension of the well-known kernel recursive least-squares, belonging to the kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) family, to the ELM framework. We call the resulting algorithm the kernel online sequential ELM (KOS-ELM). Moreover, we consider two different criteria used in the KAF field to obtain sparse filters and extend them to our context.

This study investigates SHM techniques for the fiber reinforced plastics (FRPs) used to construct WECs. Data is collected using piezoelectric transducers on sample FRP plates. One of the primary hurdles with this problem is that the underlying structure of the FRPs is different for each plate, which results in significant variability in the collected data between plates. To overcome this issue, we propose using one-class support vector machines (OCSVMs) that can be trained solely on baseline examples from each plate. The OCSVM then detects anomalies and classifies them as damage. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the OCSVM can outperform traditional support vector machines (SVMs).

In this paper, we mainly focus on the tasks of parameter transfer under the framework of extreme learning machine (ELM). Unlike the existing parameter transfer approaches, which incorporate the source model information into the target by regularizing the di erence between the source and target domain parameters, an intuitively appealing projective-model is proposed to bridge the source and target model parameters. Specifically, we formulate the parameter transfer in the ELM networks by the means of parameter projection, and train the model by optimizing the projection matrix and classifier parameters jointly.

In the new approach, the neural fuzzy inference system was used to create an initial flood susceptibility model and then the model was optimized using two metaheuristic algorithms, Evolutionary Genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization. A high-frequency tropical cyclone area of the Tuong Duong district in Central Vietnam was used as a case study. First, a GIS database for the study area was constructed. The database that includes 76 historical flood inundated areas and ten flood influencing factors was used to develop and validate the proposed model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to assess the model performance and its prediction capability. Experimental results showed that the proposed model has high performance on both the training (RMSE = 0.306, MAE = 0.094, AUC = 0.962) and validation dataset (RMSE = 0.362, MAE = 0.130, AUC = 0.911). The usability of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing with those obtained from state-of-the art benchmark soft computing techniques such as J48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. The results show that the proposed MONF model outperforms the above benchmark models; we conclude that the MONF model is a new alternative tool that should be used in flood susceptibility mapping.

Ideal gas sensors should be with selectivity, reliability, and cross-sensitivity to different odors. However, a new problem is that abnormal odors (e.g., perfume, alcohol, etc.) would show strong sensor response, such that they deteriorate the usual usage of E-nose for target odor analysis. An intuitive idea is to recognize abnormal odors and remove them online. A known truth is that the kinds of abnormal odors are countless in real-world scenarios. Therefore, general pattern classification algorithms lose effect because it is expensive and unrealistic to obtain all kinds of abnormal odors data. In this paper, we propose two simple yet effective methods for abnormal odor (outlier) detection: 1) a self-expression model (SEM) with $ {l_{1}/l_{2}}$ -norm regularizer is proposed, which is trained on target odor data for coding and then a very few abnormal odor data is used as prior knowledge for threshold learning and 2) inspired by self-expression mechanism, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based self-expression (SE $^{ {2}}$ LM) is proposed, which inherits the advantages of ELM in solving a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network.

How to identify the most energy-efficient way of running a multiple-program workload on a many-core processor while still maintaining a satisfactory performance level is always a challenge. Automatic tuning on the voltage and frequency level of a many-core processor is an effective method to aid solving this dilemma. The metrics we focus on optimizing are energy usage and energy-delay product (EDP). To this end, we propose SVM-JADE, a machine learning enhanced version of an adaptive differential evolution algorithm (JADE). We monitor the energy and EDP values of different voltage and frequency combinations of the cores, or power islands, as the algorithm evolves through generations. By adding a well-tuned support vector machine (SVM) to JADE, creating SVM-JADE, we are able to achieve energy-aware computing on many-core platform when running multiple-program workloads. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can further improve the energy by 8.3% and further improve EDP by 7.7% than JADE. Besides, in both EDP-based and energy-based fitness SVM-JADE converges faster than JADE. Parallel tree skeletons are basic computational patterns that can be used to develop parallel programs for manipulating trees. In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation of parallel tree skeletons on distributed-memory parallel computers.

In this paper, MEMS accelerometer signals are analyzed in different domains and several features are selected for the design of classification algorithms. Frequency domain analysis is performed as a function of the user velocity and sensor location, showing the potential of the selected features even when the MEMS is not placed on the user foot. The selected features are finally integrated into three different classification algorithms whose characteristics are analyzed and compared under several operating conditions.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2105198795", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17591052", "19635967", "49272397", "211522941", "38187081", "60442981", "20150120", "3164951", "22161776", "46371035", "42371871", "7002866", "21937395", "12240194", "7223043", "40911076", "3615328", "15748162", "2770333"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110679270"}

In two experiments we identified the stimulation threshold at which the brain changes to an afterdischarge state. In one experiment a range of suprathreshold stimulations were applied, and in another the stimulation was not changed. The neural state was measured by the power spectral density prior to stimulation. In the first experiment, these measures and the stimulation parameters were used as features, either together or separately, for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether the stimulation would produce an afterdischarge. In the second experiment, recursive feature elimination was used to iteratively remove the neural state features from the recording channels that had the least impact on the overall accuracy. In the first experiment 43 stimulations elicited 26 afterdischarges. In predicting the post-stimulation state-change (afterdischarge vs. no afterdischarge) the feature space of only neural state had a higher accuracy (67.4%) than when combined with the stimulation parameters (65.1%) or the stimulation parameters alone (58.1%). The overall classification results from both feature spaces containing the neural state were non-independent (chi-squared p < 0.01). In the second experiment, the channels that were the least predictive were those on the more distal ends of the recording electrode, and the most predictive were clustered in the center of the electrode. Additionally, the accuracy increased when 4 channels were removed. The findings from these experiments suggest that both the pre-stimulation state and the spatial properties from where it is measured can play a role in how neural stimulation can induce functional changes in the hippocampal networks.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28226864", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591070", "venue": "2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "journal": "2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2539161380", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2477629", "6988489", "22958863", "12179430", "1307720", "21092775", "19988243"], "inbound_citations": ["204943980", "215449729"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19665679"}

Using mainly climatic variables as the major predictors, a model of the predicted risk of fasciolosis was created by Random Forest modelling that had 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

An ideal data-driven model-based analysis framework will incorporate the most realistic model possible, enabling accurate imaging of the physiological variables. However, models must be sufficiently parsimonious to enable tracking of important variables using data. This paper provides tools to inform the realism versus parsimony trade-off, the Bayesian Cramer-Rao (lower) Bound (BCRB). We demonstrate how the BCRB can be used to assess the feasibility of using various popular neural mass models to track epilepsy-related dynamics via stochastic filtering methods. A series of simulations show how optimal state estimates relate to measurement noise, model error and initial state uncertainty. We also demonstrate that state estimation accuracy will vary between seizure-like and normal rhythms. The performance of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is assessed against the BCRB.

In this paper, we extend the intrinsic metric learning problem to semi-definite case, by which the data distribution is better described for various classification tasks. First, we formulate the metric learning as a minimization problem to the SPD manifold on subspace, which not only considers to balance the information between inner classes and inter classes by an adaptive tradeoff parameter but also improves the robustness by the low-rank subspaces presentation. Thus, it benefits to design a structure-preserving algorithm on subspace by using the geodesic structure of the SPD subspace. To solve this model, we develop an iterative strategy to update the intrinsic metric and the subspace structure, respectively.

Many approaches have been proposed to classify different categories of Internet traffic.

In this paper, we propose an approach to classify both TCP and UDP traffic flows using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. In this approach, we select the best feature subset using Genetic Algorithm, and then we calculate the correspondence weight of each feature selected by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In addition, the traditional SVM algorithm is optimized by PSO algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach can effectively select the feature subset from multiple attributes that can best reflect the differences among different network applications.

Two Bayesian logistic regression models were utilized to identify crash precursors and their impact on ramp crash risk. Meanwhile, four Support Vector Machines (SVM) were applied to predict crash occurrence. Bayesian logistic regression models and SVMs commonly showed that the models with the socio-demographic and trip generation variables outperform their counterparts without those parameters. It indicates that the socio-demographic and trip generation parameters have significant impact on the real-time crash risk. The Bayesian logistic regression model results showed that the logarithm of vehicle count, speed, and percentage of home-based-work production had positive impact on crash risk. Meanwhile, off-ramps or non-diamond-ramps experienced higher crash potential than on-ramps or diamond-ramps, respectively. Though the SVMs provided good model performance, the SVM model with all variables (i.e., all traffic, geometric, socio-demographic, and trip generation variables) had an overfitting problem.

In this paper, we resort to the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) in the 802.11n standard to recognize number gestures. The intuition is that certain gestures can affect wireless environment in a specific formation and thus generate unique features. Unfortunately, the majority of CSI-based technologies only extracted coarse grained features to recognize macro-movements. Besides, it can be time-consuming to select the most discriminative feature as salient evidence. In this paper, we present a device-free number gesture recognition approach based on deep learning, named DeNum. First, we explore the sensibility of both the amplitude and phase information of de-noised CSI values to action transitions. Then the amplitude difference is utilized to detect the finishing points of actions through multiple sliding windows. To extract discriminative features from both the amplitude and phase information over three antennas, a 4-layer deep learning model is adopted after obtaining number gesture information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied for gesture classification. We conduct extensive experiments on commercial Wi-Fi devices with different experimental parameters.

A fixed wing UAV was used to obtain multispectral images and derive a set of vegetation indices. Two different image classification techniques were used to cluster the vegetation indices maps and produce plant community distribution maps. The highest classification accuracy was obtained using a Random Forest classifier and 13 vegetation indices. Additionally, the spectral characteristics of the training samples were correlated with aboveground biomass and species diversity. Both biomass and species diversity were positively correlated with the spectral diversity of training samples and are thus likely to have an effect on the classification accuracy.

The optic discs in the colour fundus images are segmented to avoid false alarms using morphological operations and based on circular Hough transform.

Our proposed approach, based on GANs is capable of producing natural sounding, intelligible speech which is synchronised with the video.

Tone recognition plays an important role in automatic Chinese speech recognition in that the same syllable with different tones gives quite distinct meanings. The different tone can be characterized by its pitch contour, but the pitch contours are hardly ideal smooth curves. It is because the pitch points calculated by pitch detector normally have some error points. These error pitch points can cause the erroneous classification of Mandarin four-tone recognition. It is necessary to smooth the pitch contour before tone recognition. The classic smooth algorithms can not deal with error fundamental frequencies successively. A new smoothing method proposed in this paper can deal with the error pitch point appropriately. It first checks whether the current point is a correct or error point, then the error type, and finally modifies the error point according to the error type. For different error type, the corresponding smoothing method is also different. To confirm this smoothing method, four \u201cone vs. all\u201d Support Vector Machine classifier are built for Mandarin Tone Recognition.

Nevertheless, the performance of the MSKL is dramatically influenced by the widths and weights of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, since its multi-scale kernel function is constructed by several RBF kernels. In order to achieve efficient multi-scale classifier, a new dynamic differential evolution (DE) algorithm is introduced in this paper. In addition, the spectral features and spatial fractal texture features of images are synthetically employed to construct the multi-scale kernel. The experimental results show that the multi-scale kernel based on the dynamic DE algorithm is superior to the traditional multi-scale kernel in obtaining a better multi-scale kernel classifier and with higher classification accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-00563-4_32", "venue": "BICS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2895019250", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52958757"}

Digital imagery is a powerful data source for coastal monitoring, maintenance and research. It provides high-resolution measurements in both time and space. The size and resolution of long-term imagery datasets provide great opportunities, but also pose problems of tractability in the data analysis. In order to fully use the possibilities of these datasets, reliable and automated classification of images is essential. This paper discusses an automated classification approach based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The algorithm is applied in pixel space only. Therefore it does not rely on in-situ measurements, nor is there a need for image rectification.

The advantage of unsupervised machine learning approaches such as GANs is that they do not need a large amount of labeled data, which is costly and time consuming. GANs may be used in a variety of applications, including image synthesis, semantic image editing, style transfer, image super-resolution and classification. In this work, GANs are utilized to solve the single image super-resolution problem. This approach in literature is referred to as super resolution GANs (SRGAN), and employs a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes the solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and the original photo-realistic images, and the content loss is motivated by the perceptual similarity and not the similarity in the pixel space. This paper presents implementation of SRGAN using Deep convolution network applied to both the aerial and satellite imagery of the aircrafts. The results thus obtained are compared with traditional super resolution methods. The resulting estimates of SRGAN are compared against the traditional methods using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structure similarity index metric (SSIM). The PSNR and SSIM of SRGAN estimates are similar to traditional method such as Bicubic interpolation but traditional methods are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2524720", "venue": "Defense + Commercial Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2944921230", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10578341", "43417978", "51968038", "1033682", "211227", "3545005", "15863986", "16192835", "980236", "7037846", "6635779", "8758543", "14124313"], "inbound_citations": ["199474245", "203594052"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:181448372"}

It is an important commercial crop of India and hence, reliable acreage and production estimation is most essential for taking up policy decisions. The coffee growing regions in India are mainly confined to the traditional South Indian states (Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and partly in non-traditional regions (Andhra Pradesh and Odisha) while to a smaller extent in North-Eastern states. Interpretation and mapping of coffee plantations using satellite data is quite challenging due to the diverse and complex cultivation practices. In the present study, multi-resolution and multi-source data was utilized for mapping of coffee plantations in the country. Temporal LISS-III (24.0 m) data was used for characterizing the phenology of coffee and other competing plantation crops for selection of optimal high resolution satellite (HRS) datasets. Accordingly, Cartosat-1 (2.5 m) and Resourcesat LISS-IV multispectral (5.0 m) datasets corresponding to February-April months were utilized. The spectral signature of coffee plantations is determined by the age category of coffee plantations, varietal difference, density & composition of shade trees along with terrain features like slope and aspect. The plantations manifested in different tones of red and mottled texture on the multispectral image. Object oriented classification approach showed encouraging results in homogenous & contiguous areas but showed poor mapping accuracy in heterogeneous regions due to complex spectral signature and varying texture. Thus, a combination of digital and visual interpretation techniques were used for mapping of coffee plantations depending on the suitability. Feature space optimization function was used for selection of object parameters and 14 image features consisting of mean spectral values, standard deviation, NDVI, geometry and contextual parameters were used for classification of coffee plantations using Support Vector Machine (SVM). In case of small holdings and heterogeneous areas, interactive visual interpretation of HRS data at 1 : 5,000 scale using tone, texture, shape and terrain characteristics was carried out for mapping of coffee plantations with the help of ground truth and field experience of Liaison Officials of Coffee Board. Post-interpretation field verification/validation of the interpreted maps was carried out for the accuracy assessment and the overall mapping accuracy of better than 90.0 per cent was achieved in the study. Total area under coffee plantations was about 4.41 lakh ha (excluding N-E states). This is the first study in the country to generate coffee map at national level for creation of baseline geospatial database which could be updated periodically.

When training and test distributions are different, the standard metric learning cannot infer appropriate data embeddings. The proposed method can infer appropriate data embeddings for the unseen domains by using latent domain vectors, which are latent representations of domains and control the property of data embeddings for each domain. This latent domain vector is inferred by using a neural network that takes the set of feature vectors in the domain as an input. The neural network is trained without the unseen domains. The proposed method can instantly infer data embeddings for the unseen domains without (re)-training once the sets of feature vectors in the domains are given. To accumulate knowledge in advance, the proposed method uses labeled and unlabeled data in multiple source domains. Labeled data, i.e., data with label information such as class labels or pair (similar/dissimilar) constraints, are used for learning data embeddings in such a way that similar data points are close and dissimilar data points are separated in the embedding space. Although unlabeled data do not have labels, they have geometric information that characterizes domains. The proposed method incorporates this information in a natural way on the basis of a probabilistic framework. The conditional distributions of the latent domain vectors, the embedded data, and the observed data are parametrized by neural networks and are optimized by maximizing the variational lower bound.

In a first learning phase, SVM involves the construction and solution of a primal-dual interiorpoint optimization problem. Each iteration of the interior-point method (IPM) requires a sparse linear system solution, which dominates the execution time of SVM learning. Solving this linear system can often be computationally expensive depending on the conditioning of the matrix. Consequently, preconditioned linear systems can lead to improved SVM performance while maintaining the classification accuracy. In this paper, we seek to characterize the role of preconditioning schemes for enhancing the SVM classifier performance. We compare and report on the solution time, convergence, and number of Newton iterations of the iterior-point method and classification accuracy of the SVM for 6 well-accepted preconditioning schemes and datasets chosen from well-known machine learning repositories. In particular, we introduce \u0394 -IPM that sparsifies the linear system at each iteration of the IPM. Our results indicate that on average the Jacobi and SSOR preconditioners perform 10.01 times better than other preconditioning schemes for IPM and 8.83 times better for \u0394 -IPM. Also, across all datasets Jacobi and SSOR perform between 2 to 30 times better than other schemes in both IPM and \u0394 -IPM. Moreover, \u0394 -IPM obtains a speedup over IPM performance on average by 1.25 and as much as 2 times speedup in the best case.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2010.04.040", "venue": "ICCS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2076750258", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["194951", "2427083", "62683614", "10743717", "5155714", "5667586", "1536643", "7794861", "13563302", "6491967", "198120256", "961425", "15690554", "123000748", "121446568", "59849738", "14020712", "59817029", "56520908"], "inbound_citations": ["65230456", "59337706"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31797252"}

First, the number of nonzero coefficients in 1-norm SVMs is at most equal to the number of only the exact support vectors lying on the +1 and -1 discriminating surfaces, while that in standard SVMs is equal to the number of support vectors, which implies that 1-norm SVMs have better sparseness than that of standard SVMs. Second, the number of nonzero coefficients is at most equal to the rank of the sample matrix.

The dataset obtained in a city with distinct seasons, Hakodate, Japan, is used for our empirical analysis.

Furthermore, it concludes that data set from two-seasons and data set from single season also follow different distributions. However, this test achieves some contradictory results in some cases. Due to this, RF is used to check how the accuracy varies in a further detail. RF confirms the findings by AZ-test in most cases.

{"paper_id": "116238139", "title": "Finding Similar Days for Air Traffic Management", "authors": [{"first": "Sreeta", "middle": [], "last": "Gorripaty", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Author(s): Gorripaty, Sreeta | Advisor(s): Hansen, Mark | Abstract: Airports are central to stimulating the growth and development of economies around the world. With the trend of increasing demand for air travel and transportation of goods, there is mounting pressure on the existing airport infrastructure. This leads to an imbalance in the capacity and demand at airports that costs airlines, passengers and the economy at large billions of dollars. A cost-effective solution to this growing imbalance is to develop ways to utilize the existing infrastructure well. Information from historical days that are similar to a day of operations can be used to gain insights to support traffic management decisions on that day. Recent advances in machine learning and computing power have made it possible to mine and analyze sizable historical archives of different variables that characterize and influence airport operations. Finding similar historical days can help better understand the impact of different traffic management initiatives (TMIs) and identify areas of capacity underutilization. Reduction in airport capacity underutilization can lead to reduction in airport delays. Decision support tools that can identify similar days and the TMIs taken on these past similar days and their resulting outcomes can augment controller experience to guide decision-making on the reference day at an airport. This information can allow air traffic managers to make less conservative decisions and thus improve airport capacity and reduce delays. This dissertation develops similarity measures between days using airport capacity and demand data. We find that dimensionality reduction is feasible for capacity data, and base capacity similarity on the principal components. Dimensionality reduction cannot be efficiently performed on demand data; consequently demand similarity is based on original data in this case. We find that both capacity and demand data lack natural clusters and thus propose that similarity be viewed as a continuous measure. Finally we estimate measures of overall distance based on both capacity and demand similarity. The estimated distances are visualized using Metric Multidimensional Scaling plots and indicate that most days with significant air traffic management activity are similar to certain other days, validating the potential of this approach for decision support. Accurate demand and capacity estimates are necessary to generate meaningful similarity measures that can be used in decision-support tools. Predicting airport capacity accurately can also help make better tradeoffs between allowing more flights to operate at the airport and minimizing expensive airborne delay. We develop accurate demand estimates from the Aggregate Demand List (ADL), which contains fine-grained flight schedule data of all the flights operating at an airport. Capacity of an airport can be observed only at sufficiently large demand. However, if the throughput of an airport is limited by the demand, we can only conclude that the capacity is larger than or equal to the observed throughput. The inability to directly observe capacity makes capacity prediction a challenging and less explored problem. This dissertation applies machine-learning methods that incorporate observations censored by insufficient demand to develop an airport capacity prediction model. Specifically, we explore Kaplan Meier estimator, Cox Proportional Hazards model and Random Survival Forest model to predict airport capacity. These models predict a capacity distribution rather than a single capacity value for an hour of interest at an airport using its weather, fleet mix and scheduled demand data. The model results also indicate the influence of different variables on the capacity of the airport. Model performance is compared using several validation measures, including Integrated Brier Score (IBS), Concordance Index (C Index), R2 and RMSE of predicted throughput, that account for the presence of censored observations. The RSF model consistently outperforms the KM estimator and Cox model across all the validation measures. This dissertation also develops capacity based similarity metrics between two days using the predicted hourly capacity distributions. The evaluation of the estimated similarity metric is challenging owing to the lack of ground truth similarity measures. In this dissertation, we propose a framework to validate the estimated similarity metric between two days using predicted capacity CDFs, demand, TMI and operational outcomes data. The assumption for this framework is that days that are similar based on their capacity, demand and TMI features should be similar based on their operational outcomes. We use a Random Forest model to combine the capacity, demand and TMI based similarity metrics, supervised by operational outcomes similarity metric. This combined similarity matrix is evaluated by measuring its correlation with the operational outcomes similarity matrix on test data. The methodology developed in this dissertation to identify similar days can be extended to any airport around the world using their respective weather, demand, TMI and operational outcome data. This framework uses data that can be forecasted and thus can be used to guide decisions on a day-of-operations in order to guide decision making, as well as a post-operations setting to compare decisions and outcomes on similar historical days.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2767588360", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116238139"}

This is due to the fact that (1) simultaneous collection of multi-sensor data using satellites are rare and (2) multi-sensor data collected during a single flight have not been accessible until recent developments in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) and UAS-friendly sensors that allow efficient information fusion. The objective of this study was to evaluate the power of high spatial resolution RGB, multispectral and thermal data fusion to estimate soybean ( Glycine max ) biochemical parameters including chlorophyll content and nitrogen concentration, and biophysical parameters including Leaf Area Index (LAI), above ground fresh and dry biomass. Multiple low-cost sensors integrated on UASs were used to collect RGB, multispectral, and thermal images throughout the growing season at a site established near Columbia, Missouri, USA. From these images, vegetation indices were extracted, a Crop Surface Model (CSM) was advanced, and a model to extract the vegetation fraction was developed. Then, spectral indices/features were combined to model and predict crop biophysical and biochemical parameters using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Learning Machine based Regression (ELR) techniques. Results showed that: (1) For biochemical variable estimation, multispectral and thermal data fusion provided the best estimate for nitrogen concentration and chlorophyll (Chl) a content (RMSE of 9.9% and 17.1%, respectively) and RGB color information based indices and multispectral data fusion exhibited the largest RMSE 22.6%; the highest accuracy for Chl a + b content estimation was obtained by fusion of information from all three sensors with an RMSE of 11.6%. (2) Among the plant biophysical variables, LAI was best predicted by RGB and thermal data fusion while multispectral and thermal data fusion was found to be best for biomass estimation. (3) For estimation of the above mentioned plant traits of soybean from multi-sensor data fusion, ELR yields promising results compared to PLSR and SVR in this study.

We studied the impact of sample size on classifier performance and the possibility of using RF generated class conditional probabilities as metrics describing DR risk. RF measures of variable importance are used to detect factors that affect classification performance. ::: ::: ::: PRINCIPAL FINDINGS ::: Both types of data were informative when discriminating participants with or without DR. RF based models produced much higher classification accuracy than those based on logistic regression. Combining both types of data did not increase accuracy but did increase statistical discrimination of healthy participants who subsequently did or did not have DR events during four years of follow-up. RF variable importance criteria revealed that microaneurysms counts in both eyes seemed to play the most important role in discrimination among the graded fundus variables, while the number of medicines and diabetes duration were the most relevant among the systemic variables. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE ::: We have introduced RF methods to DR classification analyses based on fundus photography data. In addition, we propose an approach to DR risk assessment based on metrics derived from graded fundus photography and systemic data.

Many computer vision problems can also be re-stated as classifying images and videos. In this dissertation, I describe new approaches for various image and video classification problems, including static image categorization, dynamic gait recognition, and unsupervised motion layer recovery. ::: First, two algorithms are developed for classifying images and video sequences represented as ensembles of instances. Different from previous classification approaches, our algorithms explicitly identify the uninformative instances and remove them from the further classification stage. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach with reject option, called RO-SVM, is designed to determine the classifier and the rejection region at the same time. An efficient combinatorial optimization method is employed to detect uninformative instances among the training data using a multipartite graph structure. Hierarchical classifiers are then built correspondingly for automatic detection of uninformative instances and classification. These two approaches are applied to both image categorization and gait recognition, and improved classification accuracies are achieved due to the removal of uninformative samples. ::: While the above classification approaches treat individual video frames as independent samples, motion dynamics is also important, especially when recognizing walking people. A model-based gait feature extraction procedure is presented to extract joint position trajectories using the Metropolis-Hasting method. Hidden Markov Models are trained to identify subjects based on the frequencies of these trajectories. Promising recognition rates are achieved for both indoor and outdoor sequences. ::: Furthermore, a novel variational approach is described to partition image pixels into different motion layers with consistent apparent motion. The number of motion layers is estimated by non-parameric clustering in the motion parameter space. The shape of each motion layer is implicitly embedded in a higher dimensional space of distance transforms, which is subject to the smoothness constraints, motion information, and visual grouping modules. This representation supports arbitrary topology of individual motion layers, as well as consistency with the geometry of the scene.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2750711789", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54219434"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126068169"}

It is believed that early treatment of MCI could slow down the progression of AD, and functional brain network (FBN) could provide potential imaging biomarkers for MCI diagnosis and response to treatment. However, there are still some challenges to estimate a \u201cgood\u201d FBN, particularly due to the poor quality and limited quantity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the target domain (i.e., MCI study). Inspired by the idea of transfer learning, we attempt to transfer information in high-quality data from source domain (e.g., human connectome project in this paper) into the target domain towards a better FBN estimation, and propose a novel method, namely NERTL (Network Estimation via Regularized Transfer Learning). Specifically, we first construct a high-quality network \u201ctemplate\u201d based on the source data, and then use the template to guide or constrain the target of FBN estimation by a weighted l1-norm regularizer. Finally, we conduct experiments to identify subjects with MCI from normal controls (NCs) based on the estimated FBNs. Despite its simplicity, our proposed method is more effective than the baseline methods in modeling discriminative FBNs, as demonstrated by the superior MCI classification accuracy of 82.4% and the area under curve (AUC) of 0.910.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31403449", "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2019.2934230", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2967956019", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1334013", "24996737", "29862787", "12925552", "11737133", "6273959", "14976519", "16939941", "4876738", "35791807", "11557297", "143229505", "10156739", "20102394", "214857769", "16050914", "14813562", "5518447", "3207782", "11563643", "7652329", "1149101", "1370535", "545830", "43895463", "67235626", "9151056", "58949202", "52273750", "3583134", "51680317", "51610900", "146460945", "33404663", "740063", "36250842", "7910895", "961425", "10511727", "13862878", "21877334", "10165943", "205669512", "14105573", "21767790", "24360470"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199540292"}

Additionally, previous researches generally focused on discrimination of EEG of left and right hand movement imagery by using data from C3 and C4 electrodes which locate on the top of the head. However, we choose the gamma wave channels of F7 and F8 and obtain data when subjects imagine their left or right hand to move with their eyeballs rotated in the corresponding direction. With the help of the Common Space Pattern algorithm to extract features of brain waves between left and right hand movement imagery, we make use of the Support Vector Machine to classify different brain waves. Traditionally, the accuracy rate of classification was approximately 90% using the EEG data from C3 and C4 electrode poles; however, the accuracy rate reaches 95.1% by using the gamma wave data from F7 and F8 in our experiment. Finally, we design a plane program in Python where a plane can be controlled to go left or right when users imagine their left or right hand to move. 8 subjects are tested and all of them can control the plane flexibly which reveals that our model can be applied to control hardware which is useful for disabled individuals and normal people.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1509.08257", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2111456493", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1906734"], "inbound_citations": ["55009988", "208626810", "86544660", "211055407"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8426220"}

The isolated forest method is used to filter the bad points of the auxiliary training set, thereby eliminating the interference of abnormal data. The dynamic factor concept is introduced to solve the problem that the weight of source domain data decreases too quickly and irreversibly, and this enhances the generalization performance of the algorithm for different goaf samples. To test the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting goaf stability, an evaluation model is constructed and the performance compared with other algorithms in current use. The prediction accuracy and generalization ability of the model are evaluated by mean square error and F1 measurements, which prove that the performance of the model is excellent.

Clinically relevant (i.e. grade 2 or greater) peripheral neurotoxicity is a significant side-effect of bortezomib. As the occurrence of neurotoxicity is unforeseeable and apparently dose independent, we think that it might be associated with individual genetic characteristics such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) or Copy Number Variants (CNV). In order to identify the genetic characteristics (SNP and CNV) correlated with the occurrence of neurotoxicity induced by bortezomib, we performed high density SNP analysis in 300 patients using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Arrays 6.0. All patients were included in the prospective randomized trial IFM 99-01 and had received bortezomib and dexamethasone as induction therapy for previously untreated MM. Neurotoxicity was graded as severe (ECOG score of 2 or greater) or non severe (ECOG score of 0 or 1). ::: ::: Quality controls included Contrast Quality Control (CQC), the call rate and the percentage of heterozygotes. CQC estimates the ability to separate the intensities corresponding to the different alleles into three clusters. In poor quality samples, CQC is excessively low and a large difference between CQC calculated on SNP that reside on Nsp and Sty fragments can indicate a single-enzyme target preparation failure. Only one sample was considered to have an excessively low CQC value ( 2), according to Affymetrix recommendations for quality control on SNP6.0 chips. Then the birdseed algorithm (Korn et al., 2008) was used to genotype the samples.. The median call rate was 99.57%. Eight samples were excluded to a call rate < 97%. Percentage of heterozygotes is also evaluated as an excessive percentage can be a consequence of contamination. We thus excluded 3 additional samples for which the percentage of heterozygotes was greater than m + 3 sd (m: mean of heterozygotes in the entire series, sd: standard deviation). Further analysis was performed on 281 samples that meet these quality criteria and for which we know the neurotoxicity grade of the treatment. 833,192 SNP were considered on these samples. ::: ::: For the CNV analysis, the Median of the Absolute Values of all Pairwise Differences (MAPD) metric was considered for quality control. According to Affymetrix recommendations, 22 samples with a MAPD>0.35 were excluded. Further analysis was performed on 270 samples that meet this quality criterion and for which we know the neurotoxicity grade of the treatment. 1,720,978 CNV markers were considered on these samples. ::: ::: To identify the SNP and CNV most associated with neurotoxicity in patients receiving bortezomib, we use of two efficient and highly scalable feature selection techniques. The aim is to identify the relevant SNP and CNV markers that are strictly necessary to construct an efficient classifier of the bortezomib neurotoxicity from data alone. One is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM-RFE), a common and well-studied method in the Machine Learning community. The other uses a probabilistic feature selection technique based on recent Bayesian networks advances to identify a Markov Blanket of the target variable T, that is, a subset of the variables that renders the the remaining ones independent of T. Statistical significance of the selected SNP and CNV markers are evaluated using bootstrapping. Additional data will be presented during the meeting. ::: ::: Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.v114.22.4816.4816", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2581721832", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79148571"}

It is shown that the combination of statistical signal processing and machine learning concepts improve the spectrum sensing process and spectrum sensing is possible even at low Signal to Noise Ra- tio (SNR) values up to 50 dB.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.13164/re.2015.0192", "venue": null, "journal": "Radioengineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2333099658", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6424286", "9056128", "14279547", "9041202", "61207536", "14070543", "7863105", "10392288", "14823257", "14496656", "28753059", "7138354", "16159585", "10030683", "64543020", "1648794", "13900622"], "inbound_citations": ["211052736"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11975827"}

We intend to discover a subspace rich in gestural information of speech and captures the invariance of similar gestures. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised techniques best suited for learning such a subspace. Main contribution of the paper is an approach to learn gesture-rich representation of speech automatically from data in completely unsupervised manner. This study compares the representations obtained through convolutional autoencoder (ConvAE) and standard unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques such as manifold learning and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through the task of phoneme classification. Manifold learning techniques such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap and Laplacian Eigenmaps are evaluated in this study.

Further, we evaluate the representation using Zero Resource Speech Challenge\u2019s ABX discriminability measure. Results indicate that representation obtained through ConvAE and Isomap out-perform baseline MFCC features in the task of phoneme classification as well as ABX measure and induce separation between sounds composed of different set of gestures.

With an increasing world population, more food production is needed and, therefore, more land is converted into agricultural areas. This conversion of land to agricultural areas, in turn, leads to more land degradation. Some common forms of land degradation are desertification, salinization and soil erosion by water. The negative effects of soil erosion have been recognized for a long time. Since the early 20th century, researchers have tried to quantify soil displaced due to water, and to measure and model the efficiency of management strategies. The implications of problems with upscaling, wrong process representation and equifinality include the difficulty to properly predict sediment sources, pathways and sinks within catchments. These problems then can translate into the implementation of sub-optimal management strategies. To deal with these non-linear processes and the lack of proper representation of water and sediment sources, pathways and sinks, the concept of connectivity was developed. Currently, many definitions of connectivity have been proposed, although the definition most used is that of hydrological connectivity by Pringle (2003): \u2018Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle\u2019. A unified theory on what constitutes connectivity and how connectivity should be measured or inferred remains one of the biggest challenges within catchment science. In addition, it is unclear whether connectivity should be an output or an input of a model and if an input, whether this should be added explicitly or implicitly. The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to assess and quantify hydrological and sediment connectivity in a meaningful way, which can further our understanding of hydrological and sediment transport processes and catchment system dynamics. The study was carried out in three catchments in Navarre, northern Spain. Two catchments, \u2018Latxaga\u2019 and \u2018La Tejeria\u2019, are agricultural catchments with sizes of 2.07 km2 and 1.69 km2, respectively. The \u2018Oskotz Forestal\u2019 catchment is a (semi-)natural catchment, with a size of 5.05 km2. Land cover in the agricultural catchments is mainly winter wheat and barley, while in the Oskotz catchment it is grassland and forest. Latxaga and La Tejeria are mainly underlain by marls and within La Tejeria some sandstone is also present. The geology in Oskotz is characterised by an alternation of marls and sandy limestone. In chapter 2, I used networks (graph theory) to characterise and quantify overland flow connectivity dynamics on hillslopes in a humid sub-Mediterranean environment by using a combination of high-resolution digital-terrain models, overland flow sensors and a network approach. Results showed that there are significant differences between overland flow connectivity on agricultural areas and semi-natural shrubs areas. Significant positive correlations between connectivity and precipitation characteristics were found. Significant negative correlations between connectivity and soil moisture were found, most likely due to soil water repellency and/or soil surface crusting. The combination of structural networks and dynamic networks for determining potential connectivity and actual connectivity proved a powerful tool for analysing overland flow connectivity. In chapter 3, I determined the functioning of hillslope-channel connectivity and the continuation of transport of these sediments in the channel. To determine this functioning, I obtained data on sediment transport from the hillslopes to the channels while simultaneously looking at factors that influence sediment export out of the catchment. For measuring hillslope-channel sediment connectivity, Rare-Earth Oxide (REO) tracers were applied to a hillslope in the Latxaga catchment preceding the winter of 2014-2015. The results showed that during the winter there have been no sediments transported from the hillslope into the channel. Analysis of precipitation data showed that although total precipitation quantities did not differ much from the mean, the precipitation intensities were low. Using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning method, I showed that hillslope-channel connectivity in Latxaga is dominated by sediment mobilisation during large (high intensity) precipitation events. Sediments are for a large part exported during those events. Large events also leave behind large amounts of sediments in and near the channel, which is gradually removed by small events. In chapter 4 I demonstrated that existing data can be used to assess governing factors of connectivity, and how these factors change over time. Data from three catchments in Navarre, Northern Spain, were used to assess factors that influence hydrologic and sediment connectivity. These factors were used as components in a spatially-lumped linear model for discharge and suspended-sediment yield. Three components of connectivity were distinguished: topographical, biological and soil. Changes in the topographical component for the studied periods were considered relatively small, and, therefore, kept constant. Changes in the biological component were determined using the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Changes in the soil component were assessed using an Antecedent Precipitation Index. Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients were between 0.49 through 0.62 for the discharge models and between 0.23 through 0.3 for the sediment-yield models. I recommended applying the model at smaller spatial scales than catchment scale to minimize the lumping of spatial variability in the components. In chapter 5, the objective was to better understand the implications of model calibration at different spatial scales on the simulation of hydrology and sediment dynamics of an agricultural catchment. I applied the LAPSUS-D model to the Latxaga catchment. The model was calibrated and validated (4 years: 2011-2015) using three datasets at varying spatial scales: hillslope, catchment and the combined dataset (combined-calibrated model). The hillslope-calibrated model showed mainly infiltration-excess overland flow, the catchment-calibrated mainly saturation-excess overland flow at the footslopes and the combined-calibrated model showed saturation-excess overland flow from the midslopes to the footslopes. For hydrology, the combined-calibrated model simulated the large discharge peaks best, while at the hillslope scale, the hillslope-calibrated model performed best. The hillslope-calibrated model produced the highest model efficiencies for sediments, for calibration (0.618) and validation (0.269). The hillslope-calibrated model was the only model that showed observed gully erosion on a high-resolution DEM and displayed channel sediment dynamics. However, absolute quantities of erosion and deposition within the catchment were too high. The results show that modellers need to be aware of problems associated with automatic calibration, over-calibration and not incorporating measured data at multiple spatial scales. We advocate incorporating runoff and sediment tracing data at multiple scales whenever this is possible and to, furthermore, carry out specific measuring campaigns towards this end, ultimately to get a more comprehensive view on hydrological and sediment connectivity within a catchment. The combination of chapters in this thesis showed that the connectivity concept is useful for a wide range of studies, from hillslope scale to catchment scale. Using the concept, I was able to determine sediment dynamics for a humid-Mediterranean catchment and show that this behaviour is different than previously thought. Depending of the aim of the study, various concepts of connectivity are useful. Different geologic and climatic settings cause large differences in catchment (sediment) dynamics. It might, therefore, not be necessary, or even possible, to strive for a single, unifying conceptual framework for connectivity. Instead, a collection of frameworks for different settings should be developed. These frameworks should, however, always aim at helping to understand which measurements need to be taken and which type of models and indices should be used for that particular setting. It is my honest opinion that connectivity is definitely a useful concept to advance our knowledge on water and sediment transport processes further. However, careful consideration is also required as this particular concept will not necessary provide the ultimate explanation and insights in dynamic behaviour within watersheds around the world. The gap between the different spatial and temporal scales is too complex to be bridged with a single concept like connectivity. However, the many studies about connectivity that will be published in the near future will be able to advance knowledge on water and sediment transport processes.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18174/419764", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2756575933", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134914653"}

They make use of sensors and machine states to indicate to end-users various information (e.g. diagnostics or need of maintenance) or to put machines in a specific mode (e.g. shut-down when thermal protection is activated). More specifically, the alarms are often triggered based on comparing sensors data to a threshold defined in the controllers software. In batch production machines, triggering an alarm (e.g. thermal protection) in the middle of a batch production is crucial for the quality of the produced batch and results into a high production loss. This situation can be avoided if the settings of the production machine (e.g. production speed) is adjusted accordingly based on the temperature monitoring. Therefore, predicting a temperature alarm and adjusting the production speed to avoid triggering the alarm seems logical. In this paper we show the effectiveness of Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) in predicting the evolution of the temperature in a steel production machine and, as a consequence, possible alarms due to overheating. Firstly, in an offline fashion, we develop a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model, where a systematic model selection procedure allows to carefully tune the model parameters.

The brain segmentation using MRI is challenging due to a significant amount of noise caused by operator performance, scanner, and the environment, which can lead to serious inaccuracies with segmentation. Evaluations of segmentation results in medical imaging are caused by the absence of a gold standard. So, the performance evaluation of these methods would be necessary. ::: Methods: In this paper, the performance of clustering algorithms such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Hard C-Means (HCM), and Neural Gas (NG) for tumor detection is evaluated on 100 downloaded images. For this purpose, we evaluated these 3 algorithms under noise condition, convergence speed. Compared with manual segmentation by an expert radiologist, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are calculated for each segmentation methods. ::: Results: It can be stated, based on the results, that among the HCM and NG algorithms, the highest degree of accuracy and robustness to noise belongs to FCM. Moreover, optimum convergence rate and iteration need to gain final result using FCM algorithm. ::: Conclusion: All the quantitative performance analysis and visual comparisons clearly demonstrated the superiority of FCM algorithm for MRI-based tumor detection.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21767/1989-5216.1000271", "venue": null, "journal": "Archives of Medicine", "mag_id": "2806243508", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53345659"}

This reasoning is quite sluggish compared to PID. Thus PID is used to control the negative torque of the motor when brake is pressed. This fresh elucidation has improved performance in regard to insight, strength, and efficiency. The suggested system grants the simulation results by analysing the speed of motor with its braking force and the vehicle\u2019s battery charge under the IDE of Simulink.

Therefore, in the last decade, many researchers and practitioners proposed different approaches in order to increase the effectiveness and safety of spam filtering models. In this paper, we propose a spam filtering approach consisted of two main stages; feature selection and emails classification. In the first step a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Wrapper Feature Selection is used to select the best representative set of features to reduce the large number of measured features. In the second stage, a Random Forest spam filtering model is developed using the selected features in the first stage. Experimental results on real-world spam data set show the better performance of the proposed method over other five traditional machine learning approaches from the literature. Furthermore, four cost functions are used to evaluate the proposed spam filtering method.

The use of the model\u2019s outcome allows any clinical engineer to identify the proposal that best attend the health unit requirements. To validate this model, a national inquiry (32 clinical engineers) was conducted using an electronic chart that permitted to: (a) establish a major professional profile of the inquired engineers; (b) determine which were the most important criteria considered during a medical equipment procurement process and (c) generate 95 examples that were used to train, and to test, diverse types of artificial neural networks. Hence, to represent the knowledge of clinical engineers (for the evaluation process of purchasing proposals) who worked at public hospitals, with three to ten years of experience, the best results were encountered for an ensemble of 100 two-hidden-layers perceptrons trained with the Backpropagation algorithm.
