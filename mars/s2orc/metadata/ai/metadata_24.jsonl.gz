The system was tested by ten participants in two part experiments, one under controlled laboratory conditions and the other in unrestricted free-living. The proposed food intake recognition method first performed an energy-based segmentation to isolate candidate chewing segments (instead of using epochs of fixed duration commonly reported in research literature), with the subsequent classification of the segments by linear Support Vector Machine models. On participant level (combining data from both laboratory and free-living experiments), with 10-fold leave-one-out cross-validation, chewing were recognized with average F-score of 96.28% and the resultant area under the curve was 0.97, which are higher than any of the previously reported results.

There exist two intrinsic issues in multiple-shot person re-identification: Large variances in view point, illumination, and non-rigid deformation are included in the image set of the same person, only a few training data for learning tasks are available in a realistic re-identification scenario. We deal with the multimodal property of people's appearance distribution caused by the first issue by using a local distance comparison approach. Since the capability of the local distance comparison highly depends on the choice of distance metric, we also introduce an adaptive learning method to learn an appropriate distance metric and use it to find and compute local neighbors effectively. This adaptive learning method is able to solve the over fitting problem caused by the second issue, through leveraging the generic knowledge of re-identification together with the specific information of the target task.

The proposed modulation classification algorithm is applicable to spatially multiplexed multiple antenna systems over frequency-selective fading channels. It works in the presence of timing, phase, and frequency offsets, without having prior knowledge of the channel state information. Classification is performed by utilizing the combined properties of the correlation functions, cyclic cumulant (CC), and cumulant. The correlation function of the received baseband signal exhibits peaks at a particular set of time lag, which represents distinctive features for the modulation formats. The CC uses the position of nonzero cycle frequency of the received baseband signals to classify modulation formats, while the cumulant employs threshold values.

Characterisation and classification of different common gait disorders such as foot drop in an effective and accurate manner can lead to improved diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and treatment. However, currently visual inspection is the main clinical method to evaluate gait disorders, which is reliant on the subjectivity of the observer, leading to inaccuracies. Research question: This study examines if it is feasible to use commercial off-the-shelf Inertial measurement unit sensors and supervised learning methods to distinguish foot drop gait disorder from the normal walking gait pattern. Method: The gait data collected from 56 adults diagnosed with foot drop due to L5 lumbar radiculopathy (with MRI verified compressive pathology), and 30 adults with normal gait during multiple walking trials on a flat surface. Machine learning algorithms were applied to the inertial sensor data to investigate the feasibility of classifying foot drop disorder. Results: The best three performing results were 88.45%, 86.87% and 86.08% accuracy derived from the Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes classifiers respectively. After applying the wrapper feature selection technique, the top performance was from the Random Forest classifier with an overall accuracy of 93.18%.

A Monte Carlo approach was used for the sensitivity analysis of the AI models and input parameters. For the construction and validation of the models, 189 soft clayey soil samples were analyzed. In the models study, 13 input parameters: depth of sample, bulk density, plasticity index, moisture content, clay content, specific gravity, void ratio, liquid limit, dry density, porosity, plastic limit, degree of saturation, and liquidity index were used to obtain one output parameter \u201cCc\u201d. Validation of the models was done using statistical methods such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of determination (R2). Results of the model validation indicate that though performance of all the three models is good but SVM model is the best in the prediction of Cc. The Monte Carlo method based sensitivity analysis results show that out of the 13 input parameters considered for the models study, four parameters namely clay, degree of saturation, specific gravity and depth of sample are the most relevant in the prediction of Cc, and other parameters (bulk density, dry density, void ratio and porosity) are the most insignificant parameters for the prediction of Cc. Removal of these insignificant parameters helped to reduce the dimension of the input space and also model running time, and improved significantly the performance of the AI models.

Thanks to recent progress in photography and breakthroughs in aviation, we are now able to capture tens of megapixels of ground imagery, namely Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), at multiple frames per second from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). WAMI serves as a great source for many applications, including security, urban planning and route planning. These applications require fast and accurate image understanding which is time consuming for humans, due to the large data volume and city-scale area coverage. Therefore, automatic processing and understanding of WAMI imagery has been gaining attention in both industry and the research community. This paper focuses on an essential step in WAMI imagery analysis, namely vehicle classi\ufb01cation. That is, deciding whether a certain image patch contains a vehicle or not. We collect a set of positive and negative sample image patches, for training and testing the detector. Positive samples are 64 \u00d7 64 image patches centered on annotated vehicles. We generate two sets of negative images. The \ufb01rst set is generated from positive images with some location shift. The second set of negative patches is generated from randomly sampled patches. We also discard those patches if a vehicle accidentally locates at the center. Both positive and negative samples are randomly divided into 9000 training images and 3000 testing images. We propose to train a deep convolution network for classifying these patches. The classi\ufb01er is based on a pre-trained AlexNet Model in the Ca\ufb00e library, with an adapted loss function for vehicle classi\ufb01cation. The performance of our classi\ufb01er is compared to several traditional image classi\ufb01er methods using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features. While the SVM+HOG method achieves an accuracy of 91.2%, the accuracy of our deep network-based classi\ufb01er reaches 97.9%.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2224916", "venue": "SPIE Defense + Security", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2362163200", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["9530137", "14124313", "206594692", "14113767", "436933", "10328909", "14102203", "1799558", "409780", "2814088", "13401677", "1603029", "7018553", "6552137", "5907973", "16169844", "2714075", "131734602", "13442603", "10310799", "206591293", "9630774", "31228251", "206590483", "2715202", "195908774", "206592484", "1241368", "10328909", "56507745", "15095719", "6763530", "35331779", "203670408", "121539478", "120686836", "16080610", "11377016", "794070", "100226"], "inbound_citations": ["64588596", "53108151", "69315838", "3312899", "20627070", "8348628", "3285856", "9577454"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124929833"}

The dominant approach uses supervised learning, in which a human expert specifies which patterns to look for (by designating a learning task and class labels) and where to look for them (by constructing input features). This scales poorly and misses the unexpected patterns, which are the most informative. Unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying patterns (or features) that form a compact, expressive representation of their source data without depending on class labels or human input. Unsupervised features have become the state of the art for image and speech recognition. In this work we introduce the idea of using them for the problem of phenotype recognition. We present an unsupervised approach for inferring broadly useful, data-driven micro-phenotypes in the form of continuous, longitudinal features learned from noisy, sparse, and irregular EMR data. In our demonstration project, unsupervised features learned from longitudinal laboratory values were as accurate (0.96 AUC) in a classification task unknown to the learning algorithm as gold-standard features engineered by an expert with complete knowledge of the domain, the data, and the class labels.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24303314", "doi": null, "venue": "AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

The present study performs a comparative study for NTL detection using supervised machine learning techniques such as the: Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Online-sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM). Model testing is performed using historical customer consumption data for three towns within peninsular Malaysia. The detection hit-rate of all compared models is obtained from TNB Distribution (TNBD) Sdn. Bhd. for onsite customer inspection. Experimental results obtained indicate that the BPNN detection model achieves the lowest average detection hit-rate of 36.07%, while the OS-ELM model obtains a slightly higher average detection hit-rate of 51.38%. The previously proposed SVM-based NTL detection model outperforms the BPNN and OS-ELM by far with the highest average detection hit-rate of 60.75%. This indicates that the use of a SVM-based soft-margin approach results in a better generalization performance for the application of NTL detection as compared to the BPNN and OS-ELM schemes.

Discussing in detail the neural correlates of moral cognition, he argues that neural networks can be used to model ethical function. He then discusses the impact his views of moral epistemology and ontology will have on traditional ethical theory and moral education, concluding that there is room for other moral theories as long as they take into consideration the functional aspect of ethics; the pragmatic neo-Aristotelian virtue theory he proposes thus serves as a moral \"big tent.\" Finally, he addresses objections to ethical naturalism that may arise, and calls for a reconciliation of the sciences and the humanities. \"Living well,\" Casebeer writes, \"depends upon reweaving our ethical theories into the warp and woof of our scientific heritage, attending to the myriad consequences such a project will have for the way we live our lives and the manner in which we structure our collective moral institutions.\"", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7551/mitpress/4856.001.0001", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1954851655", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211250917", "23118429", "20455993", "149418878", "18794961", "8846979", "32276717", "11699710", "43956494", "5544594", "46951417", "27112789", "538927", "14045782", "8393383", "14456771", "142439848", "171769555", "146655799", "18627893", "149430214", "145056419", "195835573", "144998322", "146553543", "2915834", "11294718", "142865736", "182098766", "42540898", "54010921", "19744334"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143230810"}

This represents a significant departure from models where each individual constructs a direct input-outcome map, for example, from the set of exemplars to the set of class labels as is typical under the classification domain. In contrast, the proposed model focuses on learning a bidding strategy based on the exemplar feature vectors; each individual is associated with a single discrete action and the individual with the maximum bid `wins' the right to suggest its action. Thus, the number of individuals associated with each action is a function of the intra-action bidding behaviour. Credit assignment is designed to reward correct but unique bidding strategies relative to the target actions. An advantage of the model over other teaming methods is its ability to automatically determine the number of and interaction between cooperative team members. The resulting model shares several traits with learning classifier systems and as such both approaches are benchmarked on nine large classification problems. Moreover, both of the evolutionary models are compared against the deterministic Support Vector Machine classification algorithm. Performance assessment considers the computational, classification, and complexity characteristics of the resulting solutions. The bid-based model is found to provide simple yet effective solutions that are robust to wide variations in the class representation.

The framework identifies pairs of hand motions (gesture) and uttered words as training samples by autonomously aligning the speech and the co-occurring gestures. Using the samples, a supervised learning approach is undertaken to learn a model to discriminate between gestures that co-occur with a spoken word (w) and gestures when the word w is not being spoken. To detect gestures and associate them with spoken words, we extract (1) a trajectory signal feature set, (2) features of various gesture phases from hand motion data and (3) primitive gesture patterns learned by Sift Invariant Sparse Coding (SISC). Then Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained with these three-feature sets. In experiments, the classification accuracy achieved for 80 words was above 60 % (the maximum accuracy achieved was 71 %) using the proposed framework. In particular, SVMs trained with features (2) and (3) outperform an HMM trained with feature (1) (prepared as a baseline model).

Here we use a cohort of 271 breast cancer tissues, 204 positive estrogen receptor (ER+) and 67 negative estrogen receptor (ER-), to test the accuracies of autoencoder, a deep learning (DL) framework, as well as six widely used machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM), and Generalized Boosted Models (GBM).

To deal with high-dimensional data, a novel sparse Bayesian Double-Layer ELM (DL-ELM) is proposed in this paper. The first layer of the proposed DL-ELM is based on a set of SBELM subnetworks which are separately applied to the features on the input layer. The second layer consists in a set of weight parameters to determine the contribution of each feature in the output. Adopting a Bayesian approach and using Gaussian priors, the proposed method is sparse in both the hidden layer (of SBELM subnetworks) and the input layer.

Query refinement typically includes a number of tasks such as spelling error correction, word splitting, word merging, phrase segmentation, word stemming, and acronym expansion. In previous research, such tasks were addressed separately or through employing generative models. This paper proposes employing a unified and discriminative model for query refinement. Specifically, it proposes a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model suitable for the problem, referred to as Conditional Random Field for Query Refinement (CRF-QR). Given a sequence of query words, CRF-QR predicts a sequence of refined query words as well as corresponding refinement operations. In that sense, CRF-QR differs greatly from conventional CRF models. Two types of CRF-QR models, namely a basic model and an extended model are introduced. One merit of employing CRF-QR is that different refinement tasks can be performed simultaneously and thus the accuracy of refinement can be enhanced. Furthermore, the advantages of discriminative models over generative models can be fully leveraged. Experimental results demonstrate that CRF-QR can significantly outperform baseline methods. Furthermore, when CRF-QR is used in web search, a significant improvement of relevance can be obtained.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1390334.1390400", "venue": "SIGIR '08", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2096961418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10942425", "7651132", "14683127", "2704994", "5766312", "14303238", "61116939", "1981391", "8885742", "15205488", "207159138", "16543675", "277918", "409423", "16913242", "11711278", "11358505", "11600398", "61859400", "57435686", "45846138", "6038991", "17671150", "937336", "53249280"], "inbound_citations": ["15253238", "10373769", "11620665", "14284540", "9158264", "54626389", "18181215", "11806361", "2333650", "1311730", "46808506", "11583822", "15569760", "73583845", "15955283", "11479131", "13254414", "19000871", "13354369", "59528277", "52010569", "23567778", "14561439", "12378389", "739317", "86803071", "17281980", "9117959", "7038201", "8352081", "397153", "9710156", "8910506", "1601589", "12833507", "2020951", "6287975", "6828812", "55912140", "3016128", "13440500", "17569849", "17877051", "14708145", "15901129", "18373261", "7948947", "8814375", "52180149", "11416634", "1359547", "10666272", "41460928", "1361463", "16353511", "7989387", "6095070", "17825610", "27283799", "1165695", "52830919", "33481361", "14863454", "5824615", "2076339", "11591571", "9761002", "7016350", "14130667", "5406553", "7011780", "53356677", "18406335", "6390993", "7343609", "2409730", "7569020"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13970940"}

Often these two aspects are dealt with independently and thus the features are not sufficient enough to partition the data meaningfully. In this paper, we propose a method where we discover these features required for the separation of the images using deep autoencoder. Our method learns the image representation features automatically for the purpose of clustering and also select a coherent image and an incoherent image simultaneously for a given image so that the feature representation learning can learn better discriminative features for grouping the similar images in a cluster and at the same time separating the dissimilar images across clusters.

Detection of crop stress from hyperspectral images is of high importance for breeding and precision crop protection. However, the continuous monitoring of stress in phenotyping facilities by hyperspectral imagers produces huge amounts of uninterpreted data. In order to derive a stress description from the images, interpreting algorithms with high prediction performance are required. Based on a static model, the local stress state of each pixel has to be predicted. Due to the low computational complexity, linear models are preferable. In this paper, we focus on drought-induced stress which is represented by discrete stages of ordinal order. We present and compare five methods which are able to derive stress levels from hyperspectral images: One-vs.-one Support Vector Machine (SVM), one-vs.-all SVM, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Support Vector Ordinal Regression (SVORIM) and Linear Ordinal SVM classification. The methods are applied on two data sets - a real world set of drought stress in single barley plants and a simulated data set.

For action recognition typically appearance and/or motion information of an action is analyzed using a large number of frames, which is often not sufficient, if very fast actions (e.g., in sport analysis) have to be analyzed. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that uses a single-frame representation for actions based on appearance and on motion information. In particular, we estimate Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOGs) for the current sample as well as for a flow field. The thus obtained descriptors are then efficiently represented by the coefficients of a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Actions are classified using an one-vs-all Support Vector Machine. Since the flow can be estimated from two frames, in the evaluation stage only two consecutive frames are required for the action analysis. Both, the optical flow as well as the HOGs, can be computed very efficiently.

Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.", "year": 2017,

In order to understand the impacts of nsSNPs on the structure and function of the proteome, as well as to guide protein engineering, accurate in silicomethodologies are required to study and predict their effects on protein stability. Despite the diversity of available computational methods in the literature, none has proven accurate and dependable on its own under all scenarios where mutation analysis is required. Here we present DUET, a web server for an integrated computational approach to study missense mutations in proteins.

Past works addressing these two aspects were heavily parametric in the sense that the optimal performance is only reached for a suitable parameter choice that should be known in advance. In this paper, we demonstrate that sparse coding theory not only serves for automatic graph reconstruction as shown in recent works, but also represents an accurate alternative for out-of-sample embedding.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed out-of-sample embedding, experiments are conducted using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Kernel Support Vector Machines (KSVM) classifiers on four public face databases.

For such tasks, the ability to effectively handle sparsity by the employed machine learning technique is crucial. The state-of-the-art random forest algorithm is frequently employed to handle this type of data. It has however recently been demonstrated that the algorithm is biased towards the majority class, which may result in a low predictive performance on EHR data with large numbers of sparse features. In this study, approaches to handle this problem are empirically evaluated using 14 ADE datasets and three performance metrics, F1-score, AUC and Brier score. Two resampling based techniques are investigated and compared to two baseline approaches. The experimental results indicate that, for larger forests, the resampling methods outperform the baseline approaches when considering F1-score, which is consistent with the metric being affected by class bias. The approaches perform on a similar level with respect to AUC, which can be explained by the metric not being sensitive to class bias. Finally, when considering the squared error (Brier score) of individual predictions, one of the baseline approaches turns out to be ahead of the others. A bias-variance analysis shows that this is an effect of the individual trees being more correct on average for the baseline approach and that this outweighs the expected loss from a lower variance. The main conclusion is that the suggested choice of approach to handle sparsity is highly dependent on the performance metric, or the task, of interest. If the task is to accurately assign an ADE to a patient record, a sampling based approach is recommended. If the task is to rank patients according to risk of a certain ADE, the choice of approach is of minor importance. Finally, if the task is to accurately assign probabilities for a certain ADE, then one of the baseline approaches is recommended.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICHI.2014.10", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1976253807", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8949897", "15041736", "89141", "15619865", "12370460", "207738357", "206420153", "7375956", "60993494", "18401995", "15245447", "74728932", "9693748", "2702042", "122906757", "7553535"], "inbound_citations": ["52149465", "61810894", "52955554", "9761306", "14820565", "13350761", "16888458"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13408145"}

Moreover, they have a set of parameters to be tuned. In this paper, we propose GEEK, a Grammatical Evolution approach for automatically Evolving Kernel functions. GEEK uses a grammar composed of simple mathematical operations extracted from known kernels and is also able to optimize some of their parameters. When combined through the Grammatical Evolution, these operations give rise to more complex kernel functions, adapted to each specific problem in a data-driven approach. The predictive results obtained by Support Vector Machines using the GEEK kernel functions were in general statistically similar to those of the standard RBF, Polynomial and Sigmoid kernel functions, which had their parameters optimized by a grid search method.

This learning scenario is based on the intuitive notion that a learner can determine the meaning of a word by finding something in common across all observed uses of that word. Here we show how the deterministic Neural Modeling Fields (NMF) categorization mechanism can be used by the learner as an efficient algorithm to infer the correct object-word mapping. To achieve that we first reduce the original on-line learning problem to a batch learning problem where the inputs to the NMF mechanism are all possible object-word associations that could be inferred from the cross-situational learning scenario.

Learning a useful feature representation from graph data lies at the heart and success of many machine learning tasks such as classification, anomaly detection, link prediction, among many others. Many existing techniques use random walks as a basis for learning features or estimating the parameters of a graph model for a downstream prediction task. Examples include recent node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, as well as graph-based deep learning algorithms. However, the simple random walk used by these methods is fundamentally tied to the identity of the node. This has three main disadvantages. First, these approaches are inherently transductive and do not generalize to unseen nodes and other graphs. Second, they are not space-efficient as a feature vector is learned for each node which is impractical for large graphs. Third, most of these approaches lack support for attributed graphs. To make these methods more generally applicable, we propose a framework based on the notion of attributed random walk that is not tied to node identity and is instead based on learning a function $\\Phi : \\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x} \\rightarrow w$ that maps a node attribute vector $\\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x}$ to a type $w$.

A novel automatic identification approach of flaws using support vector machine (SVM) is presented. Wavelet transform is applied to feature extraction of ultrasonic echo signals, and SVM is to perform the identification task. To validate this approach, some experiments are performed. The results show that unlike conventional and artificial neural networks (ANN) identification methods the new technique performs better than conventional evaluation ones with advantages of high identification performance for pipeline flaws, lower cost, excellent generalization. Introduction Pipelines prove to be the safest and the most economical means transporting large quantities of oil and gas resources. Maintenance of oil and gas pipelines is an issue of great concern for all oil and gas companies. But various flaws will inevitably occur and grow during the operations, such as crack, leakage, corrosion of the pipe wall, etc. Flaw detection and identification is a very important step to ensure pipelines safe operation. The traditional flaw detection suffers from complicated process, low accurate rate and off-line implement. The improved methods of flaw identification by artificial neural networks (ANN) can lead to the problems of overfit and bad generalization because of finite samples[1]. In this paper after de-noising the ultrasonic echo signals using wavelet transform and with a view of data mining, a novel approach using SVM classification is discussed to identify the flaws. The experiment results show that unlike conventional and ANN identification methods the new technique performs better than conventional evaluation ones with advantages of high efficiency, lower cost, easy implement on-line, excellent generalization. The approach provides a novel technique means for nondestructive flaw identification of various flaws. Pipeline flaw identification based on SVM A. Theory and principle of SVM SVM initially came into prominence in the area of hand-written character recognition and is now being rapidly applied to many other fields, such as text categorization, computer vision, speech recognition and gene classification, etc.[2-3]. SVM is the approximate realization of the structural risk minimization method, analysis of the expression state of the linear separable pattern, which main idea is to establish a hyperplane as the decision hyperplane, the decision hyperplane can not only classify all the training samples correctly, but also among training samples make the distance between the points closest to the classification face and the classification face is the maximum. The detailed data can see references [4-5]. Flaw classification task involves training set and test set composed by data examples. Each example in training set includes a target value (class marker) and several attributes (characteristics). The objective of SVM is to produce a target value of data example containing only the attribute among a predicted test set. 4th International Conference on Mechatronics, Materials, Chemistry and Computer Engineering (ICMMCCE 2015) \u00a9 2015.

Secondly, the spatio-temporal interaction descriptor and causal interaction descriptor are constructed respectively, which fully mine the spatio-temporal and implicit causal interactive relationships between parts.

First, it uses directly the Euclidean distances already computed to self-organize the map in the input space. Second, it uses the neighborhood relationships between the neurons to create \u201cneighboring\u201d influence kernels.

In software engineering, rationale management focuses on capturing design and requirements decisions and on organizing and reusing project knowledge. This paper takes a different view on rationale written by users in online reviews. We studied 32,414 reviews for 52 software applications in the Amazon Store. Through a grounded theory approach and peer content analysis, we investigated how users argue and justify their decisions, e.g., about upgrading, installing, or switching software applications. We also studied the occurrence frequency of rationale concepts such as issues encountered or alternatives considered in the reviews and found that assessment criteria like performance, compatibility, and usability represent the most pervasive concept. We identified a moderate positive correlation between issues and criteria and furthermore assessed the distribution of rationale concepts with respect to rating and verbosity. We found that issues tend to appear more in lower star rated reviews, while criteria, alternatives, and justifications seem to appear more in three star rated reviews. Also, reviews reporting alternatives seem to be more verbose than reviews reporting criteria. A follow-up qualitative study of sub-concepts revealed, that users also report other alternatives (e.g., alternative software provider), criteria (e.g., cost), and decisions (e.g., on rating software). We then used the truth set of manually labeled review sentences to explore how accurately we can mine rationale concepts from the reviews. We evaluated the classification algorithms Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Process, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier using a baseline and random configuration. Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, trained on the review metadata, syntax tree of the review text, and influential terms, achieved a precision around 80% for predicting sentences with alternatives and decisions, with top recall values of 98%. On the review level, precision was up to 13% higher with recall values reaching 99%. Using only word features, we achieved in most cases the highest precision and highest recall respectively using the Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithm.

Here we focused in Central Africa, a region still subjected to traditional agricultural practices with a clear vegetation gradient. Using remote sensing data and global databases, we calibrated a Random Forest model to correlatively link tree cover with climatic, edaphic, fire and agricultural practices data. We showed that annual rainfall and accumulated water deficit were the main drivers of the distribution of tree cover and vegetation classes (defined by the modes of tree cover density), but agricultural practices, especially pastoralism, were also important in determining tree cover. We simulated future tree cover with our model using different scenarios of climate and land-use (agriculture and population) changes.

In general, it maps network nodes, edges, subgraphs, etc. onto independent vectors in a low dimension space, thus facilitating network analysis tasks. As community structure is one of the most prominent mesoscopic structure properties of real networks, it is necessary to preserve community structure of networks during NRL. In this paper, the concept of $k$ -step partial community structure is defined and two Partial Community structure Guided Network Embedding (PCGNE) methods, based on two popular NRL algorithms (DeepWalk and node2vec respectively), for node representation learning are proposed. The idea behind this is that it is easier and more cost-effective to find a higher quality 1-step partial community structure than a higher quality whole community structure for networks; the extracted partial community information is then used to guide random walks in DeepWalk or node2vec. As a result, the learned node representations could preserve community structure property of networks more effectively. The two proposed algorithms and six state-of-the-art NRL algorithms were examined through multi-label classification and (inner community) link prediction on eight synthesized networks: one where community structure property could be controlled, and one real world network. The results suggested that the two PCGNE methods could improve the performance of their own based algorithm significantly and were competitive for node representation learning. Especially, comparing against used baseline algorithms, PCGNE methods could capture overlapping community structure much better, and thus could achieve better performance for multi-label classification on networks that have more overlapping nodes and/or larger overlapping memberships.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2978517", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3009748595", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1479507", "3953995", "3215337", "13999578", "125864963", "17341970", "50778825", "59528295", "3051291", "207238980", "7859877", "3948366", "8399404", "3952914", "207238964", "52919090", "44162050", "50776071", "19140125", "1033682", "29154877", "19149083", "13913863", "67263763", "58981554", "3332112", "18481617", "961425", "1654798", "15126724", "52117882", "10511727", "349242"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213183192"}

In this paper, a novel method is proposed in order to reduce the computational time taken by the CAD system for the detection of growth in abdominal CT images for the identification of colorectal cancer. In the proposed CAD system, segmentation of the colon is done by otsu's method of thresholding and clustered by K-Means clustering for the extraction of the features such as intensity texture and volume in order to classify the polyps. The segmented candidates are typically characterized by features describing, for instance, the polyp shape and its internal intensity distribution. Such features will serve as input for the classification system. Classification is performed by SVM (Support Vector Machine) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network). The proposed CAD system is evaluated with 16 slices (each) of normal and abnormal images.

The idea is tested for the detection of precipitation and its phase over oceans, using coincidences of passive/active data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and CloudSat satellites. The initial results demonstrate that the presented approach cannot only capture the known laws of radiative transfer equations, but also the surrogate signatures that can arise due to the co-occurrence of precipitation and other radiometrically active land-atmospheric state variables. In particular, the results demonstrate high precision (low error) for the low-frequency channels of 10\u201337 GHz in the detection of both rain and snowfall over oceans. Using the optimal estimate of the channel error covariance through the multi-frequency ${k}$ -nearest neighbor (kNN) classification approach, without any ancillary data, it is demonstrated that the probability of passive microwave detection of snowfall (0.97) can be higher than that of the rainfall (0.88), when drizzle and light snowfall are the dominant form of precipitation.

In order to make use of this large-scale data and extract useful knowledge, researchers in machine learning and data mining communities are faced with numerous challenges, since the data mining and machine learning tools designed for standard desktop computers are not capable of addressing these problems due to memory and time constraints. As a result, there exists an evident need for development of novel, scalable algorithms for big data. ::: In this thesis we address these important problems, and propose both supervised and unsupervised tools for handling large-scale data. First, we consider unsupervised approach to big data analysis, and explore scalable, efficient visualization method that allows fast knowledge extraction. Next, we consider supervised learning setting and propose algorithms for fast training of accurate classification models on large data sets, capable of learning state-of-the-art classifiers on data sets with millions of examples and features within minutes. ::: Data visualization have been used for hundreds of years in scientific research, as it allows humans to easily get a better insight into complex data they are studying. Despite its long history, there is a clear need for further development of visualization methods when working with large-scale, high-dimensional data, where commonly used visualization tools are either too simplistic to gain a deeper insight into the data properties, or are too cumbersome or computationally costly. We present a novel method for data ordering and visualization. By combining efficient clustering using k-means algorithm and near-optimal ordering of found clusters using state-of-the-art TSP-solver, we obtain efficient algorithm that achieves performance better than existing, computationally intensive methods. In addition, we present visualization method for smaller-scale problems based on object matching. The experiments show that the methods allow for fast detection of hidden patterns, even by users without expertise in the areas of data mining and machine learning. ::: Supervised learning is another important task, often intractable in many modern applications due to time and memory constraints, considering prohibitively large scales of the data sets. To address this issue, we first consider Multi-hyperplane Machine (MM) classification model, and propose online Adaptive MM algorithm which represents a trade-off between linear and kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs), as it trains MMs in linear time on limited memory while achieving competitive accuracies on large-scale non-linear problems. Moreover, we present a C++ toolbox for developing scalable classification models, which provides an Application Programming Interface (API) for training of large-scale classifiers, as well as highly-optimized implementations of several state-of-the-art SVM approximators. Lastly, we consider parallelization and distributed learning approaches to large-scale supervised learning, and propose AROW-MapReduce, a distributed learning algorithm for confidence-weighted models using MapReduce framework. Experimental evaluation of the proposed methods shows state-of-the-art performance on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets, further paving a way for efficient and effective knowledge extraction from big data problems.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2104975219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16070072"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62144562"}

Species Distribution ::: Modelling (SDMs) offers a potentially powerful tool that might help to fill those gaps in our ::: knowledge especially for those species from which there is very little known about their ecology ::: and places where collecting has been very scarce. In this thesis, I used a database compiled from ::: museum and private collections, publications (including online databases) and fieldwork data ::: already assembled by my co-authors. ::: ::: Such database contains over 109,880 distributional records of the global distribution for all the 982 ::: non-American taxa of the Sphingidae family of Lepidoptera which then I combined with SDMs ::: algorithms to provide high-resolution distribution maps for all the taxa in the family and study ::: patterns of biodiversity.

The algorithm that performed the best was Maxent followed by ::: Random Forest, however we could not confirm effects of species traits or data properties ::: influencing the modeling performance. ::: ::: Subsequently, in Chapter 3 we assessed the value of different data sources, by comparing an ::: independent compilation of occurrence data vs GBIF database, and its contribution to different ::: aspects of the range of the species (i.e. range filling, range extent and climatic niche space).

We also provided assessment ::: of inventory completeness in the same region. Variables describing vegetation emerged as ::: important predictors of species richness.

In this paper, we launch an in-depth empirical investigation into negative transfer in fine-tuning and find that, for the weight parameters and feature representations, transferability of their spectral components is diverse. For safe transfer learning, we present Batch Spectral Shrinkage (BSS), a novel regularization approach to penalizing smaller singular values so that untransferable spectral components are suppressed.

As a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful way of conducting VS for drug leads. ML for VS generally involves assembling a filtered training set of compounds, comprised of known actives and inactives. After training the model, it is validated and, if sufficiently accurate, used on previously unseen databases to screen for novel compounds with desired drug target binding activity. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: The study aims to review ML-based methods used for VS and applications to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) drug discovery. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: To update the current knowledge on ML for VS, we review thorough backgrounds, explanations, and VS applications of the following ML techniques: Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: All techniques have found success in VS, but the future of VS is likely to lean more largely toward the use of neural networks - and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are a subset of ANN that utilize convolution. We additionally conceptualize a work flow for conducting ML-based VS for potential therapeutics for AD, a complex neurodegenerative disease with no known cure and prevention. This both serves as an example of how to apply the concepts introduced earlier in the review and as a potential workflow for future implementation. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Different ML techniques are powerful tools for VS, and they have advantages and disadvantages albeit.

ToF cameras allow capturing an entire scene instantaneously, and thus provide depth images in real-time. Despite the relatively low resolution, this type of data offers a clear advantage over conventional cameras for specific applications, such as human-machine interaction. In this paper, we propose a method that allows simultaneously recognizing the performed activity and tracking the full-body pose of a person observed by a a single ToF camera. Our method removes the need for identifying body parts in sparse and noisy ToF images [4] or for fitting a skeleton using expensive optimisation techniques [1]. The proposed method consists of learning a prior model of human motion and using an efficient, sampling-based inference approach for activity recognition and body tracking (Figure 1). The prior motion model is comprised of a set of low-dimensional manifold embeddings for each activity of interest. We generate the embeddings from full-body pose training data using a manifold learning technique [2]. Each of the embeddings acts as a low-dimensional parametrisation of feasible body poses [3] that we use to constrain the problem of body tracking only from depth cues. In a generative tracking framework, we sample the low-dimensional manifold embedding space by means of a particle filter and thus avoid exhaustively searching the full-body pose space. This way, we are able to track multiple pose hypotheses for different activities and to select one that is most consistent with the observed depth cues. Our depth feature descriptor, intuitively a sparse 3D human silhouette representation, can easily be extracted from ToF images. The overall method combines the distinctiveness of multiple local, activity-specific motion models into a global model capable of recognising and tracking multiple activities from simple observations.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5244/C.24.80", "venue": "BMVC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1969385685", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2887541", "13181540", "14879317", "15596138", "6821810", "16036400", "2519499", "6087055", "1377132", "1969061", "15815312", "207413679", "6068544", "16897742", "18109711", "912116", "518708", "16303609", "1407568"], "inbound_citations": ["22930624", "8110655", "14011452", "174428900", "1851093", "28400072", "123727826", "30079423", "19228934", "12871107", "1627761", "6913372", "17460792", "56259178", "202558095", "11392541", "2444871", "19256975", "9967462", "7815832", "6991037", "15299936", "60789222", "24353573", "945851"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1729419"}

The assorted papers demonstrate the vitality of current ILP research applied in challenging applications (here, object recognition), augmenting its logical foundations (metainterpretative learning, interpretation dynamics), and combined with extra-logical machinelearning techniques (neural networks, Bayes nets). In particular, the paper \u201cPlane-based Object Categorization using Relational Learning\u201d by R. Farid and C. Sammut, which won the best student-paper prize kindly sponsored by this journal, explores the hypothesis that relational description for classes of 3D objects can be built for robust object categorization in a real robotic application. Labelled sets of planes from 3D point clouds gathered during the RoboCup Rescue Robot competition are used as examples for an ILP system. The results show that ILP can be successfully applied to recognize objects encountered by a robot especially in an urban search and rescue environment.

Though the PCA space has orthogonal principal components (PC), it does not provide a real reduction of dimensionality in terms of the original features (variables), as all features including irrelevant and redundant features are required to define a single PC. It is necessary to remove such type of features by using feature subset selection (FSS) for better generalization performance. The principal intent of this paper is to introduce a PCA-based optimal FSS for fuzzy extreme learning machine (PF-FELM) approach that is able to handle weighted classification problem. The PF-FELM is mainly categorized into four subsystems: PCA, FSS, fuzzification, and classification. FSS selects an optimal feature order that is based on maximum occurrences within the various filter-based ranking algorithms. The simulation results are computed and compared by using sequential forward search strategy for clinical datasets. As a case study, an uncertain real-time application of plant disease and nutrient deficiency classification is considered, helping remote farmers as expert advice. For validation of the proposed PF-FELM, statistical and hypothetical tests are evaluated by using correlation measure and paired t-test.

Currently, most of the existing GUFS methods use a two-stage strategy which constructs graph first and then perform feature selection on this fixed graph. Since the performance of feature selection severely depends on the quality of graph, the selection results will be unsatisfactory if the given graph is of low-quality. To this end, we propose a joint graph learning and unsupervised feature selection (JGUFS) model in which the graph can be adjusted to adapt the feature selection process. The JGUFS objective function is optimized by an efficient iterative algorithm whose convergence and complexity are analyzed in detail.

Several machine learning regression algorithms such as neural networks, support vector regression, fuzzy logic, k nearest neighbors regression, multivariate adaptive regression spline, and random forest have already been applied. In this article, we present the Linear Random Forest algorithm and investigate its application in logging regression modeling.

The identification of the relevant genes to metabolic pathways is also helpful for understanding the genes. However, the relationships between metabolic pathways and genes are complicated. Thus, it is difficult to identify the relevant genes by linear models. In this study, we propose a new method based on the SVM approach, for inferring the genes involved in metabolic pathways from the gene expression profiles. To improve the classification performances of SVMs, we developed a method for finding the important interactions for classification, from a huge number of experiment combinations. The interactions selected by our method were added as new features to the training data set of the SVMs. Furthermore, feature selection by the Gini importance was applied, to avoid overlearning of the SVMs. To demonstrate the validity of our method, we trained SVMs with Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression profiles against eight metabolic pathways, and evaluated their classification performances. As a result, we achieved high performances with some metabolic pathways. Thus, our method is useful for inferring the relevant genes to metabolic pathways.

FullCAM-predicted above-ground woody biomass is heavily influenced by the parameter M, which defines the maximum upper limit to biomass accumulation for any location within the Australian continent. In this study we update FullCAM\u2019s M spatial input layer through combining an extensive database of 5739 site-based records of above-ground biomass (AGB) with the Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm, with model predictions of AGB based on 23 environmental predictor covariates. A Monte-Carlo approach was used, allowing estimates of uncertainty to be calculated. Overall, the new biomass predictions for woodlands, with 20\u201350% canopy cover, were on average 49.5 \u00b1 1.3 (s.d.) t DM ha\u22121, and very similar to existing model predictions of 48.5 t DM ha\u22121. This validates the original FullCAM model calibrations, which had a particular focus on accounting for greenhouse gas emissions in Australian woodlands. In contrast, the prediction of biomass of forests with a canopy cover >50% increased significantly, from 172.1 t DM ha\u22121, to 234.4 \u00b1 5.1 t DM ha\u22121. The change in forest biomass was most pronounced at sub-continental scales, with the largest increases in the states of Tasmania (166 to 351 \u00b1 22 t DM ha\u22121), Victoria (201 to 333 \u00b1 14 t DM ha\u22121), New South Wales (210 to 287 \u00b1 9 t DM ha\u22121), and Western Australia (103 to 264 \u00b1 14 s.d. t DM ha\u22121). Testing of model predictions against independent data from the savanna woodlands of northern Australia, and from the high biomass Eucalyptus regnans forests of Victoria, provided confidence in the predictions across a wide range of forest types and standing biomass. When applied to the Australian Government\u2019s National Inventory land clearing accounts there was an overall increase of 6% in continental emissions over the period 1970\u20132016. Greater changes were seen at sub-continental scales calculated within 6\u00b0 \u00d7 4\u00b0 analysis tiles, with differences in emissions varying from \u221221% to +35%.

On the other hand, it gives rise to a more conservative result, which reduces the operating margin of nuclear power plants. In this paper, the axial DNBR distribution at the actual hot fuel rod position was predicted based on the support vector regression (SVR) model, which is a data-based method using a number of measured signals from the reactor coolant system. SVR models were developed using a learning data set and validated by an independent test data set. These models were applied to the first fuel cycle of the Yonggwang unit 3 nuclear power plant. The root mean square (RMS) error averaged for 13 axial locations of the hot rod was 0.87%. The SVR models estimate DNBR values more accurately at central parts that have relatively lower DNBR values, which are more important in terms of safety.

In this paper, we propose a new model for event extraction that combines the power of MLNs and SVMs, dwarfing their limitations. The key idea is to reliably learn and process high-dimensional features using SVMs; encode the output of SVMs as low-dimensional, soft formulas in MLNs; and use the superior joint inferencing power of MLNs to enforce joint consistency constraints over the soft formulas.

While power-grid operators have to keep the production equal to demand, wind power depends on meteorological conditions. Therefore, the main issue of power-grid operators is to predict the wind production as precisely as possible. Our goal is to improve wind prediction accuracy based on the feedback of the relevant work on the subject. To this purpose, past power production and Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP) are used as input of a Gradient Boosting Tree algorithm. Our approach is to lay emphasis on the input data in order to extract as much knowledge as possible and remove as much error as possible from the source. Therefore, 20 days have been removed and additional values have been calculated to improve the algorithm accuracy. The novelty of our approach is in the constant retraining of the model to give the latest information available contrary to most studies, which use a fixed learning dataset. The idea is to combine the advantage of regression models and machine learning algorithms, which use large datasets, in order to learn the relationship between wind production, NWP, and date and time information. The whole methodology helps the model anticipate error of wind prediction and seasonal trends so that the overall prediction accuracy increases by 17% compared to the persistance approach.

We focus exclusively on dynamic analysis of runtime behavior to provide a clean point of comparison that is dual to static approaches. Specific challenges in the use of dynamic analysis on Android are the limited information gained from tracking low-level events and the imperfect coverage when testing apps, e.g., due to inactive command and control servers. We observe that on Android, pure system calls do not carry enough semantic content for classification and instead rely on lightweight virtual machine introspection to also reconstruct Android-level inter-process communication. To address the sparsity of data resulting from low coverage, we introduce a novel classification method that fuses Support Vector Machines with Conformal Prediction to generate high-accuracy prediction sets where the information is insufficient to pinpoint a single family.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SPW.2016.25", "venue": "2016 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW)", "journal": "2016 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2487124337,3007795975", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14242198", "872430", "52874011", "15546924", "16538162", "9270162", "206556577", "53904563", "18106970", "7566679", "15874442", "26274173", "59718844", "57961414", "10890306", "6345218", "10659969", "56563878", "383749", "11532932", "14454728", "18628064", "14617835", "1680772", "62519887", "2559966", "2242259", "17968887", "16674382", "206578712"], "inbound_citations": ["155107165", "4235502", "4605457", "211038151", "155106044", "67871528", "4660811", "51923104", "24153418", "214764775", "10516868", "69573660", "181325110", "46756541", "22499525", "53871551", "2052057", "174817565", "3927386", "12314330", "59449397", "198976176", "54452235", "86441370", "30181685", "201622536", "9221492", "211297986", "53246240", "52838507", "145813625", "11084808", "201882096", "13753322", "3355912", "195774727", "182179063", "211551146", "49905199", "3342683", "3499678", "54796587", "211222746", "198162716", "210715225", "7295923", "2560441", "8838479", "208277550", "204864016", "54092966", "198930636", "65224905"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206581409"}

The latest statistics from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) showed that USA, Japan, Germany, China, and South Korea are among the top patent filing countries [1] . WIPO data indicate that these countries and their global companies are directing significant resources toward engineering innovations, design inventions, and technology R&D. The end result will be to capitalize their intellectual assets for competitive advantage. The huge and ever growing data and knowledge content of international patent (cyber-) depositories creates great challenges for engineers, researchers, and technology strategists to fully utilize the wealth of knowledge [2] . Most critically, engineers must make correct R&D decisions based on the complex sets of patent information. This special issue features research papers focusing on the advances of representing, modeling, reasoning, analyzing, and synthesizing knowledge related to innovations, intellectual property (IP), patents, and technology adoptions.

However, in practice we often encounter biological or clinical data whose class distribution is highly skewed. Since standard supervised learning algorithms intend to maximize the overall prediction accuracy, a prediction model tends to show a strong bias toward the majority class when it is trained on such imbalanced data. Therefore, the class distribution should be incorporated appropriately to learn from imbalanced data. To address this practically important problem, we proposed balanced gradient boosting (BalaBoost) which reformulates gradient boosting to avoid the overfitting to the majority class and is sensitive to the minority class by making use of the equal class distribution instead of the empirical class distribution. We applied BalaBoost to cancer tissue diagnosis based on miRNA expression data, premature death prediction for diabetes patients based on biochemical and clinical variables and tumor grade prediction of renal cell carcinoma based on tumor marker expressions whose class distribution is highly skewed. Experimental results showed that BalaBoost outperformed the representative supervised learning algorithms, i.e., gradient boosting, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine.

To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Gabor features, we perform subword recognition for off-line Arabic handwritten images using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We also compare the recognition performance with other binarization based features which have been proven to be effective in capturing shape characteristics of handwritten Arabic subwords, such as GSC (a set of gradient, structure, and concavity features) and skeleton based Graph features. Our preliminary experimental results show that Gabor features outperform Graph features and are slightly better than GSC features for Arabic subword recognition. In addition, by combining Gabor and GSC features, we obtain a significant reduction in classification error rate over using GSC or Gabor features alone.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1815330.1815337", "venue": "DAS '10", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2015591846", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207165665", "961425", "2822115", "62428799", "3851757", "12416536", "667074", "33411226", "916460", "7135076", "17374833", "28637672", "45957412"], "inbound_citations": ["9559305", "4702745", "8196227", "9364131", "29355713", "12752916", "1501737", "9034090", "665101", "34106491", "16939224", "42943242", "2862278", "3345739", "15562188", "18255109", "29690283", "52933748", "46805260", "8260739", "4392255", "38114314", "1656872", "11496852", "4764840", "31133637", "11698933", "26586192"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:685085"}

However, one of the challenges towards widespread utilisation of such service is maintaining the security of those portals. Recent reports show an alarming increase in cyber-attacks using crawlers. These software programs crawl web pages and are capable of executing various commands such as attacking web servers, cracking passwords, harvesting users\u2019 personal information, and testing the vulnerability of servers. The aim of this research is to develop a new effective model for detecting malicious crawlers based on their navigational behavior using machine-learning techniques. Method In this research, different methods of crawler detection were investigated. Log files of a sample of compromised patients\u2019 portals were analysed and the best features for the detection of crawlers were extracted. Then after testing and comparing several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Network and Decision Tree, the best model was developed using the most appropriate features and its accuracy was evaluated. Results Our analysis showed the SVM-based models can yield higher accuracy (f-measure = 0.97) comparing to Bayesian Network (f-measure = 0.88) and Decision Tree (f-measure = 0.95) for detecting malicious crawlers. However, extracting proper features can increase the performance of the SVM (f-measure = 0.98), the Bayesian network (f-measure = 0.94) and the Decision Tree (f-measure = 0.96) and artificial neural network (ANN) (f-measure = 0.92). Conclusion Security concerns are among the potential barriers to widespread utilisation of patient portals. Machine learning algorithms can be accurately used to detect malicious crawlers and enhance the security of sensitive patients\u2019 information. Selecting appropriate features for the development of these algorithms can remarkably increase their accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31606554", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.103976", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "mag_id": "2976723358", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204038006"}

It has become a good choice for machine learning both for supervised and unsupervised learning purposes. The SVM is primarily based on the mapping the data to a hyperplane using some kernel function and then increasing the margin between the hype planes so this hyperplane classifies the data in the normal and fault state. Due to large amount of input data, it is computationally cumbersome to yield the desired results in shortest possible time by using SVM. To overcome this difficulty in this work, we have employed statistical Time-Domain Features like Root Mean Square (RMS), Variance, Skewness and Kurtosis as pre-processors to the input raw data. Then various combinations of these time-domains signals and features have been used as inputs and their effects on the optimal model selection have been investigated thoroughly and optimal one has been suggested. The procedure presented here is computational less expensive otherwise to process the input data for model selection we may have to use super computer. The implementation of proposed method for machine learning is not much complicated and by using this procedure, an impending fault/abnormal behavior of the machine can be detected beforehand.Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2008-49772", "venue": "Volume 3: 28th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Parts A and B", "journal": "Volume 3: 28th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Parts A and B", "mag_id": "2092521589", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110518881"}

As explained in [5], PTTP is an efficient realisation of the Model Elimination (ME) calculus [2] that utilises five extensions of standard Prolog: ::: ::: 1. It uses a sound unification algorithm with the occur-check; ::: ::: 2. It uses a complete search strategy based on iterative-deepening; ::: ::: 3. It adds contrapositives of the clauses in the theory in order to provide entry points for all of the literals in those clauses; ::: ::: 4. It uses ancestor resolution when unfolding the query in order to overcome the incompleteness of Prolog's SLD resolution; ::: ::: 5. It adds contrapositives for the negation of the query in order to extract indefinite answers from successful computations. ::: ::: Although it is equipped for full clausal reasoning, PTTP has been tailored to some notable Horn clause applications by removing those features deemed unnecessary in the Horn case.

In this paper, we introduce novel approximations of the primal and dual SWD. Instead of using a large number of random projections, as it is done by conventional SWD approximation methods, we propose to approximate SWDs with a small number of parameterized orthogonal projections in an end-to-end deep learning fashion. As concrete applications of our SWD approximations, we design two types of differentiable SWD blocks to equip modern generative frameworks---Auto-Encoders (AE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

In this way, the extracted features are more discriminative for the recognition tasks. Our approach benefits from a recent discovery on the closed-form solutions to noiseless LatLRR.

The unique ecological features of its marine life make it particularly vulnerable to the multiple effects of climate change. A network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has started to be implemented in the SO to protect marine ecosystems. However, considering future predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the relevance of current, static, MPAs may be questioned under future scenarios. In this context, the ecoregionalization approach can prove promising in identifying well-delimited regions of common species composition and environmental settings. These so-called ecoregions are expected to show similar biotic responses to environmental changes and can be used to define priority areas for the designation of new MPAs and the update of their current delimitation. In the present work, a benthic ecoregionalization of the entire SO is proposed for the first time based on abiotic environmental parameters and the distribution of echinoid fauna, a diversified and common member of Antarctic benthic ecosystems. A novel two-step approach was developed combining species distribution modelling with Random Forest and Gaussian Mixture modelling from species probabilities to define current ecoregions and predict future ecoregions under IPCC scenarios RCP 4.5 and 8.5. The ecological representativity of current and proposed MPAs of the SO are discussed with regards to the modeled benthic ecoregions.

The SVM is a set of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, the SVM algorithm builds a model that predicts the class of new unseen examples. This algorithm is considered essential in both machine-learning and data-mining curriculums and is frequently used by practitioners. Besides, its utilization spans to a wide variety of applied research fields such as computer vision, neuroscience, text categorization, and finance. The success of SVMs solving classification tasks in a wide variety of fields, such as text or image processing and medical informatics, has stimulated practitioners to do research on the execution performance and scalability of the training phase of serial versions of the algorithm. Nevertheless, the training phase of the SVM remains a computationally expensive task, and the training time of a binary problem composed by 100,000 points with hundreds of dimensions can often take on the order of hours of serial execution. This study shows that the GPU implementation of the dual form of the SVM using the sequential minimal optimization algorithm leads to performance improvements of an order of magnitude in both training and classification. Finally, a technique that coordinates multiple GPUs to solve even larger classification problems is also presented in the chapter.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-384988-5.00020-6", "venue": "GPU Computing Gems Emerald Edition", "journal": "GPU Computing Gems Emerald Edition", "mag_id": "2234982790", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57043475"}

In this scenario, due to the lack of degrees of freedom, one cannot extract perfectly the desired source even in the noiseless case. However, the Bounded Component Analysis of the error can be used to obtain a linear estimate of the target signal while cancelling as many as possible of the interfering sources, what it will be referred as a Partial Zero Forcing criterion. An application of the technique is presented in wireless communications scenarios dominated by the interference. The Bounded Component Analysis of the error is used as a preprocessing for the received observations which simplifies the structure of the interference and noise in the linear estimate.

However, vibration signals are usually with abundant noise and characterized as nonlinearity and nonstationarity. Therefore, it is quite challenging to extract robust and useful fault features from complex vibration signals to achieve an accurate and reliable diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel feature representation learning approach, named stacked multilevel-denoising autoencoders (SMLDAEs), with the aim to learn robust and discriminative fault feature representations through a deep network architecture for diagnosis accuracy improvement. In our proposed approach, we design an MLD training scheme, which uses multiple noise levels to train AEs. It enables to learn more general and detailed fault feature patterns simultaneously at different scales from the complex frequency spectra of the raw vibration data, and therefore helps enhance the feature learning and fault diagnosis capability.

Then, ensemble learning algorithms, i.e. gradient boosting (GB) and bagging, are introduced to combine learners to boost model performance. Based on the learned convex models of power flow, optimal power flow (OPF) is formulated as a convex quadratic programming problem.

As a result, they typically trigger hundreds to thousands of false alarms per patient per day - drowning the important alarms in noise and adding to the exhaustion of clinical staff.

This technique is especially useful in orographically complex regions, where large differences can be found between the NWP elevation model and the true orography. This study carries out a comparison of linear and non-linear MOS methods, aimed at the prediction of minimum temperatures in a fruit-growing region of the Italian Alps, based on the output of two different NWPs (ECMWF T511\u2013L60 and LAMI-3). Temperature, of course, is a particularly important NWP output; among other roles it drives the local frost forecast, which is of great interest to agriculture. The mechanisms of cold air drainage, a distinctive aspect of mountain environments, are often unsatisfactorily captured by global circulation models. The simplest post-processing technique applied in this work was a correction for the mean bias, assessed at individual model grid points. We also implemented a multivariate linear regression on the output at the grid points surrounding the target area, and two non-linear models based on machine learning techniques: Neural Networks and Random Forest. We compare the performance of all these techniques on four different NWP data sets. Downscaling the temperatures clearly improved the temperature forecasts with respect to the raw NWP output, and also with respect to the basic mean bias correction. Multivariate methods generally yielded better results, but the advantage of using non-linear algorithms was small if not negligible. RF, the best performing method, was implemented on ECMWF prognostic output at 06:00 UTC over the 9 grid points surrounding the target area. Mean absolute errors in the prediction of 2 m temperature at 06:00 UTC were approximately 1.2\u00b0C, close to the natural variability inside the area itself.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/npg-14-211-2007", "venue": null, "journal": "Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1992442607", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["55531560", "121691397", "1088806", "62215743", "207738357", "89141", "60993494", "119781966", "17620381", "198120286", "1836349", "55480377", "14215320", "15330146", "208904765", "120639670", "53340979", "129672110", "131018015", "123108432", "15794392", "129593982", "109343240", "17224518", "53467936", "54571812", "124317076", "53459424"], "inbound_citations": ["54581209", "117237139", "54552103", "125730983", "210969412", "84180745", "13471034", "135430419", "120582989", "208224825", "58671856", "44240988", "55883576", "199405888", "59405934"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10055282"}

Affective Video Content Analysis (AVCA) attempts to generate a direct mapping between video content and the corresponding affective states such as arousal and valence dimensions. Most existing studies establish the mapping for each dimension separately using knowledge-based rules or traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). The inherent correlations between affective dimensions have largely been unexploited, which are anticipated to include important information for accurate prediction of affective dimensions. To address this issue, this paper presents an approach to predict arousal and valance dimensions synchronously using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The approach extracts a set of low-level audio and visual features from video data and projects them synchronously into pairs of arousal and valence values using the LSTM network which automatically incorporates the correlations between arousal and valance dimensions.

Automation of this business process on registering post mailing will significantly reduce expenses of postal service on mail delivery.There are two main approaches to handwriting recognition, namely hidden Markov models (HMM) and artificial neural networks (ANN).

The first model is based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) [1] for feature extraction and a fully connected multilayer perceptron (fully connected MLP) for word classification.

AHE can cause fainting or shock suddenly, leading to irreversibility organ damage, and even death. Therefore, forecasting of occurrence of AHE is of practical value. However, the prediction of clinical AHE largely depends on the doctors\u2019 experience, which cannot guarantee the high rate of success. It is thus very meaningful for the clinical care to use appropriate methods to predict the AHE with an automatic and reliable method. In this study, a Probability Distribution Patterns Analysis (PDPA) method is presented to solve the time series prediction problem of AHE. In the first phase, the features are extracted from the PDPA in the global and integral time series, and the partial local time series in the fixed time window. In the second phase, the proposed algorithm combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), namely GA-SVM is adopted to select the vital features for the effective classification. In order to demonstrate the generality of our method, we also conduct experiments on a classical time series problem-Control Chart Patterns (CCPs) multi-class time series, which is a benchmark problem in the process control. For CCPs problem, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several traditional methods. The obtained accuracy is 98.65%, which is superior to listed previous works using the same CCPs model. For AHE classification and forecasting, the methodology is applied in two data sets, a small data set (37 records) and a big one (2892 records). The test accuracy of 89.19%, sensitivity of 91.67%, specificity of 88% in the small data set, and a test accuracy of 80.76%, sensitivity of 78.19%, specificity of 81.51% in the big data set are achieved with the classification model.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2017.03.030", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2595924818", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7462377", "122966410", "17026173", "24629869", "2467290", "44346307", "1194240", "2968973", "44526536", "41499637", "40281808", "201909297", "43281026", "39743899", "14681288", "3940995", "206787478", "2702042", "8797625", "29717741", "2298777", "17235105", "113097521", "136833880", "114995537", "124495032"], "inbound_citations": ["208602679", "88493947"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57353145"}

It aims to use those methods to achieve a logical understanding of students, and the educational environment they should have for better learning. ::: These data are characterized by their large size and randomness and this can make it difficult for educators to extract knowledge from these data. Additionally, knowledge extracted from data by means of counting the occurrence of certain events is not always reliable, since the counting process sometimes does not take into consideration other factors and parameters that could affect the extracted knowledge. ::: Student attendance in Higher Education has always been dealt with in a classical way, i.e. educators rely on counting the occurrence of attendance or absence building their knowledge about students as well as modules based on this count. This method is neither credible nor does it necessarily provide a real indication of a student s performance. ::: On other hand, the choice of an effective student assessment method is an issue of interest in Higher Education. Various studies (Romero, et al., 2010) have shown that students tend to get higher marks when assessed through coursework-based assessment methods - which include either modules that are fully assessed through coursework or a mixture of coursework and examinations than assessed by examination alone. There are a large number of Educational Data Mining (EDM) studies that pre-processed data through the conventional Data Mining processes including the data preparation process, but they are using transcript data as it stands without looking at examination and coursework results weighting which could affect prediction accuracy. ::: This thesis explores the above problems and tries to formulate the extracted knowledge in a way that guarantees achieving accurate and credible results. Student attendance data, gathered from the educational system, were first cleaned in order to remove any randomness and noise, then various attributes were studied so as to highlight the most significant ones that affect the real attendance of students. The next step was to derive an equation that measures the Student Attendance s Credibility (SAC) considering the attributes chosen in the previous step. The reliability of the newly developed measure was then evaluated in order to examine its consistency. ::: In term of transcripts data, this thesis proposes a different data preparation process through investigating more than 230,000 student records in order to prepare students marks based on the assessment methods of enrolled modules. The data have been processed through different stages in order to extract a categorical factor through which students module marks are refined during the data preparation process. The results of this work show that students final marks should not be isolated from the nature of the enrolled module s assessment methods; rather they must be investigated thoroughly and considered during EDM s data pre-processing phases. More generally, it is concluded that Educational Data should not be prepared in the same way as exist data due to the differences such as sources of data, applications, and types of errors in them. Therefore, an attribute, Coursework Assessment Ratio (CAR), is proposed to use in order to take the different modules assessment methods into account while preparing student transcript data. ::: The effect of CAR and SAC on prediction process using data mining classification techniques such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks and k-Nears Neighbors have been investigated. The results were generated by applying the DM techniques on our data set and evaluated by measuring the statistical differences between Classification Accuracy (CA) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of all models. Comprehensive evaluation has been carried out for all results in the experiments to compare all DM techniques results, and it has been found that Random forest (RF) has the highest CA and lowest RMSE. The importance of SAC and CAR in increasing the prediction accuracy has been proved in Chapter 5. ::: Finally, the results have been compared with previous studies that predicted students final marks, based on students marks at earlier stages of their study. The comparisons have taken into consideration similar data and attributes, whilst first excluding average CAR and SAC and secondly by including them, and then measuring the prediction accuracy between both. The aim of this comparison is to ensure that the new preparation process stage will positively affect the final results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2909144422", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67953615"}

In this study, first, a whole-genome in silico approach was used to accurately demarcate B. pumilus group strains, as a case of highly phylogenetically related taxa, at the species level. In order to achieve that and consequently to validate or correct taxonomic identities of genomes in public databases, an average nucleotide identity correlation, a core-based phylogenomic and a gene function repertory analyses were performed. Eventually, more than 50% such genomes were found to be misclassified. Hierarchical clustering of gene functional repertoires was also used to infer ecotypes among B. pumilus group species. Furthermore, for the first time the machine-learning algorithm Random Forest was used to rank genes in order of their importance for species classification. We found that ybbP, a gene involved in the synthesis of cyclic di-AMP, was the most important gene for accurately predicting species identity among B. pumilus group strains.

We address the vision problems of shape matching, shape-based mining of objects in arbitrary image collections, context-aware object recognition, monocular estimation of 3D object poses, and monocular 3D scene reconstruction using shape from texture. Our work on shape-based object discovery is the first to show that meaningful objects can be extracted from a collection of arbitrary images, without any human supervision, by shape matching. We also show that a spatial repetition of objects in images (e.g., windows on a building facade, or cars lined up along a street) can be used for 3D scene reconstruction from a single image.

Support vector regression (SVR) employing an isotropic Gaussian kernel has been widely used for such tasks; this kernel has one tunable hyperparameter that can be optimized (along with the penalty constant C) using a standard procedure that involves a parameter grid search combined with cross-validation. The isotropic kernel however suffers from limited expressiveness, and might provide inadequate predictive accuracy for nonlinear mappings that involve multiple tunable input variables. The present study shows that Bayesian support vector regression using the inherently more flexible Gaussian kernel with automatic relevance determination (ARD) is eminently suitable for highly non-linear modeling tasks, such as the input reflection coefficient magnitude |S11| of broadband and ultrawideband antennas.

Mapping the distribution of oil palm is crucial in order to manage and plan the sustainable operations of oil palm plantations. Remote sensing provides a means to detect and map oil palm from space effectively. Recent advances in cloud computing and big data allow rapid mapping to be performed over large a geographical scale. In this study, 30 m Landsat 8 data were processed using a cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE) in order to classify oil palm land cover using non-parametric machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF) for the first time over Peninsular Malaysia. The hyperparameters were tuned, and the overall accuracy produced by the SVM, CART and RF were 93.16%, 80.08% and 86.50% respectively. Overall, the SVM classified the 7 classes (water, built-up, bare soil, forest, oil palm, other vegetation and paddy) the best. However, RF extracted oil palm information better than the SVM. The algorithms were compared and the McNemar's test showed significant values for comparisons between SVM and CART and RF and CART. On the other hand, the performance of SVM and RF are considered equally effective.

The popularity of tools for analyzing Technical Debt, and particularly that of SonarQube, is increasing rapidly. SonarQube proposes a set of coding rules, which represent something wrong in the code that will soon be reflected in a fault or will increase maintenance effort. However, while the management of some companies is encouraging developers not to violate these rules in the first place and to produce code below a certain technical debt threshold, developers are skeptical of their importance. Objective. In order to understand which SonarQube violations are actually fault-prone and to analyze the accuracy of the fault-prediction model, we designed and conducted an empirical study on 21 well-known mature open-source projects. Method. We applied the SZZ algorithm to label the fault-inducing commits. We compared the classification power of eight Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to obtain a set of violations that are correlated with fault-inducing commits. Finally, we calculated the percentage of violations introduced in the fault-inducing commit and removed in the fault-fixing commit, so as to reduce the risk of spurious correlations. Result. Among the 202 violations defined for Java by SonarQube, only 26 have a relatively low fault-proneness. Moreover, violations classified as ''bugs'' by SonarQube hardly never become a failure. Consequently, the accuracy of the fault-prediction power proposed by SonarQube is extremely low. Conclusion. The rules applied by SonarQube for calculating technical debt should be thoroughly investigated and their harmfulness needs to be further confirmed. Therefore, companies should carefully consider which rules they really need to apply, especially if their goal is to reduce fault-proneness.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.00376", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2954099065", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["215513889", "3788401", "207738357", "89141", "60993494", "4650265", "2017285", "202590023", "4656410", "4657132", "205437694", "13397760", "4716303", "25340249", "6644398", "7955044", "69923308", "15137276", "8842997", "52069846", "6992832", "47020958", "15897200", "37293464", "20707656", "18021677", "7506489", "16290255", "31931958", "61808633", "14467280", "4634301", "145013954", "3770261", "207144526", "63751177", "781715", "3527376", "14508603", "874102", "15164329", "7235454"], "inbound_citations": ["199405223", "199551804", "201112523"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195767293"}

These systems heavily rely on storing the sensitive biometric data on the cloud. Due to the fact that biometric data like fingerprint and iris cannot be changed, storing them on the cloud creates vulnerability and can potentially have catastrophic consequences if these data are leaked. In the recent years, in order to preserve the privacy of the users, homomorphic encryption has been used to enable computation on the encrypted data and to eliminate the need for decryption. This work presents DeepZeroID: a privacy-preserving cloud-based and multiple-party biometric verification system that uses homomorphic encryption. Via transfer learning, training on sensitive biometric data is eliminated and one pre-trained deep neural network is used as feature extractor. By developing an exhaustive search algorithm, this feature extractor is applied on the tasks of biometric verification and liveness detection. By eliminating the need for training on and decrypting the sensitive biometric data, this system preserves privacy, requires zero knowledge of the sensitive data distribution, and is highly scalable. Our experimental results show that DeepZeroID can deliver 95.47% F1 score in the verification of combined iris and fingerprint feature vectors with zero true positives and with a 100% accuracy in liveness detection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/computers8010003", "venue": "Computers", "journal": "Computers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2907462141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["43182186", "126235682", "2680650", "19120013", "12644173", "3823776", "3783028", "1632116", "26747831", "116310948", "2990900", "3826475", "16426272", "15095626", "53284403", "4634686", "5038071", "22374832", "6383532", "5024194", "4875829", "25755083", "9945228", "18378417", "53250337", "67846878", "2120593", "2649314", "18666561"], "inbound_citations": ["210930299", "204512545", "196831496", "204863212", "88495985", "207972942"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69287807"}

However, the performance of Reservoir Computing approach on hydrological time series remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the potential of ESN or Reservoir Computing for long-term prediction of lake water levels. Great Lakes water levels from 1918 to 2005 are used to develop and evaluate the ESN models. The forecast performance of the ESN-based models is compared with the results obtained from two benchmark models, the conventional recurrent neural network (RNN) and the Bayesian neural network (BNN). The test results indicate a strong ability of ESN models to provide improved lake level forecasts up to 10-month ahead \u2013 suggesting that the inherent structure and innovative learning approach of the ESN is suitable for hydrological time series modeling. Another particular advantage of ESN learning approach is that it simplifies the network training complexity and avoids the limitations inherent to the gradient descent optimization method. Overall, it is shown that the ESN can be a good alternative method for improved lake level forecasting, performing better than both the RNN and the BNN on the four selected Great Lakes time series, namely, the Lakes Erie, Huron-Michigan, Ontario, and Superior.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.11.027", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "1982201779", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["154459805", "32177219", "15547517", "10934157", "154061653", "128594118", "55571156", "12766236", "24901792", "53463984", "117813086", "20204469", "2222977", "73594226", "128833364", "109658306", "3027343", "20314126", "55721828", "140188927", "203605298", "3084636", "203650305", "134883763"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140578913"}

In order to utilize the supervised classification algorithms without consuming a lot of time for labeling data manually, a two step method which selects the training data automatically has been proposed in previous studies.

One crucial research issue in transfer learning is how to find a good representation for instances of different domains such that the divergence between domains can be reduced with the new representation. Recently, deep learning has been proposed to learn more robust or higher-level features for transfer learning. In this article, we adapt the autoencoder technique to transfer learning and propose a supervised representation learning method based on double encoding-layer autoencoder. The proposed framework consists of two encoding layers: one for embedding and the other one for label encoding. In the embedding layer, the distribution distance of the embedded instances between the source and target domains is minimized in terms of KL-Divergence. In the label encoding layer, label information of the source domain is encoded using a softmax regression model. Moreover, to empirically explore why the proposed framework can work well for transfer learning, we propose a new effective measure based on autoencoder to compute the distribution distance between different domains.

According to the Support Vector Regression (SVR), a new image watermarking detection algorithm against geometric attacks is proposed in this paper, in which the steady Pseudo-Zernike moments and Krawtchouk moments are utilized. The host image is firstly transformed from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and the Pseudo-Zernike moments of the host image are computed. Then some low-order Pseudo-Zernike moments are selected, and the digital watermark is embedded into the cover image by quantizing the magnitudes of the selected Pseudo-Zernike moments. The main steps of watermark detecting procedure include: (i) some low-order Krawtchouk moments of the image are calculated, which are taken as the eigenvectors; (ii) the geometric transformation parameters are regarded as the training objective, the appropriate kernel function is selected for training, and a SVR training model can be obtained; (iii) the Krawtchouk moments of test image are selected as input vector, the actual output (geometric transformation parameters) is predicted by using the well trained SVR, and the geometric correction is performed on the test image by using the obtained geometric transformation parameters; (iv) the digital watermark is extracted from the corrected test image.

Many existing methods either rely on hand-crafted features or perform rather slow as they treat the problem as a pixel-level assignment problem. In order to create a feasible method for real applications, we propose to use superpixels as basic units of segmentation, and features are learned directly from pixels. An image is first oversegmented into superpixels with the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm. Then, each superpixel is represented by the features of its central pixel. The features are learned from pixel intensity values with stacked convolutional autoencoders in an unsupervised manner. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify superpixels into four classes: periphery, background, text block, and decoration.

This paper focuses on using machine learning methods to explain driver-injury severity in run-off-roadway and rollover types of accidents. A Random Forest (RF)-classification tree (CART) approach is used to select the relevant categorical variables (driver, vehicle, infrastructure, and environmental factors) to obtain models that classify, explain, and predict the severity of such accidents with good accuracy. A support vector machine and binomial logit models were applied in order to contrast the variable importance ranking and the performance analysis, and the results are convergent with the RF+CART approach (more than 70% accuracy).

As many fungal species cannot be cultured, morphological identification of those species is almost impossible. But, DNA barcoding technique can be employed for identification of such species.

Though the computational prediction of fungal species has become feasible with the availability of huge volume of barcode sequences in public domain, prediction of fungal species is challenging due to high degree of variability among ITS regions within species. A Random Forest (RF)-based predictor was built for identification of unknown fungal species. The reference and query sequences were mapped onto numeric features based on gapped base pair compositions, and then used as training and test sets respectively for prediction of fungal species using RF. More than 85% accuracy was found when 4 sequences per species in the reference set were utilized; whereas it was seen to be stabilized at ~88% if \u22657 sequence per species in the reference set were used for training of the model.

Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) is one of the fastest neural network architectures given its ability to produce neurons on demand to represent new classification categories. FAM can adapt to the input data without having to specify an arbitrary structure. However, FAM is vulnerable to noisy data which can rapidly degrade network performance. Due to its fast learning features, FAM is sensitive to the sequence of input sample presentations. In this paper we propose a parallel and distributed approach to ensemble learning for FAM networks as a means to improve the over-all performance of the classifier and increase its resilience to noisy data. We use the multi-agent platform to distribute the computational load of the ensemble to several hosts.

Therefore, there is a clear need for research and development on data driven methodologies and condition monitoring techniques which are able to achieve fast, reliable and high-quality diagnosis in an automatic manner. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis approach integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed, consisting of three main stages. Firstly, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is employed in order to obtain pre-processed representations of raw vibration signals. Secondly, a CNN with a square pooling architecture is constructed to extract high-level features.

An important phenomenon that draws the attention of analysis is the emergence of communities in these networks. The understanding and identifying communities in these networks is challenging and has gained much importance these days. There are many approaches suggested to identify communities in social networks, and most of them are time consuming when implemented or need some important user-input parameters. In this paper, a new label propagation algorithm named CILPA (Cohesion Index based Label Propagation Algorithm) is proposed. The algorithm brings in two new functions, called Cohesion Similarity (CoSim) and Cohesion Index (CI). The cohesion index function measures cohesiveness of nodes and similarity with neighbor nodes is measured using cohesion similarity. Cohesion index as the base, we propose a new label propagation algorithm with precise node update sequence and node priority. Prior information about the number of communities is not required in our algorithm and the results show that the quality of communities obtained by CILPA are very stable and better than those detected by original LPA. Results of experiments conducted on real world networks demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and indicate that cohesion index calculation of nodes improves the accuracy and CILPA is an efficient method for unveiling communities in complex social networks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s41870-018-0190-4", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Information Technology", "mag_id": "2800510370", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4037619"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67458285"}

However, existing expert based identification algorithms often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false positive rate. Materials and methods We propose a data informed framework for identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR via feature engineering and machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including k-Nearest-Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed EHR repository ranging from 2012 to 2014. Results We apply top-performing machine learning algorithms on the engineered features. We benchmark and contrast the accuracy, precision, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of classification models against the state-of-the-art expert algorithm for identification of T2DM subjects. Our results indicate that the framework achieved high identification performances (\u223c0.98 in average AUC), which are much higher than the state-of-the-art algorithm (0.71 in AUC). Discussion Expert algorithm-based identification of T2DM subjects from EHR is often hampered by the high missing rates due to their conservative selection criteria. Our framework leverages machine learning and feature engineering to loosen such selection criteria to achieve a high identification rate of cases and controls.

Modern healthcare is getting reshaped by growing Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Recently, these records have been shown of great value towards building clinical prediction models. In EMR data, patients' diseases and hospital interventions are captured through a set of diagnoses and procedures codes. These codes are usually represented in a tree form (e.g. ICD-10 tree) and the codes within a tree branch may be highly correlated. These codes can be used as features to build a prediction model and an appropriate feature selection can inform a clinician about important risk factors for a disease. Traditional feature selection methods (e.g. Information Gain, T-test, etc.) consider each variable independently and usually end up having a long feature list. Recently, Lasso and related l 1 -penalty based feature selection methods have become popular due to their joint feature selection property. However, Lasso is known to have problems of selecting one feature of many correlated features randomly. This hinders the clinicians to arrive at a stable feature set, which is crucial for clinical decision making process. In this paper, we solve this problem by using a recently proposed Tree-Lasso model. Since, the stability behavior of Tree-Lasso is not well understood, we study the stability behavior of Tree-Lasso and compare it with other feature selection methods. Using a synthetic and two real-world datasets (Cancer and Acute Myocardial Infarction), we show that Tree-Lasso based feature selection is significantly more stable than Lasso and comparable to other methods e.g. Information Gain, ReliefF and T-test. We further show that, using different types of classifiers such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines, decision trees and Random Forest, the classification performance of Tree-Lasso is comparable to Lasso and better than other methods.

Most of these methods depend on pairwise aligned MR and CT training images of the same patient, which are difficult to obtain. 2D cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (2D-cGAN) have been explored before for generating synthetic CTs from MR images but the results are not satisfied due to spatial inconsistency. There exists attempt to develop 3D cycle GAN (3D-cGAN) for image translation but its training requires large number of data which may not be always available. In this paper, we introduce two novel mechanisms to address above mentioned problems. First, we introduce a hybrid GAN (hGAN) consisting of a 3D generator network and a 2D discriminator network for deep MR to CT synthesis using unpaired data. We use 3D fully convolutional networks to form the generator, which can better model the 3D spatial information and thus could solve the discontinuity problem across slices. Second, we take the results generated from the 2D-cGAN as weak labels, which will be used together with an adversarial training strategy to encourage the generator\u2019s 3D output to look like a stack of real CT slices as much as possible.

Mandibular Movement (MM) signals are closely associated with diaphragmatic effort during sleep. Objective: We aimed at reliably detecting obstructive off central hypopneas events using MM statistical characteristics. Methods: A bio-signal learning approach was implemented whereby raw MM fragments corresponding to normal breathing (NPB; n = 501), central (n = 263), and obstructive hypopneas (n = 1861) were collected from 28 consecutive patients (mean age = 54 years, mean AHI = 34.7 n/h) undergoing in-lab polysomnography (PSG) coupled with a MM magnetometer, and OeP recordings. Twenty three input features were extracted from raw data fragments to explore distinctive changes in MM signals. A Random Forest model was built upon those input features to classify the central and obstructive hypopnea events. External validation and interpretive analysis were performed to evaluate the model's performance and the contribution of each feature to the model's output. Results: Obstructive hypopneas were characterized by a longer duration (21.9 vs. 17.8 s, p < 10-6), more extreme low values (p < 10-6), a more negative trend reflecting mouth opening amplitude, wider variation, and the asymmetrical distribution of MM amplitude. External validation showed a reliable performance of the MM features-based classification rule (Kappa coefficient = 0.879 and a balanced accuracy of 0.872). The interpretive analysis revealed that event duration, lower percentiles, central tendency, and the trend of MM amplitude were the most important determinants of events. Conclusions: MM signals can be used as surrogate markers of OeP to differentiate obstructive from central hypopneas during sleep.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6701450", "pubmed_id": "31456731", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2019.00828", "venue": "Front.

More precisely, the method explicitly identifies those protein mentions in text that refer to their potential TF functions. The prediction features are engineered from the results of shallow parsing and domain-specific processing (recognition of relevant appearing in phrases) and a phrase-based Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is used to capture the content and context information of candidate entities. The proposed approach for the identification of TF mentions has been tested on a set of evidence sentences from the TRANSFAC and FlyTF databases. It achieved an F-measure of around 51.5% with a precision of 62.5% using 5-fold cross-validation evaluation. The experimental results suggest that the phrase-based CRF model benefits from the flexibility to use correlated domain-specific features that describe the dependencies between TFs and other entities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first attempts to apply text-mining techniques to the task of assigning semantic roles to protein mentions.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19364541", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2009.04.001", "venue": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2017785968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6300142", "17052248", "34571587", "9603780", "8924947", "7000864", "3189010", "1119948", "14067186", "14578271", "2668789", "15302893", "12880854", "11375867", "1554697", "33755705", "2243960", "17690183", "277918", "11664683", "13936575", "206592413", "38078518", "9740396", "1995140", "62635412", "445090", "12228376", "14306830", "7115955", "6534012", "42481186", "7380336", "9483510", "15752876", "14403648", "1866450"], "inbound_citations": ["14253481", "215025075", "3047119", "6425084"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14772468"}

We investigate several methods of combining acoustic scores from the multiple models, including maximum-likelihood estimation of the weights of different acoustic models from training data, as well as using confidence score of -value or relative entropy to obtain the weights dynamically from online data. Since computing acoustic scores from the multiple models slows down decoding search, we propose clustering methods to compact the RF-generated acoustic models. The conventional concept of PDT-based state tying is extended to RF-based state tying. On each RF tied state, we cluster the Gaussian density functions (GDFs) from multiple acoustic models into classes and compute a prototype for each class to represent the original GDFs. In this way, the number of GDFs in each RF tied state is decreased greatly, which significantly reduces the time for computing acoustic scores.

But previous studies on MRI images were not effective enough. According to the remarkable performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) in medical domain, we hypothesized that a deep learning algorithm can achieve high accuracy in distinguishing the World Health Organization (WHO) low grade and high grade gliomas. Methods: One hundred and thirteen glioma patients were retrospectively included. Tumor images were segmented with a rectangular region of interest (ROI), which contained about 80% of the tumor. Then, 20% data were randomly selected and leaved out at patient-level as test dataset. AlexNet and GoogLeNet were both trained from scratch and fine-tuned from models that pre-trained on the large scale natural image database, ImageNet, to magnetic resonance images. The classification task was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation (CV) on patient-level split. Results: The performance measures, including validation accuracy, test accuracy and test area under curve (AUC), averaged from five-fold CV of GoogLeNet which trained from scratch were 0.867, 0.909 and 0.939, respectively. With transfer learning and fine-tuning, better performances were obtained for both AlexNet and GoogLeNet, especially for AlexNet. Meanwhile, GoogLeNet performed better than AlexNet no matter trained from scratch or learned from pre-trained model.

Most of the neural models applied in this study are defined within the framework of unsupervised learning. They are based on Exploratory Projection Pursuit, Topology Preserving Maps and Curvilinear Component Analysis. Two interesting real data sets are analyzed to empirically probe the robustness of these models. The first case study describes information from a significant sample of Spanish multinational enterprises (MNEs). It analyses data pertaining to such aspects as decisions over the location of subsidiary enterprises in various regions across the world, the importance accorded to such decisions and the driving forces behind them. Through a projection-based analysis, this study reveals a range of different reasons underlying the internationalization strategies of Spanish MNEs and the different goals they pursue. It may be concluded that projection connectionist techniques are of immense assistance in the process of identifying the internationalization strategies of Spanish MNEs, their underlying motives and the goals they pursue. The second case study covers several risk categories that include task policy, security, and political stability among others, and it tracks the scores of different countries all over the world.

This thesis focuses on the creation of an intelligent navigation system for oil palm plantations. For the successful creation of the system, an object detection system to detect tree trunks, a path planner to calculate the optimum path to the tree and a trajectory controller to accurately move along the path was necessary. A robot rover was designed and built to test the created system, and novelties were presented in the object detection as well as the trajectory control systems to tackle the difficulties faced due to the plantation environment. ::: ::: A novel tree trunk detection algorithm was proposed for object detection, focusing on oil palm trees in the plantation, as they were the key objects of interest. The algorithm used the Viola and Jones detector with a proposed pre-processing method along with depth information to tackle the issue of high false positive rates when the Viola and Jones detector was used on its own. The pre-processing method used colour space combination and segmentation to eliminate the ground not covered by trees and fed the resulting image into a cascade detector. The method had better performance when compared to both Neural Network and Support Vector Machine based detectors with a detection rate of 91.7% and had the lowest false acceptance rate overall, as well as a 97.8% detection rate during real time testing with the use of the robot, proving its high accuracy. Depth information obtained via the Microsoft KINECT sensor, resulted in a 100% detection rate of tree trunks within the sensor\u2019s range during low light conditions. ::: ::: The nearest detected tree as well as the distance to it was obtained and marked as the goal point, while the surrounding obstacles were detected via ultrasonic sensors. This information was then passed onto the path planning system, created by a modified D*lite algorithm, to plan an optimal path to the tree trunk from the robot\u2019s current position. ::: ::: The trajectory control system was based on the Enhanced Self Organizing Incremental Neural Network (ESOINN), which was able to produce exceptional trajectory control without the use of a kinematic / dynamic model of the robot while consistently reducing errors during incremental learning. However, the ESOINN was only capable of discrete outputs, which limited the motions capable by the robot. A novel incremental unsupervised learning algorithm that is capable of producing continuous outputs, called IDW-ESOINN, was proposed by incorporating an interpolation method known as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to extract outputs from three of the nearest nodes to the data point and combining them based on their distance to the data. The method also led to the creation of virtual nodes that enabled more nodes to be produced in empty areas during the next stage of incremental learning. The IDW-ESOINN had a higher performance accuracy than the original ESOINN as well as the Kalman filter method in simulated path following tests, with a consistently low RMSE, while having the lowest RMSE 60% of the time when compared with the other two methods. In real-time testing, the IDW-ESOINN outperformed the original ESOINN again, proving its functionality. ::: ::: Based on the results obtained via the various tests done, it can be concluded that the created navigation system had a high level of performance, which could lead to fully autonomous robots being used in oil palm plantations one step closer to realisation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2932469083", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131945372"}

In this paper, the problem of predicting automobile drivers' stress levels, as experienced during actual driving, is investigated through the application of five different data mining algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

How to effectively extend it for multi-class classification is still an on-going research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a multi-class classifier by combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multi-class SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for two such \u201call-together\u201d methods: [25], [27] and [7]. We then compare their performance with three methods based on binary classifications: \u201cone-against-all,\u201d \u201cone-against-one,\u201d and DAGSVM [23]. Our experiments indicate that the \u201cone-against-one\u201d and DAG methods are more suitable for practical use than the other methods. Results also show that for large problems methods by considering all data at once in general need fewer support vectors.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id":

The task is relevant for several application domains. This paper presents an empirical study of decision tree approaches to HMC in the area of functional genomics. We compare learning a single HMC tree (which makes predictions for all classes together) to learning a set of regular classification trees (one for each class). Interestingly, on all 12 datasets we use, the HMC tree wins on all fronts: it is faster to learn and to apply, easier to interpret, and has similar or better predictive performance than the set of regular trees. It turns out that HMC tree learning is more robust to overfitting than regular tree learning.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11871637_7", "venue": "PKDD", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768998191,1554219991", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13227504", "14561609", "60993494"], "inbound_citations": ["6104561", "11294398", "13536304", "2550739", "3210288", "145030809", "206759540", "14985659", "23190278", "7268417", "22998", "31718176", "207113055", "8727032", "17471451", "14561609", "15277357", "37237148", "16736428", "15417911", "15195415", "9539978", "199565952", "4438320", "8207735", "950252", "15612160", "9579531", "9579531", "126299390", "215230341", "14263333", "8985601", "5603511", "53745664", "3686468", "53745543", "1873653", "5352219", "17711661", "2721915", "18865766", "9554722", "18215664", "8185068", "45659856", "18261599", "14589084", "44059718", "207775525", "10297002", "53019177", "15144827", "7692424", "1847933", "52215564", "13856501", "18111582", "14189168", "13357496", "24591140", "46879553", "12382643", "7667298", "16329544", "55378484", "52148122", "15342326", "2165021", "7036557", "6929287", "3199880", "58821999", "16367839", "18685011", "1086682", "15507213", "19006577", "27788920", "12674592", "12640991", "15762903", "41399840", "15474559", "207995741", "12824453", "4256044", "7802133"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14561609"}

A crucial decision to take when performing it is which observation window to use, this is, to decide the time period in the past that will be taken into account in order to accurately predict. Currently, this decision is a highly manual process, dependent on expert knowledge. To alleviate this problem, we propose the usage of a customized genetic algorithm alongside a machine learning technique, random forests, which optimizes a novel, multiple observation window schemes that allows for more modeling complexity than other schemes present on the literature. We validate it using ten different events extracted from two real, industrial data sets: one from a high performance computing environment and one from a computer network.

However, prior research has shown that the representations computed by OMP may be of inferior quality, as they deliver suboptimal classification accuracy on several image datasets. We have found that this problem is caused by OMP's relatively weak stability under data variations, which leads to unreliability in supervised classifier training. We show that by imposing a simple nonnegativity constraint, this nonnegative variant of OMP (NOMP) can mitigate OMP's stability issue and is resistant to noise overfitting. In this work, we provide extensive analysis and experimental results to examine and validate the stability advantage of NOMP. In our experiments, we use a multi-layer deep architecture for representation learning, where we use K-means for feature learning and NOMP for representation encoding. The resulting learning framework is not only efficient and scalable to large feature dictionaries, but also is robust against input noise.

Due to the scarcity of meaningful vocabulary and the persistence of domain-related data, the buying and selling of previously owned domain names, also known as the domain aftermarket, has evolved into a billion dollar industry. Each day over a 100,000 domain names expire and become available for re-registration. Manual appraisal is impossible at such a volume; thus a method for the automated identification of valuable domain names is called for. The aim of our study was to develop a method for high throughput screening of domain names for rapid identification of the valuable ones. Five different aspects that make a domain name valuable were identified: name quality, domain authority, domain traffic, active domain age and domain health.

In this paper, we develop a principle upon which auto-encoders can be combined with generative adversarial networks by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the generative model. The underlying principle shows that variational inference can be used a basic tool for learning, but with the in- tractable likelihood replaced by a synthetic likelihood, and the unknown posterior distribution replaced by an implicit distribution; both synthetic likelihoods and implicit posterior distributions can be learned using discriminators. This allows us to develop a natural fusion of variational auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks, combining the best of both these methods.

A dangerous driving style would possibly result in dangerous behaviors. If the driving styles can be recognized by some appropriate classification methods, much attention could be paid to the drivers with dangerous driving styles. The driving style recognition module can be integrated into the advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), which integrates different modules to improve driving automation, safety and comfort, and then the driving safety could be enhanced by pre-warning the drivers or adjusting the vehicle's controlling parameters when the dangerous driving style is detected. In most previous studies, driver's questionnaire data and vehicle's objective driving data were utilized to recognize driving styles. And promising results were obtained. However, these methods were indirect or subjective in driving style evaluation. In this paper a method based on objective driving data and electroencephalography (EEG) data was presented to classify driving styles. A simulated driving system was constructed and the EEG data and the objective driving data were collected synchronously during the simulated driving. The driving style of each participant was classified by clustering the driving data via K-means. Then the EEG data was denoised and the amplitude and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of four frequency bands were extracted as the EEG features by Fast Fourier transform and Welch. Finally, the EEG features, combined with the classification results of the driving data were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and a leave-one-subject-out cross validation was utilized to evaluate the performance. The SVM classification accuracy was about 80.0%. Conservative drivers showed higher PSDs in the parietal and occipital areas in the alpha and beta bands, aggressive drivers showed higher PSD in the temporal area in the delta and theta bands. These results imply that different driving styles were related with different driving strategies and mental states and suggest the feasibility of driving style recognition from EEG patterns.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6549479", "pubmed_id": "31191419", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01254", "venue": "Front.

This poses a major difficulty for a reliable interpretation of geochemical results. The problem is especially severe when the information on the tubewells design is hard to obtain. This paper shows a supervised classification method based on the Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique to identify the layer from where groundwater samples were extracted. The classification rules were based on the major ion composition of the samples. We applied this method to the Campo de Cartagena multi-layer aquifer system, in southeastern Spain. A large amount of hydrogeochemical data was available, but only a limited fraction of the sampled tubewells included a reliable determination of the borehole design and, consequently, of the aquifer layer being exploited. Added difficulty was the very similar compositions of water samples extracted from different aquifer layers. Moreover, not all groundwater samples included the same geochemical variables. Despite of the difficulty of such a background, the Random Forest classification reached accuracies over 90%. These results were much better than the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Decision Trees (CART) supervised classification methods. From a total of 1549 samples, 805 proceeded from one unique identified aquifer, 409 proceeded from a possible blend of waters from several aquifers and 335 were of unknown origin. Only 468 of the 805 unique-aquifer samples included all the chemical variables needed to calibrate and validate the models. Finally, 107 of the groundwater samples of unknown origin could be classified. Most unclassified samples did not feature a complete dataset. The uncertainty on the identification of training samples was taken in account to enhance the model.

Bursty topics from microblogs are the results of the emerging issues that instantly attract more followers and more attention online, which provide a unique opportunity to gauge the relation between expressed public sentiment and hot topics. This paper presents a Social Sentiment Sensor (SSS) system on Sina Weibo to detect daily hot topics and analyze the sentiment distributions toward these topics. SSS includes two main techniques, namely, hot topic detection and topic-oriented sentiment analysis. Hot topic detection aims to detect the most popular topics online based on the following steps, topic detection, topic clustering, and topic popularity ranking. We extracted topics from the hashtags using a hashtag filtering model because they can cover almost all the topics. Then, we cluster the topics that describe the same issue, and rank the topic clusters via their popularity to exploit the final hot topics. Topic-oriented sentiment analysis aims to analyze public opinions toward the hot topics.

The goal of this study is to offer methods to enhance our ability to accurately model the spatial distributions of six migratory waterfowl species. This goal is accomplished by creating models based on species-specific annual cycles and introducing a depth to water table (DWT) data set. The DWT data set, a wetland proxy, is a simulated long-term measure of the point either at or below the surface where climate and geological/topographic water fluxes balance. For species occurrences, the USGS' banding bird data for six relatively common species was used. Distribution models are constructed using Random Forest and MaxEnt. Random Forest classification of habitat and non-habitat provided a measure of DWT variable importance, which indicated that DWT is as important, and often more important, to model accuracy as temperature, precipitation, elevation, and an alternative wetland measure. MaxEnt models that included DWT in addition to traditional predictor variables had a considerable increase in classification accuracy. Also, MaxEnt models created with DWT often had higher accuracy when compared with models created with an alternative measure of wetland habitat. By comparing maps of predicted probability of occurrence and response curves, it is possible to explore how different species respond to water table depth and how a species responds in different seasons. The results of this analysis also illustrate that, as expected, all waterfowl species are tightly affiliated with shallow water table habitat. However, this study illustrates that the intensity of affiliation is not constant between seasons for a species, nor is it consistent between species.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3260213", "pubmed_id": "22272288", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030142", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2049639940", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["198151270", "10284741", "55414296", "53343013", "15789218", "82311959", "85892669", "85091286", "85889693", "54067264", "85174061", "83786293", "52208131", "83700246", "52840329", "7883951", "129012284", "209557686", "53591576", "86872671", "85740602", "83585764", "161301958", "52237539", "3626971", "89141", "11245224", "8004388", "11652370", "83194844", "5874426", "178030622", "35375831", "62802477", "90612677"], "inbound_citations": ["1690924", "20812293", "54020518", "86400567", "215214045", "55054130", "204080008", "33089156"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11434262"}

In this game, the task of the discriminator is to discriminate the real and generated (i.e., fake) data, whilst the task of the generator is to generate the fake data that maximally confuses the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint for GANs, which is termed as the minimizing general loss viewpoint. This viewpoint shows a connection between the general loss of a classification problem regarding a convex loss function and a f-divergence between the true and fake data distributions. Mathematically, we proposed a setting for the classification problem of the true and fake data, wherein we can prove that the general loss of this classification problem is exactly the negative f-divergence for a certain convex function f. This allows us to interpret the problem of learning the generator for dismissing the f-divergence between the true and fake data distributions as that of maximizing the general loss which is equivalent to the min-max problem in GAN if the Logistic loss is used in the classification problem. However, this viewpoint strengthens GANs in two ways. First, it allows us to employ any convex loss function for the discriminator. Second, it suggests that rather than limiting ourselves in NN-based discriminators, we can alternatively utilize other powerful families. Bearing this viewpoint, we then propose using the kernel-based family for discriminators.

For each of the standard tests, a regression technique based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels was applied to model the stiffness and bulges of the intervertebral lumbar disc when the parameters of the FE models are changed.

This paper focus on improving intrusion system in wireless local area network by using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The data that are used in our experiments originated from a computer Lab. SVM performs intrusion detection based on recognized attack patterns. Simulation result show that proposed detection system can recognizes anomalies and raises an alarm. In addition, evaluation produced a better result in terms of the detection efficiency and false alarm rate which may give better coverage, and make the detection more effective.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.protcy.2012.02.066", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2029268532", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["26478969", "17954211", "6149448", "38800722", "52949183", "1731734", "15874442", "36119068", "20951", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["203591838", "28929690", "6678984", "174804852", "34846235", "52927542", "203688766", "53071443", "53071443", "62580301", "16178491", "6548222", "211244531", "20565370"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109667120"}

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models over discrete data. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1704.00028", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv",

{"paper_id": "14419395", "title": "Incremental Learning of Concept Drift from Streaming Imbalanced Data", "authors": [{"first": "Gregory", "middle": [], "last": "Ditzler", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Robi", "middle": [], "last": "Polikar", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Learning in nonstationary environments, also known as learning concept drift, is concerned with learning from data whose statistical characteristics change over time. Concept drift is further complicated if the data set is class imbalanced. While these two issues have been independently addressed, their joint treatment has been mostly underexplored. We describe two ensemble-based approaches for learning concept drift from imbalanced data. Our first approach is a logical combination of our previously introduced Learn++.NSE algorithm for concept drift, with the well-established SMOTE for learning from imbalanced data. Our second approach makes two major modifications to Learn++.NSE-SMOTE integration by replacing SMOTE with a subensemble that makes strategic use of minority class data; and replacing Learn++.NSE and its class-independent error weighting mechanism with a penalty constraint that forces the algorithm to balance accuracy on all classes.

This has stimulated recent work in multi-label learning where a given image can be tagged with multiple class labels. A serious problem with existing approaches is that they are unable to exploit correlations between class labels. This paper presents a novel framework for multi-label learning termed Correlated Label Propagation (CLP) that explicitly models interactions between labels in an efficient manner. As in standard label propagation, labels attached to training data points are propagated to test data points; however, unlike standard algorithms that treat each label independently, CLP simultaneously co-propagates multiple labels. Existing work eschews such an approach since naive algorithms for label co-propagation are intractable. We present an algorithm based on properties of submodular functions that efficiently finds an optimal solution.

Recently, it has received a lot of attention given the interest in opinion mining in micro-blogging platforms. These new forms of textual expressions present new challenges to analyze text because of the use of slang, orthographic and grammatical errors, among others. Along with these challenges, a practical sentiment classifier should be able to handle efficiently large workloads.The aim of this research is to identify in a large set of combinations which text transformations (lemmatization, stemming, entity removal, among others), tokenizers (e.g., word n-grams), and token-weighting schemes make the most impact on the accuracy of a classifier (Support Vector Machine) trained on two Spanish datasets. The methodology used is to exhaustively analyze all combinations of text transformations and their respective parameters to find out what common characteristics the best performing classifiers have. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach based on the combination of word-based n-grams and character-based q-grams.

The daily stream flows simulated by the SVM are in very good agreement with the observed ones, while those simulated by Xinanjiang and TOPMODEL significantly underestimate or overestimate the main peak-flows and are greatly different from the observed ones for low flow stages in both calibration stage and validation period.

In real industrial applications, working loads of machines are always changing. Hence, directly applying the traditional algorithms will cause significant degradation of performance with changing conditions. In this paper, a novel domain adaptation method, named generative transfer learning (GTL), is proposed to tackle this problem. First, raw datasets were transformed to time-frequency domain based on short-time Fourier transformation. A domain discriminator was then built to distinguish whether the data came from the source or the target domain. A target domain classification model was finally acquired by the feature extractor and the classifier. Experiments were carried out for the fault diagnosis of a wind turbine gearbox.

CITP allows quantitative assessment of intelligence in individual dogs using a scoring system based on the latency to response, success-in-effort time, attentiveness, interest in novelty exploration, response to signaling and showing, observational learning, problem solving/boldness, and handedness. Blood samples were collected from the canines, and genomic DNA prepared. A total of 117 dogs, belonging to three breeds (German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois, Labrador Retrievers) were down-selected and successfully genotyped for whole genome (WG) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers by means of the Affymetrix Canine SNP Array v2. A proof-of-concept advanced data mining algorithm for unsupervised analysis of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset was successfully developed. Using this algorithm, canine subjects were successfully clustered into the correct breeds with an accuracy ranging from 89% - 100%, solely based on the WG SNP profiles.

In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware unsupervised discriminative ELM method for HSI clustering. The main novelty of the proposed method are twofold:1) a local spectral-spatial context integration and reshaping mechanism is incorporated into the hidden layer feature representation by using a context-aware propagation filtering procedure; and 2) both local manifold and global discriminative regularization are integrated into unsupervised ELM framework to learn an effective data representation. The most important advantage of the proposed method is that it efficiently exploits the spatial contextual information of HSI through a propagation filtering procedural; furthermore, the learned data representation can capture the intrinsic structure by exploiting the local manifold and global information by discriminative regularization.

Introduction The year 2012 has been a special year for the Korean \ufb01lm industry. This year, there were a numberof successful domestic movies that attracted millions of moviegoers. The Thieves (released in lateJuly) has set a box o\ufb03ce record with over 13 million viewers on that places it \ufb01rst in all-time boxo\ufb03ce history. In addition, Masquerade (released in mid-September) had a huge box-o\ufb03ce successrecording the fourth largest total attendance with over 11 million tickets sold. The recently released, aWerewolf Boy, is rapidly attracting record numbers of moviegoers (over six million as of November,2012). In the \ufb01rst half of 2012, the biggest blockbuster \ufb01lm was the Hollywood movie, Avengers;however, seven domestic movies were among the top ten blockbusters leading the box-o\ufb03ce in the\ufb01rst half of 2012. The Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA) has forecast that the gross revenueof the domestic movie industry is expected to grow by 4.4% relative to the \ufb01rst half of 2012; inaddition, it states that the top four distributors accounted for 95.72% of the total market share of theaudience, further pushing the polarization of major distributors and medium-sized distributors. Thetop four distributors include CJ EM however, there are various determinants of the box o\ufb03ce success besides thedistributors. It costs money to make a movie; therefore, a studio and investors want to predict thegross revenue that a movie will bring before a movie opens in theaters. There were several studiesto predict box o\ufb03ce revenue using various regression methods.

We elucidated distributional overlaps and related climatic variables for two endemic sister taxa of Rhododendron and a generalist with respect to current and future climate conditions. Our research questions are: (i) Which climate factors separate the distributions of Rhododendron cowanianum, R. lepidotum and R. lowndesii? (ii) How large is the geographic overlap in current and future distributions? (iii) Is it likely that the species are able to track their niches in the future? To answer these questions, we performed species distribution modelling on binomial Rhododendron occurrences accompanied by random pseudo-absences and absences constrained by other Rhododendron taxa. We used Generalized Linear Modelling to select variables, and modelled the distribution of each species using Random Forest algorithms, predicting their potential distribution in current and future climates. We also examined range differences to identify the variables segregating the distribution of these sister taxa, and estimated current and future distributional overlap between and within species. Precipitation variables explained R. lowndesii distribution, whereas temperature variables explained distributions of the other two species. We found that sister taxa have similar climate niche and hence high overlap in geographic distribution in current climate (46\u201368%) and potentially in future climate (53\u201377%). Under future climate conditions, the potential distribution area of R. lepidotum and R. cowanianum is predicted to be at a higher elevation, while the prediction for R. lowndesii is similar to its current geography. Our models suggest that there are more potential distribution areas for these narrowly distributed endemic species than are currently occupied, which illustrates that it is rather uncertain whether the Rhododendron species will be able to track the geographical location of their niches in the future.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21425/F59334911", "venue": null, "journal": "Frontiers of biogeography", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2766086668", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["126887808", "5444157", "140575618", "85813547", "84329497", "85040925", "53609562", "89141", "43249382", "2959918", "36905177", "178030622", "73718273", "133964372", "85911313", "6257192", "4419902", "20705033", "14375908", "132848115", "133964008", "1190097", "35718537", "84589252", "140171601", "82834521", "399236", "7990899", "158611139", "86062324", "24535914", "3895737", "73645618"], "inbound_citations": ["1279869"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134415204"}

In the recent years there has been use of SVM for speech recognition. Many kinds of kernel functions are available for SVM to map an input space problem to high dimensional spaces.

Methods: A retrospective patient review was conducted for several centers in Latin America. Clinicians identified ALK-positive NSCLC patients who received crizotinib and reported their clinical characteristics, treatments, and survival. Overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were described. A Random Forest Tree (RFT) model was constructed to predict brain progression. Results: A total of 73 patients were included; median age at diagnosis was 58 years, 60.3% were female, and 93.2% had adenocarcinoma. Eighty-nine percent of patients were never smokers/former smokers, 71.1% had \u22652 sites of metastasis, and 20.5% had brain metastases at diagnosis.

In the parallel field of regression ensembles,where the loss function of interest is the mean squared error, thisdecomposition not only exists, but it has been shown that diversitycan be managed via the Negative Correlation (NC) framework. In thefield of probabilistic modelling the expected value of the negativelog-likelihood loss function is given by its conditional entropy; thisresult suggests that interaction information might provide someinsight into the trade off between accuracy and diversity. Ourobjective is to improve our understanding of classifier diversity byfocusing on two different loss functions -- the mean squared error andthe negative log-likelihood.In a study of mean squared error functions, we reformulate the Tumer &Ghosh model for the classification error as a regression problem, andwe show how the NC learning framework can be deployed to managediversity in classification problems. In an empirical study ofclassifiers that minimise the negative log-likelihood loss function,we discuss model diversity as opposed to error diversity in ensemblesof Naive Bayes classifiers. We observe that diversity in low-varianceclassifiers has to be structurally inferred. We apply interactioninformation to the problem of monitoring diversity in classifierensembles. We present empirical evidence that interaction informationcan capture the trade-off between accuracy and diversity, and thatdiversity occurs at different levels of interactions between baseclassifiers. We use interaction information properties to buildensembles of structurally diverse averaged Augmented Naive Bayesclassifiers. Our empirical study shows that this novel ensembleapproach is computationally more efficient than an accuracy basedapproach and at the same time it does not negatively affect theensemble classification performance.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "829547146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15353913"}

Potentially extracting useful features specific to a patient's pathology would be crucial step towards personalized medicine and assessing treatment options. In order to automatically extract features directly from multiparametric radiological imaging datasets, we developed an advanced unsupervised machine learning algorithm called the multidimensional imaging radiomics-geodesics(MIRaGe). ::: ::: Methods: ::: Seventy-six breast tumor patients underwent 3T MRI breast imaging were used for this study. We tested the MIRaGe algorithm to extract features for classification of breast tumors into benign or malignant. The MRI parameters used were T1-weighted, T2-weighted, dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging(DWI). The MIRaGe algorithm extracted the radiomics-geodesics features (RGFs) from multiparametric MRI datasets. This enable our method to learn the intrinsic manifold representations corresponding to the patients. To determine the informative RGF, a modified Isomap algorithm(t-Isomap) was created for a radiomics-geodesics feature space(tRGFS) to avoid overfitting. Final classification was performed using SVM. The predictive power of the RGFs was tested and validated using k-fold cross validation. ::: ::: Results: ::: The RGFs extracted by the MIRaGe algorithm successfully classified malignant lesions from benign lesions with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 91%. The top 50 RGFs identified as the most predictive by the t-Isomap procedure were consistent with the radiological parameters known to be associated with breast cancer diagnosis and were categorized as kinetic curve characterizing RGFs, wash-in rate characterizing RGFs, wash-out rate characterizing RGFs and morphology characterizing RGFs. ::: ::: Conclusion: ::: In this paper, we developed a novel feature extraction algorithm for multiparametric radiological imaging. The results demonstrated the power of the MIRaGe algorithm at automatically discovering useful feature representations directly from the raw multiparametric MRI data. In conclusion, the MIRaGe informatics model provides a powerful tool with applicability in cancer diagnosis and a possibility of extension to other kinds of pathologies. ::: ::: NIH (P50CA103175, 5P30CA006973 (IRAT), R01CA190299, U01CA140204), Siemens Medical Systems (JHU-2012-MR-86-01) and Nivida Graphics Corporation", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28048357", "doi": "10.1118/1.4955777", "venue": "Medical physics", "journal": "Medical physics", "mag_id": "2467135562", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8205642"}

Physiological signals were recorded from 10 healthy subjects and 9 cognitively preserved PD patients. We computed conventional heart rate variability (HRV) features as well as the full Lyapunov spectrum over 600s recordings at rest, and tested for significant group effects using a general linear model taking into account age and gender as nuisance covariates. Additionally, the discriminatory power of all features was tested by training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier combined with recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a variable number of target features.

The best classification performance (75% sensitivity, 8O% specificity, area under ROC curve O.8) was attained when instructing RFE to retain 2 features, where the algorithm selected the first and second Lyapunov exponents.

This information is commonly obtained from conventional wireline logs, such as gamma ray, density, transit time and resistivity. Due to the complexity of unconventional reservoirs, traditional methods based on distinct differences of resistivity, density and sonic velocity of organic matter from those of the inorganic matrix are not always successful. We investigate the best way to predict the TOC using gamma-ray, density, porosity, resistivity and sonic transit time log responses by applying machine learning methods such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

RAM detects simple and composite activities, collecting the data with a single 3D accelerometer to produce a non-invasive solution. Classification module of RAM carries out non-predefined feature extraction and activity detection in a coalesced manner thanks to feature extractive training, whereas the state-of-art classifiers need to be fed with the output of a predefined feature extraction scheme. As being a Support Vector Machines (SVM) inspired solution, RAM fulfils multiclass classification with one-against-pseudo class strategy, without generating hyperplanes. The strength of the proposed model lies in that RAM achieves robustness in terms of inter-activity detection consistency and time efficiency with little overhead. Robustness property offers a potential to reduce the need for re-training an expert system, which faces the problem of growing set of activity classes in the real time activity recognition domain. We compared RAM for a set of hand oriented activities, against 8 different configurations, where SVM and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifiers are fed with different predefined features.

However, the dynamic live data with high volume and fast arrival rate in data streams make it challenging to apply SVM in data stream processing. Existing SVM implementations are mostly designed for batch processing and hardly satisfy the efficiency requirement of stream processing for its inherent complexity. To address the challenges, we propose a high efficiency distributed SVM framework over data stream (HDSVM), which consists of two main algorithms, incremental learning algorithm and distributed algorithm. Firstly, we propose a partial support vectors reserving incremental learning algorithm (PSVIL). By selecting a subset of support vectors based on their distances to classification hyperplane instead of the universal set to update SVM, the algorithm achieves lower time overhead while ensuring accuracy. Secondly, we propose a distribution remaining partition and fast aggregation distributed algorithm (DRPFA) for SVM. The real-time data is partitioned based on the original distribution with clustering instead of random partition, and historical support vectors are partitioned based on their distances to the classification hyperplane. The global hyperplane can be obtained by averaging the parameters of local hyperplanes due to the above partition strategy. Extensive experiments on Apache Storm show that the proposed HDSVM achieve lower time overhead and similar accuracy compared with the state-ofart.

Aiming to reduce the number of trajectories that need to be adjusted, previous papers introduced a few methods of identifying critical trajectories from a large-scale trajectories in the operation plan. However, there are still many challenges like unsatisfactory time complexity in O(n2) time due to huge data volume of flight trajectories.

In this framework, defined as the key feature set which for classification, several temporal-spatial operating characteristics of large-scale trajectories are summarized. After that, a machine learning model is used to classify the critical trajectories.

The models learn a small set of intuitive parameters without the need for labeled data and use them to generate new realistic trajectories. The neural networks, which base on the InfoGAN and beta-VAE architectures, are adapted from the image domain to the time series domain. Although our methods are generally applicable, our experiments focus on lane change maneuvers on highways. To train the networks, we use more than 5600 measured lane change trajectories extracted from the highD dataset. Our results show that the networks learn to describe lane change maneuvers by up to four intuitive parameters. Furthermore, the networks are able to map existing lane change trajectories to values of the learned parameters and generate new, previously unseen, realistic trajectories.

In this paper, we explore the automatic selective archiving of the movements and sounds infants make before crying to give parents information they could later use to reflect on these behaviors and determine what the infant wants. Following a user-centered design methodology we developed a capture and access tool that uses accelerometers to detect when the infant is moving, and an algorithm to detect when the infant is crying. The movement detection algorithm uses a motion shimmer sensor and computes the magnitude exerted over the three axes, and the cry detection algorithm uses a Multi-Band Spectral Entropy Signature (MBSES) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect sustained crying.

Yet, there is a significant lack of knowledge in these models concerning the correlation between storm damage and high-impact near-surface airflow. To improve our understanding in this field, we built Random Forests (RF) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for evaluating the association between high resolution gust speed data and long-term, multi-event forest storm damage data from long-term permanent forest growth and yield plots. The tested gust speed data were derived from two different gust speed models: a numerical non-hydrostatic mesoscale model and a statistical model. In all RF and GLM models gust speed was a statistically significant predictor. The performance of the evaluated empirical models was very high (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values AUC = 0.86\u20130.99). Depending on the type of model, the relative importance of gust speed was moderate to very high (up to 35%). However, starting from models using all significant predictors and excluding gust speed, the performance loss was almost negligible in all models. Furthermore, modeling long-term storm damage for each storm event individually performed better compared to modeling average long-term, event-unspecific storm damage. Our results demonstrate that empirical storm damage models using only gust speed as a predictor can reach moderate (GLM) to very high (RF) performance, even without any other information on terrain and forest attributes. However, if detailed terrain and forest data are available, empirical storm damage models may have such a high performance that adding gust speed data improves them very little. The correlation between gust speed and storm damage in the coupled modeling system is a fundamental first step in being able to evaluate potential changes of forest storm damage in a changing climate with potentially changing wind regimes. Additionally, further improvements could be achieved by improved representation of airflow in complex forest.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.017", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural and Forest Meteorology", "mag_id": "2909144690", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209331420", "195438217"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91287510"}

Experiments on a 3D Dobutamine Stress Echo (DSE) dataset with normal and abnormal wall motions shows that both hand-crafted approaches yield comparable accuracy: Random Forests (72.1%), Support Vector Machines (70.5%), and CNN at a slightly higher accuracy (75.0%) and a lower training computational cost.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363785", "venue": "2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2806082822", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10178876", "17358915", "16277866", "7066965", "609094", "4494620", "7072663", "207763512", "14124313", "15975450", "206869445"], "inbound_citations": ["53096845", "211218339", "210884820", "53229741", "211193221"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44148227"}

However, whether imaging features can be utilised as biomarkers for this disease has not been explored. To address this, we encoded subcortical regions of the brain using 45 radiomic features to identify features specific for AD patients. We comprehensively evaluated the proposed approach using the OASIS dataset, assessing significance via the Wilcoxon test and Random Forest (RF) classifier models to identify the subcortical regions best able to identify AD patients. Our results show that features (i.e., correlation and volume) derived from several subcortical regions (i.e., cerebral, thalamus, caudate Putamen, Pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and stem-and-cerebrospinal-fluid) are able to identify AD from healthy control (HC) subjects with the hippocampus and amygdala reaching $\\mathrm{p} following Holm-Bonferroni correction. Consistent with this, hippocampus ( $\\mathbf{AUC}=\\mathbf{81.19-84.09}\\%$ ) and amygdala ( $\\mathbf{AUC}=\\mathbf{79.70-80.27}\\%$ ) regions showed a higher AUC value compared to other subcortical regions.

A dimensionality reduction method should eliminate genes that are irrelevant, redundant, or noisy for classification, while at the same time retain all the highly discriminative genes. In this paper, a novel method for gene selection based on mapreduce is proposed for improving the running time of the algorithm.

The functioning of the gene selection algorithm is distributed through a set of mappers and reducers and thereby speeds up the classification process and reduce the memory requirements.

We formulate this assumption into mathematical equations, and theoretically bridge it with independence and conditional independence of factors. Meanwhile, we show that conditional independence is satisfied in encoders of VAEs due to factorized noise in reparameterization. To highlight the importance of our proposed assumption, we show in experiments that violating the assumption leads to dramatic decline of disentanglement.

Automatic glacier facies mapping utilizing remote sensing data is challenging due to the spectral similarity of supraglacial debris and the adjacent bedrock. Most of the available glacier datasets do not provide the boundary of clean ice and debris-covered glacier facies, while debris-covered glacier facies play a key role in mass balance research. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic algorithm to distinguish ice cover types based on multi-temporal satellite data, and the algorithm was implemented in a subregion of the Parlung Zangbo basin in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The classification method was built upon an automated machine learning approach: Random Forest in combination with the analysis of topographic and textural features based on Landsat-8 imagery and multiple digital elevation model (DEM) data. Very high spatial resolution Gao Fen-1 (GF-1) Panchromatic and Multi-Spectral (PMS) imagery was used to select training samples and validate the classification results.

In this paper, we first describe and evaluate a set of binary feature extractors, for phonetic classes with relevance for glottal source analysis. As voice quality classification is typically achieved using feature data derived by glottal source analysis, we then investigate the effect of removing data from certain detected phonetic regions on the classification accuracy. For the phonetic feature extraction, classification algorithms based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are compared. Experiments demonstrate that the discriminative classifiers (i.e. ANNs and SVMs) in general give better results compared with the generative learning algorithm (i.e. GMMs).

The normalized energies are used as the input to a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for faulty section identification (underground cable or overhead line). Once the faulty section is identified, the faulty-half is determined by comparing polarity of the first two current traveling waves.

The transient voltage and current for different fault locations are simulated using the ATP software. MATLAB is used to process the simulated transients and apply the proposed method.

Often, time-series forecast relies on the information contained in a single measured variable.

Here, we utilize Reservoir Computing techniques to process sequential multivariate information. As reservoir, we employ a Mackey-Glass delay system. We discuss the approximation of a three-dimensional theoretical model (the Lorenz model) by comparing prediction performance for one variable using either one or two variables as input.

However, SVM classification is a computationally complex task, suffering from linear dependencies on the number of the support vectors and the problem's dimensionality. This paper presents a fully scalable field programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture for the acceleration of SVM classification, which exploits the device heterogeneity and the dynamic range diversities among the dataset attributes. An adaptive and fully-customized processing unit is proposed, which utilizes the available heterogeneous resources of a modern FPGA device in efficient way with respect to the problem's characteristics. The implementation results demonstrate the efficiency of the heterogeneous architecture, presenting a speed-up factor of 2-3 orders of magnitude, compared to the CPU implementation. The proposed architecture outperforms other proposed FPGA and graphic processor unit approaches by more than seven times. Furthermore, based on the special properties of the heterogeneous architecture, this paper introduces the first FPGA-oriented cascade SVM classifier scheme, which exploits the FPGA reconfigurability and intensifies the custom-arithmetic properties of the heterogeneous architecture. The results show that the proposed cascade scheme is able to increase the heterogeneous classifier throughput even further, without introducing any penalty on the resource utilization.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24807131", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2196446", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2136632098", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "16909692", "7521516", "14542261", "59849738", "4791469", "52810328", "9434141", "2811356", "14591650", "5155714", "14393104", "15052440", "121070291", "64543020", "14318121", "16813648", "14487094", "15202588", "6381548", "7594756", "13415258", "2127615", "11812687", "16408774", "121601971", "206658009", "2443126", "18933838", "15439523"], "inbound_citations": ["10025637", "52926610", "115532912", "15075032", "8416162", "57361653", "25755392", "28422769", "211226949", "1036848", "20595406", "28815557", "37482384", "211069019", "4767520", "13741444", "23342432", "15472917", "37183737", "30775164", "14956110", "45894677", "52964385", "15223845", "51908975", "872490", "2228100", "5555364", "20799403", "45026726", "23248156", "49535459", "3450374", "59230991", "115814398", "9928463", "3733185", "3498640", "18057522", "2717571", "16151250", "15057683", "9579493", "16357875", "62948272"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13569059"}

Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning, both in classification and regression problems. In renewable energy systems, feature selection appears related to prediction systems in the most important sources such as wind, solar and marine resources. The objective of the paper is twofold: first, a review of the most important prediction systems for renewable energy applications involving feature selection is carried out. Analysis and discussion of different feature selection problems in prediction systems are considered. We show that wrapper FSP approaches are those mostly used due to their higher performance. They include a diversity of algorithms, prevailing fast-training approaches. The lack of an uniform framework for FSP and the diversity of tackled problems impede a systematic assessment of the performance and properties of the applied methods. Thus, the simultaneously use of several global search mechanisms should be the preferred option. In a second part of the paper, we explore this possibility, by introducing a novel approach for feature selection based on a novel meta-heuristic, the Coral Reefs Optimization algorithm with Substrate Layer. This approach is able to combine different search mechanisms into a single algorithm, providing a global search procedure of high quality. We use an Extreme Learning Machine for prediction within this novel approach. The performance of the system is evaluated in a problem of wind speed prediction from numerical models input, using real data from a wind farm in Spain, where comparison with alternative regression algorithms is carried out. Improvements up to 20% in hourly and daily wind speed prediction are obtained with the proposed system versus the algorithms without the feature selection process considered.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.008", "venue": null, "journal": "Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews", "mag_id": "2799581641", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195657154", "53282327", "210931949", "214596061"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116683228"}

We include 240 actinobacteria classified into four pathogenicity classes: human pathogens (HPs), broad-spectrum pathogens (BPs), opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and non-pathogenic (NP). We hypothesize: (H1) Pathogens (HPs and BPs) possess specific pathogenicity signature genes. (H2) The same holds for OPs. (H3) Broad-spectrum and exclusively HPs cannot be distinguished from each other because of an observation bias, i.e. many HPs might yet be unclassified BPs. (H4) There is no intrinsic genomic characteristic of OPs compared with pathogens, as small mutations are likely to play a more dominant role to survive the immune system. To study these hypotheses, we implemented a bioinformatics pipeline that combines evolutionary sequence analysis with statistical learning methods (Random Forest with feature selection, model tuning and robustness analysis). Essentially, we present orthologous gene sets that computationally distinguish pathogens from NPs (H1). We further show a clear limit in differentiating OPs from both NPs (H2) and pathogens (H4). HPs may also not be distinguished from bacteria annotated as BPs based only on a small set of orthologous genes (H3), as many HPs might as well target a broad range of mammals but have not been annotated accordingly.

For proof of idea, three subjects were asked to write seven letters with foot. We recorded and analyzed the data to study the learning process in five sessions. Since previous studies have shown that pressure of pen and stiffness of hand are inversely related to the learning level, we considered the pressure applied by a magnetic pen on a digital tablet during foot writing as one of the main features to represent the learning level. Pressure analysis demonstrated that the pressure on the tablet is decreased during successive task accomplishments. Statistical analysis of pressure indicates that the fourth day can be considered as the frontier of the learning process. The EMG signal was also recorded from eight leg muscles and for each of them 28 features were extracted. Several classification methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Classifier, Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were used in order to classify the recorded data. With 10 superior features chosen by Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm for each classifier, the accuracy of corresponding classifiers was in the range of 72%\u201395%.

The first phase of connectionism attracted a certain amount of media attention, but scant philosophical interest. The phase came to an abrupt halt, due to the efforts of Minsky and Papert (1969), when they argued for the intrinsic limitations of the approach. In the mid-1980s connectionism saw a resurgence. This marked the beginning of the second phase of connectionist research. This phase did attract considerable philosophical attention. It was of philosophical interest, as it offered a way of counteracting the conceptual ties to the philosophical traditions of atomism, rationalism, logic, nativism, rule realism and a concern with the role symbols play in human cognitive functioning, which was prevalent as a consequence of artificial intelligence research. The surge in philosophical interest waned, possibly in part due to the efforts of some traditionalists and the so-called black box problem.

These trends clearly illustrate the need for better understanding of malicious cyber activities based on both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes.

Therefore, the concept drift detection of time series has practical significance. In this paper, a novel method called online entropy-based time domain feature extraction (ETFE) for concept drift detection is proposed. Firstly, the empirical mode decomposition based on extrema symmetric extension is used to decompose time series, where features in various time scales can be adaptively extracted. Meanwhile, the end point effect caused by traditional empirical mode decomposition can be avoided. Secondly, by using the entropy calculation, the time-domain features are coarse-grained to quantify the structure and complexity of the time series, among which six kinds of entropy are used for discussion. Finally, a statistical process control method based on generalized likelihood ratio is used to monitor the change of the entropy, which can effectively track the mean and amplitude of the time series. Therefore, the early alarm of concept drift can be given. Synthetic data sets and neonatal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings with seizures annotations data sets are used to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/e21121187", "venue": "Entropy", "journal": "Entropy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2989966743", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["114588352", "126470415", "53075637", "49318689", "5809989", "46925329", "59621976", "10935539", "202790390", "2606652", "14823702", "11437022", "1249503", "43531835", "17129877", "182388041", "207873253", "127554914", "1262186", "122174397", "719660", "116858", "14490303", "208099448", "157718140", "119432283", "120697471", "16876096", "209149518", "35261436", "205003915", "5785692", "12598891", "4366340", "38805132", "13029734", "34254016", "10193916", "7178127", "70350259", "29694079"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208611288"}

If the potency difference between MMP compounds is very small, the substructure exchange (chemical transformation) encodes a bioisosteric replacement; if the difference is very large, the transformation encodes an activity cliff. For a given compound activity class, MMPs comprehensively capture existing structural relationships and represent a spectrum of potency changes for structurally analogous compounds. We have aimed to predict potency changes encoded by MMPs. This prediction task principally differs from conventional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. For the prediction of MMP-associated potency changes, we introduce direction-dependent MMPs and combine MMP analysis with support vector regression (SVR) modeling. Combinations of newly designed kernel functions and fingerprint descriptors are explored. The resulting SVR models yield accurate predictions of MMP-encoded potency changes for many different data sets. Shared key structure context is found to contribute critically to prediction accuracy. SVR models reach higher performance than random forest (RF) and MMP-based averaging calculations carried out as controls.

The experimental results show that based on the recognition results with the highest accuracy, the most influential features are the zero crossing rate, music mode, harmonics, pitch and energy obtained through the Sequential Backward Selection algorithm. The selection of features in this study can increase accuracy up to 8%.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/icicos.2018.8621783", "venue": "2018 2nd International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences (ICICoS)", "journal": "2018 2nd International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences (ICICoS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2912740422", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5322427", "7328295", "26278004", "6117989", "72130", "21762643", "142131701", "2583515", "193085631", "518060", "13321749", "14819792"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59236251"}

While understanding the drivers of disturbance is important for quantifying the implications of land use change on regional biodiversity, methods for attributing disturbance to specific drivers of change at a high temporal and spatial resolution are still lacking in the Andes region, in part due to persistent cloud cover. Using 20 years of Landsat images (1996\u20132015) covering Picachos National Park in the Colombian Andes, we detected sub-annual forest cover disturbances using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) Monitor algorithm; characterized different types of disturbance using spectral, spatial, and topographic indicators; and attributed causes of forest disturbance such as conversion to pasture, conversion to agriculture, and non-stand replacing disturbance (i.e., thinning) using a Random Forest (RF) classifier. Conversion to pasture has been the main driver of forest disturbance in Picachos, responsible for 11,395 \u00b1 72 ha (17%) of forest cover loss, followed by non-stand replacing disturbance and conversion to agriculture. Disturbance detection had 96% overall agreement with validation data, although we had a high omission error of 21% primarily associated with forest to agriculture conversion. Other change drivers had a much more reliable attribution with forest to pasture conversion or non-stand-replacing disturbance, showing only 1\u20135% commission and 2\u201314% omission errors. Our results provide spatially-explicit information on sub-annual disturbances and associated drivers of change that are necessary for evaluating and improving domestic conservation efforts and establishing systematic ecological observations, which is currently absent from Colombia. While effective at revealing forest change dynamics in a geographically remote and socio-politically complex region like Picachos, our approach is highly automated and it can be easily extended to the rest of Andes-Amazon transition belt where low availability of remote sensing data and high cloud cover impede efforts at consistent monitoring of forest cover change dynamics and drivers.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/f9050269", "venue": null, "journal": "Forests", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2803534171", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["52230401", "85673419", "20085844", "154049845", "67831909", "84791321", "13890226", "83538931", "132244418", "25546446", "73544906", "205013370", "128512889", "17808729", "123413594", "9320704", "128873514", "131084205", "3900606", "4791575", "129930873", "140732095", "2426778", "129157349", "120178216", "988399", "11668169", "131402699", "85405422", "17929978", "129909424", "51903355", "130177729", "140702418", "9193083", "14923551", "128818929", "54961095", "55251284", "54653799", "41606011", "132574938", "31336469", "154020012", "1609387", "133660681", "128232702", "24632203", "16650430", "55301451", "129619757", "67363387"], "inbound_citations": ["209375678"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51685894"}

We report on the development of an efficient subgraph mining technique and its application to finding characteristic substructural patterns within protein structural families. In our method, protein structures are represented by graphs where the nodes are residues and the edges connect residues found within certain distance from each other. Application of subgraph mining to proteins is challenging for a number reasons: (1) protein graphs are large and complex, (2) current protein databases are large and continue to grow rapidly, and (3) only a small fraction of the frequent subgraphs among the huge pool of all possible subgraphs could be significant in the context of protein classification. To address these challenges, we have developed an information theoretic model called coherent subgraph mining. From information theory, the entropy of a random variable X measures the information content carried by X and the Mutual Information (MI) between two random variables X and Y measures the correlation between X and Y. We define a subgraph X as coherent if it is strongly correlated with every sufficiently large sub-subgraph Y embedded in it. Based on the MI metric, we have designed a search scheme that only reports coherent subgraphs. To determine the significance of coherent protein subgraphs, we have conducted an experimental study in which all coherent subgraphs were identified in several protein structural families annotated in the SCOP database (Murzin et al, 1995). The Support Vector Machine algorithm was used to classify proteins from different families under the binary classification scheme. We find that this approach identifies spatial motifs unique to individual SCOP families and affords excellent discrimination between families.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "14992521", "doi": "10.1142/9789812704856_0039", "venue": "Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1976287380", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["2706742", "17341860", "11173972", "2941443", "5159247", "61648815", "103685", "35930516", "49022", "7938529", "7847517", "39555688", "8684662", "6869184", "847106", "182236", "28637672", "33107223"], "inbound_citations": ["7637006", "12187183", "16944902", "17181729", "10936962", "18221273", "3844237", "11257692", "15472495", "27438568", "2045984", "15550780", "14280289", "10829184", "18531994", "18693212", "14293827", "13569113", "1933307"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10774024"}

It includes pair-wise, comparative or multiple sequence analysis. The Genome On-Line Database (GOLD) provides information about the number of completed, meta, incomplete and targeted genome projects. The statistics of GOLD show 2942 of completed, 7687 of incomplete, 340 of meta and 440 of targeted genome projects. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used technique that analyzes the gene expression or micro array data. In the present study, we performed inter and intra species comparative nucleic acid as well as protein sequence analysis of Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) and Ice-recrystallization Inhibition (IRI) domain containing plant antifreeze proteins (AFPs), which provide extensive understanding of their sequential characteristics and help in their classification and in production of transgenic constructs to improve the agricultural yields. Here, classification based on their sequential characteristics was made accordingly, the AFPs from Daucus carota bearing only LRR domains were placed in Class I group while AFPs with both LRR and IRI domains fromTriticum aestivum, Deschampsia antarctica, Lolium perenne and Hordeum vulgare were placed in Class II group. In Class II groups, the entries with less than ten occurrences of IRI were placed in a subgroup A, while the other with more than ten incidences of IRI was placed in a subgroup B. Later, the entries in A and B which has single LRR patterns were placed separately under the Group A1 and B1, whereas those with more than one occurrence were placed in the groups A2 and B2 respectively. Again, the entries in B1 were reclassified based on the conservation of LRR into C1 and C2 groups respectively. LRR regions were found to be enriched with alpha and beta sheet whereas IRI regions contain coil and sheets. The reported classification scheme and proposed methodology facilitate the identification, annotation and construction of synthetic plant AFPs in near future. Ongoing efforts are directed towards the development of comprehensive database integrated with the prediction server for identification of new class of plant AFPs and their homology in an extensive manner. ::: ::: ::: ::: Key words: Antifreeze protein, leucine rich repeat, over-wintering plants, comparative sequence analysis, ice-recrystallization inhibition protein.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2126417663", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17866974"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85597448"}

The effect of such corrections in random forests of PETs is investigated, and the use of the relative class frequency is compared to using two corrected estimates, the Laplace estimate and the m-estimate. An experiment with 34 datasets from the UCI repository shows that estimating class probabilities using relative class frequency clearly outperforms both using the Laplace estimate and the m-estimate with respect to accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Brier score. Hence, in contrast to what is commonly employed for PETs and ensembles of PETs, these results strongly suggest that a non-corrected probability estimate should be used in random forests of PETs. The experiment further shows that learning random forests of PETs using relative class frequency significantly outperforms learning random forests of classification trees (i.e., trees for which only an unweighted vote on the most probable class is counted) with respect to both accuracy and AUC, but that the latter is clearly ahead of the former with respect to Brier score.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2187071731", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18485495", "14960849", "45798891", "12514342", "67868366", "122966593", "15417248", "211830979", "55280807", "6166318", "56426460", "3647667", "22748227", "18335744", "189928542"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123242940"}

First, in the process of pre-processing, we use the color correction approach and the contrast enhancement method to compensate color casts and produce natural color images. Second, an improved Super-resolution Generative Adversarial Networks is applied to pre-processed images in order to remove blurring and boost detail.

Each block is saved as an RSP data block file that can be used directly to estimate the statistical properties of the entire data set. A subset of RSP data blocks is randomly selected and analyzed with existing sequential algorithms in parallel. Then, the results from these blocks are combined to obtain ensemble estimates and models which can be improved gradually by appending new results from the newly analyzed RSP data blocks. To this end, we propose a distributed data-parallel framework (Alpha framework) and develop a prototype of this framework using Microsoft R Server packages and Hadoop distributed file system.

However, most of the 24 indicators that determine the water quality level in the standards are non-optically active parameters. The weak optical characteristics make it difficult to find significant correlations between the single parameters and the remote sensing imagery. In addition, traditional on-site testing methods have been unable to meet the increasingly extensive water-quality monitoring requirements. Based on the above questions, it's meaningful that the supervised classification process of a detail-preserving smoothing classifier based on conditional random field (CRF) and Landsat-8 data was proposed in the two study areas around Wuhan and Huangshi in Hubei Province. The random forest classifier was selected to model the association potential of the CRF. The results (the first study area: OA = 89.50%, Kappa = 0.841; the second study area: OA = 90.35%, Kappa = 0.868) showed that the water-quality monitoring based on CRF model is feasible, and this approach can provide a reference for water-quality mapping of inland lakes.

However direct measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration, the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, may not be feasible in large epidemiological studies. An alternative approach is to estimate vitamin D status using a predictive model based on parameters derived from questionnaire data. In previous studies, models developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) have explained a limited proportion of the variance and predicted values have correlated only modestly with measured values. Here, a new modelling approach, nonlinear radial basis function support vector regression (RBF SVR), was used in prediction of serum 25(OH)D concentration. Predicted scores were compared with those from a MLR model. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Determinants of serum 25(OH)D in Caucasian adults (n = 494) that had been previously identified were modelled using MLR and RBF SVR to develop a 25(OH)D prediction score and then validated in an independent dataset. The correlation between actual and predicted serum 25(OH)D concentrations was analysed with a Pearson correlation coefficient. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Better correlation was observed between predicted scores and measured 25(OH)D concentrations using the RBF SVR model in comparison with MLR (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.74 for RBF SVR; 0.51 for MLR). The RBF SVR model was more accurately able to identify individuals with lower 25(OH)D levels (<75 nmol/L). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Using identical determinants, the RBF SVR model provided improved prediction of serum 25(OH)D concentrations and vitamin D deficiency compared with a MLR model, in this dataset.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3841172", "pubmed_id": "24302994", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0079970", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1972880565", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["11332254", "29662535", "510788", "70399219", "7448243", "18566028", "16249135", "13760350", "18295088", "23489381", "23052582", "42801789", "2698102", "10039376", "1026081", "8733155", "33103723", "5755177", "10175408", "2554032", "52874011", "14895712", "379259", "194951", "15480929", "2058232", "10188487", "14607075", "8747638", "3270585"], "inbound_citations": ["6848431", "15437107"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14911966"}

Generally, most extractive summarizers do not take context information into account, but do take into account the redundancy over the entire summarization. However, there must exist relationships among the extracted sentences. Actually, we can observe these relationships as consecutiveness among the sentences. We deal with this consecutiveness by using dynamic and difference features to decide if a sentence needs to be extracted or not. Since important sentences tend to be extracted consecutively, we just used the decision made for the previous sentence as the dynamic feature. We used the differences between the current and previous feature values for the difference feature, since adjacent sentences in a block of important ones should have similar feature values to each other, where as, there should be a larger difference in the feature values between an important sentence and an unimportant one. We also present a way to ensure that no redundant summarization occurs.

Unlike most previous kinship verification methods which employ low-level hand-crafted descriptors such as local binary pattern and Gabor features for face representation, this paper aims to learn discriminative mid-level features to better characterize the kin relation of face images for kinship verification. To achieve this, we construct a set of face samples with unlabeled kin relation from the labeled face in the wild dataset as the reference set. Then, each sample in the training face kinship dataset is represented as a mid-level feature vector, where each entry is the corresponding decision value from one support vector machine hyperplane. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization function by minimizing the intraclass samples (with a kin relation) and maximizing the neighboring interclass samples (without a kin relation) with the mid-level features. To better use multiple low-level features for mid-level feature learning, we further propose a multiview PDFL method to learn multiple mid-level features to improve the verification performance.

We study the extent to which features learnt by a fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and its iterative alternative (PGD) can preserve their defence properties against black and white-box attacks under three different transfer learning strategies. We find that using PGD examples during training on the source task leads to more general robust features that are easier to transfer.

In this paper, we propose to investigate Recursive Auto-Encoders (RAE)-based transfer learning to cope with the problem of scarcity of data in the context of abnormal behaviour detection. We present a method for generating synthetic data to reflect on some behavior of people with dementia. An RAE model is trained on data of a healthy person in a source household.

Here, a sliding window approach is combined with the Random Forests method to predict protein interaction sites using (i) a combination of sequence- and structure-derived parameters and (ii) sequence information alone. For sequence-based prediction we achieved a precision of 84% with a 26% recall and an F-measure of 40%. When combined with structural information, the prediction performance increases to a precision of 76% and a recall of 38% with an F-measure of 51%. We also present an attempt to rationalize the sliding window size and demonstrate that a nine-residue window is the most suitable for predictor construction.

Various methods of content based image retrieval (CBIR) have been proposed in the remote sensing domain, but no general approaches are available. Regardless of the used method, the CBIR systems have the same function, to identify the most similar images with the query image. Some authors developed powerful CBIR tools such as GeoIRIS system of Shyu C. et al. which is a content-based multimodal Geospatial Information Retrieval and Indexing System and includes automatic feature extraction, visual content mining from large-scale image databases, and high-dimensional database indexing for fast retrieval, KIM - knowledge-driven information mining proposed by Datcu M. et al. which is based on human-centered concepts and implements new features and functions allowing improved feature extraction, search on a semantic level, the availability of collected knowledge and interactive knowledge discovery, SemQuery,developed by Sheikholeslami G. et al., which is a semantics-based clustering and indexing approach, used to support visual queries on heterogeneous features of images. Regarding the idea of finding a common ground between synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical data and even data fusion products, the goal is to develop an application capable to join feature extraction algorithms and classification algorithms. Therefore, this paper is presenting a framework of feature extraction methods for SAR, Multispectral and Data fusion image products that can be used in automatic or semi-automatic classification of urban areas. Our results demonstrate the usability of patch based image classification techniques that can be applied on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 public data sets. Also, another goal is to demonstrate how data fusion products perform in the context of patch based image classification and automatic annotation of urban areas. In order to do so, the selected scene is grouped in a few generic classes like buildings, vegetation, forest, water, streets etc. Then we use feature extraction methods such as Gabor filter banks and Weber Local Descriptors in combination with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) to define an application to be tested on SAR, optical data and data fusion products. The result of the study is intended to establish the optimum number of classes that can be found in the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images when using patch based image classification techniques. Also another important objective of this paper is to determine the best patch sizes suitable for this type of classification and that can be used to obtain the best results for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 EO images.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2589389349", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133199487"}

Corel image dataset contain nine categories which are buildings, birds, flowers, people, trees, elephants, white clouds, mountains and automotive.

The DELOS corpus, a collection of economic domain texts that has been automatically annotated using various morphological and syntactic tools was used as training material. Our shallow parser makes use of limited linguistic input. More specifically, we consider only part of speech tagging, the voice and the mood of the verb as well as the head word of a noun phrase. For the task of detecting the head word of a phrase we used a sentence boundary detector. Identifying the head word of a noun phrase, i.e. the word that holds the morphological information (case, number) of the whole phrase, also proves to be very helpful for our task as its morphological tag is all the information that is needed regarding the phrase. The evaluation of the proposed method was performed against three other machine learning techniques, namely naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines, methods that have been previously applied to natural language processing tasks with satisfactory results.

However, compared with the clinically widely used thick-section MR images, thin-section MR images are less available due to the imaging cost. Thin-section MR images of infants are even scarcer but are quite valuable for the study of human brain development. Therefore, we propose a method for the reconstruction of thin-section MR images from thick-section images. A two-stage reconstruction framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to reconstruct thin-section MR images from thick-section images in the axial and sagittal planes. A 3D-Y-Net-GAN is first proposed to fuse MR images from the axial and sagittal planes and to achieve the first-stage thin-section reconstruction. A 3D-DenseU-Net followed by a stack of enhanced residual blocks is then proposed to provide further detail recalibrations and structural corrections in the sagittal plane. In this method, a comprehensive loss function is also proposed to help the networks capture more structural details. The reconstruction performance of the proposed method is compared with bicubic interpolation, sparse representation, and 3D-SRU-Net. Cross-validation based on 35 cases and independent testing based on two datasets with totally 114 cases reveal that, compared with the other three methods, the proposed method provides an average 23.5% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), 90.5% improvement in structural similarity (SSIM), and 21.5% improvement in normalized mutual information (NMI).

The relationships between model parameters and climate/landscape catchment descriptors were multidimensional and exhibited nonlinear features. In this case, machine-learning tools offered the option of efficiently handling such relationships using a large sample of data. The performance of the regionalized model using RF was assessed in comparison with local calibration and two benchmark regionalization approaches. Two catchment sets were considered: (1) A target pseudo-ungauged catchment set was composed of 120 urban ungauged catchments and (2) 2105 gauged American and French catchments were used for constructing the RF. By using pseudo-ungauged urban catchments, we aimed at assessing the potential of the RF to detect the specificities of the urban catchments. Results showed that RF-regionalized models allowed for slightly better streamflow simulations on ungauged sites compared with benchmark regionalization approaches.

Although the cerebral cortex and the directly connected thalamus are paramount to this particular form of epilepsy, several other parts of the mammalian brain are likely to influence this oscillatory activity. We have recently shown that some of the cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons, which form the main output of the cerebellum, show synchronized oscillatory activity during episodes of cortical SWDs in two independent mouse models of absence epilepsy [1]. The CN neurons that show this significant correlation with the SWDs are deemed to \u201cparticipate\u201d in the seizure activity and are therefore used in our current study designed to unravel the potential causes of such oscillatory firing patterns. ::: ::: Initially, we set out to study if different types of CN neurons are more prone to show modulated firing patterns during seizure activity. We applied Growing Neural Gas (GNG) [2], an unsupervised clustering algorithm, on the interictal activity, i.e., firing patterns recorded in between seizures, using the measures CV, log-interval entropy, permutation entropy and firing rate. Three main groups of neurons were found by the clustering algorithm, in which the neurons were predominantly participating in the seizures. These can be seen on Figure \u200bFigure11 as the green, yellow and pale blue crosses (+). Moreover, these three clusters have the highest CV (and therefore more irregular) and higher log-interval entropy (more unpredictable). Further, we used a Gaussian Process Regression model [3] to predict the extent of participation of the neurons in the seizure activity, based on two measures: Z-score of mean power at seizure frequency (6-9Hz) (FFT based Z-score) and modulation frequency. These characterize the extent to which CN neurons phase-lock their spiking activity to the spikes in the EEG during seizures. We achieved a good prediction rate (r = 0.56, p < 0.05 for FFT based Z-score; r = 0.45, p < 0.05 for modulation frequency) using this method. Also, we are using a compartmental model of a CN neuron with realistic morphology [4] to investigate the input conditions that can generate interictal activity found in the participating neurons. Our results indicate that bursting in the Purkinje cell or mossy fiber input can cause behavior that is similar to the interictal activity found in participating neurons. The black dot in Figure \u200bFigure11 shows the output from the CN neuron model, provided with a bursting Purkinje cell input, when it is subjected to clustering with the experimental data. Desynchronization of the burst occurrence in the input did not alter the position of the data point drastically[0]. Currently, we are in the process of applying an evolutionary algorithm to explore in detail the input conditions that can that lead to the spiking behavior that is associated with seizures. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: shows 2D projection, using principal component analysis, of the clusters formed as a result of GNG clustering of the CN neuron interictal activity using CV, Log-Interval Entropy, Firing rate and Permutation Entropy.

The proposed adversarial method named as triple-net GAN employs three connected networks: a generator network (G), a discriminator network (D) and a classifier network (C).

The outputs of G are transferred in a parallel way to the D and C.

This traditional expression is centered on the theory that absorption of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) follow a bell-shaped function skewed to the upper canopy. However, the validity of this theory has remained untested for a suite of canopy traits in a temperate forest ecosystem across multiple seasons using multispectral imagery. In this study, we examined the effect of canopy traits expression in modelling canopy traits using Sentinel-2 multispectral data across the growing season in Bavaria Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. To achieve this, we measured leaf mass per area (LMA), chlorophyll (Cab), nitrogen (N) and carbon content and LAI from the exposed upper and shaded lower canopy respectively over three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). Subsequently, we estimated canopy traits using two expressions, i.e. the traditional expression-based on the product of LAI and leaf traits content of samples collected from the sunlit upper canopy (hereinafter top-of-canopy expression) and the weighted expression - established on the proportion between the shaded lower and sunlit upper canopy LAI and their respective leaf traits content. Using a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we separately modelled canopy traits estimated from the two expressions using Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices. Our results showed that dry matter related canopy traits (LMA, N and carbon) estimated based on the weighted canopy expression yield stronger correlations and higher prediction accuracy (NRMSECV 0.48 \u00b5g/cm2) across all seasons. We also developed a generalized model that explained 52.57\u201367.82% variation in canopy traits across the three seasons. Using the most accurate Random Forest model for each season, we demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-2 data to map seasonal dynamics of canopy traits across the park. Results presented in this study revealed that canopy trait expression can have a profound effect on modelling the accuracy of canopy traits using satellite imagery throughout the growing seasons.

Segmentation algorithms are generally based on searching a region where pixels share similar gray level intensity and satisfy a set of defined criteria. However, the segmented region cannot be used directly for partial image retrieval. In this dissertation, a Contour Based Image Structure (CBIS) model is introduced. In this model, images are divided into several objects defined by their bounding contours. The bounding contour structure allows individual object extraction, and partial object matching and retrieval from a standard CBIS image structure. ::: The CBIS model allows the representation of 3D objects by their bounding contours which is suitable for parallel implementation particularly when extracting contour features and matching them for 3D images require heavy computations. This computational burden becomes worse for images with high resolution and large contour density. In this essence we designed two parallel algorithms; Contour Parallelization Algorithm (CPA) and Partial Retrieval Parallelization Algorithm (PRPA). Both algorithms have considerably improved the performance of CBIS for both contour shape matching as well as partial image retrieval. ::: To improve the effectiveness of CBIS in segmenting images with inhomogeneous backgrounds we used the phase congruency invariant features of Fourier transform components to highlight boundaries of objects prior to extracting their contours. The contour matching process has also been improved by constructing a fuzzy contour matching system that allows unbiased matching decisions. ::: Further improvements have been achieved through the use of a contour tailored Fourier descriptor to make translation and rotation invariance. It is proved to be suitable for general contour shape matching where translation, rotation, and scaling invariance are required. ::: For those images which are hard to be classified by object contours such as bacterial images, we define a multi-level cosine transform to extract their texture features for image classification. The low frequency Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients and Zenike moments derived from images are trained by Support Vector Machine (SVM) to generate multiple classifiers. ::: INDEX WORDS Image Processing, Content Based Image Retrieval, Image Segmentation, Image Shape Matching, XML Image Structure, 3D Reconstruction, 3D Partial Retrieval, Fourier Transform, Phase Congruency, Multi-level Cosine Transform, Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithm.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2409470968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125051532"}

However, reading medical images and making diagnosis or treatment recommendations require specially trained medical specialists. The current practice of reading medical images is labor-intensive, time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. It would be more desirable to have a computer-aided system that can automatically make diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Recent advances in deep learning enable us to rethink the ways of clinician diagnosis based on medical images. Early detection has proven to be critical to give patients the best chance of recovery and survival. Advanced computer-aided diagnosis systems are expected to have high sensitivities and small low positive rates. How to provide accurate diagnosis results and explore different types of clinical data is an important topic in the current computer-aided diagnosis research. In this thesis, we will introduce 1) mammograms for detecting breast cancers, the most frequently diagnosed solid cancer for U.S. women, 2) lung Computed Tomography (CT) images for detecting lung cancers, the most frequently diagnosed malignant cancer, and 3) head and neck CT images for automated delineation of organs at risk in radiotherapy. First, we will show how to employ the adversarial concept to generate the hard examples improving mammogram mass segmentation. Second, we will demonstrate how to use the weakly labelled data for the mammogram breast cancer diagnosis by efficiently design deep learning for multi-instance learning. Third, the thesis will walk through DeepLung system which combines deep 3D ConvNets and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for automated lung nodule detection and classification.

A general space encoding method is valuable for a multitude of tasks such asPOI search, land use classification, point-based spatial interpolation and locationaware image classification. However, no such general model exists to date beyond simply applying discretizing or feed forward nets to coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for encoding space and are critical for recognizing places and for path-integration. Inspired by this research, wepropose a representation learning model called Space2vec to encode the absolutepositions and spatial relationships of places. We conduct experiments on realworld geographic data and predict types of POIs at given positions based on their1) locations and 2) nearby POIs.

The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility and efficiency of SVM as a preprocessor. Our study analyzes different classification algorithms that are employed to predict the customers with caravan car policy based on his/her sociodemographic data and history of product ownership. A series of experiments was conducted to test various computational intelligence techniques viz., Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). Various standard balancing techniques such as under-sampling, over-sampling and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) are also employed. Subsequently, a strategy of data balancing for handling imbalanced distribution in data is proposed. The proposed approach first employs SVM as a preprocessor and the actual target values of training data are then replaced by the predictions of trained SVM. Later, this modified training data is used to train techniques such as MLP, LR, and RF.

Previous topic model approaches, such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have shown impressive success in discovering low-rank hidden structures for modeling text documents. These approaches, however do not take into account the manifold structure of the data, which is generally informative for nonlinear dimensionality reduction mapping. More recent topic model approaches, Laplacian PLSI (LapPLSI) and Locally-consistent Topic Model (LTM), have incorporated the local manifold structure into topic models and have shown resulting benefits. But they fall short of achieving full discriminating power of manifold learning as they only enhance the proximity between the low-rank representations of neighboring pairs without any consideration for non-neighboring pairs. In this article, we propose a new approach, Discriminative Topic Model (DTM), which separates non-neighboring pairs from each other in addition to bringing neighboring pairs closer together, thereby preserving the global manifold structure as well as improving local consistency.

However, most existing OOD detection methods rely heavily on manually labeled OOD samples and cannot take full advantage of unlabeled data. This limits the feasibility of these models in practical applications. ::: In this paper, we propose a novel model to generate high-quality pseudo OOD samples that are akin to IN-Domain (IND) input utterances, and thereby improves the performance of OOD detection. To this end, an autoencoder is trained to map an input utterance into a latent code. and the codes of IND and OOD samples are trained to be indistinguishable by utilizing a generative adversarial network.

His metaphor of ``wiring'' together what ``fires together'' matches very closely the common paradigm that global organization can derive from simple local rules. While ingenious at his time and inspiring the research over decades, the results still fall short of the expectations. For instance, unsupervised as they are, such neural mechanisms should be able to explain and realize the self-organized acquisition of sensorimotor competencies. This paper proposes a new synaptic law which replaces Hebb's original metaphor by that of ``chaining together'' what ``changes together''. Starting from differential Hebbian learning, the new rule grounds the behavior of the agent directly in the internal synaptic dynamics. Therefore, one may call this a behavior-driven synaptic plasticity. Neurorobotics is an ideal testing ground for this new, unsupervised learning rule. This paper focuses on the close coupling between body, control, and environment in challenging physical settings. The examples demonstrate how the new synaptic mechanism induces a self-determined ``search and converge'' strategy in behavior space, generating spontaneously a variety of sensorimotor competencies. The emerging behavior patterns are qualified by involving body and environment in an irreducible conjunction with the internal mechanism. The results may not only be of immediate interest for the further development of embodied intelligence. They also offer a new view on the role of self-learning processes in natural evolution and in the brain.

To overcome these challenges, we propose an automatic method in this paper to diagnose BV by quantitative analysis of bacterial morphotypes, which consists of a three-step approach, i.e., bacteria regions segmentation, overlapping bacteria splitting, and bacterial morphotypes classification. Specifically, we first segment the bacteria regions via saliency cut, which simultaneously evaluates the global contrast and spatial weighted coherence. And then Markov random field model is applied for high-quality unsupervised segmentation of small object. We then decompose overlapping bacteria clumps into markers, and associate a pixel with markers to identify evidence for eventual individual bacterium splitting. Next, we extract morphotype features from each bacterium to learn the descriptors and to characterize the types of bacteria using an Adaptive Boosting machine learning framework.

Furthermore, the growing use of e-mail has led to the emergence and further growth problems caused by unsolicited bulk e-mails, commonly referred to as spam e-mail. Many of the existing supervised algorithms like the Support Vector Machine (SVM) were developed to stop the spam e-mail. However, the problem of dealing with large data and high dimensionality of feature space can lead to high execution-time and low accuracy of spam e-mail classification. Nowadays, removing the irrelevant and redundant features beside finding the optimal (or near-optimal) subset of features significantly influences the performance of spam e-mail classification; this has become one of the important challenges. Therefore, in order to optimize spam e-mail classification accuracy, dimensional reduction issues need to be solved. Feature selection schemes become very important in order to reduce the dimensionality through selecting a proper subset feature to facilitate the classification process. The objective of this study is to investigate and improve schemes to reduce the execution time and increase the accuracy of spam e-mail classification. The methodology of this study comprises of four schemes: one-way ANOVA f-test, Binary Differential Evolution (BDE), Opposition Differential Evolution (ODE) and Opposition Particle Swarm Optimization (OPSO), and combination of Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The four schemes were used to improve the spam e-mail classification accuracy.

A number of approaches have been proposed to extend the original binary SVM to an all-in-one multiclass SVM. However, its direct extension to a unified multilabel SVM has not been widely investigated. We propose a straightforward extension to the SVM to cope with multiclass and multilabel classification problems within a unified framework. Our framework deviates from the conventional soft margin SVM framework with its direct oppositional structure. In our formulation, class-specific weight vectors (normal vectors) are learned by maximizing their margin with respect to an origin and penalizing patterns when they get too close to this origin. As a result, each weight vector chooses an orientation and a magnitude with respect to this origin in such a way that it best represents the patterns belonging to its corresponding class. Opposition between classes is introduced into the formulation via the minimization of pairwise inner products of weight vectors. We also extend our framework to cope with nonlinear separability via standard reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). Biases which are closely related to the origin need to be treated properly in both the original feature space and Hilbert space. We have the flexibility to incorporate constraints into the formulation (if they better reflect the underlying geometry) and improve the performance of the classifier. To this end, specifics and technicalities such as the origin in RKHS are addressed.

Substantial experiments on KDD 99 intrusion benchmark indicate that our model outperforms other state of the art learning algorithms, with significantly improved detection accuracy, minimal false alarms and relatively small computational complexity.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": "0911.0485", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 083-091, October 2009, USA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2135703295,2949790301,2963786907", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["44508583", "21036931", "6345780", "6093110", "15087039", "207616703", "9939887", "195713050", "7737916", "483366", "62263407", "16071977", "62195333", "3176887", "18900231", "46571120", "9156200", "62637527", "13012539", "16801587", "2157536", "16864206", "41230035", "45955615", "6266210", "1307215", "6644398", "15189518", "208152", "42546822"], "inbound_citations": ["15346971", "12390276", "16810467", "16810467", "47021799", "202896159", "215153474", "18706261", "43885992", "59140203", "198934785", "67893263", "15766240", "18696869", "35102274", "55157497", "16484496", "53242938", "12120", "210153119", "18502604"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17417625"}

We cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we jointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator---analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test--- to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. The outputs from the discriminator are then used as rewards for the generative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemble human dialogues. ::: In addition to adversarial training we describe a model for adversarial {\\em evaluation} that uses success in fooling an adversary as a dialogue evaluation metric, while avoiding a number of potential pitfalls. Experimental results on several metrics, including adversarial evaluation, demonstrate that the adversarially-trained system generates higher-quality responses than previous baselines.", "year": 2017,

In addition, large thermal preference variance amongst people requires the development of personal thermal comfort models, rather than group-based methodologies such as predicted mean vote (PMV). This study focuses on assessing wearable solutions with the aim to predict personal thermal preference. We collected physiological signals (e.g., skin temperature, heart rate) of 14 subjects (6 female and 8 male adults) and environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation) for two weeks (at least 20 hr/d) to infer personal real-time thermal preference. The subjects reported their real-time thermal sensation and preference using cell-phones approximately every hour. We trained a Random Forest algorithm using data collected from individuals to develop a personal comfort model with the objective to predict thermal preference. The results show that subjects expressed needs for \"warmer\" or \"cooler\" conditions at about 30% (from 21% to 88%) of their daily time on average, implying the strong demand for a personalized indoor thermal comfort. In addition, the personal comfort model using Random Forest can infer individual thermal preference with a mean accuracy of 75% (53-93%) using physiological and environmental parameters, demonstrating the strengths of the proposed data-driven method.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2940898493", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53024096", "204743887", "204246628", "203837617", "209373410"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149722891"}

This effort achieved the top score in Task A on supervised stance detection, producing an average F1 score of 67.8 when assessing whether a tweet author was in favor or against a topic. We employed a recurrent neural network initialized with features learned via distant supervision on two large unlabeled datasets.

Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of deep learning algorithms which are capable of learning the patterns and creating new patterns. In this paper, Generative Adversarial Networks is used for procedural content generation for original textures synthesis for video game development. This method is used by video game designers for autonomous redesigning of objects and environment textures. This process saves significant time and cost in video game development. The particular attention in this paper is on procedural synthesis of ground surface textures. The generated texture samples are visually acceptable and have mean score of 2.45 with 0.1 standard deviation after 2K iteration. Also the discriminator loss of generated samples reached 0.74 at the final stage of training.

To- ward a Unified Theory of Development: Connectionism and Dynamic Systems Theory Re-Considered. Oxford Uni- versity Press, pages 86-118 Dynamical Systems thinking has been influential in the way psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists think about sensori-motor behavior and its development. The ini- tial emphasis on motor behavior was expanded when the con- cept of dynamic activation fields provided access to embodied cognition. Dynamical Field Theory (DFT) offers a frame- work for thinking about representation-in-the-moment that is firmly grounded in both Dynamical Systems thinking and neurophysiology. Dynamic Neural Fields are formalizations of how neural populations represent the continuous dimen- sions that characterize perceptual features, movements, and cognitive decisions. Neural fields evolve dynamically under the influence of inputs as well as strong neuronal interaction, generating elementary forms of cognition through dynamical instabilities. The concepts of DFT establish links between brain and behavior, helping to define experimental paradigms in which behavioral signatures of specific neural mechanisms can be observed. These paradigms can be modeled with Dy- namic Neural Fields, deriving testable predictions and pro- viding quantitative accounts of behavior. One obstacle for researchers wishing to use DFT has been that the mathematical and technical skills required to make these concepts operational are not part of the standard reper- toire of cognitive scientists. The goal of this tutorial is, there- fore, to provide the training and tools to overcome this obsta- cle. We will provide a systematic introduction to the central concepts of DFT and their grounding in both Dynamical Sys- tems concepts and neurophysiology. We will discuss the con- crete mathematical implementation of these concepts in Dy- namic Neural Field models, giving all needed background and providing participants with some hands-on experience using interactive simulators in MATLAB. We will review robotic implementations to make the ideas concrete. Finally, we will take participants through a number of selected, exem- plary case studies in which the concepts and associated mod- els have been used to ask questions about elementary forms of embodied cognition and their development. The interactive simulators will be available at the tutorial. We will take participants through the process of building and simulating models. We will use online tools available now 2.

We have classified over 6600 scenes of Landsat TM data after 2006, and over 2300 scenes of Landsat TM and ETM+ data before 2006, all selected from the green season. These images cover most of the world's land surface except Antarctica and Greenland. Most of these images came from the United States Geological Survey in level L1T orthorectified. Four classifiers that were freely available were employed, including the conventional maximum likelihood classifier MLC, J4.8 decision tree classifier, Random Forest RF classifier and support vector machine SVM classifier. A total of 91,433 training samples were collected by traversing each scene and finding the most representative and homogeneous samples. A total of 38,664 test samples were collected at preset, fixed locations based on a globally systematic unaligned sampling strategy. Two software tools, Global Analyst and Global Mapper developed by extending the functionality of Google Earth, were used in developing the training and test sample databases by referencing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer enhanced vegetation index MODIS EVI time series for 2010 and high resolution images from Google Earth. A unique land-cover classification system was developed that can be crosswalked to the existing United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO land-cover classification system as well as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme IGBP system. Using the four classification algorithms, we obtained the initial set of global land-cover maps. The SVM produced the highest overall classification accuracy OCA of 64.9% assessed with our test samples, with RF 59.8%, J4.8 57.9%, and MLC 53.9% ranked from the second to the fourth. We also estimated the OCAs using a subset of our test samples 8629 each of which represented a homogeneous area greater than 500 m \u00d7 500 m. Using this subset, we found the OCA for the SVM to be 71.5%. As a consistent source for estimating the coverage of global land-cover types in the world, estimation from the test samples shows that only 6.90% of the world is planted for agricultural production.

However, assessing N status of tall perennial crops such as oil palm is complex and not as straightforward as assessing annual crops, due to complex N partitioning, age, and larger amounts of respiratory loads. Hence, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential of spectral measurements obtained from leaf scale and machine learning approaches as a rapid tool for quantifying oil palm N status. This study involved assessing the performance of discriminant analysis (DA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for discriminating spectral bands sensitive to N sufficiency levels and comparing the predictive accuracy of DA and SVM for classifying N status of immature and mature oil palms. The experiment was conducted on immature Tenera seedlings (13 months old) and mature Tenera palm stands (9 and 12 years old) that were arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design with treatments varied from 0 to 2 kg N. Generally, the discriminant function of both classifiers was age-dependent. A clear trade-off between the classifiers\u2019 number of spectral bands and their accuracies was observed; the DA with a larger number of optimal spectral bands could discriminate N sufficiency levels of all maturity classes with higher accuracies compared to the SVM, yet the latter could produce reasonable accuracies with a lesser number of spectral bands. N status of all maturity classes could be classified satisfactorily with SVM (71\u201388%) via the satellite-simulated blue and green bands, signifying the possibility to develop spectral index or an N-sensitive sensor for oil palm.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/01431161.2017.1372862", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2751083419", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134081441", "135245342"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134630635"}

Most of the Re-ID algorithms conduct supervised training in some small labeled datasets, so directly deploying these trained models to the real-world large camera networks may lead to a poor performance due to underfitting. The significant difference between the source training dataset and the target testing dataset makes it challenging to incrementally optimize the model. To address this challenge, we propose a novel solution by transforming the unlabeled images in the target domain to fit the original classifier by using our proposed similarity preserved generative adversarial networks model, SimPGAN. Specifically, SimPGAN adopts the generative adversarial networks with the cycle consistency constraint to transform the unlabeled images in the target domain to the style of the source domain. Meanwhile, SimPGAN uses the similarity consistency loss, which is measured by a siamese deep convolutional neural network, to preserve the similarity of the transformed images of the same person.

The proposed model determines the performance metrics for workload prior to the co-operation of autonomic computing characteristics. Thus, CBR provides optimal scheduling of resources and workload monitoring for cloud data centers. In order to validate the proposed CBR-based prediction model, we perform a series of experiments and evaluate the effectiveness in terms of precision, recall, f-measure, and mean square error rate.

In this chapter, we extend this biological motivation from humans to animals more generally, but with a focus on the central nervous systems in its relationship to the bodies of these creatures. In particular, we investigate the sensorimotor loop in the execution of sophisticated behavior. Some of these sections concentrate on cases where vision provides key sensory data. Neuroethology is the study of the brain mechanisms underlying animal behavior, and Sect. 77.2 exemplifies the lessons it has to offer robotics by looking at optic flow in bees, visually guided behavior in frogs, and navigation in rats, turning then to the coordination of behaviors and the role of attention. Brains are composed of diverse subsystems, many of which are relevant to robotics, but we have chosen just two regions of the mammalian brain for detailed analysis. Section 77.3 presents the cerebellum. While we can plan and execute actions without a cerebellum, the actions are no longer graceful and become uncoordinated. We reveal how a cerebellum can provide a key ingredient in an adaptive control system, tuning parameters both within and between motor schemas. Section 77.4 turns to the mirror system, which provides shared representations which bridge between the execution of an action and the observation of that action when performed by others. We develop a neurobiological model of how learning may forge mirror neurons for hand movements, provide a Bayesian view of a robot mirror system, and discuss what must be added to a mirror system to support robot imitation. We conclude by emphasizing that, while neuroscience can inspire novel robotic designs, it is also the case that robots can be used as embodied test beds for the analysis of brain models.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-32552-1_77", "venue": "Springer Handbook of Robotics, 2nd Ed.", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1582232668", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["146425277", "60800063", "555608", "37820497", "9605619", "83672843", "122566861", "58511329", "141650142", "61438242", "43465050", "122508976", "1131164", "142644595", "1648181", "192973793", "2894096", "143451743", "15192655", "802621", "11714140", "11757034", "142774685", "793980", "124899443", "14505318", "192077", "16901865", "40057049", "13461075", "16353514", "2246271", "20690516", "22542566", "8892385", "17538093", "59677428", "113882175", "149366614", "83255470", "758863", "331616", "53807430", "5055086", "13309992", "18998331", "7520532", "35813989", "5889345", "2033342", "140969329", "42296795", "9821505", "6792943", "207750120", "14705879", "58728512", "16447203", "33350734", "6351794", "1874331", "20186027", "5639035", "3081461", "17648373", "369687", "9067338", "11568972", "15148826", "16734520", "5792022"], "inbound_citations": ["115133217", "13577", "176279", "86848072", "52012600", "11765304", "11111911", "211137221", "24357250"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2266221"}

Environmental variables are commonly used to build soil salinity prediction model. However, few researches have been done to summarize the environmental sensitive variables for soil electrical conductivity (EC) estimation systematically. Additionally, the performance of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and Random Forest regression (RFR) model, the representative of current main methods for soil EC prediction, has not been explored. Taking the north of Yinchuan plain irrigation oasis as the study area, the feasibility and potential of 64 environmental variables, extracted from the Landsat 8 remote sensed images in dry season and wet season, the digital elevation model, and other data, were assessed through the correlation analysis and the performance of MLR, GWR, and RFR model on soil salinity estimation was compared. The results showed that: 1) 10 of 15 imagery texture and spectral band reflectivity environmental variables extracted from Landsat 8 image in dry season were significantly correlated with soil EC, while only 3 of these indices extracted from Landsat 8 image in wet season have significant correlation with soil EC.

Generally, when the sample size ($N$) is much bigger than the number of features ($d$), DL often outperforms other machine learning (ML) techniques, often through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, in many bioinformatics fields (including metagenomics), we encounter the opposite situation where $d$ is significantly greater than $N$. In these situations, applying DL techniques would lead to severe overfitting. Here we aim to improve classification of various diseases with metagenomic data through the use of CNNs. For this we proposed to represent metagenomic data as images. The proposed Met2Img approach relies on taxonomic and t-SNE embeddings to transform abundance data into\"synthetic images\". We applied our approach to twelve benchmark data sets including more than 1400 metagenomic samples. Our results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). We observe that the integration of phylogenetic information alongside abundance data improves classification.

Variations in lighting conditions, environment and pose changes across camera views make re-identification a challenging problem. Previous methods address these challenges by designing specific features or by learning a distance function. We propose a hierarchical feature learning framework that learns invariant representations from labeled image pairs. A mapping is learned such that the extracted features are invariant for images belonging to same individual across views. To learn robust representations and to achieve better generalization to unseen data, the system has to be trained with a large amount of data. Critically, most of the person re-identification datasets are small. Manually augmenting the dataset by partial corruption of input data introduces additional computational burden as it requires several training epochs to converge.

A multi-dimensional heterogeneous space model is presented for a range of geological characteristic parameters prediction, such as formation pore pressure, formation drillability, rock strength, lithology and so on. Then the model is applied to the formation drillability prediction with the parameter of seismic layer velocity, acoustic velocity, formation density, shale content, drilling pressure, rotary speed, hydraulic horsepower, bottom hole differential pressure, rate of penetration and formation depth. Firstly, Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is used to extract the feature of the parameters, and then Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine (QPSO-SVM) is utilized as the information fusion algorithm. The comparison of the prediction results with the results of backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) indicates that this method is better than BP neural network in a variety of performance and has the advantages of higher accuracy and better generalization ability.

Using the machine learning algorithms to measure blood pressure at a continuous rate is a feasible way to provide models and analysis for telemedicine monitoring data and predicting blood pressure. For this paper, we applied the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) whilst predicting blood pressure rates based on the human physiological data collected by the EIMO device.

When predicting the blood pressure of a single individual, calculating the systolic pressure displays an accuracy rate of above 70% and above 64% for calculating diastolic pressure with GBDT, with the prediction time being less than 0.1s.

The samples were divided into training, test, and validation samples. We used the training and test samples (n=135) to identify which sample characteristics discriminate between positive and negative samples, and to build machine learning algorithms interpreting these characteristics.

Spam filtering, fraud detection, and user query-intent analysis has relied heavily on machine learned classifiers, and resulted in improvements in robust classification accuracy. Combining multiple classifiers (a.k.a. Ensemble Learning) is a well studied and has been known to improve effectiveness of a classifier. To address two key challenges in Ensemble Learning-- (1) learning weights of individual classifiers and (2) the combination rule of their weighted responses, this paper proposes a novel Ensemble classifier, EnLR, that computes weights of responses from discriminative classifiers and combines their weighted responses to produce a single response for a test instance. The combination rule is based on aggregating weighted responses, where a weight of an individual classifier is inversely based on their respective variances around their responses. Here, variance quantifies the uncertainty of the discriminative classifiers' parameters, which in turn depends on the training samples. As opposed to other ensemble methods where the weight of each individual classifier is learned as a part of parameter learning and thus the same weight is applied to all testing instances, our model is actively adjusted as individual classifiers become confident at its decision for a test instance. Our empirical experiments on various data sets demonstrate that our combined classifier produces \"effective\" results when compared with a single classifier. Our novel classifier shows statistically significant better accuracy when compared to well known Ensemble methods -- Bagging and AdaBoost. In addition to robust accuracy, our model is extremely efficient dealing with high volumes of training samples due to the independent learning paradigm among its multiple classifiers.

In this work, we propose the detection of malware on X86-based IoT devices in an autonomous driving approach combining fusion features from static analysis and machine learning to solve problems of resource overhead for dynamic analysis and low accuracy of the static analysis. First, a feature extraction model based on the level of operation code is designed. Then fusion features at three different levels are extracted through unpacking programs. Finally, a detection model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to discover malware on X86-based IoT devices in autonomous driving. On this basis, a malware detection approach based on fusion features is demonstrated. After that, we compare our approach with other identification approaches on a dataset consisting of 4169 samples, which includes 2379 malware and 1790 benign programs. Experimental results show that fusion features can significantly increase the recognition rate. Moreover, XGBoost has a higher recognition accuracy than other mainstream classification algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MWC.2019.1800505", "venue": "IEEE Wireless Communications", "journal": "IEEE Wireless Communications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2969676115", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4518902", "8622668", "3833381", "29151253", "3355912", "6350280", "19188849", "35264675", "64726500", "44175270", "52149515", "52947558", "14578848"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201620257"}

The program also provides specific modules that enable the user to fine-tune classification accuracy, to formalize the annotation of lncRNA classes and to identify lncRNAs even in the absence of a training set of non-coding RNAs. We used FEELnc on a real data set comprising 20 canine RNA-seq samples produced by the European LUPA consortium to substantially expand the canine genome annotation to include 10 374 novel lncRNAs and 58 640 mRNA transcripts.

A major barrier to the success of this treatment is donor-recipient HLA mismatch (MM). HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 MMs have been associated with early and severe acute GvHD and low survival rate. However, the extent and type of HLA MMs that modulate undesirable immune responses remains unclear. The present study examines the effect of HLA MM at amino acid sequence level on day 100 survival (D100S). From 3,855 SCTs facilitated by the NMDP from 1988 to 2004, we selected 2,107 recipients with early- or intermediate-stage ALL, AML, CML, or MDS who were either matched with their donors at HLA-DRB1 but had a single HLA-class I MM at HLA-A (n=179), B (n=88), or C (n=333), or who were matched at HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 (n=1,507). In this study population, of over 270 amino acid positions in each HLA class I loci, 59 amino acid positions had at least one amino acid substitution (AAS) in HLA-A, 46 positions in HLA-B, and 46 positions in HLA-C, for a total of 151 positions in HLA-A, B, and C. A common approach to study the effect of AAS on SCT outcome is to perform separate analyses for individual substitutions (e.g., Kawase et al ., Blood, 110: 2235\u201341, 2007). This approach may be inadequate as SCT outcome is potentially influenced by all AAS positions as well as between-position interactions. However, traditional regression techniques to model between-position interactions are problematic owing to the proliferation of indicator variables required for encoding a large number of highly multilevel unordered categorical covariates (i.e., AAS positions) and attendant interactions. We applied Random Forests (RF) as a screening procedure to identify a small subset of important AAS positions associated with D100S for more thorough statistical analyses. RF is a tree-based method for classification based on an ensemble of classification trees built by a doubly random process (Breiman, Machine Learning, 45: 5\u201332, 2001). These trees are then combined through a voting process that assigns the class with the most votes to be the individual\u2019s predicted class. Unlike the traditional regression models RF is a non-parametric procedure that makes no assumptions about the form of underlying relationships between the predictor variables and the target variable. RF provides a robust ranking of variable importance that can be used to weed out predictors unlikely to be associated with the outcome and is useful in areas of biology where hundreds to thousands of eligible predictors need to be examined. For example, Lunetta et al . (BMC Genetics, 5:32,2004) applied RF to identify a small set of relevant SNPs in a large-scale genome-wide association study and showed that as the number of interacting SNPs increases, the improvement in performance of RF relative to univariate Fisher exact test for screening also increases. We carried out a RF analysis on 2,107 patient-donor pairs by specifying 151 AAS position variables and 4 patient characteristic variables (age, disease, disease status, and patient-donor gender match) as predictors of D100S. Using a RF of 500 trees and Gini criterion for measuring variable importance the following 16 variables, listed in order of importance, were identified by RF to be predictive of D100S: age, disease stage, HLA-C 116, HLA-C 156, HLA-A 152, HLA-C 99, HLA-C 219, HLA-A 9, HLA-C 9, disease type, gender match, HLA-B 116, HLA-A 156, HLA-A 62, HLA-A 114, and HLA-C 97. This list confirms some of the AAS positions previously identified in the literature. In summary, RF is a useful screening tool that enables us to identify a small number of AAS position variables as important predictors of D100S. The positions and types of these AAS will be further investigated using more traditional multivariate regression techniques to elucidate the complex effect of specific HLA mismatches and their interactions.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2555617410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88760382"}

Using data from more than 200,000 forest plots in eastern North America and Random Forest, we evaluated the performance of species abundance models (SAM) in predicting the relative abundance (measured as importance value) of each of 105 tree species in relation to climate, edaphic, and topographic variables. We calculated the coefficient of determination R SAM 2 between observed and predicted abundances as a measure of model performance for each species. We also performed multiple linear regressions to explain variation of R SAM 2 among species using five biogeographical or spatial attributes of species as explanatory variables. Predictive performances of SAM R SAM 2 were generally low, ranging from 0.016 to 0.815 (mean = 0.258). Black spruce (Picea mariana) had the best predictive model and Florida maple (Acer barbatum) and American chestnut (Castanea dentata) the worst. Thirty-seven of the 41 best performing species R SAM 2 \u2a7e 0.3 had climate ranked as the best and/or second best predictor. Species with the best performance tended to be those that could reach dominance, showed aggregated distribution of abundance, and/or had high latitudinal limits in the study area. Climate change is likely to affect patterns of dominance in communities by altering patterns of co-occurrences, but for many species that constitute the bulk of tree diversity, predictions based solely on the current distribution of relative abundances may not be reliable enough to inform conservation or management decisions.

However, reducing the radiation dose will inevitably cause server noise and affect radiologists\u2019 judgment and confidence. Hence, progressive low-dose CT (LDCT) image reconstruction methods must be developed to improve image quality. Over the past two years, deep learning-based approaches have shown impressive performance in noise reduction for LDCT images. Most existing deep learning-based approaches usually require the paired training dataset which the LDCT images correspond to the normal-dose CT (NDCT) images one-to-one, but the acquisition of well-paired datasets requires multiple scans, resulting the increase of radiation dose. Therefore, well-paired datasets are not readily available. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes an unpaired LDCT image denoising network based on cycle generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) with prior image information which does not require a one-to-one training dataset. In this method, cyclic loss, an important trick in unpaired image-to-image translation, promises to map the distribution from LDCT to NDCT by using unpaired training data. Furthermore, to guarantee the accurate correspondence of the image content between the output and NDCT, the prior information obtained from the result preprocessed using the LDCT image is integrated into the network to supervise the generation of content. Given the map of distribution through the cyclic loss and the supervision of content through the prior image loss, our proposed method can not only reduce the image noise but also retain critical information.

In recent years, research in object tracking has focussed on designing tracking methods that do not rely on a pre-learned model of the object and are therefor able to track any kind of object. As a result, online learning of an object model is used in virtually all new methods. However, these tracking methods often fail when presented with articulated objects or when an object rotates enough that parts become visible that haven\u2019t been seen before. Furthermore, these methods rely purely on texture and have no notion of object shape. Additionaly, almost no existing tracking method processes images fast enough to be practically applied in Robotics applications. Affordable depth sensors have started to become popular. These sensors work as normal cameras, but with an additional depth channel. This depth information contains information about the shape of objects, which can be used to recognize the difference between object and background, or to learn a more accurate model of the object of interest. In this work, novel methods are introduced to improve tracker accuracy. Acknowledging that introducing novel methods, tracking speeds are likely to decrease, two additional methods of increasing the tracker speed are proposed. K-means clustering and local searching are applied to increase tracker speed, while depth information is used in two ways to improve accuracy. Gaussian Mixture Modelling of the depth histogram is applied to segment object from background and shape features based on local curvature are used in a Random Forests classification method to learn an object model that includes shape information.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "194779095", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58560069"}

The proposed method benefits from Statistical Region Merging (SRM) algorithm for object extraction as well as Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification of the objects. A Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based preprocessing step is also provided in order to smooth each band of the multi/hyperspectral data. The SRM-based object extraction step is then applied to the smoothed data and the spectral features of the outcomes are used in the classification process. The parameters of the PDE-based smoothing algorithm are adaptively tuned according to the data texture. The adaptation process is based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and an innovative fitness function. The efficiency of the proposed GA-PDE-based method as well as the effect of using different values of SRM and PDE parameters on the gained results are evaluated using different criteria. The first measure is the enhancement level in the classification ratios after applying the object-based method. The other measures which are used in this paper are the computational time of the proposed method, the object-to-pixel ratio and finally a recently developed metric which assesses the segmentation efficiency via defining an upper bound for the overall accuracy of classification.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12524-015-0515-8", "venue": "Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing", "journal": "Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2426671420", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60633363", "961425", "16008390", "206691761", "15540318", "57258745", "61665483", "119518249", "120898406", "25319553", "206400957", "595377", "27700472", "14502908", "123208636", "41359509"], "inbound_citations": ["55422416", "62832218"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62961260"}

The objective of feature selection (FS) is to improve the performance of the prediction. This contributes to providing a better definition of the features, feature structure, feature ranking, feature selection functions, efficient search techniques, and feature validation methods. In this study, a retrieval method that integrates correlation and linear forward selection algorithms to evaluate and generate the subset of clinical features are present. The objective of the research is to find the optimal features of a cancer dataset and to classify the disease into multiple cancer stages: one, two, three, and four. The research methodology is developed based on data mining, knowledge data discovery with four phases: pre-processing, resampling, feature selection, and classification. The proposed Bayesian Relevance Feedback (BRF) for classification is also described to resolve the zero value of posterior probabilities, concentrating on increasing the accuracy in the diagnosis of cancer stages. The experimental works are done on oral cancer dataset by applying WEKA. The analysis on accuracy performance was done on several classification algorithms using 15 optimal features that were chosen by a hybrid features selection method.

Moreover, the flexibility of this type of representation allows both polysemy and ambiguity to be treated identically, and suggests how neologisms can be handled. Although the use of distributed representations in psychology is not very widespread, these ideas are continually explored because of the demonstrations of their utility in a variety of different domains. The chapter also explores the effects following the resolution of the ambiguity. When asked, people are able to generate more than one meaning of an ambiguous word. The alternative meaning of an ambiguous word can be accessed by habituating the connections. Consistent with empirical findings, access of the alternative meaning is more likely when the subordinate meaning is given initially.", "year": 1988, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-08-051013-2.50012-4", "venue": "Lexical Ambiguity Resolution", "journal": "Lexical Ambiguity Resolution", "mag_id": "1551307421", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18278925", "9325794", "35854055", "16074725", "15495668", "10764579", "198159", "30165868", "22193125", "61988968", "3211177", "13015468", "16629052", "9289155", "17191443", "170827041", "15573558", "7865401", "1825817", "7312458", "17663354", "2746742", "6277458", "13965947", "15668571", "7069311"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118585972"}

The Manipuri news corpus has been manually annotated with the major NE tags, namely Person name , Location name , Organization name and Miscellaneous name to apply SVM. The SVM based system makes use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of orthographic word-level features which are helpful in predicting the NE classes. In addition, lexical context patterns generated using the active learning technique have been used as the features of SVM in order to improve performance. The system has been trained and tested with 28,629 and 4,763 wordforms, respectively.

However, additional information about target properties can potentially be recovered if the waveform shape is preserved in the fusion process. This paper proposes a \u201cvoxelization\u201d method to register FWL data to HI by dividing the waveform data into voxels, and then synthesizing all waveforms which intersect a voxel column into one three-dimensional superposition waveform: the synthesized waveform (SWF). A vertical energy distribution coefficients (VEDC) feature is proposed for extracting features from SWF, and then the SWF and HI are fused to form a complete feature space for classification. A pairwise classifier was adapted and completed using both Maximum Likelihood and Support Vector Machine classifiers for the combined SWF/HI features. Results show that this method of generating SWF from FWL data can effectively preserve information from the original waveforms, and the fusion of SWF and HI enhanced land cover classification compared to both using either data set alone or the merging of HI with a discrete LiDAR return point cloud.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2015.05.012", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "897634805", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56517392", "125947287", "104293395", "23281755", "19784587", "197526155", "198428021", "53585012", "4166027", "51965506", "11773332", "202180133", "49577614", "28520811", "56481715", "134722518", "55363399"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117964623"}

Users can write text in the air as if they were using an imaginary blackboard. Motion sensing is done wirelessly by accelerometers and gyroscopes which are attached to the back of the hand. We propose a two-stage approach for spotting and recognition of handwriting gestures. The spotting stage uses a Support Vector Machine to identify data segments which contain handwriting. The recognition stage uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to generate the text representation from the motion sensor data. Individual characters are modeled by HMMs and concatenated to word models. Our system can continuously recognize arbitrary sentences, based on a freely definable vocabulary with over 8000 words. A statistical language model is used to enhance recognition performance and restrict the search space. We report the results from a nine-user experiment on sentence recognition for person dependent and person independent setups on 3d-space handwriting data. For the person independent setup, a word error rate of 11% is achieved, for the person dependent setup 3% are achieved. We evaluate the spotting algorithm in a second experiment on a realistic dataset including everyday activities and achieve a sample based recall of 99\\% and a precision of 25%.

Time series data (i.e. machining force from the process), which has transient, nonlinear, and non-stationary characteristics, was collected by a data acquisition system. Three status detection features including the maximum force, peak-to-peak force value, and the variance of the collected lateral machining force, were extracted to classify the state of the nanomachining process. Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machines (DAGSVM) with a Gaussian Radial Basis Kernel Function (RBF Kernel) was constructed to identify the different process states. Using this multi-class SVM, the machining process and the tip wear can be classified into three regions, which are effective machining with a sharp tip, transition region and bad/no machining with severe tip wear. The experimental data showed that the accuracy of the SVM was over 94.73% in both binary and ternary classifications, which confirmed that the SVM-based pattern recognition technology via time series data could successfully monitor the tip wear and process performance for tip-based nanomachining process.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmapro.2019.01.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Manufacturing Processes", "mag_id": "2910974444", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140087159"}

All this data hold valuable knowledge that can be used to improve hospital decision making. Data mining techniques aim precisely at the extraction of useful knowledge from raw data. This work describes an implementation of a medical data mining project approach based on the CRISP-DM methodology. Recent real-world data, from 2000 to 2013, were collected from a Portuguese hospital and related with inpatient hospitalization. The goal was to predict generic hospital Length Of Stay based on indicators that are commonly available at the hospitalization process (e.g., gender, age, episode type, medical specialty). At the data preparation stage, the data were cleaned and variables were selected and transformed, leading to 14 inputs. Next, at the modeling stage, a regression approach was adopted, where six learning methods were compared: Average Prediction, Multiple Regression, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network ensemble, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. The best learning model was obtained by the Random Forest method, which presents a high quality coefficient of determination value (0.81). This model was then opened by using a sensitivity analysis procedure that revealed three influential input attributes: the hospital episode type, the physical service where the patient is hospitalized and the associated medical specialty. Such extracted knowledge confirmed that the obtained predictive model is credible and with potential value for supporting decisions of hospital managers.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-22348-3_9", "venue": "ICEIS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1919675552", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60842791", "6950845", "12872746", "11100397", "19094609", "18325012", "69108770", "3226814", "45726832", "32258800", "1418217", "15240569", "10072206", "31588985", "140109802", "2214159"], "inbound_citations": ["21687996", "210952073", "209497721"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8963664"}
