Given that images from distinct classes in fine-grained classification share significant features of interest, we present a new deep network architecture that explicitly models shared features and removes their effect to achieve enhanced classification results. Our modeling of shared features is based on a new group based learning wherein existing classes are divided into groups and multiple shared feature patterns are discovered (learned). We call this framework Group based deep Shared Feature Learning (GSFL) and the resulting learned network as GSFL-Net. Specifically, the proposed GSFL-Net develops a specially designed autoencoder which is constrained by a newly proposed Feature Expression Loss to decompose a set of features into their constituent shared and discriminative components. During inference, only the discriminative feature component is used to accomplish the classification task. A key benefit of our specialized autoencoder is that it is versatile and can be combined with state-of-the-art fine-grained feature extraction models and trained together with them to improve their performance directly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GSFL-Net can enhance classification accuracy over the state of the art with a more interpretable architecture.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2004.01817", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3014894113,3023286166", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11617315", "7530403", "1325997", "206595459", "6161478", "4242479", "1532984", "3231460", "206594692", "6099034", "2053770", "14342571", "8970727", "15080437", "1331231", "12916936", "459456", "2118703", "3267113", "5726681", "19429476", "7102424", "206771654", "14124313", "206592484", "52957198", "4711865", "1757271", "2258583", "50788959", "11914643", "17333257", "9757556", "16421909", "6882979", "6789015"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214802188"}

The need has thus arisen for the development of computational methods aimed at improving cancer subtyping and biomarker identification from multi-modal data. Here we apply the Integrative Network Fusion (INF) pipeline, which combines multiple omics layers exploiting Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) within a machine learning predictive framework. INF includes a feature ranking scheme (rSNF) on SNF-integrated features, used by a classifier over juxtaposed multi-omics features (juXT). In particular, we show instances of INF implementing Random Forest (RF) and linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) as the classifier, and two baseline RF and LSVM models are also trained on juXT. A compact RF model, called rSNFi, trained on the intersection of top-ranked biomarkers from the two approaches juXT and rSNF is finally derived. All the classifiers are run in a 10\u00d75-fold cross-validation schema to warrant reproducibility, following the guidelines for an unbiased Data Analysis Plan by the US FDA-led initiatives MAQC/SEQC. INF is demonstrated on four classification tasks on three multi-modal TCGA oncogenomics datasets. Gene expression, protein abundances and copy number variants are used to predict estrogen receptor status (BRCA-ER, N=381) and breast invasive carcinoma subtypes (BRCA-subtypes, N=305), while gene expression, miRNA expression and methylation data is used as predictor layers for acute myeloid leukemia and renal clear cell carcinoma survival (AML-OS, N=157; KIRC-OS, N=181). In test, INF achieved similar Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) values and 97% to 83% smaller feature sizes (FS), compared with juXT for BRCA-ER (MCC: 0.83 vs 0.80; FS: 56 vs 1801) and BRCA-subtypes (0.84 vs 0.80; 302 vs 1801), improving KIRC-OS performance (0.38 vs 0.31; 111 vs 2319). INF predictions are generally more accurate in test than one-dimensional omics models, with smaller signatures too, where transcriptomics consistently play the leading role. Overall, the INF framework effectively integrates multiple data levels in oncogenomics classification tasks, improving over the performance of single layers alone and naive juxtaposition, and provides compact signature sizes1.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/2020.04.01.020685", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3014559175", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["44715573", "90651670", "9033318", "205274784", "28070551", "208577819", "85543530", "91464438", "85445696", "89141", "52874011", "215649672", "6923178", "2085071", "17006983", "209528322", "7491529", "14039553", "26143375", "10659969", "4686855", "31636937", "2906936", "28513087", "18217756", "211215903", "15468051", "73504360", "206659235", "53244226", "3641284", "195847758", "18003714", "204942663", "3797894", "208957973", "16876183", "92117365", "203781207", "209481723", "6107827", "23491937", "214533279", "195830791", "58950737", "4775104", "215383295", "91077070", "205900737", "209543830", "69196533", "53215089", "53113465", "208318967", "207962979", "4363729", "92444042", "52081932", "49341843", "59599683", "215126976", "211084518", "51625983", "2675854", "196654023", "92273338", "73514038", "210709357", "13816996", "27755662", "215217260", "3944857", "117717033", "52826431", "207898258", "215364274", "58611479", "211234460", "196676422", "133608952", "208601186", "108293655", "145869601", "3845614", "51937353", "3692726", "73727185", "155102398", "43953167"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214807360"}

Electronic Health Records (EHR) play an important role for the redefinition of phenotypes in view of the wealth and heterogeneity of information now available from disparate data sources. A recent cross-sectional retrospective study has described the potential of EHR toward type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) screening when ad hoc models are used. About 10,000 US patients have been analyzed through a variety of inference techniques applied to all records with a variable degree of completeness. The analyses conducted in the reference study have indicated that EHR phenotypes significantly improved T2D detection. Methods. With these US patients and the T2D data evidenced in the above study, we propose an integrative inference approach that leverages the prediction power of EHR features selected by two well-known methods, Random Forests and Lasso. The goal is twofold: reducing the big data redundancies potentially harmful to the predictive learning task and exploiting the inter-connectivity of EHR features. A mutual information (MI) network is the inference tool used to identify communities useful to prioritize significant T2D features underlying the similarity between patients. Results. Endowed with a different degree of granularity, the communities detected after the application of both methods were centered especially on T2D comorbidities and risk factors. As such, they appear very relevant for assessment of two main issues, T2D disease burden and prevention. Conclusions. Our analytical approach offers a solution for managing the EHR scale factor in a complex disease context. EHR are rich sources of phenotypic diversity through which novel stratifications of patients are expected. To enable these results, both pre-screening of variables and calibration of risk prediction methods become necessary steps in EHR analyses. We have presented networks identifying major T2D communities. The specific significance assigned to comorbidities and risk factors in relation to T2D can be inferred with accuracy from just a suitably reduced number of EHR features.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/fdata.2019.00030", "venue": "Front.

Despite the huge number of inhabitants, these markets still lack a proper finance infrastructure. One of the main difficulties felt by customers is the access to loans. This limitation arises from the fact that most customers usually lack a verifiable credit history. As such, traditional banks are unable to provide loans. This paper proposes credit scoring modeling based on non-traditional data, acquired from smartphones, for loan classification processes. We use Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models which are the top performers in traditional banking. Then we compared the transformation of the training datasets creating boolean indicators against recoding using Weight of Evidence (WoE). Our models surpassed the performance of the manual loan application selection process, loans granted through the models criteria presented fewer overdues, also the approval criteria of the models increased the amount of granted loans substantially. Compared to the baseline, the loans approved by meeting the criteria of the SVM model presented \u2212196.80% overdue rate. At the same time, the approval criteria of the SVM model generated 251.53% more loans. This paper shows that credit scoring can be useful in emerging markets.

These different representations are called views. The aim of multi-view regression is to increase the performance of using only one view by taking into account the information available from all views. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-view regression model called Multi-View Least Squares Support Vector Machines (MV LS-SVM) regression. This model is formulated in the primal-dual setting typical to Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) where a coupling term is introduced in the primal objective. This form of coupling allows for some degree of freedom to model the different representations while being able to incorporate the information from all views in the training phase. This work was motivated by the challenge of predicting temperature in weather forecasting. Black-box weather forecasting deals with a large number of observations and features and is one of the most challenging learning task around. In order to predict the temperature in a city, the historical data from that city as well as from the neighboring cities are taking into account. In the past, the data for different cities were usually simply concatenated. In this work, we use MV LS-SVM to do temperature prediction by regarding each city as a different view.

We propose a simple scenario, which describes the evolution of the central galaxies and their host dark matter halos. Star formation quenching is one key process in this scenario, which leads to the different assembly history of blue groups (group with a blue central) and red groups (group with a red central). For blue groups, both the central galaxy and the halo continue to grow their mass. For red groups, the central galaxy has been quenched and its stellar mass remains about constant, while its halo continues to grow by merging smaller halos. From this simple scenario, we speculate about the driving properties that should strongly correlate with the group halo mass. We then apply the machine learning algorithm, Random Forest (RF) regressor, to blue groups and red groups separately in the semi-analytical model, L-GALAXIES, to explore these non-linear multi-correlations, and to verify the scenario as proposed above. Remarkably, the results given by RF regressor are fully consistent with the prediction from our simple scenario and hence provide strong support to it. As a consequence, the group halo mass can be more accurately determined from observable galaxy properties by the RF regressor with a 50% reduction in error. More accurately determined halo mass in this way also enables more accurate investigations on the galaxy-halo connection and other important related issues, including galactic conformity and the effect of halo assembly bias on galaxy assembly.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.01560", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3847/1538-4357/ab2ece", "venue": null, "journal": "The Astrophysical Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2968281837,2954990812", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["89141"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195791660"}

Vertolli (michaelvertolli@gmail.com) Jim Davies (jim@jimdavies.org) Carleton University, Institute of Cognitive Science, 1125 Colonel By Dr. Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6 Canada Abstract A cognitive model of the visual imagination will produce \u201cincoherent\u201d results when it adds elements to an imagined scene that come from different contexts (e.g., \u201ccomputer\u201d and \u201ccheese\u201d with \u201cmouse\u201d). We approach this problem with a model that infers coherence relations from co-occurrence probabilities of labels in images. We show that this algorithm\u2019s serial traversal of networks of co-occurrence relations for a particular query produces greater coherence than one leading model in the field of computational coherence: Thagard\u2019s connectionist model. Keywords: imagination; coherence; artificial intelligence Introduction The imagination is implicated in a wide range of abilities related to human cognition. The list of abilities includes but is not limited to planning, problem solving, hypothetical thinking, counterfactual thinking, theory of mind, and mental time travel (Davies, Atance, & Martin Ordas, 2011). Despite a plethora of research on the imagination as a facilitator for these abilities (see, for example, Markman, Klein & Suhr, 2012), the generative capacity of the imagination is an untapped area of research in this domain. This work focuses on the visual faculty as it is the most studied. When someone constructs a visual scene with the imagination (e.g., a mouse eating a piece of cheese) they might use visual memories from many different experiences as the components of the new scene. How these components are selected from the range of possible experiences is not obvious. If more than just the mouse and cheese are included in the scene, it is unclear what makes the selection of some elements (e.g., a cat, mousetrap, floorboards, or a countertop) more likely or appropriate than others (e.g., a rollercoaster, map of Spain, or cruise ship). What is known is that people do not arbitrarily select the components for their imaginings, even if those imaginings are entirely fictional (see Cockbain, Vertolli, Davies, in press). There is an intuitive coherence imposed on imagined scenes that inhibits unusual and sometimes even highly creative combinations. One way that humans might make this selection is through the co-occurrence of objects in visual memory (by visual memory we mean only the memory of visual things, and not a specific subsystem like the visuo-spatial sketchpad). Thus, when one is imagining a scene given an environmental query (e.g., a novel, question, or problem), mental processes might search visual memory for other objects that often occur with that query. Recent research in cognitive neuroscience supports this co-occurrence view. Under the title of \u201cscene construction theory,\u201d this research has demonstrated that the hippocampus plays a primary role in the construction of a \u201ccoherent spatial context\u201d for the integration of the components of imagined experiences among other cognitive phenomena (Hassabis & Maguire, 2007; Maguire & Mullally, 2013). Parallel research on the role of the hippocampus in the emergence of conceptual knowledge and knowledge transfer (see Kumaran, Summerfield, Hassabis & Maguire, 2009) endorses the \u201cmemory space\u201d hypothesis of hippocampal function. In this view, neurons in the hippocampus encode the co-occurrence of the components of a given experience or event through their spatiotemporal associations (Konkel & Cohen, 2009). This means that objects can co-occur as a consequence of associations due to spatial relationships (e.g., mice often are seen next to cheese) or temporal relationships (e.g., gunshots are often followed by death or injury). We only address the former in the current work. Figure 1. An incoherent scene generated by SOILIE for the query \u2018mouse,\u2019 containing elements from both the computer and animal senses of \u2018mouse.\u2019 In sum, when one imagines a mouse eating a piece of cheese, it is not surprising that mousetraps, cats, etc. are more likely to come to mind than unrelated elements. They all often occur together in the world and, thus, are associated in the brain. In this case, \u201ca mouse eating a piece of cheese\u201d serves as the query and the other elements are what are returned by some imagination process. One way to further explore this idea is through the use of computational models.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2395308294", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14333234", "143994759", "15934182", "170401845", "13939288", "12901848", "14371585", "38991", "16628430", "145249058", "144481121", "18554020", "142692289", "338469", "207158556", "1008003"], "inbound_citations": ["16433450", "41456762"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13470355"}

The feature extraction process is concise and there is no need to deliberately screen the data set. Among the algorithms involved in this paper, the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Random Forest algorithm have the most ideal performance.

Tight linkage between markers introduces near collinearity among marker genotypes, complicating the detection of QTL and estimation of QTL effects in linkage mapping, and this problem is exacerbated by very high density linkage maps. Here we developed a thinning and aggregating (TAGGING) method as a new ensemble learning approach to QTL mapping. TAGGING reduces collinearity problems by thinning dense linkage maps, maintains aspects of marker selection that characterize standard QTL mapping, and by ensembling, incorporates information from many more markers-trait associations than traditional QTL mapping. The objective of TAGGING was to improve prediction power compared with QTL mapping while also providing more specific insights into genetic architecture than genome-wide prediction models. TAGGING was compared with standard QTL mapping using cross validation of empirical data from the maize (Zea mays L.) nested association mapping population. TAGGING-assisted QTL mapping substantially improved prediction ability for both biparental and multifamily populations by reducing both the variance and bias in prediction. Furthermore, an ensemble model combining predictions from TAGGING-assisted QTL and infinitesimal models improved prediction abilities over the component models, indicating some complementarity between model assumptions and suggesting that some trait genetic architectures involve a mixture of a few major QTL and polygenic effects.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4592990", "pubmed_id": "26276383", "doi": "10.1534/g3.115.021121", "venue": "G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics", "journal": "G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2309128097", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1088806", "8436950", "15467419", "12707477", "34910416", "207738357", "27026167", "89141", "85852302", "17901537", "15080731", "56776745", "15213678", "16884658", "19136066", "17235649", "84329231", "55571260", "20121886", "6323690", "1728050", "7081438", "1627104", "2208295", "215660433", "15271366", "11149239", "13485428", "17038703", "44066316", "3171995", "23211084", "11810872", "215214576", "16824618", "12667765", "1947866", "52852779"], "inbound_citations": ["159041060", "23782131", "23762491", "91184146"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24295448"}

This study investigates two types of the sliding window that are usually used by existing studies: Fixed-size Non-overlapping Sliding Window (FNSW) and Fixed-size Overlapping Sliding Window (FOSW). Two publicly-accessible datasets are used in this study. Two machine-learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), are used to train and test the classifier.

To analyse subtle variations in EEG, signal decomposition algorithms have been used in time, frequency, joint time-frequency, and nonlinear domain. The statistical and entropy parameters are the key features to discern normal from the seizure EEG signals.

The paper also evaluates the performance of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, naive Bayes, Least Square Support Vector Machine, k nearest neighbour, and random forest classifiers using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy metrics. A seizure detection technique is developed by decomposing the EEG signals by means of Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT). To quantify the complexity of the individual multivariate sub-bands of the biomedical signals TQWT proves effective with varied values of Q factor suitable for analyzing signals with oscillatory and non-oscillatory nature.

Most existing indoor intrusion detection methods directly exploit the Received Signal Strength (RSS) data collected by Monitor Points (MPs) and do not consider the instability of WLAN signals in the complex indoor environments. In response to this urgent problem, this paper proposes a novel WLAN indoor intrusion detection method based on deep signal feature fusion and Minimized Multiple Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Minimized-MKMMD). Firstly, the multi-branch deep convolutional neural network is used to conduct the dimensionality reduction and feature fusion of the RSS data, and the tags are obtained according to the features of the offline and online RSS fusion features that are corresponding to the silence and intrusion states, and then based on this, the source domain and target domain are constructed respectively. Secondly, the optimal transfer matrix is constructed by minimizing MKMMD.

Unfortunately, the process of identifying the actual species of mosquito is currently a manual process requiring highly trained personnel to visually inspect each specimen one by one under a microscope to make the identification. In this paper, we propose a system to automate this process.

It has been verified that an accurate and early detection of breast cancer can increase the chances for the patients to take the right treatment plan and survive for a long time. Nowadays, numerous classification methods have been utilized for breast cancer diagnosis. However, most of these classification models have concentrated on maximum the classification accuracy, failed to take into account the unequal misclassification costs for the breast cancer diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, misclassifying the cancerous patient as non-cancerous has much higher cost compared to misclassifying the non-cancerous as cancerous. Consequently, in order to tackle this deficiency and further improve the classification accuracy of the breast cancer diagnosis, we propose an improved cost-sensitive support vector machine classifier (ICS-SVM) for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In the proposed approach, we take full account of unequal misclassification costs of breast cancer intelligent diagnosis and provide more reasonable results over previous works and conventional classification models.

An infor- mative and accurate vegetation map was produced with an overall accuracy of 91.1 % and Kappa value of 0.89. A com- bination of the three data sources achieved the best result compared with applying aerial photography alone, or a syner- gy of two data sources. Ensemble analysis of three classifiers not only increased the classification accuracy, but also gener- ated a complementary uncertainty map for the final classified vegetation map. This uncertainty map was able to identify regions with a high robust classification, as well as areas where classification errors were most likely to occur.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s13157-015-0730-7", "venue": "Wetlands", "journal": "Wetlands", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2207590130,2395821227", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["26771400", "54741771", "89141", "5707430", "133466124", "7487572", "8584223", "62739295", "18207180", "42328368", "7993309", "128484632", "39169815", "127779390", "17371657", "130711195", "6810356", "11077516", "127150493", "12054931", "2357415", "129796492", "32779933", "129307120", "42623946", "25669668", "129260885", "20307381", "12557149", "17819411", "49488000", "9765130", "18564919", "49476665"], "inbound_citations": ["210998708", "204202106", "3380348", "84181259", "125784440"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13972420"}

For an assignment to occur, agents with different individual preferences must agree on an option. We provide a formalism for agreement problems and negotiation, which encompasses important real-world problems faced by people daily, e.g., selecting a meeting time, deciding on a location for a group lunch, and assigning roles in a joint task. ::: We focus on the challenge of designing algorithms to improve agent negotiation. We formalize the negotiation process as a series of rounds, where the agents each make an offer until they reach agreement. The offers agents make, and hence the outcome of a negotiation, is influenced by the agents' negotiation strategies, preferences and utility functions. As an agent negotiates with other agents, it can keep a record of the offers the agents made, and the negotiation round in which they were made. We address the challenge of designing algorithms to improve agent negotiation, by providing learning algorithms, which agents can use to inform, and thereby improve, their negotiation. In particular, we show how an agent can learn complex models of its own user's preferences, by observing the outcomes of negotiations. We also address the problem of modeling the properties of other agents from negotiation histories. This problem is particularly challenging, because negotiation histories do not provide sufficient information to reconstruct a complete model of an agent. As such, we have developed a domain independent approach, to designing and learning abstractions of the properties of other agents. We demonstrate that an agent can learn these abstractions online while negotiating, and use the learned abstractions to increase the efficiency of its negotiation, without sacrificing its individual preferences. We also provide an algorithm for agents to model the reward they receive from different negotiation strategies. When an agent is faced with the problem of dealing with a wide variety of negotiation behavior in other agents, we show that the agent can improve its negotiation performance by using experts algorithms to adapt its selection of negotiation strategies according to their performance. ::: We observe that agreement problems are neither fully cooperative (agents have preferences), nor fully competitive (agents must agree to receive reward). We define semi-cooperative agents, to capture this space between cooperation and self-interest. The utility function of a semi-cooperative agent, trades-off preference satisfaction, and the time taken to reach agreement. The degree of the trade-off depends on the individual agent. We show how semi-cooperative agents can estimate the utility of different negotiation outcomes, by learning online about other agents' behavior. We also provide an in-depth analysis of two different strategies for using the learned information. ::: The approaches presented apply to a wide range of agreement problems. We provide analytical and experimental analysis to demonstrate their effectiveness in representative domains. ::: Keywords: Multiagent Negotiation, Multiagent Learning, Machine Learning, Personal Assistant Agents", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2418374443", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["13423685", "7301159", "17207100"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63707652"}

These models formulate the gene expression inference in a completely supervised manner, which require a large labeled dataset (i.e. paired landmark and target gene expressions).

We employ the reliable generated data by our GAN model as the extra training pairs to improve the training of our inference model, and utilize the trustworthy predictions of the inference network to enhance the adversarial training of our GAN network.

Regardless the novel invention of DNA microarray, most of its results relies on the computational intelligence power, which is used to interpret the large number of data. At present, interpreting large scale of gene expression data remain a thought-provoking issue due to their innate nature of \u201chigh dimensional low sample size\u201d. Microarray data mainly involved thousands of genes, n in a very small size sample, p. In addition, this data are often overwhelmed, over fitting and confused by the complexity of data analysis. Due to the nature of this microarray data, it is also common that a large number of genes may not be informative for classification purposes. For such a reason, many studies have used feature selection methods to select significant genes that present the maximum discriminative power between cancerous and normal tissues. In this study, we aim to investigate and compare the effectiveness of these four popular filter gene selection methods namely Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR), Fisher Criterion (FC), Information Gain (IG) and t-Test in selecting informative genes that can distinguish cancer and normal tissues. Two common classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (C4.5) are used to train the selected genes. These gene selection methods are tested on three large scales of gene expression datasets, namely breast cancer dataset, colon dataset, and lung dataset. This study has discovered that IG and SNR are more suitable to be used with SVM while IG fit for C4.5. In a colon dataset, SVM has achieved a specificity of 86% with SNR while and 80% for IG.

Most multitask learning algorithm assume that all tasks are related. However, if all the tasks are not related, negative transfer of information occurs amongst the tasks, and the performance of traditional multitask learning algorithm worsens. Thus, we design an algorithm that simultaneously groups the related tasks and trains only the related task together. There are different approaches to train the related tasks in multi-task learning based on which information is shared across the tasks. These approaches either assume that the parameters of each of the tasks are situated close together, or assume that there is a common underlying latent space in the features of the tasks that is related. Most multi-task learning algorithm use either regularization method or matrix-variate priors. In our algorithm, the related tasks are tied together by a set of common features selected by each tasks. Thus, to train the related tasks together, we use spike and slab prior to select a common set of features for the related tasks, and a mixture of gaussians prior to select the set of related tasks. For validation, the developed algorithm is tested on toxicity prediction and hand written digit recognition data sets.

In this paper, we use Inductive Logic Programming in a multi-predicate setting to learn extraction patterns fitted to an ontological context. Multi-predicate ILP is an important paradigm which allows to learn recursive theories. We experimented our framework on a Bacillus subtilis bacterium text corpus, in which we reach a global recall of 67.7% and a precision of 75.5% in ten-fold cross-validation.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1529282.1529634", "venue": "SAC '09", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2089928311", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5558082", "18638602", "2591187", "155422876", "6052674", "11448201", "13882954", "1175488", "1410634", "17500499", "15894892", "270818", "2144550"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16137305"}

In the field of fault diagnosis, deep learning has been extensively used due to its excellent feature learning ability. However, it still suffers from several issues; for example, 1) simultaneous requirements of features from multiple aspects, including sparsity and robustness, are hardly met due to the limited feature learning ability of a single model, and 2) most methods deal with preprocessed signals instead of original time domain signals because of the noise interference and deficiency of a single model. To solve these problems, this study proposes a new deep fusion network for fault feature learning, which combines two types of deep learning models, namely, sparse autoencoder and contractive autoencoder, which are respectively applied to enhance features\u2019 sparsity and robustness and thereby guarantee the representativeness of extracted features and gain strong anti-interference ability. Consequently, fault diagnosis with original time domain signals can be realized. Bearing and gearbox fault diagnosis experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the presented network. Results show that the diagnosis accuracies for two cases are higher than those of networks based on single contractive autoencoder and sparse autoencoder.

However, there is no previous research to analyze their overfitting in high-dimensional omics data based disease diagnosis, which is essential to avoid deceptive diagnostic results and enhance clinical decision making. In this work, we comprehensively investigate this problem from both theoretical and practical standpoints to unveil the special characteristics of SVM overfitting. We found that disease diagnosis under an SVM classifier would inevitably encounter overfitting under a Gaussian kernel because of the large data variations generated from high-throughput profiling technologies. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse-coding kernel approach to overcome SVM overfitting in disease diagnosis.

Starting from a very young age, they quickly become increasingly more competent at inferring other's intentions from their behavior (Wellman & Liu 2004). This represents a crucial skill, as inferring other's intention allows cooperation without explicit verbal communication as well as preparing for the next likely actions of those around. What is even more impressive is that humans are capable of inferring reasons for seemingly suboptimal behavior, allowing them to collect much more information about the agent they are observing as well as the situation that agent is currently in. This is possible because they are assuming that other humans are rational agents, meaning that their actions should serve a purpose, it might just be that they cannot immediately understand this purpose. Children can use this additional information to learn more about the world around them (Liu et al. 2017). This capability, which goes beyond mere goal or action recognition, can also benefit computational systems, by allowing them to anticipate their users' next action or intention, without requiring explicit communication, thus greatly improving human computer interaction and potential cooperation with robots (Knepper et al. 2017).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AAMAS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2887627673,2808148209", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["154292", "3338320", "1560164", "31964589", "296975", "2315539", "4322886", "16994141", "14400305", "142737405", "141321709", "14546077", "6824910", "6858362", "5562001"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51881728"}

Basic SVM models are dealing with the situation where the exact values of the data points are known. This paper presents a survey of SVM when the data points are uncertain. When a direct model cannot guarantee a generally good performance on the uncertainty set, robust optimization is introduced to deal with the worst case scenario and still guarantee an optimal performance. The data uncertainty could be an additive noise which is bounded by norm, where some efficient linear programming models are presented under certain conditions; or could be intervals with support and extremum values; or a more general case of polyhedral uncertainties with formulations presented. Another field of the uncertainty analysis is chance constrained SVM which is used to ensure the small probability of misclassification for the uncertain data. The multivariate Chebyshev inequality and Bernstein bounding schemes have been used to transform the chance constraints through robust optimization. The Chebyshev based model employs moment information of the uncertain training points. The Bernstein bounds can be less conservative than the Chebyshev bounds since it employs both support and moment information, but it also makes a strong assumption that all the elements in the data set are independent.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s40745-014-0022-8", "venue": null, "journal": "Annals of Data Science", "mag_id": "2023737915", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["603650", "54732684", "16153989", "54465366", "38143212", "33777737"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121163400"}

In this paper, a new method based on feature learning and spectrogram analysis is proposed to simplify the feature extraction process while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The proposed method learns a dictionary of discriminant features from patches extracted in the spectrogram representations of training speech segments.

The number of features, and difficulties linked to the feature extraction process are greatly reduced as only one type of descriptors is used, for which the 7 parameters can be tuned automatically.

In this study, we propose a new Multiple Label Propagation algorithm for linking each other the existing LOD to bring out the original features by semi-supervised learning. This algorithm predicts semantic labels of individual data of the LOD using an assumption that adjacent nodes belong to a same or similar class. Therefore, the algorithm has new formula to consider semantic distance. Thereby, the algorithm is possible to extend links between neighborhood nodes (data). In addition, the algorithm is possible to correspond multi-label data. The results of experiments showed that the algorithm can give the label prediction values representing semantic distances, and can be processed much faster than a conventional algorithm.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IMIS.2016.111", "venue": "2016 10th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS)", "journal": "2016 10th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2566429334", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1036210", "116930672", "13935962", "18470677", "18734348"], "inbound_citations": ["3970101"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17658485"}

Therefore, for the complex data, the SVR is easy to reconstruct an approximated model based on the linear programming technique. On the other hand, a typical microarray data consists of expression levels for a large number of genes on a relatively small number of samples. In order to avoid higher computational complexity and larger prediction errors on high-dimensional problem, we proposed the dimension reduction with SVR for the ovarian cancer microarray data. The SVR can reduce dimension on each sample from 9600 genes to about three hundreds genes. Besides, we can choose the epsiv value in the loss-function of SVR to obtain the variable number of gene and the proposed method can also overcome the block effect of microarray data.

In this paper, we propose a collaborative model by incorporating the local and holistic models together which is corresponding to discriminative and generative models in tracking-classification-framework. At the local level, an on-line Random Forest (RF) classifier is trained to distinguish the superpixels of the object from the background. A series of local superpixels are used to represent the target, so as to adapt the appearance variances. The discriminative model is used to classify superpixels in the next frame as either belonging to the object or background. A confidence map consisting of dependability and stability is formed to measure the probabilities of superpxiels pertaining to the target from the classifier. A modified mean-shift is proposed to work on the confidence map to find the peak, where is the position of the target. Meanwhile, a separate component for managing the training set dynamically is employed to control the updating of the RF model. At the global level, the target is represented by covariance matrix of multi-scale bounding boxes.

Specifically, LSDR encodes high-dimensional label vectors into low-dimensional code vectors lying in a latent space, so as to train predictive models at much lower costs. With respect to the prediction, it performs classification for any unseen instance by recovering a label vector from its predicted code vector via a decoding process. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely End-to-End Feature-aware label space Encoding (E2FE), to perform LSDR. Instead of requiring an encoding function like most previous works, E2FE directly learns a code matrix formed by code vectors of the training instances in an end-to-end manner. Another distinct property of E2FE is its feature awareness attributable to the fact that the code matrix is learned by jointly maximizing the recoverability of the label space and the predictability of the latent space. Based on the learned code matrix, E2FE further trains predictive models to map instance features into code vectors, and also learns a linear decoding matrix for efficiently recovering the label vector of any unseen instance from its predicted code vector. Theoretical analyses show that both the code matrix and the linear decoding matrix in E2FE can be efficiently learned. Moreover, similar to previous works, E2FE can be specified to learn an encoding function. And it can also be extended with kernel tricks to handle nonlinear correlations between the feature space and the latent space. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark data sets with many classes show consistent performance gains of E2FE over the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28500009", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2691545", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2611997167", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["597468", "18830691", "4300209", "17500711", "11182056", "15676013", "8388806", "2013706", "201720", "9404152", "16193644", "17671150", "11608263", "6617228", "9250890", "10513691", "7450781", "269973", "14674817", "13342577", "7427312", "6086492", "5751495", "968630", "8844096", "569231", "2555940", "2665935", "13909180", "1600265", "18068714", "10958911", "17038278", "8727032", "1952250", "7557952", "1642637", "122725444", "11608263", "14885327", "43188859", "10377473", "14833547", "16185365", "338469", "2087532", "207211581", "3116168", "1008003", "17574759", "195673258"], "inbound_citations": ["182951947", "13685701", "51612220", "53572371", "57373791", "4354144"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21684170"}

However, the oversize feature set used in the model has posed several issues, like overfitting problem and excessive computational demand. To resolve these issues, we did a thorough survey of two existing feature selection methods for CRFs, namely the gain-based and gradient-based methods, and applied the later one to CONTRAST.

However, clinicians observe that around 30 to 40% of treated patients fail to respond to TNF\u03b1 blocking agents. One way to optimise the drug prescription is to identify predictive markers of drug responsiveness. Objectives To identify a combination of serum proteins whose expression profile would predict the RA patients responses to the association of methotrexate (MTX) and etanercept (ETA) by mass spectrometry-based quantification methods and ELISA. Methods A \u201ccohort discovery phase\u201d of 23 patients with active RA was treated by a subcutaneous injection of. The clinical efficacy of these drugs was evaluated with the DAS28 score after 6 months of treatment according to the EULAR response criteria. For proteomic analysis, a serum sample was collected in patients prior to treatment exposure. A \u201clabel free\u201d approach on the whole proteome was performed by mass spectrometry on the 25 sera. Accordingly, the proteome of each sample was extracted and in-gel digested. The resulting peptides were analysed by LTQ Orbitrap\u00ae (ThermoFisher). Differential analysis between responder and non responder samples was performed with LCMS ProGenesis\u00ae (Nonlinear Dynamics). To validate these results a relative quantification of selected protein was performed on the second \u201ccohort validation phase\u201d by ELISA. The proteome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a second cohort of seven patients with similar characteristics has also been studied by the same label free approach. Results The label free approach revealed 12 differentially expressed serum proteins according to patient response. This combination of proteins was used to build a Random Forest statistical model to predict the patient\u2019s status. This model was validated by a blind test on a panel of seven patients. Moreover, these results have shown the protein S100A9 overexpression in both the serum and the PBMCs from responder\u2019s patients and this expression was confirmed by ELISA. Conclusions The label free approach has identified a combination of predictive markers of response to MTX treatment/ETA. Thus, using sera samples collected in patients prior to treatment exposure, it is possible to predict response to treatment with a small error. These proteins represent interesting candidate biomarkers of response that must be validated in a larger population. Already identified as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of RA, the S100A9 protein has been identified as a predictive biomarker of response both in serum and in PBMCs.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-203223.5", "venue": null, "journal": "Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases", "mag_id": "2099204441", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73122646"}

Looking for valuable nuggets of knowledge, such as capturing and summarizing sentiments from these huge amount of data could help users make informed decisions. In this paper, we develop a sentiment identification system called SES which implements three different sentiment identification algorithms. We augment basic compositional semantic rules in the first algorithm. In the second algorithm, we think sentiment should not be simply classified as positive, negative, and objective but a continuous score to reflect sentiment degree. All word scores are calculated based on a large volume of customer reviews. Due to the special characteristics of social media texts, we propose a third algorithm which takes emoticons, negation word position, and domain-specific words into account. Furthermore, a machine learning model is employed on features derived from outputs of three algorithms. We conduct our experiments on user comments from Face book and tweets from twitter. The results show that utilizing Random Forest will acquire a better accuracy than decision tree, neural network, and logistic regression.

It has been applied to a variety of applications, such as text categorization and image annotation. A large number of algorithms have been proposed for multilabel learning, most of which concentrate on multilabel classification problems and only a few of them are feature selection algorithms. Current multilabel classification models are mainly built on a single data representation composed of all the features which are shared by all the class labels. Since each class label might be decided by some specific features of its own, and the problems of classification and feature selection are often addressed independently, in this paper, we propose a novel method which can perform joint feature selection and classification for multilabel learning, named JFSC. Different from many existing methods, JFSC learns both shared features and label-specific features by considering pairwise label correlations, and builds the multilabel classifier on the learned low-dimensional data representations simultaneously. A comparative study with state-of-the-art approaches manifests a competitive performance of our proposed method both in classification and feature selection for multilabel learning.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28212104", "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2017.2663838", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2588628126", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["59805198", "97681", "9404152", "10239704", "7049696", "1224977", "13044872", "1008003", "13856501", "65240712", "205163", "12415435", "16059274", "15136247", "14886376", "1976599", "36816957", "7218339", "207211581", "7492417", "5945730", "209093615", "53722003", "9545992", "6418797", "11049039", "2474294", "17496428", "14635503", "13729860", "379259", "60567601", "8190856", "19228563", "16162039", "19639702", "13084742", "14472875", "424620", "53558639", "32617124", "42822746", "776067", "2345347", "2894855", "12347240", "14180329", "23579047", "12630207", "8189944", "43832632", "44619381", "12796651", "785634", "7572436", "21190117", "20093670", "3072879", "961425", "7553535"], "inbound_citations": ["208139095", "204809530", "201621645", "210692107", "53044255", "153314682", "214623997", "164301806", "59843035", "204711899", "214623865", "30198089", "208138008", "59554429", "199510481", "52985231", "86675242", "208229573", "53034807"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3290051"}

Our goal is to estimate the kinematics of an unknown gait from image sequences taken by a single camera. This approach involves two generative models, called the kinematic gait generative model (KGGM) and the visual gait generative model (VGGM), which represent the kinematics and appearances of a gait by a few latent variables, respectively. Particularly, the concept of gait manifold is proposed to capture the gait variability among different individuals by which KGGM and VGGM can be integrated together for gait estimation, so that a new gait with unknown kinematics can be inferred from gait appearances via KGGM and VGGM. A key issue in generating a gait manifold is the definition of the distance function that reflects the dissimilarity between two individual gaits. Specifically, we investigate and compare three distance functions each of which leads to a specific gait manifold. Moreover, we extend our gait modeling framework from the whole level to the part level by decomposing a gait into two parts, an upper-body gait and a lower-body gait, each of which is associated with a specific gait manifold for part level gait modeling. Also, a two-stage inference algorithm is employed for whole-part gait estimation.

I suggest that the discontent expressed by Schyns, Goldstone and Thibaut about fixed-features theories of categorization reflects the growing impact of connectionism, and show how their perspective is similar to recent research on implicit learning, consciousness, and development. A hard problem remains, however: How to bridge the gap between subsymbolic and symbolic cognition. Cleeremans: Commentary on Schyns, Goldstone, and Thibaut 2 Schyns, Goldstone and Thibaut\u2019s (hereafter, SGT Perruchet, in press), development (see Clark & Karmiloff-Smith, 1993), and implicit learning \u2014 the process by which we can learn without intention to do so and without awareness of the resulting knowledge. In this commentary, I would like to argue that the constructivist view of cognition advanced by SGT Cleeremans, in press) that the connectionist framework probably provides us with the best metaphor to think about how such implicit knowledge can come to influence performance without having the properties of symbolic representation. Connectionist models indeed excel at representing complex stimuli as graded, continuous patterns that can preserve much of the variability contained in the input while at the same time providing enough structure to satisfy the demands of the task (Cleeremans, 1993; 1994b). Connectionist models further make it clear how such knowledge can develop based on sub-symbolic processing and representational principles. To summarize, the target article makes it clear that theories of categorization based on the traditional computational metaphor of mind (roughly, processes that manipulate Cleeremans: Commentary on Schyns, Goldstone, and Thibaut 4 representations) are fundamentally flawed. A growing dissatisfaction with the computational metaphor is also emerging in consciousness and implicit learning research, and for essentially the same reasons: The relative inflexibility of symbolic representation, the artificial character of a nevertheless deeply ingrained distinction between processes and representations, and the weaknesses of classical systems in accounting for change and for the emergence of new forms. There is little doubt that connectionism and other similar dynamical (e.g., Port and van Gelder, 1995) approaches offer many fundamental insights into how one may start to address these limitations of classical symbolic systems. The problem with SG&T\u2019s approach, however, is that they fail (as many others) to offer any specific discussion of \u201cthe other hard problem\u201d that is common to the categorization, implicit learning, consciousness and development fields: How to bridge the gap that separates subsymbolic and symbolic cognition. In this respect, Representational Redescription, as proposed by Clark and Karmiloff-Smith (1993), is an interesting suggestion in that it leaves open the possibility that multiple recodings (possibly cast at different levels of complexity) of the same input remain available for further processing, a property that is undoubtedly central to confer flexibility to any learning system.", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1017/S0140525X98290108", "venue": null, "journal": "Behavioral and Brain Sciences", "mag_id": "2021288581", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143994266"}

The methodology is applied to a new data set of microarray gene expression data collected in Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, Foggia \u2013 Italy. The data set is made up of normal (22) and tumor (25) specimens extracted from 25 patients affected by colon cancer. We propose to give answers to some questions which are relevant for the automatic diagnosis of cancer such as: Is the size of the available data set sufficient to build accurate classifiers? What is the statistical significance of the associated error rates? In what ways can accuracy be considered dependant on the adopted classification scheme? How many genes are correlated with the pathology and how many are sufficient for an accurate colon cancer classification? The method we propose answers these questions whilst avoiding the potential pitfalls hidden in the analysis and interpretation of microarray data.ResultsWe estimate the generalization error, evaluated through the Leave-K-Out Cross Validation error, for three different classification schemes by varying the number of training examples and the number of the genes used. The statistical significance of the error rate is measured by using a permutation test. We provide a statistical analysis in terms of the frequencies of the genes involved in the classification. Using the whole set of genes, we found that the Weighted Voting Algorithm (WVA) classifier learns the distinction between normal and tumor specimens with 25 training examples, providing e = 21% (p = 0.045) as an error rate. This remains constant even when the number of examples increases. Moreover, Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers can learn with only 15 training examples, with an error rate of e = 19% (p = 0.035) and e = 18% (p = 0.037) respectively. Moreover, the error rate decreases as the training set size increases, reaching its best performances with 35 training examples. In this case, RLS and SVM have error rates of e = 14% (p = 0.027) and e = 11% (p = 0.019). Concerning the number of genes, we found about 6000 genes (p < 0.05) correlated with the pathology, resulting from the signal-to-noise statistic. Moreover the performances of RLS and SVM classifiers do not change when 74% of genes is used. They progressively reduce up to e = 16% (p < 0.05) when only 2 genes are employed. The biological relevance of a set of genes determined by our statistical analysis and the major roles they play in colorectal tumorigenesis is discussed.ConclusionsThe method proposed provides statistically significant answers to precise questions relevant for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. We found that, with as few as 15 examples, it is possible to train statistically significant classifiers for colon cancer diagnosis. As for the definition of the number of genes sufficient for a reliable classification of colon cancer, our results suggest that it depends on the accuracy required.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC1564153", "pubmed_id": "16919171", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-7-387", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1771155305", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2914506", "2478905", "9061359", "1069019", "1456512", "11625473", "16456637", "61649919", "58799660", "7022062", "14686653", "10445998", "3218248", "123067933", "2515388", "9901636", "34888439", "10491674", "30515102", "456433", "40012197", "8558933", "21547367", "13631479", "27825953", "24707535", "14568573", "34197709", "21837213", "15529320", "25899458", "10210728", "10094955", "39309236", "10028818", "24765920", "11098969", "682012", "5365891"], "inbound_citations": ["215188740", "105290", "6366032", "14028073", "8746731", "7572482", "17596567", "16176327", "215698331", "29841154", "13344314", "9315870", "215219203", "206512392", "1658691", "3257422", "215591121", "36491782", "10308565", "206511085", "15010327", "21725935", "3233658", "17616191", "18499010", "8455907", "14631874", "8813418", "26355024", "6778485", "14177762", "10868577", "73291", "6681176", "11798097", "25059685", "7758135", "53631447", "10832115"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8244471"}

To explore public sentiment in depth during a disaster, this study analyzed Sina-Weibo (Weibo) texts in terms of space, time, and content related to the 2018 Shouguang flood, which caused casualties and economic losses, arousing widespread public concern in China. The temporal changes within six-hour intervals and spatial distribution on sub-district and city levels of flood-related Weibo were analyzed. Based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, a topic extraction and classification model was built to hierarchically identify six flood-relevant topics and nine types of public sentiment responses in Weibo texts. The majority of Weibo texts about the Shouguang flood were related to \u201cpublic sentiment\u201d, among which \u201cquestioning the government and media\u201d was the most commonly expressed. The Weibo text numbers varied over time for different topics and sentiments that corresponded to the different developmental stages of the flood. On a sub-district level, the spatial distribution of flood-relevant Weibo was mainly concentrated in high population areas in the south-central and eastern parts of Shouguang, near the river and the downtown area. At the city level, the Weibo texts were mainly distributed in Beijing and cities in the Shandong Province, centering in Weifang City. The results indicated that the classification model developed in this study was accurate and viable for analyzing social media texts during a disaster.

Unforeseen machine failures affect production schedules, product quality, and production costs. Therefore, condition monitoring of rotating machine can play an important role in machine availability. There is a growing number of methods for Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM). Yet, the performance of these methods is limited by the massive amounts of data need to be collected for MCM. This work proposes a computational method which can greatly reduce the high dimensional vibration dataset to a set of compressively-sampled measurements using Compressive Sampling (CS). Then, to learn fewer features from these compressively-sampled measurements we propose an effective multi-step feature learning algorithm that combines the advantages of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Finally, with these learned features, we use multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify machine health conditions. Experiments on a roller element bearing fault classification task based on vibration signals are used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that we are able to achieve high classification accuracy even from highly reduced vibration signal measurements. Moreover, the efficiency of our proposed method outperforms some recently published results.

Recognition of facial expressions, which are central to human-computer interactions, seems natural and desirable. However, facial expressions include mixed emotions, continuous rather than discrete, which vary from moment to moment. This paper represents a novel method of recognizing facial expressions of various internal states via manifold learning, to achieve the aim of human-centered interaction studies. A critical review of widely used emotion models is described, then, facial expression features of various internal states via the locally linear embedding (LLE) are extracted. The recognition of facial expressions is created with the pleasure-displeasure and arousal-sleep dimensions in a two-dimensional model of emotion. The recognition result of various internal state expressions that mapped to the embedding space via the LLE algorithm can effectively represent the structural nature of the two-dimensional model of emotion.

Unfortunately, this tends to be the case for current visual feature representations of the same scene across varying seasons or times of day. The aim of this paper is to provide a dense feature representation that can be used to perform localization, sparse matching or image retrieval, regardless of the current seasonal or temporal appearance. Recently, there have been several proposed methodologies for deep learning dense feature representations. These methods make use of ground truth pixel-wise correspondences between pairs of images and focus on the spatial properties of the features. As such, they don't address temporal or seasonal variation. Furthermore, obtaining the required pixel-wise correspondence data to train in cross-seasonal environments is highly complex in most scenarios. We propose Deja-Vu, a weakly supervised approach to learning season invariant features that does not require pixel-wise ground truth data. The proposed system only requires coarse labels indicating if two images correspond to the same location or not. From these labels, the network is trained to produce\"similar\"dense feature maps for corresponding locations despite environmental changes.

For classifying facial expressions, an analytic representation of face with 15 feature points has been used that provides visual observation of the discrete features responsible for the seven basic facial expressions. Feature points from the region of mouth are detected by segmenting the lip contour applying a variational formulation of the level set method. A multidetector approach of facial feature point detection is utilized for identifying the feature-points from the regions of eyes, eyebrows and nose. Feature vectors composed of 15 features are then obtained with respect to the average representation of neutral face and are used to train a Multiclass SVM classifier.

Our goal is to enable oblivious network analysis which can perform the aforementioned tasks for black-box devices. In this work, we explore the use of a recent machine learning tool called generative adversarial networks (GANs) [16] to enable this vision. Unlike other competing approaches, GANs can work in a truly black-box setting and can infer complex dependencies between protocol fields with little to no supervision. We leverage GANs to show the preliminary use cases of our approaches using two case studies: 1) generating synthetic protocol messages given only samples of messages; and 2) generating attack inputs for a black-box system.

The detection process is divided into three steps, namely, decomposition, modeling, and inference. First, observing that one license plate is decomposed into several constituent characters, the maximally stable extremal region detector is used to extract candidate characters in images. Then, conditional random field (CRF) models are constructed on the candidate characters in neighborhoods. This way, the spatial and visual relationships among the characters is integrated in CRF in the form of probability distribution. Finally, the exact bounding boxes of license plates are estimated through the belief propagation inference on CRF. Both visual and structural features of license plates are fully exploited during detection. Hence, our approach can adapt to various environmental factors, such as cluttered background and illumination variation. A series of experiments are conducted on images that are collected from the actual road surveillance environment.

In this paper, we present a deep and shallow feature learning network, namely DSNet, to learn the multi-level same-resolution compressed (MSC) features for efficient online tracking, in an end-to-end offline manner. Specifically, the proposed DSNet compresses multi-level convolutional features to uniform spatial resolution features. The learned MSC features effectively encode both appearance and semantic information of objects in the same-resolution feature maps, thus enabling an elegant combination of the MSC features with any DCF-based methods. Additionally, a channel reliability measurement (CRM) method is presented to further refine the learned MSC features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MSC features learned from the proposed DSNet on two DCF tracking frameworks: the basic DCF framework and the continuous convolution operator framework.

BackgroundConstructing standard and computable clinical diagnostic criteria is an important but challenging research field in the clinical informatics community. The Quality Data Model (QDM) is emerging as a promising information model for standardizing clinical diagnostic criteria. ObjectiveTo develop and evaluate automated methods for converting textual clinical diagnostic criteria in a structured format using QDM. MethodsWe used a clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool known as cTAKES to detect sentences and annotate events in diagnostic criteria. We developed a rule-based approach for assigning the QDM datatype(s) to an individual criterion, whereas we invoked a machine learning algorithm based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for annotating attributes belonging to each particular QDM datatype. We manually developed an annotated corpus as the gold standard and used standard measures (precision, recall and f-measure) for the performance evaluation. ResultsWe harvested 267 individual criteria with the datatypes of Symptom and Laboratory Test from 63 textual diagnostic criteria. We manually annotated attributes and values in 142 individual Laboratory Test criteria. The average performance of our rule-based approach was 0.84 of precision, 0.86 of recall, and 0.85 of f-measure; the performance of CRFs-based classification was 0.95 of precision, 0.88 of recall and 0.91 of f-measure. We also implemented a web-based tool that automatically translates textual Laboratory Test criteria into the QDM XML template format. The results indicated that our approaches leveraging cTAKES and CRFs are effective in facilitating diagnostic criteria annotation and classification.

Due to superior forecasting performance, the hybridizing support vector regression (SVR) model with evolutionary algorithms has received attention and deserves to continue being explored widely. The cuckoo search (CS) algorithm has the potential to contribute more satisfactory electric load forecasting results. However, the original CS algorithm suffers from its inherent drawbacks, such as parameters that require accurate setting, loss of population diversity, and easy trapping in local optima (i.e., premature convergence). Therefore, proposing some critical improvement mechanisms and employing an improved CS algorithm to determine suitable parameter combinations for an SVR model is essential. This paper proposes the SVR with chaotic cuckoo search (SVRCCS) model based on using a tent chaotic mapping function to enrich the cuckoo search space and diversify the population to avoid trapping in local optima. In addition, to deal with the cyclic nature of electric loads, a seasonal mechanism is combined with the SVRCCS model, namely giving a seasonal SVR with chaotic cuckoo search (SSVRCCS) model, to produce more accurate forecasting performances. The numerical results, tested by using the datasets from the National Electricity Market (NEM, Queensland, Australia) and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, NY, USA), show that the proposed SSVRCCS model outperforms other alternative models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en11041009", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "mag_id": "2801549487", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["155108837", "106403927", "204823407", "126175196", "146001625", "155105811", "86813943", "145023214", "116482462", "198970380", "210836447", "198480072", "53076133", "160010293", "150338953", "212664132", "203156920", "204826680", "129945838", "85463336", "210970967", "53569236"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116132612"}

Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards Non-Technical Loss (NTL) analysis for electric utilities using a novel intelligence-based technique, Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector due to electricity theft. The proposed model preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite for fraud based on irregularities and abnormal consumption behavior. This approach provides a method of data mining and involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. The SVM based approach uses customer load profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. The result yields classification classes that are used to shortlist potential fraud suspects for onsite inspection, based on significant behavior that emerges due to irregularities in consumption. Simulation results prove the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by TNB in order to reduce NTL activities.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/PECON.2008.4762604", "venue": "2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference", "journal": "2008 IEEE 2nd International Power and Energy Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2542346878", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["114000890", "108900974", "110358998", "3866488", "110591243", "111199943", "110014926", "33977870", "7099960", "29704926", "28637672", "2167771", "961425", "2443126"], "inbound_citations": ["1762088", "23071669", "199508596", "211541120", "41200058", "14392068", "57362881", "52884230", "25303171", "9850103", "47323537", "2719769", "37169903", "17235906", "27519150", "10568883", "14382848", "29169205", "14837344", "211244552", "112344377", "112344377", "209322161", "58929160", "5027580", "1122326", "55563068", "45751590", "50773349", "15560360", "15620516", "210968908", "12589035", "56399982", "6954779", "7005427", "21077291", "19226770", "25986781", "213182999", "213182999", "52898926", "8594272", "13964686", "3973688", "28842939", "57754700", "202699847", "9153762", "9836378", "13294484", "3926522", "208980261", "167775417", "19629337", "12358900", "18939042", "60440661", "203032307", "203563304", "19870435", "212703371"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27881543"}

For identifying crop types based on remote sensing, methods using only a single image type have significant limitations. Current research that integrates fine and coarser spatial resolution images, using techniques such as unmixing methods, regression models, and others, usually results in coarse resolution abundance without sufficient detail within pixels, and limited attention has been paid to the spatial relationship between the pixels from these two kinds of images. Here we propose a new solution to identify winter wheat by integrating spectral and temporal information derived from multi-resolution remote sensing data and determine the spatial distribution of sub-pixels within the coarse resolution pixels. Firstly, the membership of pixels which belong to winter wheat is calculated using a 25-m resolution resampled Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image based on the Bayesian equation. Then, the winter wheat abundance (acreage fraction in a pixel) is assessed by using a multiple regression model based on the unique temporal change features from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data. Finally, winter wheat is identified by the proposed Abundance-Membership (AM) model based on the spatial relationship between the two types of pixels. Specifically, winter wheat is identified by comparing the spatially corresponding 10\u00d710 membership pixels of each abundance pixel. In other words, this method takes advantage of the relative size of membership in a local space, rather than the absolute size in the entire study area. This method is tested in the major agricultural area of Yiluo Basin, China, and the results show that acreage accuracy (Aa) is 93.01% and sampling accuracy (As) is 91.40%. Confusion matrix shows that overall accuracy (OA) is 91.4% and the kappa coefficient (Kappa) is 0.755. These values are significantly improved compared to the traditional Maximum Likelihood classification (MLC) and Random Forest classification (RFC) which rely on spectral features. The results demonstrate that the identification accuracy can be improved by integrating spectral and temporal information. Since the identification of winter wheat is performed in the space corresponding to each MODIS pixel, the influence of differences of environmental conditions is greatly reduced. This advantage allows the proposed method to be effectively applied in other places.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S2095-3119(19)62615-8", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Integrative Agriculture", "mag_id": "2988656079", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209592097"}

As age is a prominent factor risk for the disease, next years will see a continuous increment of PD patients, making urgent the development of efficient strategies for early diagnosis and treatments. We propose here a novel approach based on complex networks for accurate early diagnoses using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data; our approach also allows us to investigate which are the brain regions mostly affected by the disease. First of all, we define a network model of brain regions and associate to each region proper connectivity measures. Thus, each brain is represented through a feature vector encoding the local relationships brain regions interweave. Then, Random Forests are used for feature selection and learning a compact representation. Finally, we use a Support Vector Machine to combine complex network features with clinical scores typical of PD prodromal phase and provide a diagnostic index. We evaluated the classification performance on the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, including a mixed cohort of 169 normal controls (NC) and 374 PD patients.

Hence, to predict if a lncRNA is acting as a scaffold, we consider this problem as a multiclass multilabel classification problem. To solve this problem, the high confident CLIP-seq data were selected from the POSTAR2 database with an augmentation of the data for the RBP classes with a small number of interacting lncRNAs. We then constructed a deep learning model for multiclass multilabel classification, called McBel-Plnc, based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) using each of the five datasets randomly generated from the prepared data. Based on macro average, the test results showed the high precision of 0.9151 \u00b1 0.0038 averaged from the five models with the lower recall of 0.5786 \u00b1 0.0208. The small standard deviations confirmed the model stability. Comparing with iDeepE with a binary relevance method, iDeepE got the higher recall with the significantly lower precision (0.6912 and 0.1987, respectively).

In this survey, we discuss current work on cooperative and competitive MASs and aim to make the distinctions and overlap between the two approaches more explicit. ::: ::: Lastly, this paper summarizes the papers of the first International workshop on Learning and Adaptation in MAS (LAMAS) hosted at the fourth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems (AAMAS'05) and places the work in the above survey.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11691839_1", "venue": "LAMAS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2495884693,1596727164", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2570857", "150961712", "18256288", "14982527", "242105", "143240714", "15469756", "14914834", "152710090", "14386538", "168332229", "6795438", "6277700", "8014503", "11866341", "17083777", "59905706", "37981840", "424446", "6665743", "291197", "7697772", "166865291", "3010227", "2200805", "7885581", "11512397", "14268907", "12107974", "13588814", "2754345", "14545496", "116184822", "15295656", "119692687", "266978", "154845826", "12786347", "16327263", "6983831", "10374387", "1241650", "5228823", "7490553", "1394727", "23385721", "6061086", "17441907", "16811386", "805090", "5976664", "85023742", "7671810", "6922419", "12547591", "5085448", "60155113", "797384", "9022934", "1708582", "765279", "2440510", "15831895", "152921622", "166888650", "8108362", "16776495", "2620886", "13978669", "14549600", "14905078", "14610547", "18750212", "2895801", "14273924", "14624433", "27263747", "1193177", "119861247", "124452949", "1182915", "2167913", "154961404", "6680982", "8140420", "60897233", "29322444", "6356521", "13620780", "13916714", "10619916", "40745276", "59883442", "8638479", "2869546", "2805981", "59884003", "118322776", "18422035", "152666363", "9213072", "494962", "16671606", "224746", "10370626", "153121765", "14610440", "12520973", "12664323", "3264931", "16849877", "2102933", "11379650", "3266062", "24840855", "41956252", "16637134", "3177337", "3093694", "8019496", "14342974", "31103662", "16264735", "15050085", "195857594", "5857607", "5980461", "36087773", "12911552", "2908243", "59809750", "124585526", "5320617", "9355993", "5955353", "51976556", "2476404", "12193979"], "inbound_citations": ["1342900", "13171013", "6496923", "182739138", "16964340", "208039306", "10515168", "49581942", "3163754", "18312800", "164155", "12533228", "158047000", "10161508", "7496856", "17864989", "14333923"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8862416"}

Logistic regression and Support Vector Machines are typical examples of soft and hard classifiers respectively. The essential difference between these two groups is whether one needs to estimate the class conditional probability for the classification task or not. In particular, soft classifiers predict the label based on the obtained class conditional probabilities, while hard classifiers bypass the estimation of probabilities and focus on the decision boundary. In practice, for the goal of accurate classification, it is unclear which one to use in a given situation. To tackle this problem, the Large-margin Unified Machine (LUM) was recently proposed as a unified family to embrace both groups. The LUM family enables one to study the behavior change from soft to hard binary classifiers. For multicategory cases, however, the concept of soft and hard classification becomes less clear. In that case, class probability estimation becomes more involved as it requires estimation of a probability vector. In this paper, we propose a new Multicategory LUM (MLUM) framework to investigate the behavior of soft versus hard classification under multicategory settings. Our theoretical and numerical results help to shed some light on the nature of multicategory classification and its transition behavior from soft to hard classifiers.

The Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) Code, a mono-hierarchical multi-axial code, served as a basis for this work. To extensively evaluate the image enhancement techniques, five classification schemes including the complete IRMA code were adopted. The deep convolutional neural network systems Inception-v3 and Inception-ResNet-v2, and Random Forest models with 1000 trees were trained using extracted Bag-of-Keypoints visual representations. The classification model performances were evaluated using the ImageCLEF 2009 Medical Annotation Task test set. The applied visual enhancement techniques proved to achieve better annotation accuracy in all classification schemes.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6231616", "pubmed_id": "30419028", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0206229", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2901159198", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["195618994", "16104735", "3583761", "3074096", "23268850", "10875300", "12428378", "4868246", "2087532", "6698107", "4596475", "2088679", "5550223", "206593880", "1023605", "207763512", "11206708", "2930547", "206594692", "6447277", "89141", "17606900", "1458265", "6110572", "5553697"], "inbound_citations": ["214596655", "208615215"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53292116"}

While our understanding of how the brain processes the spatial context of memories has advanced considerably, our understanding of their temporal organization lags far behind. In this paper, we propose a new approach for elucidating the neural basis of complex behaviors and temporal organization of memories. More specifically, we focus on neural decoding - the prediction of behavioral or experimental conditions based on observed neural data. In general, this is a challenging classification problem, which is of immense interest in neuroscience. Our goal is to develop a new framework that not only improves the overall accuracy of decoding, but also provides a clear latent representation of the decoding process. To accomplish this, our approach uses a Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) model with a diversity-encouraging prior based on determinantal point processes (DPP) to improve latent representation learning by avoiding redundancy in the latent space. We apply our method to data collected from a novel rat experiment that involves presenting repeated sequences of odors at a single port and testing the rats' ability to identify each odor.

Various data mining techniques exist for prediction of thermostable proteins. Furthermore, ANN methods have attracted significant attention for prediction of thermostability, because they constitute an appropriate approach to mapping the non-linear input-output relationships and massive parallel computing. Method: An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was applied to estimate thermal behavior of 1289 proteins. In the proposed algorithm, the parameters of ELM were optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which tuned a set of input variables, hidden layer biases, and input weights, to and enhance the prediction performance. The method was executed on a set of amino acids, yielding a total of 613 protein features. A number of feature selection algorithms were used to build subsets of the features. A total of 1289 protein samples and 613 protein features were calculated from UniProt database to understand features contributing to the enzymes\u2019 thermostability and find out the main features that influence this valuable characteristic. Results:At the primary structure level, Gln, Glu and polar were the features that mostly contributed to protein thermostability. At the secondary structure level, Helix_S, Coil, and charged_Coil were the most important features affecting protein thermostability. These results suggest that the thermostability of proteins is mainly associated with primary structural features of the protein. According to the results, the influence of primary structure on the thermostabilty of a protein was more important than that of the secondary structure. It is shown that prediction accuracy of ELM (mean square error) can improve dramatically using GA with error rates RMSE=0.004 and MAPE=0.1003. Conclusion: The proposed approach for forecasting problem significantly improves the accuracy of ELM in prediction of thermostable enzymes. ELM tends to require more neurons in the hidden-layer than conventional tuning-based learning algorithms. To overcome these, the proposed approach uses a GA which optimizes the structure and the parameters of the ELM. In summary, optimization of ELM with GA results in an efficient prediction method; numerical experiments proved that our approach yields excellent results.

This paper describes a retrospective analysis of a prevalence survey of NIs done in the Geneva University Hospital. Our goal is to identify patients with one or more NIs on the basis of clinical and other data collected during the survey. In this two-class classification task, the main difficulty lies in the significant imbalance between positive or infected (11%) and negative (89%) cases. To cope with class imbalance, we investigate one-class SVMs which can be trained to distinguish two classes on the basis of examples from a single class (in this case, only \"normal\" or non infected patients). The infected ones are then identified as \"abnormal\" cases or outliers that deviate significantly from the normal profile. Experimental results are encouraging: whereas standard 2-class SVMs scored a baseline sensitivity of 50.6% on this problem, the one-class approach increased sensitivity to as much as 92.6%.

However, training DNNs requires costly pixel-level annotations. In this paper, we leverage the observation that image-level tags provide important cues of foreground salient objects, and develop a weakly supervised learning method for saliency detection using image-level tags only. The Foreground Inference Network (FIN) is introduced for this challenging task. In the first stage of our training method, FIN is jointly trained with a fully convolutional network (FCN) for image-level tag prediction. A global smooth pooling layer is proposed, enabling FCN to assign object category tags to corresponding object regions, while FIN is capable of capturing all potential foreground regions with the predicted saliency maps. In the second stage, FIN is fine-tuned with its predicted saliency maps as ground truth.

This paper describes the possible effects of feedback on learning (associations) using a connectionist tool, the delta rule. Feedback in instruction can be described in terms of the interaction of stimulus inputs and response outputs, an associationist perspective. Here the delta rule is applied to each instance that an input and an output likely interact; the delta rule is used to describe the direction and magnitude of increase or inhibition of each instance. The total effect for a 'type' of feedback is then described by the combination of the instances that make up that type. The findings of this investigation may provide seminal foundations for understanding feedback effects. Focus of this Paper This presentation will focus on: Overview of the Connectionist approach \"PERMISSION TO REPRODUCE THIS Implications of lesson item difficulty MATERIAL HAS BEEN GRANTED BY R. B. Clariana Delta rule calculations for immediate and delayed feedback Implications TO THE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES INFORMATION CENTER (ERIC).\" Connectionist Approach Recently, connectionist investigations have revived associationist views of memory. Connectionist apply various mathematical rules within neural network computer simulations in a search to mimic and describe memory associations and learning. For example, trained neural nets 2 BEST COPY AVAILABLE Mathematical explanation of feedback . . . 2 have been shown to be capable of pattern matching, recognition, and classification (Haberlandt, 1997) among other things. This approach provides additional ways to understand cognitive activity (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1985). Among a number of connectionist rules, the delta rule (Shanks, 1995; Widrow & Hoff, 1960) is one of the simplest that include the effects of feedback on learning. The delta rule describes the change in association weight, termed Aw, between an input unit and an output unit at each learning trial, as Awio = a ain (to aotn), where a is the learning rate parameter, ain is the activation level of input units, to is the desired response (the t refers to 'teacher', in this case to is item feedback), and aoot is the activation level of the output units (from Shanks, 1995). In instructional terms, learning is an increase in the association (e.g., an increase in Awio) between the stimulus (ain) and the correct response (aont), with a relative decrease in association (e.g., a decrease in ANA%) for incorrect responses. For example, suppose you move to a new city; for the question \"What is your postal zip code?\", your old zip code at that instance will have a probability of being recalled of say .53, while your new zip code would have a probability of .24 (refer to Figure 1). Over time, the old will decrease (if it is not recollected) while the new increases. Note that the two are separate but probably correlated units. Interference (RI and PI) and also retrieval competition between the two is likely, and so context of recall is important.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "5358519", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58474833"}

State-of-the-art methods for arc filtering use separate classifiers to make point-wise decisions about the tree; they label tokens with roles such as root, leaf, or attaches-to-the-left, and then filter arcs accordingly. Because these classifiers overlap substantially in their filtering consequences, we propose to train them jointly, so that each classifier can focus on the gaps of the others. We integrate the various pointwise decisions as latent variables in a single arc-level SVM classifier. This novel framework allows us to combine nine pointwise filters, and adjust their sensitivity using a shared threshold based on arc length. Our system filters 32% more arcs than the independently-trained classifiers, without reducing filtering speed.

Recently, the Spatially Localized Atlas Network Tiles (SLANT) approach has been shown to effectively segment whole brain non-contrast T1w MRI with 132 volumetric labels. Enhancing generalizability of SLANT would enable broader application of volumetric assessment in multi-site studies. Transfer learning (TL) is commonly used to update the neural network weights for local factors; yet, it is commonly recognized to risk degradation of performance on the original validation/test cohorts. Here, we explore TL by data augmentation to address these concerns in the context of adapting SLANT to anatomical variation and scanning protocol. We consider two datasets: First, we optimize for age with 30 T1w MRI of young children with manually corrected volumetric labels, and accuracy of automated segmentation defined relative to the manually provided truth. Second, we optimize for acquisition with 36 paired datasets of pre- and post-contrast clinically acquired T1w MRI, and accuracy of the post-contrast segmentations assessed relative to the pre-contrast automated assessment. For both studies, we augment the original TL step of SLANT with either only the new data or with both original and new data. Over baseline SLANT, both approaches yielded significantly improved performance (signed rank tests; pediatric: 0.89 vs. 0.82 DSC, p<0.001; contrast: 0.80 vs 0.76, p<0.001).

A footprint has three types of features which are sufficient to recognize a person uniquely. These features are categorized into geometric, texture, and minutiae. We have computed most widely used geometry features of the foot using length, width, area, major axis, and minor axis, to identify a person uniquely. Different variations of these features are computed by assigning weights to each feature emphasizing its importance. We have extracted the best variations among foot descriptors, and conclude that the province is the most contributing factor to identify a person foot uniquely. Foot contour features are further combined with foot descriptors to increase the accuracy. For texture, Gray level co-occurrence matrix based on Haralick features is computed with Support Vector Machine as the classifier.

Deep learning techniques (in particular convolutional neural networks, CNNs) have recently emerged as a promising approach for statistical downscaling due to their ability to learn spatial features from huge spatio-temporal datasets. However, existing studies are based on complex models, applied to particular case studies and using simple validation frameworks, which makes difficult a proper assessment of the (possible) added value offered by these techniques. As a result, these models are usually seen as black-boxes generating distrust among the climate community, particularly in climate change problems. In this paper we undertake a comprehensive assessment of deep learning techniques for continental-scale statistical downscaling, building on the VALUE validation framework. In particular, different CNN models of increasing complexity are applied for downscaling temperature and precipitation over Europe, comparing them with a few standard benchmark methods from VALUE (linear and generalized linear models) which have been traditionally used for this purpose. Besides analyzing the adequacy of different components and topologies, we also focus on their extrapolation capability, a critical point for their possible application in climate change studies. To do this, we use a warm test period as surrogate of possible future climate conditions. Our results show that, whilst the added value of CNNs is mostly limited to the reproduction of extremes for temperature, these techniques do outperform the classic ones for the case of precipitation for most aspects considered. This overall good performance, together with the fact that they can be suitably applied to large regions (e.g. continents) without worrying about the spatial features being considered as predictors, can foster the use of statistical approaches in international initiatives such as CORDEX.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/gmd-2019-278", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoscientific Model Development Discussions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["203705191", "52950361", "202904905", "128843101", "85506333", "41814621", "44240988", "134005421", "54458117", "131201646", "85499694", "6916627", "10140273", "31051639", "129242873", "132734574", "178939169", "133823677", "133313175", "125210236", "134595205", "49182888", "61156451", "198998197", "52020649", "125443981", "86770882", "11715509", "17224518", "128619546", "88514923", "13205911", "88514923", "127061995", "133902562", "55096988", "125794884"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207970819"}

Nevertheless, such models can often waste their capacity on the minutiae of datasets, presumably due to weak inductive biases in their decoders. This is where graphics engines may come in handy since they abstract away low-level details and represent images as high-level programs. Current methods that combine deep learning and renderers are limited by hand-crafted likelihood or distance functions, a need for large amounts of supervision, or difficulties in scaling their inference algorithms to richer datasets. To mitigate these issues, we present SPIRAL, an adversarially trained agent that generates a program which is executed by a graphics engine to interpret and sample images. The goal of this agent is to fool a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and rendered data, trained with a distributed reinforcement learning setup without any supervision. A surprising finding is that using the discriminator's output as a reward signal is the key to allow the agent to make meaningful progress at matching the desired output rendering.

We present a classification of parent material for pedologic purposes, which includes twelve lithology classes based on mineralogical and chemical composition. The relationships of these lithology classes with six key soil properties (soil organic carbon, pH, cation exchange capacity, sum of bases, total P and clay %) were examined in a case study over New South Wales, Australia. We used multiple linear regression, Random Forest and Cubist tree models based on a soil dataset of over 3200 points. Semi-quantitative estimates are derived of change in these soil properties with a change in lithology class, and an associated silica index, for example, a 22% relative decrease in soil organic carbon with each 10% rise in silica, broadly equivalent to a change from shale to granite, assuming other factors remain constant. Parent material covariates are essential for the effective modelling and mapping of soil properties. Widely available lithology data have the potential for greater use in digital soil modelling and mapping (DSMM) programs. We compared the performance of the classified lithology data with other continuous, geophysical parent material covariates such as gamma radiometrics in digital soil models and maps over NSW. The lithology covariate was demonstrated to exert the greatest influence on all six soil properties, coming well ahead of all geophysical parent material and other environmental covariates. Validation statistics demonstrated strong improvement in both model and map quality when the lithology covariate was included. For example, Lin's concordance for the Cubist sum of bases model rose from 0.46 with no parent material covariates to 0.58 with the continuous geophysical covariates to a high of 0.77 when lithology was also used. The improvement was typically slightly less marked in the final digital maps than for the calibration models, probably due to the lower reliability of the lithology grid derived from broad scale polygonal geological and soil data. A process is suggested for the application of lithology data into DSMM programs. Despite the potential drawbacks of using polygonal data, properly organised categorical lithology data can be a strong covariate to complement other continuous geophysical data sources in DSMM programs, particularly where reliable and fine scale geological and soil data are available.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.catena.2016.07.045", "venue": null, "journal": "Catena", "mag_id": "2476526216", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134438396", "53404030", "134695440", "55050032", "52294951"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132583107"}

In recent years, it has been found that light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data provide a source of complementary information that can greatly assist in the classification of hyperspectral data, in particular when it is difficult to separate complex classes. This is because, in addition to the spatial and the spectral information provided by hyperspectral data, LiDAR can provide very valuable information about the height of the surveyed area that can help with the discrimination of classes and their separability. In the past, several efforts have been investigated for fusion of hyperspectral and LiDAR data, with some efforts driven by the morphological information that can be derived from both data sources. However, a main challenge for the learning approaches is how to exploit the information coming from multiple features. Specifically, it has been found that simple concatenation or stacking of features such as morphological attribute profiles (APs) may contain redundant information. In addition, a significant increase in the number of features may lead to very high-dimensional input features. This is in contrast with the limited number of training samples often available in remote-sensing applications, which may lead to the Hughes effect. In this work, we develop a new efficient strategy for fusion and classification of hyperspectral and LiDAR data. Our approach has been designed to integrate multiple types of features extracted from these data. An important characteristic of the presented approach is that it does not require any regularization parameters, so that different types of features can be efficiently exploited and integrated in a collaborative and flexible way. Our experimental results, conducted using a hyperspectral image and a LiDAR-derived digital surface model (DSM) collected over the University of Houston campus and the neighboring urban area, indicate that the proposed framework for multiple feature learning provides state-of-the-art classification results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2432037", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1497089125", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10913825", "20845360", "16008390", "11112426", "6054680", "24392651", "6594715", "42732701", "9412289", "17637501", "16327957", "198909218", "34220865", "11061993", "17347221", "62586054", "42670095", "60452913", "13284902", "128848964", "7443466", "15049946", "16327957", "1670668", "11766022", "20180884", "118825644", "6906514", "1006603", "14495716", "7664224", "6445796", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["104293177", "53226624", "53224836", "1279586", "3825668", "56517392", "59232279", "13745627", "3075418", "20705436", "52309627", "59039499", "9873724", "46897307", "211476023", "145941655", "54436220", "211059932", "150331370", "33486201", "52959642", "202178774", "36433081", "54454862", "203025826", "211020774", "23134973", "22862566", "55298053", "73614814", "211210637", "144208032", "201620503", "208039114", "125983024", "203593987", "24541101", "28520811", "208039147", "53282875", "53943702", "21050049", "5352721", "20582613", "53012170", "73462657", "126889931", "124929241", "22215385", "69286304", "210970500"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20680551"}

Despite their success on large-scale datasets collected in the constrained lab environment, it is difficult to obtain the 3D pose annotations for in-the-wild images. Therefore, 3D human pose estimation in the wild is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning framework, which distills the 3D human pose structures learned from the fully annotated dataset to in-the-wild images with only 2D pose annotations. Instead of defining hard-coded rules to constrain the pose estimation results, we design a novel multi-source discriminator to distinguish the predicted 3D poses from the ground-truth, which helps to enforce the pose estimator to generate anthropometrically valid poses even with images in the wild. We also observe that a carefully designed information source for the discriminator is essential to boost the performance. Thus, we design a geometric descriptor, which computes the pairwise relative locations and distances between body joints, as a new information source for the discriminator. The efficacy of our adversarial learning framework with the new geometric descriptor has been demonstrated through extensive experiments on widely used public benchmarks.

The present study developed a novel OBIA classification using FCN and multi-view data extracted from small Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for mapping landcovers. Specifically, this study proposed three methods to automatically generate multi-view training samples from orthoimage training datasets to conduct multi-view object-based classification using FCN, and compared their performances with each other and also with RF, SVM, and DCNN classifiers. The first method does not consider the object surrounding information, while the other two utilized object context information. We demonstrated that all the three versions of FCN multi-view object-based classification outperformed their counterparts utilizing orthoimage data only. Furthermore, the results also showed that when multi-view training samples were prepared with consideration of object surroundings, FCN trained with these samples gave much better accuracy than FCN classification trained without context information. Similar accuracies were achieved from the two methods utilizing object surrounding information, although sample preparation was conducted using two different ways.

A discriminative relational feature learning method is proposed for fusing heterogeneous RGB and depth modalities, and classifying the actions in RGB-D sequences. Our method factorizes the feature matrix of each modality, and enforces the same semantics for them in order to learn shared features from multimodal data. This allows us to capture the complex correlations between the two modalities. To improve the discriminative power of the relational features, we introduce a hinge loss to measure the classification accuracy when the features are employed for classification. This essentially performs supervised factorization, and learns discriminative features that are optimized for classification. We formulate the recognition task within a maximum margin framework, and solve the formulation using a coordinate descent algorithm. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two public RGB-D action data sets. We demonstrate that the proposed method can learn extremely low-dimensional features with superior discriminative power, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a method for fault detection in microgrids using data mining patterns and classification algorithms. For this reason, several short circuit fault and no-fault cases (i.e. load switching, motor starting and transformer energization) are generated and one cycle of the voltage and current signals is preprocessed by wavelet packet transform (WPT). The main features of voltage and current signals are extracted using detailed coefficients of the WPT. For discriminating faults from no-fault events, two different classifiers (i.e. random forest (RF) and K-nearest neighbors (K-NN)) are utilized. To improve the classifiers accuracy or reduce data storage requirements of relays, two filter based feature selection methods are applied on feature vector for choosing the most relevant features.

To accomplish this in an automated fashion, many relatedness measures have been proposed. However, most of these metrics only encode information contained in the underlying corpus and thus do not directly model human intuition. To solve this, we propose to utilize a metric learning approach to improve existing semantic relatedness measures by learning from additional information, such as explicit human feedback. For this, we argue to use word embeddings instead of traditional high-dimensional vector representations in order to leverage their semantic density and to reduce computational cost. We rigorously test our approach on several domains including tagging data as well as publicly available embeddings based on Wikipedia texts and navigation. Human feedback about semantic relatedness for learning and evaluation is extracted from publicly available datasets such as MEN or WS-353.

Unlike most existing pedestrian detection methods which only use coarse-resolution feature maps with fixed receptive fields, our approach exploits multi-grained deep features to make the detector robust to visible parts of occluded pedestrians and small-size targets. Specifically, we jointly train a multi-scale network and a human parsing network in a weakly supervised manner with only bounding box annotations. We carefully design the multi-scale network to predict pedestrians of particular scales with the most appropriate feature maps, by matching their receptive fields with the target sizes. The human parsing network generates a fine-grained attention map, which helps guide the detector to focus on the visible parts of occluded pedestrians and small-size instances. Both networks are computed in parallel and form a unified single stage pedestrian detector, which assures a suitable tradeoff between accuracy and speed. Moreover, we introduce an adversarial hiding network to make our detector more robust to occlusion situations, which generates occlusions on pedestrians with the goal to fool the detector that in turn adapts itself to learn to localize these adversarial instances.

This improvement comes from the possibility of constructing neural networks with a higher number of potentially diverse layers and is known as Deep Learning.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-50127-7_11", "venue": "Australasian Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2557513839", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17151538", "872430", "206741418", "683036", "355163", "478431", "443553", "1877485", "207218705", "6780262", "14159494", "7198816", "383749", "9302624", "21791", "6844431", "2648522", "1482604", "2430214", "14351490", "12293999", "1748204"], "inbound_citations": ["204952887", "195346133", "209525913", "36849560", "197928121", "114730029", "23354916", "208208634", "203610609", "174789486", "91184576", "207959705", "196199890", "54456411", "4735139", "1044188", "53446039", "167217661", "201786759", "3274283", "54199515", "49908612", "211267791", "10232806", "10232806", "19713317", "69413820", "198233182", "199510545", "49693744", "9045692", "52290789", "202739221", "141466221", "4739525", "22442022", "21730565", "49529336", "52903278", "52116780", "212649584", "214684285", "4266190", "202158413", "131777914", "214694132", "57573695", "55018932", "39161365", "84187094", "201067444", "49653696", "49671154", "38380630", "207959118", "51969738", "195832343", "52056212", "211243849", "198146270", "214713676", "210972105", "19775973", "3396820", "132694257", "174820289", "212699348", "49866160", "91182142", "207831861", "57366141", "57366141", "214582819", "57377734", "109929301", "20012396", "44107660", "201711118", "197671962", "54444699", "52067451", "196589919", "32399825", "54644603", "211263858", "148572855", "145921425", "58670192", "155108911", "203161190", "209353355", "174799633", "21388434", "119292960", "207848033", "211244531", "199510427", "203605608", "215415140", "204915958", "150175779", "202577506", "36702866", "198930636", "4372713", "52963102", "197431210", "33893604", "209065634", "201032090", "198926171", "210930567", "59620183", "85448806", "26928273"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9413935"}

An InfoGenerative Adversarial Networks-based transformation network is proposed to transform multi-views of the given object, which carries the representation information in the generative models and discriminative models, guaranteeing the synthetic transformed view matches the source view. The advantages of the MEIGAN are that it bypasses direct mappings among different views, and can solve the problem of missing views in training data and the problem of mapping between transformed views and source views.

SVM learns the decision boundary from two classes (for Binary Classification) of training points.

These outliers are affecting on margin and classification performance, and machine should better to discard them. SVM as a popular and widely used classification algorithm is very sensitive to these outliers and lacks the ability to discard them. Many research results prove this sensitivity which is a weak point for SVM. Different approaches are proposed to reduce the effect of outliers but no method is suitable for all types of data sets.

This paper proposed emotion recognition of three basic emotions of elders, such as happy, sad and angry based on those physiological signals. Window size segmentation that was used to extract both physiological signals was 15 second. Then, statistical feature extraction method was used to obtain the features of SpO 2 and Pulse Rate (PR). Support Vector Machine (SVM) with selecting the best of C and \u03b3 parameters and the most optimal K parameters of k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method were used to classify the extracted features which were tested in several scenarios: classification using SpO 2 , using PR and using SpO 2 \u2013PR features. The result showed that SVM achieved the best accuracy (72.86%) and precision (71.30%) compared to k-NN. Furthermore, combining the features of both physiological signals could improve the accuracy and precision scores more than 3.70% compared to the single physiological signal. This result provides information of emotion recognition in term of SpO 2 and PR signals which can be better detected by combining the features of both physiological signals.

In this study, we mapped the species in a study area that includes the capital, Hargeisa, using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. During a field campaign in 2015 we collected canopy-level spectral signatures of P. juliflora and native trees, to analyse the potential use of spectral data in discriminating the invasive species. P. juliflora was found to be generally distinguishable because of its greater vigour during the dry season. We tested the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier and different classification set-ups, varying the spatial resolution (original 30 m vs. pan-sharpened 15 m) and image acquisition dates (during the wet season, the dry season and a combination of the two). Best overall accuracy (84%) was achieved using pan-sharpened data from the two seasons.

Mostly, atrial arrhythmia leads to CHF. Previous studies on ARR and CHF are focused on the binary classification of each category against normal sinus rhythm (NSR). So, there is a requirement to study the above disease cases together to detect the severity of the situation and take remedial action accordingly. The goal of this study is to analyse and classify these three different classes of ECG (namely ARR, CHF, and NSR) in an efficient way. We used 30 ECG recordings for each of the classes from the publicly available Physionet database. Since the temporal and spectral features by themselves may be insufficient to distinguish the classes, we sought to combine information across both. Accordingly, we considered feature representations from heart rate variability (HRV) of the ECG signal and wavelet-based features together with auto-regressive coefficients. To leverage complementary information across feature types, we employed feature-level fusion. We examined the performance of individual and fused feature types with multiple classifiers. The highest accuracy of 93.33% for three-class classification was obtained after feature fusion using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In this paper, we propose an order execution cost estimation approach by using limited real orders and unlimited simulated orders. The approach 1) employs exploratory data analysis to explore the patterns and relationships included in the raw data, and selects the appropriate features for model training, 2) trains supervised models on labeled orders as baselines to estimate order execution cost, 3) trains three Semisupervised Learning (SSL) models on both labeled and simulated orders to improve the estimation performances, where a. Semisupervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM) makes a low-density separation on labeled and unlabeled orders, b. Tri-Training performs bootstrap sampling on the labeled orders to obtain three labeled training sets to make disagreement for labeling unlabeled orders, and c. Label Propagation (LP) model propagates the order execution cost labels of the labeled orders to the unlabeled ones on a graph and adjusts the labels based on local and global consistency. Experiments are conducted on real and simulated order datasets.

A comprehensive algorithm was created to translate these criteria into a clinical decision-making guide. ::: ::: Objective This study investigated the translation of the individual subgroup criteria into a comprehensive algorithm by studying the prevalence of patients meeting the criteria for each treatment subgroup and the reliability of the classification. ::: ::: Design This was a cross-sectional, observational study. ::: ::: Methods Two hundred fifty patients with acute or subacute LBP were recruited from the United States and Australia to participate in the study. Trained physical therapists performed standardized assessments on all participants. The researchers used these findings to classify participants into subgroups. Thirty-one participants were reassessed to determine interrater reliability of the algorithm decision. ::: ::: Results Based on individual subgroup criteria, 25.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]=19.8%\u201330.6%) of the participants did not meet the criteria for any subgroup, 49.6% (95% CI=43.4%\u201355.8%) of the participants met the criteria for only one subgroup, and 25.2% (95% CI=19.8%\u201330.6%) of the participants met the criteria for more than one subgroup. The most common combination of subgroups was manipulation + specific exercise (68.4% of the participants who met the criteria for 2 subgroups). Reliability of the algorithm decision was moderate (kappa=0.52, 95% CI=0.27\u20130.77, percentage of agreement=67%). ::: ::: Limitations Due to a relatively small patient sample, reliability estimates are somewhat imprecise. ::: ::: Conclusions These findings provide important clinical data to guide future research and revisions to the algorithm. The finding that 25% of the participants met the criteria for more than one subgroup has important implications for the sequencing of treatments in the algorithm. Likewise, the finding that 25% of the participants did not meet the criteria for any subgroup provides important information regarding potential revisions to the algorithm's bottom table (which guides unclear classifications).

We introduce a novel transformer based architecture that jointly learns Continuous Sign Language Recognition and Translation while being trainable in an end-to-end manner. This is achieved by using a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to bind the recognition and translation problems into a single unified architecture. This joint approach does not require any ground-truth timing information, simultaneously solving two co-dependant sequence-to-sequence learning problems and leads to significant performance gains. We evaluate the recognition and translation performances of our approaches on the challenging RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T) dataset.

TOR is composed of a set of routers that make use of cryptography to apply several layers of encryption to packets, thus hiding the IP address of the user but also the relationship between the user and the server, and the contents he/she is accessing to. Despite TOR can provide a high degree of anonymity, it is vulnerable to specific attacks, such as Website Fingerprinting (WF). By means of WF, an attacker can guess the web page accessed by a given user under some circumstances. The main goal of this work is to analyze the robustness of TOR against such attacks. With this purpose, an attacker who is capable of eavesdropping the packets being sent and received by a given user has been emulated. The attack relies on the hypothesis that the attacker knows in advance the set of possible web pages the user is accessing to, i.e., it is performed under the assumption of a closed world. In order to perform the attack, it is need to create a dataset containing a set of traces with the packets sent and received when downloading each one of the web pages. The dataset must be properly formatted, and then a Machine Learning algorithm is applied to classify each trace, according to the web page it is linked to. An exhaustive set of tests has been run by using three algorithms: KNN, SVM and Random Forest.

In the field of remote sensing, there have been studies regarding single tree extraction using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data.

However, using these physical characteristics can\u2019t be very useful for identifying which trees are within a plantation, a forest, or a single tree. This is the motivation for developing algorithms of automated differentiation of random trees from plantation trees. Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) was used to acquire the locations of individual trees. Trees were separated from other land cover in the image using a CHM derived from LiDAR point cloud data. Using watershed algorithm in eCognition, trees with good canopy spacing was easily distinguished. A spatial point pattern analysis was done from the extracted locations of trees to differentiate regularly patterned points from randomly distributed points. Nearest neighbour statistics was done to provide measurement of the distribution of the extracted points. The Z-Score parameter from nearest neighbor was then added to the layers in eCognition as supplement to the available height derivatives such as mean, standard deviation, and different textural parameters. Supervised type of classification was used in order to classify the trees on the image. Training samples of each tree from the image were entered in Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the different trees. Two sets of validation were done to compare the results of using the object parameters only, and the object parameters and Z-Score. Addition of the Z-Score from the object parameters increased the obtained accuracy on both validation sets.

We also devise a few variants of relativistic $f$-divergences. Wasserstein GAN was originally justified by the idea that the Wasserstein distance (WD) is most sensible because it is weak (i.e., it induces a weak topology). We show that the WD is weaker than $f$-divergences which are weaker than relativistic $f$-divergences. Given the good performance of RGANs, this suggests that WGAN does not performs well primarily because of the weak metric, but rather because of regularization and the use of a relativistic discriminator. We also take a closer look at estimators of relativistic $f$-divergences. We introduce the minimum-variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) for Relativistic paired GANs (RpGANs; originally called RGANs which could bring confusion) and show that it does not perform better. Furthermore, we show that the estimator of Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs) is only asymptotically unbiased, but that the finite-sample bias is small.

As seen in Fig. 2b, compared with L1 words, the L2 words occupied only small and fragmented regions on the semantic map (the shaded areas), and the small chunks isolated from the main part of the L2 words tended to be interspersed in L1 regions and close to those L1 words with similar meaning. Our results suggest a dynamic developmental picture for bilingual lexical acquisition: the acquisition of two languages entails strong competition in a highly interactive context and limited plasticity as a function of timing of learning; whether bilingual representations are distinct or shared will depend on important developmental factors such as the history of learning. Our study illustrates computational mechanisms underlying L1-L2 competition, learning entrenchment, and plasticity of learning (see also Hernandez, Li, & MacWhinney, 2005). How do bilingual learners acquire a structured representation for the two lexicons at early stages of lexical acquisition? In this study, we attempt to address this question with Devlex-II, a self-organizing connectionist model. Previous connectionist simulations suggest that bilingual lexical representations may be functionally separate, but architecturally homogeneous (Li & Farkas, 2002). Here, we expand this single-mechanism- variable-representation view from a dynamical developmental perspective. Results from our study will provide insights into the long-standing debate on distinct versus shared structure of bilingual lexical representation. Figure 1: The DevLex-II model of lexical development. The DevLex-II model is a cognitively and neurally plausible connectionist model based on principle of self- organization and Hebbian learning rules (Zhao & Li, 2005). It consists of three self-organizing feature maps that are connected via associative links trained by Hebbian learning. Upon training, the meaning, phonology, and phonemic sequence of a word are processed by the network. The acquisition of Chinese and English is the bilingual context that the current model simulates. Here, each lexicon included 500 words, and was derived from CDI, the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories. In the current study, we manipulated (1) the size of the input lexicon over different developmental stages, and (2) the onset time of L2 lexical learning \u2013 simultaneous: onset times of the two languages are identical; sequential: onset time of L2 (Chinese) is delayed relative to that of L1 (English). The sequential learning can be further divided into two situations, one as early L2 learning and the other late L2 learning. Our results show that: (1) distinct representations for the two lexicons can gradually develop in our network under simultaneous learning; (2) the representational structure is highly dependent on the onset time of L2 learning (Figure 2): when the learning of L2 was early relative to that of L1, (a) (b) Figure 2: Semantic organization of the bilingual lexicon acquired by DevLex-II.

Infants with high blood levels of bilirubin called hyperbilirubinaemia, evolve the yellow color when bilirubin acquires in the skin. The major symptom of jaundice is yellow coloring of the skin and conjunctiva of the eyes. Jaundice can also make babies sleepy, which can lead to poor feeding. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia can be caused by dehydration, lack of adequate nutritional intake, extravasation of blood, cephalohematoma, contusion and may be potentially cause kernicterus. Because many of these problems affect newborns, they may require critical care from specialty medical disciplines. Thus, in this paper a combination of the Maximal Information Compression Index (MICI) for redundant feature elimination with PSO optimization for complexity reduction is proposed. Statistical features are derived from the texture images and used as features to quantify infant image textures. Finally, a Kernel SVM (Support Vector Machine) is employed as a classifier for selecting infant image textures. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method can act as a supplement to support earlier detection and more effective treatment due to improved jaundice detection.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "J.

Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are commonly used to solve the scene labelling problem since they represent contextual information efficiently and provide efficient inference methods. However, when a robot navigates through an unknown environment, it is often necessary to adjust the parameters of the CRF online to maintain the same level of accuracy under changes no predicted during the training phase. Online parameter learning can be challenging since ground truth information is not available for newly encountered scenes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method to learn the parameters of a constrained CRF (cCRF) in an online fashion. By leveraging the information from laser scans and image data the complexity of the labelling problem can be significantly reduced. The parameters are estimated by optimising a novel loss function that takes into account highly confident labels as a reference while eliminating the need for manual labelling. These labels are obtained purely based on the information from camera and laser sensors, in a self-supervised manner. Sensor data is pre-processed using methods such as convolutional nets, discriminant analysis, and Euclidean distance based clustering to extract reference labels. We show that this online parameter learning is robust to changes in the data distribution by selecting the learning rate appropriately.

Accurately identifying them is important for Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP). Focusing on biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER), this thesis presents a number of novel results on the following topics of this area. ::: First, we study whether corpus based statistical learning methods, currently dominant in BioNER, would achieve close-to-human performance by using larger corpora for training. We find that a significantly larger corpus is required to achieve a performance significantly higher than the state-of-the-art obtained on the GENIA corpus. This finding suggests the hypothesis is not warranted. ::: Second, we address the issue of nested NEs and propose a level-by-level method that learns a separate NER model for each level of the nesting. We show that this method works well for both nested NEs and non-nested NEs. ::: Third, we propose a method that builds NEs on top of base NP chunks, and examine the associated benefits as well as problems. Our experiments show that this method, though inferior to statistical word based approaches, has the potential to outperform them, provided that domain-specific rules can be designed to determine NE boundaries based on NP chunks. Fourth, we present a method to do BioNER in the absence of annotated corpora. It uses an NE dictionary to label sentences, and then uses these partially labeled sentences to iteratively train an SVM model in the manner of semi-supervised learning. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the method. ::: Finally, we explore BioNER in Chinese text, an area that has not been studied by previous work. We train a character-based CRF model on a small set of manually annotated Chinese biomedical abstracts. We also examine the features usable for the model. Our evaluation suggests that corpus-based statistical learning approaches hold promise for this particular task. ::: All the proposed methods are novel and have applicability beyond the NE types and the languages considered here, and beyond the BioNER task itself. ::: Keywords.

The latter becomes apparent when one considers that models have to be validated, explained, deployed and maintained. Here, less complex model are often preferred, for validation or efficiency reasons, or even a strict requirement. Automatic gradient boosting simplifies this idea one step further, using only gradient boosting as a single learning algorithm in combination with model-based hyperparameter tuning, threshold optimization and encoding of categorical features.

Accurate and efficient failure diagnostics can guarantee that the operator makes the correct maintenance decision, thereby reducing the maintenance costs and improving system availability. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is discussed in this thesis with the purpose of accurate and efficient failure diagnostics. The SVM utilizes the kernel method to transform input data from a lower dimensional space to a higher dimensional space. In the higher dimensional space, the hitherto linearly non separable patterns can be linearly separated, without compromising the computational cost. This facilitates failure diagnostics as in the higher dimensional space, the existing failure or incipient failure is more identifiable. The SVM uses the maximal margin method to overcome the \"overfitting\" problem. This problem makes the model fit special data sets. The maximal margin method also makes it suitable for solving small sample size problems. In this thesis, the SVM is compared with another well known technique, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In the comparative study, the SVM performs better than the ANN. However, as the performance of the SVM critically depends on the parameters of the kernel function, this thesis proposes using an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method to obtain the optimal parameters. The ACO optimized SVM is applied to diagnose the electric motor in a railway system. The Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an extension of the SVM. In this thesis, SVR is combined with a time-series to forecast reliability. Finally, to improve the SVM performance, the thesis proposes a multiple kernel SVM. The SVM is an excellent pattern recognition technique. However, to obtain an accurate diagnostics performance, one has to extract the appropriate features. This thesis discusses the features extracted from the time domain and uses the SVM to diagnose failure for a bearing. Another case in this thesis is presented, namely failure diagnostics for an electric motor installed in a railway's crossing and switching system; in this case, the features are extracted from the power consumption signal. In short, the thesis discusses the use of the SVM in failure diagnostics. Theoretically, the SVM is an excellent classifier or regressor possessing a solid theoretical foundation. Practically, the SVM performs well in failure diagnostics, as shown in the cases presented. Finally, as failure diagnostics critically relies on feature extraction, this thesis considers feature extraction from the time domain.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2234152351", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211551696", "11192913"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109970469"}

With exposure to a limited subset of grammatical sentences and their corresponding parse trees only, a holistic parser is capable of learning inductively the grammatical regularity underlying the training examples that affects the parsing process. In the past, various connectionist parsers have been proposed. Each approach had its own unique characteristics, and yet some techniques were shared in common. In this article, various dimensions underlying the design of a holistic parser are explored, including the methods to encode sentences and parse trees, whether a sentence and its corresponding parse tree share the same representation, the use of confluent inference, and the inclusion of phrases in the training set. Different combinations of these design factors give rise to different holistic parsers. In succeeding discussions, we scrutinize these design techniques and compare the performances of a few parsers on language parsing, including the confluent preorder parser, the backpropagation parsing network, the XERIC parser of Berg (1992), the modular connectionist parser of Sharkey and Sharkey (1992), Reilly's (1992) model, and their derivatives. Experiments are performed to evaluate their generalization capability and robustness. The results reveal a number of issues essential for building an effective holistic parser.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "10578042", "doi": "10.1162/089976699300016061", "venue": "Neural Computation", "journal": "Neural Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2145777524", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["57779767", "12549784", "2852656", "5518879", "60837340", "60590857", "2763403", "29043627", "38006189", "60467631", "17373566", "2781469", "8758087", "15588169", "59780317", "16444039", "6638216", "18309169", "195914990", "770011", "17836106", "59826686", "60182639"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10802257"}

The idea of developing FAM-OELM is motivated by the ELM concept proposed by Huang et al., for being an efficient learning algorithm that provides better generalization performance at a much faster learning speed. However, different from the batch learning ELM and its variant called the online sequential extreme learning machine which still requires an initial offline training phase before it can turn into online training, the proposed FAM-OELM showcases a framework that enable online learning to commence right from the first data sample. Here, classification can be conducted at any time during the training phase. Such appealing feature of the proposed algorithm has strictly fulfilled the criteria of being truly sequential, while many of the existing algorithms are not. In addition, FAM-OELM automatically grows hidden neuron such that the network can accommodate new information without over fitting and compromising on the knowledge learnt earlier. The simulation results reveal the efficacy and validity of FAM-OELM when it is applied to a real world application and various benchmark problems.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-014-9374-5", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2042758116", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["56667342", "16214427", "17653035", "15874442", "22700044", "116858", "7343126", "206089312", "1852628", "7028394", "15037168", "9782308", "14251733", "6404396", "14181277", "30609731", "13998723", "207222429", "16453988", "2598817", "209099422", "5697222", "111369686", "9152746"], "inbound_citations": ["52269796", "201810066", "85500514", "1630741", "12776433", "2242531", "204887188", "145051115", "2864097", "7074986", "211226796", "189824802"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16801466"}

Due to the adverse effects of CAN it is important to obtain a robust and highly accurate diagnostic tool for identification of early CAN, when treatment has the best outcome.

With respect to processing natural language, ILP can cater for the constant change in how we use language on a daily basis. At the same time, ILP does not require huge amounts of training examples such as other statistical methods and produces interpretable results, that means a set of rules, which can be analysed and tweaked if necessary. As contributions we extend XHAIL with (i) a pruning mechanism within the hypothesis generalisation algorithm which enables learning from larger datasets, (ii) a better usage of modern solver technology using recently developed optimisation methods, and (iii) a time budget that permits the usage of suboptimal results. We evaluate these improvements on the task of sentence chunking using three datasets from a recent SemEval competition.

The GAN model is composed of a generator that produces synthetic data and of a discriminator that discriminates between the generator's output and the true data. AE consist of an encoder which maps the model distribution to a latent manifold and of a decoder which maps the latent manifold to a reconstructed distribution. However, generative models are known to provoke chaotically scattered reconstructed distribution during their training, and consequently, incomplete generated adversarial distributions. Current distance measures fail to address this problem because they are not able to acknowledge the shape of the data manifold, i.e. its topological features, and the scale at which the manifold should be analyzed. We propose Persistent Homology for Generative Models, PHom-GeM, a new methodology to assess and measure the distribution of a generative model. PHom-GeM minimizes an objective function between the true and the reconstructed distributions and uses persistent homology, the study of the topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions, to compare the nature of the true and the generated distributions. Our experiments underline the potential of persistent homology for Wasserstein GAN in comparison to Wasserstein AE and Variational AE.

For that, this paper illustrates a machine learning approach for detecting the pedestrian zone and also to detect the pedestrians crossing in that zone. This is implemented by two different stages. In the first stage, the system checks for the presence of the pedestrian zone by combining the advantages of extended Center Symmetric \u2014 Local Binary Pattern (XCS-LBP) method and Adaptive Background Mixture Model for Foreground detection. Then it employs the Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) for the most accurate set of features and Linear Support Vector Machine (LinSVM) to classify whether the pedestrians present or not. The reason why the Linear SVM classifier is selected is because SVM provides the high generalization capacity and classifies more effectively. In the second stage, it analyzes the pedestrian crossing event for detecting the pedestrians whom crossing the zone suddenly. This second stage is performed, only if there is a presence of pedestrian is detected in the input video frames. So in this system, it processes only the video frames which contain the pedestrians.

This can be primarily attributed to two facts, namely that (a) publicly available 3D face databases are scarce as well as limited in terms of sample size and variability (e.g., few subjects, little diversity in race and gender), and (b) mesh convolutions for deep networks present several challenges that are not entirely tackled in the literature, leading to operator approximations and model instability, often failing to preserve high-frequency components of the distribution. As a result, linear methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been mainly utilized towards 3D shape analysis, despite being unable to capture non-linearities and high frequency details of the 3D face - such as eyelid and lip variations. In this work, we present 3DFaceGAN, the first GAN tailored towards modeling the distribution of 3D facial surfaces, while retaining the high frequency details of 3D face shapes.

This statistical method has yet to be applied to geological problems involving mineral chemistry. Random Forests provide a framework for classification and decision making through a series of classification trees, which individually, resemble classification keys.

To measure and collect the actual electrical power consumed by each device, we designed sensor circuits, each of which is deployed inside each power outlet. The measured data are sent to a centralized system via a wireless sensor network (which can also be used to deliver control commands to turn on/off each appliance). The system uses the data to classify a type of each appliance connected to each of the outlet. Since this research is to be detecting electrical usage at each outlet (instead of at the main circuit as in previous works), the system can be developed further to help identifying the abnormal operation of each appliance, and to automatically recognize the device when it is moved to another outlet, making possible automatic appliance on/off control. As a result, it could promote home safety and energy savings without affecting users' normal behaviors. Comparing the accuracies of classifying 40 electric devices using the four techniques, we found that 1) standard deviation of measured electricity usage is one of necessary attributes for accurately classifying appliance operating states, and 2) the decision tree algorithm (i.e., C4.5) performs best (with the error of 5.73%).", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2684793.2684802", "venue": "AINTEC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2096963063", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19526521"}

As is the case with data mining project, its workflow can be divided into business understanding, data gathering, analysis, modeling and interpretation and deployment. As of the time of the time of this writing the models have not yet been deployed. The necessity to conduct this master thesis arises from the growing popularity of heat pumps in the Netherlands, and the potential issues associated with this spread on management of low-voltage distribution grids, in particular the rising electricity demand in the heating season. Before such issues can be analyzed however, the number of all heat pump users needs to be determined. This master thesis aims in determining precisely the overall number of heat pumps users by examining individual load profiles. Data available for the purpose of thesis consists of load profiles of owners and non-owners of heat pumps provided by Alliander, load profiles of London-based non-owners of heat pumps, referred to as baseload profiles, load profiles of heat pumps only spread across the UK, temperature records for De Bilt in the Netherlands, London and Nottingham. The above-mentioned data was cleaned and manipulated before features were extracted from it. In particular, synthetic load profiles of heat pump owners were created by pairing baseload profiles with the pump only load profiles. Next all load profiles were normalized in order to diminish the importance of confounding variables, more on that later, and only night-hours were kept so as not to account for PV production. Such normalized load profiles were paired up in two sets: Alliander's set which consisted of load profiles of heat pump owners and non-owners provided by Alliander and simulated set which consisted of baseload profiles and synthetic load profiles of heat pump owners. It is worth mentioning that a confounding variable was present in Alliander's set, mainly the size of house since owners of heat pumps all lived in single standing houses as compared to non-owners, majority of whom lived in apartments. Subsequently, the following four features were extracted from normalized night-time load profiles within each two sets: (1) average daily electricity consumption in January and December (this period is also referred to as winter or heating period), (2) ratio of average daily electricity consumption in January and December to average daily electricity consumption in July and August (it is also referred to as summer or cooling period), (3) slope of the curve representing mean daily temperature on x-axis and daily electricity consumption in y-axis, and lastly (4) coefficient of determination of curve representing mean daily temperature on x-axis and daily electricity consumption in y-axis. Three main evaluation criteria were set for the performance of machine learning models: True Negative Rate, True Positive Rate and Precision. For simplicity, the mean score was used as well, which is equal to the average of True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate and Precision. Benchmark for all evaluation metrics was set to 90\\%. Five models that were used to distinguish heat pump owners from non-owners were Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines with Linear, Polynomial and Radial kernels. The evaluation procedure was the following: first hyperparameters for all the five models were tuned by using 10-fold cross validation with test and training set being features extracted from Alliander's set only. Next, the models with optimal hyperparameters were trained on features extracted from Alliander's set and tested on features from simulated set. The results show that none of the models managed to reach the benchmark of triple 90\\% for True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate and Precision. In the hyperparameter tuning stage both True Negative Rate and True Negative Rate were close to reaching 90\\%, however, this has been achieved at the cost of low Precision, reaching just above 50\\%. This was the case due to the propensity of the models to commit type I error, that is false positives. On the other hand, at the evaluation stage when the simulated set-features served as test set, it was noticed that precision was at a significantly higher level, approximately 75\\%, which came at a cost of lower True Positive Rate, around 50\\%. True Negative Rate though did exceed 90\\%. These results show a strong tendency of making type II error, that is false negatives. The best performing model, which was the Support Vector Machine with Radial Kernel, achieved a mean score of 75\\%. The divergence of results from the hyperparameter tuning stage to the evaluation stage is caused by the fact that there are different usage patterns of heat pumps between the owners of heat pumps in Alliander's load profiles and in the synthetic load profiles of heat pump owners. Particularly it is the case that owners of heat pumps in Alliander's set, do use heat pump in the night, as compared to synthetic users, which do so to a much smaller extent. As a result the features extracted from the simulated set of load profiles are less indicative of heat pump ownership than the features extracted from Alliander's load profiles. This master thesis could be improved by trying out more machine learning models, improving the process of normalization of load profiles and acquiring better heat pump only load profiles which are more similar to Alliander's set in terms of usage patterns among many others. Further work can be built upon the results of this thesis. Once heat pump owners have been identified based on load profiles, similar work can be done for identification based on voltage profiles. The advantage of using voltage profiles rather than load profiles is the fact that voltage profiles are not as privacy sensitive. Furthermore, providing more insight into the kind of heat pumps the users are utilizing (air-to-air or water source or geothermal) might provide further insight. Last but not least, the models developed in this master thesis could be deployed in Alliander and used to investigate heat pump ownership among entire dataset of 120k load profiles at the disposal of Alliander.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2958814678", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199134342"}

In this paper, we propose a novel graph learning based method for image annotation, which takes both advantages of the nearest neighbour based and the graph-based methods, by exploiting the graph learning method to propagate the labels on the graph corresponding to the K nearest neighbours of a test image. To acquire more effective graph weights for computing score for each label, besides the similarity of visual features, our method also considers the similarity of two label sets, which is computed based on the label correlation that captures the semantic information between two labels. In addition, we combine the image-to-label distance with the graph learning based score to compute the final decision value for labelling. The proposed method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets for image annotation.

EEG and cardiotocography (CTG) data were obtained from 10 parturient women during their first stage of labour. The study subjects reported the extent of their pain experienced due to uterine contractions, which were recorded by the CTG tracing. Simultaneous 16-channel EEG traces were obtained for spectral analysis and a subsequent machine learning classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) aiming to predict the pain experienced in relation to uterine contractions. It was found that pain due to uterine contraction correlated positively with relative delta and beta band activities and negatively with relative theta and alpha band activities of the EEG signals. SVM using the spectral activities, statistical and non-linear features of the EEG classified the state of pain with 83% accuracy using a classification model generalizable across subjects. Furthermore, dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) successfully reduced the number of features used in the classification while achieving a maximum classification accuracy of 84%. Continuous EEG affords the means to assess objectively maternal pain experienced during the active contraction phase of the first stage of labour.

Conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based target detection methods generally use high intensity pixels in the pre-screening stage while ignoring shadow information. Furthermore, they cannot accurately extract the target area and also have poor performance in cluttered environments. To solve this problem, a novel SAR target detection method which combines shadow proposal and saliency analysis is presented in this paper. The detection process is divided into shadow proposal, saliency detection and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) screening stages. In the shadow proposal stage, localizing targets is performed first with the detected shadow regions to generate proposal chips that may contain potential targets. Then saliency detection is conducted to extract salient regions of the proposal chips using local spatial autocorrelation and significance tests. Afterwards, in the last stage, the OC-SVM is employed to identify the real targets from the salient regions. Experimental results show that the proposed saliency detection method possesses higher detection accuracy than several state of the art methods on SAR images.

Multitask deep learning is one of the approach to improve age estimation by employing auxiliary tasks, such as gender recognition, that are related to the primary task. However, in traditional multitask learning for age estimation, the relationship between the primary and auxiliary tasks is difficult to describe; how the auxiliary tasks enhance the model for the primary objective is ambiguous. In this letter, we propose a conditional multitask learning method that architecturally factorizes an age variable into gender-conditioned age probabilities in a deep neural network. The lack of accurate training labels with discrete age values is another critical limitation to training age estimation models. Therefore, we propose a label expansion method that increases the number of accurate labels from weakly supervised categorical labels. To verify the generality of the proposed method, we perform intensive experiments on the publicly available MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

A number of standard learning methods belong to this family, such as Regularization Networks (RN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The thesis presents a theoretical justification of these machines within a unified framework based on the statistical learning theory of Vapnik. The generalization performance of RN and SVM is studied within this framework, and bounds on the generalization error of these machines are proved. In the second part, the thesis goes beyond standard one-layer learning machines, and probes into the problem of learning using hierarchical learning schemes. In particular it investigates the question: what happens when instead of training one machine using the available examples we train many of them, each in a different way, and then combine the machines? Two types of ensembles are defined: voting combinations and adaptive combinations. The statistical properties of these hierarchical learning schemes are investigated both theoretically and experimentally: bounds on their generalization performance are proved, and experiments characterizing their behavior are shown. Finally, the last part of the thesis discusses the problem of choosing data representations for learning. It is an experimental part that uses the particular problem of object detection in images as a framework to discuss a number of issues that arise when kernel machines are used in practice.

Recently, research has been actively conducted on transfer learning between different domains with various kinds of big data as the target. The fact that evaluation expressions often vary in different domains presents a barrier to reputation analysis. Users commonly use various linguistic expressions to refer to creative works, depending on the specific media form. For example, the terms or expressions used in anime to describe creative works within that medium are different from the expressions used in comics, or games or movies. These differences can be considered as features of each individual medium. We should expect, then, that there would be differences in evaluation expressions among the various media, as well. We analyze the effects of such differences on classification accuracy by conducting transfer learning between review data from different media and demonstrate compatibility between the original (pre-transfer) and target (post-transfer) media by constructing a review classification model.

Among all algorithms detecting overlapping communities, Speaker-listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SPLA) represents one of the state-of-the-art approaches due to its high accuracy. However, in the face of overlapping communities with instability and unbalanced partitions, the performance of SLPA drastically degrades. To fill such a gap, we propose a novel community detection algorithm based on density optimization. The proposed algorithm leverages Jaccard similarity coefficient to quantify the similarity between two nodes, and then propagate the label of a node to its neighboring node with the highest similarity. In this way, the initial community is obtained. Due to the existence of an oversized community in the initial community, we argue that a good community structure should have a higher density within the community than outside the community. Therefore, the initial community should be divided again. If the density of the new community is larger than that of the original community, the node's label information is updated; otherwise not. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on both artificial networks and real networks.

Here, in this paper, we propose a method that produces short term predictions for these two dangerous driving behaviors. The method feeds an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm with the most informative features of a set of physiological and vehicular variables. The XGB algorithm operates on a learning window covering the last 30 seconds to make fast track predictions (FT) for the next 10 seconds. For aggressive driving, FT predictions are final, while for distracted driving, FT predictions are weighted over one minute, to form a meta-prediction. This more deliberative process for predicting distractions fits their intermittent manifestation. The method has been tested on SIM 1, a publicly available dataset from a distracted driving experiment. In this dataset, the drivers ( $n=59$ ) are labeled as distracted based on the presence of mental activity or physical interactions antagonistic to the driving task; their driving style is defined by steering and acceleration, and is classified as aggressive or normal. The method attains classification performance that exceeds 87%. Alerting drivers when distractions and aggressiveness have taken hold on them can provide sobering awareness, given that people drift into these states subconsciously. The behavioral modification effects of such awareness mechanisms are rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Theory. The proposed method can also be used in future vehicles with advanced automation, weighing in the computer\u2019s decision to wrest vehicular control from an unrepentant driver.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TITS.2019.2910157", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2940710818", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["53007988", "142431208", "3974248", "4424570", "8316050", "1409560", "13089683", "31578841", "14114230", "108944060", "9199918", "17105064", "7788671", "14592123", "430596", "17082449", "15416758", "110761532", "17463653", "15688700", "60991363", "14166978", "933663", "2702042", "10511727", "699942", "14776737", "14258842", "3332288", "1915014", "23709080"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133611600"}

Traditional methods rely on ordered lists which require significant domain knowledge and are often difficult to use even for trained professionals. In this paper, we address the problem of large-scale tag-based font retrieval which aims to bring semantics to the font selection process and enable people without expert knowledge to use fonts effectively. We collect a large-scale font tagging dataset of high-quality professional fonts. The dataset contains nearly 20,000 fonts, 2,000 tags, and hundreds of thousands of font-tag relations. We propose a novel generative feature learning algorithm that leverages the unique characteristics of fonts. The key idea is that font images are synthetic and can therefore be controlled by the learning algorithm. We design an integrated rendering and learning process so that the visual feature from one image can be used to reconstruct another image with different text. The resulting feature captures important font design details while is robust to nuisance factors such as text. We propose a novel attention mechanism to re-weight the visual feature for joint visual-text modeling. We combine the feature and the attention mechanism in a novel recognition-retrieval model.

The collected images are filtered by wavelet denoising and processed with image binaryzation in order to eliminate the noise interference. Through the coordinate transformation, one-to-one correspondence relationship between the vehicles in image and the real ones is established. Then, the target vehicle is correctly positioned. Secondly, the processed images are partitioned into 8 \u00d78 grids. The ratio of the number of pixels meeting the requirements to the total pixels in each grid is served as the only decision condition for the output (0 or 1) of each grid.

In this paper, we show that it is possible to learn representations for graph similarity with neither domain knowledge nor supervision (i.e. feature engineering or labeled graphs). We propose Deep Divergence Graph Kernels, an unsupervised method for learning representations over graphs that encodes a relaxed notion of graph isomorphism. Our method consists of three parts. First, we learn an encoder for each anchor graph to capture its structure. Second, for each pair of graphs, we train a cross-graph attention network which uses the node representations of an anchor graph to reconstruct another graph. This approach, which we call isomorphism attention, captures how well the representations of one graph can encode another. We use the attention-augmented encoder's predictions to define a divergence score for each pair of graphs. Finally, we construct an embedding space for all graphs using these pair-wise divergence scores. Unlike previous work, much of which relies on 1) supervision, 2) domain specific knowledge (e.g. a reliance on Weisfeiler-Lehman kernels), and 3) known node alignment, our unsupervised method jointly learns node representations, graph representations, and an attention-based alignment between graphs. Our experimental results show that Deep Divergence Graph Kernels can learn an unsupervised alignment between graphs, and that the learned representations achieve competitive results when used as features on a number of challenging graph classification tasks.

As a result, there has been a critical need for automated approaches to effective and efficient utilization of massive amount of financial data to support companies and individuals in strategic planning and investment for decisionmaking. Many statistical and data mining techniques have been used to predict time series stock market. However, most statistical and data mining methods suffer from serious drawback due to requiring long training times, results are often hard to understand, and producing inaccurate predictions. We present another modification of fuzzy decision tree (FDT) classification techniques that aims to combine symbolic decision trees in data classification with approximate reasoning offered by fuzzy representation. The intent is to exploit complementary advantages of both: ability to learn from examples, high knowledge comprehensibility of decision trees, and the ability to deal with uncertain information of fuzzy representation. In particular, the proposed predictive fuzzy decision tree is based on the concept of degree of importance of attribute contributing to the classification. We extend this idea with the expressive power of fuzzy reasoning method. After constructing predictive FDT, weighted fuzzy production rules (WFPRs) can be extracted from predictive FDT. The predictive FDT has been tested using three data sets including KLSE, NYSE and LSE. The experimental results show that predictive FDT algorithm can generate a relatively optimal tree without much computation effort (comprehensibility), and WFPRs have a better predictive accuracy of stock market time series data. Many attempts have been made for meaningful prediction from real time stock market data by using data mining and statistical techniques such as Support Vector Machine [1,2], and Linear and Non- Linear Statistical Models [3,4], Neural Networks [5, 6]. Alan Fan et aI., [2] use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to stock market prediction. The SVM is a training algorithm for learning classification and regression rules from data [7]. However the predictive accuracy of SVM achieved by [2] in stock market is relatively lower than other classification applications [8, 9]. Also the existing relationship between the future stock returns and its accounting information, one would expect it to be a weak relationship. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is the extended form of SVM that can be applied in financial time series prediction [8, 9]. In financial data, due to the embedded noise, one must set a suitable margin in order to obtain a good prediction [9].

However, dealing with the huge amount of information provided by PET imaging is still a challenge. In this work we present a novel methodology to analyze PET data that improves the automatic differentiation between controls and AD patients. First the images are divided into small regions or parcels, defined either anatomically, geometrically or randomly. Secondly, the accuray of each single region is estimated using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and a cross-validation approach. Finally, all the regions are assessed together using multiple kernel SVM with a kernel per region. The classifier is built so that the most discriminative regions have more weight in the final decision.

We proposed model for automatic segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions from brain MRI data. These techniques use a supervised classifier that is trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) to discriminate between the blocks in regions of MS lesions and the blocks in non-MS lesion regions mainly based on the textural features with aid of the other features. The main contribution of this set of frameworks is the use of textural features to detect MS lesions in a fully automated approach that does not rely on manually delineating the MS lesions. As a result, the sensitivity for detection of MS lesions was 81.5% with 2.9 false positives per slice based on a leave-one-candidate-out test, and the similarity index between MS regions determined by the proposed method and neuroradiologists.

Designers of a number of humanoid robots attempted to mimic the foveated structure of the human eye. Foveation is useful because, firstly, it enables the robot to monitor and explore its surroundings in images of low resolution, thereby increasing the efficiency of the search process, and secondly, it makes it possible to simultaneously extract additional information \u2013 once the area of interest is determined \u2013 from higher resolution foveal images that contain more detail. There are several visual tasks that can benefit from foveated vision. One of the most prominent among them is object recognition. General object recognition on a humanoid robot is difficult because it requires the robot to detect objects in dynamic environments and to control the eye gaze to get the objects into the fovea and to keep them there. Once these tasks are accomplished, the robot can determine the identity of the object by processing foveal views. Approaches proposed to mimic the foveated structure of biological vision systems include the use of two cameras per eye (Atkeson et al., 2000; Breazeal et al., 2001; Kozima & Yano, 2001; Scassellati, 1998) (Cog, DB, Infanoid, Kismet, respectively), i. e. a narrow-angle foveal camera and a wide-angle camera for peripheral vision; lenses with space-variant resolution (Rougeaux & Kuniyoshi, 1998) (humanoid head ESCHeR), i. e. a very high definition area in the fovea and a coarse resolution in the periphery; and space-variant log-polar sensors with retina-like distribution of photo-receptors (Sandini &Metta, 2003) (Babybot). It is also possible to implement log-polar sensors by transforming standard images into log-polar ones (Engel et al., 1994), but this approach requires the use of high definition cameras to get the benefit of varying resolution. Systems with zoom lenses have some of the advantages of foveated vision, but cannot simultaneously acquire wide angle and high resolution images. Our work follows the first approach (see Fig. 1) and explores the advantage of foveated vision for object recognition over standard approaches, which use equal resolution across the visual field. While log-polar sensors are a closer match to biology, we note that using two cameras per eye can be advantageous because cameras with standard chips can be utilized. This makes it possible to equip a humanoid robot with miniature cameras (lipstick size and 1", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/9307", "venue": "Robot Vision", "journal": "Robot Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1516923435", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3044410", "3772616", "1425004", "1199113", "1373751", "194951", "78356", "10151608", "46942066", "9067338", "45421467", "17989470", "804200", "43759520", "3117288", "158677", "53930662", "1375403", "12023466", "7383841", "37246513", "4331213", "888065", "564746", "26127529", "61196484", "3823473", "3770671", "45569013", "7346847", "28189911"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53793837"}

Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. The worst case complexity of solving an SDP problem involving a matrix variable of size D\u00d7D with O (D) linear constraints is about O(D6.5) using interior-point methods, where D is the dimension of the input data. Thus, the interior-point methods only practically solve problems exhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Because the number of variables is D (D+1)/2, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can practically be solved around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the popular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of problem to which metric learning can be applied. Here, we propose a significantly more efficient and scalable approach to the metric learning problem based on the Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much simpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric learning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is roughly O (D3), which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach. Experiments on a variety of data sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy comparable with the state of the art, but is applicable to significantly larger problems.

In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an intensity and wavelength division multiplexing (IWDM) FBG sensor system using a Raman amplifier and extreme learning machine (ELM). We use an IWDM technique to increase the number of FBG sensors. As the number of FBG sensors increases and the spectra of two or more FBGs are overlapped, a conventional peak detection (CPD) method is unappropriate to detect the central Bragg wavelength of each FBG sensor. To solve this problem, we use ELM techniques. An ELM is used to accurately detect the central Bragg wavelength of each FBG sensor even when the spectra of FBGs are partially or fully overlapped. Moreover, a Raman amplifier is added to a fiber span to generate a gain medium within the transmission fiber, which amplifies the signal and compensates for the signal losses. The transmission distance and the sensing signal quality increase when the Raman pump power increases. The experimental results revealed that a Raman amplifier compensates for the signal losses and provides a stable sensing output even beyond a 45 km transmission distance. We achieve a remote sensing of strain measurement using a 45 km single-mode fiber (SMF).

Based on these, a distribution and structure match auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (DSM-ACGAN) is constructed for high-quality discriminative feature learning. Particularly, the characteristics of statistical distribution and spatial structure are jointly considered in class adversarial training of DSM-ACGAN. On the one hand, DSM-ACGAN sets the true SAR image characteristics as goals for the generator to learn generative models of each category. On the other hand, and more importantly, it guides the discriminator to simultaneously capture the desired statistical and structural features. Through the class adversarial processing, the discriminative feature learning progressively improves and contributes to classification. Additionally, class-balanced and plausible samples can be generated. Experimental results on three broad SAR images from different satellites confirm the effectiveness of class adversarial training and the superiority of discriminative feature learning in DSM-ACGAN.

In order to study how these abstractions are formed and because of the highly recurrent connectivity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) we model part of it using recurrent neural networks. Particularly, we use the Reservoir Computing paradigm to model PFC and part of the basal ganglia: a recurrent neural network with random connections kept constant models the prefrontal cortex, and a read-out layer (i.e. output layer) models the striatum. ::: This model was trained to perform language syntactic processing; in particular, thematic role assignment: for a given sentence this corresponds to answer the question \"Who did what to whom?\". Inspiring from language acquisition theories (Tomasello 2003), the model processes categories (i.e. abstractions) of sentences which are called \"grammatical constructions\" (Goldberg 1995). After training, it is able to (1) process correctly the majority of the grammatical constructions that were not learned, demonstrating generalization capabilities, and (2) to make online predictions (of thematic roles) while processing a grammatical construction. Moreover, we observed that when the model processes less frequent constructions an important shift in output predictions occurs. It is proposed that a significant modification of predictions in a short period of time is responsible for generating Evoked-Related Potentials (ERP) such as the P600 which typically occurs when unusual sentences structures are processed (Hinaut & Dominey 2013). ::: Subsequently, to show the ability of the model to deal with a real-world application, the model was successfully applied in the framework of human-robot interaction for both sentence comprehension and production (Hinaut et al, 2014). Recently, we showed that the very same instance of reservoir could learn both English and French sentences at the same time, suggesting that a common \"output\" (striatal) representations could be used even in the case of different languages (Hinaut et al, 2015). Moreover, the model is able to learn small corpora in fifteen European or Asian languages with different word order (Hinaut et al, in revision).

In this paper, a novel approach based on the recently developed machine learning technique - twin support vector machines (TWSVM) to detect MCs in mammograms. The ground truth of MCs in mammograms is assumed to be known as a priori. First each MCs is preprocessed by using a simple artifact removal filter and a high-pass filter. Then the combined image feature extractors are employed to extract 164 image features. In the combined feature domain, the MCs detection procedure is formulated as a supervised learning and classification problem, and the trained TWSVM is used as a classifier to make decision for the presence of MCs or not. A large number of experiments were carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed MCs detection algorithm.

Classification process gives a summary of data investigation which may be utilized to develop models or structures, telling different classes or predict future data trends for improved understanding of the data at maximum. In this survey, various data mining classification techniques and some important data mining tools along with their advantages and disadvantages are presented. Data classification techniques are classified into three categories namely, Eager learners, Lazy learners, and other Classification techniques. Decision tree, Bayesian classification, Rule based classification, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Association rule mining and backpropagation (Neural Networks) are eager learners. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification and Case Based Reasoning (CRT) are lazy learners. Other classification techniques include genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and Rough Set Approach.

Instead of directly consuming feature-label pairs, the classifier is trained by a teacher, i.e., a high-capacity model whose training may be resource-hungry. The accuracy of the classifier trained this way is usually suboptimal because it is difficult to learn the true data distribution from the teacher. An alternative method is to adversarially train the classifier against a discriminator in a two-player game akin to generative adversarial networks (GAN), which can ensure the classifier to learn the true data distribution at the equilibrium of this game. However, it may take excessively long time for such a two-player game to reach equilibrium due to high-variance gradient updates. To address these limitations, we propose a three-player game named KDGAN consisting of a classifier, a teacher, and a discriminator. The classifier and the teacher learn from each other via distillation losses and are adversarially trained against the discriminator via adversarial losses. By simultaneously optimizing the distillation and adversarial losses, the classifier will learn the true data distribution at the equilibrium. We approximate the discrete distribution learned by the classifier (or the teacher) with a concrete distribution. From the concrete distribution, we generate continuous samples to obtain low-variance gradient updates, which speed up the training.

The recording of ocular nystagmus during vestibular tests does not quantify the true response of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). So, to extract the real VOR, our study is focused on nystagmus analysis with videonystagmography (VNG) technique based on measuring amplitude and frequency vibration of eyeball movement. In this paper, we have proposed a fully automatic system based on nystagmus parameter analysis using a pupil detection algorithm and a machine learning approach for VD recognition. Firstly, an estimation of the pupil movement vectors using Hough Transform (HT) is employed to approximate the location of pupil region. Then, temporal and frequency features are computed from the rotation angle variation of the pupil motion. Finally, pertinent features are selected using a statistical criterion for discrimination and classification of the VD disease. Experimental results are employed using two categories which are normal and pathological cases. By discriminating the reduced features with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique, 94% of classification accuracy results are achieved.

Use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach to model depth, width and length of scour hole indicates that performance of ANN models is far better than existing empirical models. At present, use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and M5 Pruned Model Tree are being considered in different disciplines to further improve upon the performance of ANN models as a potential alternate. With this in view, the present study deals with the development of regression models for computing various parameters of scour hole using SVMs and M5 Model Tree. A comparative evaluation of the performance of ANN versus SVMs and M5 Model Tree clearly shows that SVMs and M5 Model Tree can prove more useful than ANN models in estimation of scour downstream of a ski jump bucket. Further, M5 model tree offers explicit expressions for use by design engineers.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11269-011-9801-6", "venue": null, "journal": "Water Resources Management", "mag_id": "2063081170", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["130510663", "214167868", "109194287", "199133625", "14612275", "134676596", "153587336", "62282480", "208172074", "107637690", "134850089", "109342017", "11045361", "134068195", "113558197", "40772047", "154011104", "153964316"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110683428"}

It turns out that alternative forms of confidence matrices are possible, and indeed useful. By focusing on the confidence matrix instead of the underlying kernel, we can derive an intuitive principle for optimizing example weights to yield robust classifiers. Our principle initially recovers the standard quadratic SVM training criterion, which is only convex for kernel-derived confidence measures. However, given our generalized view, we are then able to derive a principled relaxation of the SVM criterion that yields a convex upper bound. This relaxation is always convex and can be solved with a linear program.

By automatically pointing out where mispronunciations occur in an utterance, a language learner can receive informative and to-the-point feedbacks. In this paper, we improve mispronunciation detection performance with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained acoustic model and transfer learning based Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers. The acoustic model trained by the conventional GMM-HMM based approach is refined by the DNN training with enhanced discrimination. The corresponding Goodness Of Pronunciation (GOP) scores are revised to evaluate pronunciation quality of non-native language learners robustly. A Neural Network (NN) based, Logistic Regression (LR) classifier, where a general neural network with shared hidden layers for extracting useful speech features is pre-trained firstly with pooled, training data in the sense of transfer learning, and then phone-dependent, 2-class logistic regression classifiers are trained as phone specific output layer nodes, is proposed to mispronunciation detection. The new LR classifier streamlines training multiple individual classifiers separately by learning the common feature representation via the shared hidden layer. Experimental results on an isolated English word corpus recorded by non-native (L2) English learners show that the proposed GOP measure can improve the performance of GOP based mispronunciation detection approach, i.e., 7.4 % of the precision and recall rate are both improved, compared with the conventional GOP estimated from GMM-HMM.

However, usually we cannot guarantee the stability of the ELM because the parameters of the ELM are generated randomly, such as its biases of the hidden layer and the connecting weights between the input layer and the hidden layer. Besides, it is hard for a single model to achieve high predicted accuracy on the dataset with low-quality data. In this paper, we first propose a modified residual ELM (R-ELM) to improve the ELM\u2019s learning performance. In R-ELM, the first ELM is trained by the original dataset and the $m$ -th ( $m > 1$ ) ELM will be trained by the residuals between the ground truths and the predicted results of the previous ensemble model (with $m-1$ ELMs). R-ELM (with $m$ ELMs) is built in the direction of the error reduction by calculating the $m$ -th ELM\u2019s optimal weight which is determined by the loss function of the R-ELM. As a result, R-ELM can remember almost all information of the training set. However, this ability does not assure a similar performance on the testing dataset. In view of this problem, we add ${L_{2}}$ regularization to the loss function of the R-ELM (RR-ELM) to avoid the overfitting problem of R-ELM. In RR-ELM, ${L_{2}}$ regularization is employed to encourage each ELM to ignore the unnecessary information of the training set. In order to verify the effectiveness of the two proposed algorithms, the real data from the blast furnace are engaged to perform the experiments. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed RR-ELM and the R-ELM are more stable than the single ELM.

It is an eye disease that can be screened easily by health practitioners. However, most of the previously mentioned workers are rarely aware of the pterygium existence. Hence, health practitioners usually visit them to perform basic health checkup that includes eye disease screening. Due to many tests that need to be performed for each checkup cycle, a modern tool is required to make the screening process faster. As a result, this paper discusses a compact convolutional neural networks (CNN) approach to pterygium classification using transfer learning. Its architecture consists of only two layers of CNN and two layers of fully connected (FC) components. Rectified linear unit is used as the activation function except for the last FC layer, which utilizes Softmax function. The weights and biases are transferred from the first two layers of VGG-M architecture. Three regularization methods were experimented that include local response normalization, batch normalization and dropout.

The rate of data growth is very alarming, and it is already going beyond the Exabyte limit. Hence, there is an obvious need for fast and accurate big data classification tools. Machine Learning (ML) based solutions are very useful and reliable data classification tools, however, they cannot effectively handle large-scale datasets. This paper therefore proposes two intelligent instance selection techniques for optimizing the training and classification speed of ML algorithms, with a specific focus on Support Vector Machine (SVM). Furthermore, this paper considers two different approaches to instance selection namely: filter-based and wrapper-based. Different sets of experiments are performed on 20 small-scale datasets and 10 large- or medium-scale datasets. The results show that the proposed techniques improved SVM training speed in 100% (30 out of 30) of the datasets used for evaluation and simultaneously improved SVM predictive accuracy in some cases. Furthermore, statistical analysis test is carried out and the results reveal that the training speed of the proposed techniques is statistically significantly faster than the training speed of standard SVM and some other existing instance selection techniques. In real life application, such as video surveillance and intrusion detection systems, that require a classifier to be trained quickly for speedy classification of new target concepts, the filter-based techniques provide the best solutions; while the wrapper-based techniques are better suited for applications such as email filters, that are very sensitive to slight changes in predictive accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949238", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981832203", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14530050", "7490486", "2439726", "12824352", "14209741", "15138100", "15754259", "7957767", "1779074", "31598060", "16802118", "52874011", "12838921", "18909423", "6674796", "14152802", "17572540", "14671406", "16334375", "14414560", "31961169", "31156175", "45203670", "14457838", "2398045", "114696920", "34063156", "18840965", "15792117", "11998102", "31421897", "8021636", "15999431", "53183731", "59849738", "961425", "82569210", "2443126", "13899309", "76203", "111074844"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207831635"}

However, it is seldom applied to the analysis of patient comments, especially in China.

Given that most of currently developed BCIs only provide a visual feedback to the user, the aim of this study was to observe the result provided by an auditory feedback based on pitch. The BCI developed to this end classifies two different commands using sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) frequency features. The experiment consisted in sessions of trials during which the subjects were asked to perform motor imagery or to rest. Except for the first session, the system provided the subjects with a realtime feedback based on the learning data of the previous sessions. This feedback was generated by a control signal resulting of the classification of the extracted features by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm. Half of the 16 subjects were given visual feedback, consisting in a cursor movement, and the other half received auditory feedback, consisting in a pitch variation. Although the performance of the visual feedback BCI was superior during the first sessions, the final third session classification rates were 69.7 and 70.3% for respectively visual and auditory conditioning.

Remote sensing techniques provide efficient and cost-effective approach to monitor the expansion of built-up area, in comparison to other traditional approaches. For extracting built-up class, one of the common approaches is to use spectral and spatial features such as, Normalized Difference Built- up index (NDBI), GLCM texture, Gabor filters etc. However, it is observed that classes such as river soil and fallow land usually mix up with built-up class due to their close spectral similarity. Intermixing of classes have been observed in the classified image when using spectral channels. In this paper, an approach has been proposed which uses urban based spectral indices and textural features to extract built-up areas. Three well known spectral indices i.e. NDBI, Built-up Area Extraction Index (BAEI) and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBai) have been used in this work. Along with spectral indices, local spatial dependency of neighborhood regions is captured using eight GLCM based textural feature, such as, Contrast, Correlation, Energy and Homogeneity etc. for each image band. All textural and spectral indices bands are combined and used for extracting built-up areas using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Results suggest 4.91% increase in overall accuracy when using texture and spectral indices in comparison with 84.38% overall accuracy achieved when using spectral data only. It is observed that built-up class are more separable in the projected spectral-spatial feature space in comparison to spectral channels.

There is an important gap between theory and practice; real patterns do not perfectly respect the theoretical rules. Moreover, chart patterns definition seems subjective; it depends on the financial expert. Finally, there is no large labeled datasets of chart patterns. We study classification and detection of chart patterns using statistical markovian systems. We focus on generative (Hidden Markov Models) and discriminative (Conditional Random Fields, Hidden CRFs) approaches which are standard technologies for sequential data recognition. We propose various strategies to learn accurate systems with small training sets. The first one blends HMMs and HCRFs in such a way that the modeling ability of the generative models is used to limit the overfitting of the discriminative ones. The second strategy, is a semi-supervised approach which learns jointly a HMM and a HCRF systems; it has some similarity with the well-known co-training algorithm. To design an accurate detection system dedicated to a particular financial expert, we propose a two level system where candidate patterns are first extracted from the financial stock-market using HMMs, and then they are confirmed as chart patterns or rejected by a SVM which uses an enriched representation of patterns.

In this study pSVM RF reduces training and testing time for SVM, while boosting segmentation performance. Unlike the eMRF approach, where MR intensity information and location priors are linearly combined, pSVMRF combines this information in a nonlinear fashion, and enhances the discriminative ability of the algorithm. We validate the proposed method using MR imaging of unstained and actively stained mouse brain specimens, and compare segmentation accuracy with two existing methods: eMRF and MRF. C57BL/6 mice are used for training and testing, using cross validation. For formalin fixed C57BL/6 specimens, pSVMRF outperforms both eMRF and MRF . The segmentation accuracy for C57BL/6 brains, stained or not, was similar for larger structures like hippocampus and caudate putamen, (~ 87%), but increased substantially for smaller regions like susbtantia nigra (from 78.36% to 91.55%), and anterior commissure (from ~ 50% to ~ 80%). To test segmentation robustness against increased anatomical variability we add two strains, BXD29 and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

To do this, we developed a modeled vegetation IBI (MVIBI) based on metrics previously used to develop vegetation indices of biological integrity (VIBIs) for Ohio wetlands (e.g. % invasive grass, % sensitive species, shrub richness). We selected 82 emergent, forested, and shrub-dominated reference sites distributed across the State of Ohio and built Random Forest models to predict plant metric scores at reference wetlands from naturally occurring environmental features related to climate, hydrology, geology, soils, and landscape position. The models explained between 14 and 52% of the variance in the scores of 21 metrics indicating that variation in wetland plant assemblages was significantly associated with naturally occurring environmental gradients. We used principal component analysis to identify ten groups of statistically independent metrics and selected one metric from each group that discriminated most strongly between reference and most degraded sites based on t-scores. Two axes did not contain discriminating metrics so we used eight metrics in the MVIBI. Analysis of variance of reference site MVIBI scores indicated that we could use one distribution of reference site scores to assess multiple wetland types, thus eliminating the need to separately designate wetland types. We used the MVIBI to assess 170 test sites and compared the accuracy, precision, responsiveness, and sensitivity of the MVIBI to those of the original VIBIs. The MVIBI was up to twice as accurate and precise as the original VIBIs, indicating that modeling can be used to improve the performance of vegetation-based IBIs.

In this paper, we propose a latent elastic-net transfer learning (LET) method by simultaneously learning a latent subspace and a discriminative subspace. Specifically, the data from different domains can be well interlaced in the latent subspace by minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Since the latent subspace decouples inputs and outputs and, thus a more compact data representation is obtained for discriminative subspace learning. Based on the latent subspace, we further propose a low-rank constraint based matrix elastic-net regression to learn another subspace in which the intrinsic intra-class structure correlations of data from different domains is well captured. In doing so, a better discriminative alignment is guaranteed and thus LET finally learns another discriminative subspace for classification.

Online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) is an excellent online learning algorithm, and some improved OSELM algorithms incorporating forgetting mechanism have been developed to model and predict the time-varying system. But the existing algorithms suffer from a potential risk of instability due to the intrinsic ill-posed problem; besides, the adaptive tracking ability of these algorithms for complex time-varying system is still very weak. In order to overcome the above two problems, this paper proposes a novel OSELM algorithm with generalized regularization and adaptive forgetting factor (AFGR-OSELM). In the AFGR-OSELM, a new generalized regularization approach is employed to replace the traditional exponential forgetting regularization to make the algorithm have a constant regularization effect; consequently the potential ill-posed problem of the algorithm can be completely avoided and a persistent stability can be guaranteed. Moreover, the AFGR-OSELM adopts an adaptive scheme to adjust the forgetting factor dynamically and automatically in the online learning process so as to better track the dynamic changes of the time-varying system and reduce the adverse effects of the outdated data in time; thus it tends to provide desirable prediction results in time-varying environment. Detailed performance comparisons of AFGR-OSELM with other representative algorithms are carried out using artificial and real world data sets.

Recent studies reveal that deep neural networks can learn transferable features that generalize well to similar novel tasks. However, as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network, feature transferability drops significantly in higher task-specific layers with increasing domain discrepancy. To formally reduce the effects of this discrepancy and enhance feature transferability in task-specific layers, we develop a novel framework for deep adaptation networks that extends deep convolutional neural networks to domain adaptation problems. The framework embeds the deep features of all task-specific layers into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) and optimally matches different domain distributions. The deep features are made more transferable by exploiting low-density separation of target-unlabeled data in very deep architectures, while the domain discrepancy is further reduced via the use of multiple kernel learning that enhances the statistical power of kernel embedding matching. The overall framework is cast in a minimax game setting.

As a strategy to identify undiagnosed patients, we sought to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model to identify ATTRwt patients using medical claims data. Methods We developed an ML model for the identification of ATTRwt using ICD codes from US medical claims data sourced from IQVIA (n =\u223c300 million patients, up to 10 years of medical history). An ATTRwt cohort was derived using an ICD code for ATTRwt and compared to a random sample of HF patients matched by age, gender, and medical histories [cohort 1a (ATTRwt): N=373, cohort 1b (HF): N=373]. The classification model employed the Random Forest algorithm to learn from data from 80% of the patients (training set) and tested the learnings on the remaining 20% of patients (test set). Model validation was performed by predicting ATTRwt in 3 additional cohorts: ATTRwt and non-ATTRwt HF patients in electronic medical record (EMR) data [cohort 2a (ATTRwt): N=100, cohort 2b (HF): N=100], cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and HF patients in medical claims data [cohort 3a (CA): N=4,485, cohort 3b (HF): N=4,485, and CA and HF patients in EMR data [cohort 4a (CA): N=1,789, cohort 4b (HF): N=1,789]. EMR data was sourced from Optum (n= 88 million US patients, up to 10 years of medical history). The CA cohort comprised patients with organ-specific amyloidosis and HF diagnoses. Results The model delivered robust performance in correctly predicting ATTRwt and HF patients with sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of 94/94/91%, AUC 0.97 (derivation cohort 1, test set). External validation was also successful: cohort 2, 96/95/88%; cohort 3, 64/72/77%; and cohort 4, 75/76/80%.

However, it is very challenging in practice because the pancreas, the small, soft and flexible abdominal organ, has very high anatomical variability which leads existing studies to suffer from an unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a new automated pancreas segmentation framework: Recurrent Adversarial Learning based on Generative Adversarial Network (Pancreas-GAN) to tackle this challenge. Pancreas-GAN consists of three novel modules: 1) a dilated convolutions auto-encoder module (DCAE) not only explicitly maintains global resolution of CT images but also enlarges the receptive field of filters to effectively incorporate larger context without increasing the computation complexity; 2) a local long short-term memory module (Local-LSTM) can capture the contextual segmentation correlation across neighboring image patches for boosting precise boundary segmentation; and 3) an adversarial module can constrain the spatial smoothness consistency among successive image slices based on the global distribution constraints, which further boosts the performance of Pancreas-GAN. Extensive experiments are conducted on the CT scans of 80 patients using 4-fold cross-validation and have demonstrated that Pancreas-GAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 88.72% \u00b13.23 and the pixel-wise accuracy of 95.34%\u00b13.05.

The challenge for the electronics industry is that product qualification testing is time-consuming and costly. This paper focuses on the development and demonstration of a novel approach for smarter qualification using test data from the production line along with integrated computational techniques for data mining/analytics and data-driven forecasting (i.e. prognostics) modelling. The most common type of testing in the electronics industry\u2014sequentially run electrical multi-parameter tests on the Device-under-Test (DUT), is considered. The proposed data mining (DM) framework can identify the tests that have strong correlation to pending failure of the device in the qualification (tests sensitive to pending failure) as well as to evaluate the similarity in test measurements, thus generating knowledge on potentially redundant tests. Mining the data in this context and with the proposed approach represents a major new contribution because it uncovers embedded knowledge and information in the production test data that can enable intelligent optimisation of the tests\u2019 sequence and reduce the number of tests. The intelligent manufacturing concept behind the development of data-driven prognostics models using machine learning techniques is to use data only from a small number of tests from the full qualification specification as training data in the process of model construction. This model can then forecast the overall qualification outcome for a DUT\u2014Pass or Fail\u2014without performing all other remaining tests. The novelty in the context of machine learning is in the selection of the data features for the training dataset using results from tests sensitive to pending failure. Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary classifiers SVM models built with data from tests sensitive to the outcome that the module will fail are shown to have superior performance compared with models trained with other datasets of tests. Case studies based on the use of real industrial production test data for an electronic module are included in the paper to demonstrate and validate the computational approach. This work is both novel and original because at present, to the best knowledge of the authors, such predictive analytics methodology applied to qualification testing and providing benefits of test time and hence cost reduction are non-existent in the electronics industry. The integrated data analytics-prognostics approach, deployable for both off-line and in-line optimisation of production test procedures, has the potential to transform current practices by exploiting in a smarter way information and knowledge available with large datasets of qualification test data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10845-018-01462-9", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2908845134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7853630", "20047533", "109668711", "1340025", "17403085", "14727192", "15730183", "115194299", "3519247", "6990687", "17363143", "43742109", "2353846", "116417763", "10125147", "7138354", "63147208", "38501368", "13012327", "207171152"], "inbound_citations": ["210994732"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:83459347"}

To maintain an acceptable level of performance, the classifier has to be re-trained offline in batch mode using both existing and new data. The process of re-training can be computationally expensive and time consuming. This paper presents a new biometric classifier update algorithm that incrementally re-trains the classifier using online learning and progressively establishes a decision hyperplane for improved classification. The proposed algorithm incorporates soft labels and granular computing in the formulation of a 2@n-Online Granular Soft Support Vector Machine (SVM) to re-train the classifier using only the new data. Granular computing makes it adaptive to local and global variations in data distribution, while soft labels provide resilience to noise. Each time data is acquired, new support vectors that are linearly independent are added and existing support vectors that do not improve the classifier performance are removed. This constrains the size of the support vectors and significantly reduces the training time without compromising the classification accuracy. The efficacy of the proposed online learning strategy is validated in a near infrared face verification application involving different covariates. The results obtained on a heterogeneous near infrared face database of 328 subjects show that in all experiments using different feature extraction and classification algorithms the proposed online 2@n-Granular Soft Support Vector Machine learning approach is 2-3 times faster while achieving a high level of accuracy similar to offline training using all data.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.imavis.2010.01.009", "venue": "Image Vis.

Therefore, numerous studies aim to identify reliable risk markers for development of impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular basis of impaired glucose metabolism is so far insufficiently understood. The development of so called 'omics' approaches in the recent years promises to identify molecular markers and to further understand the molecular basis of impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes. Although univariate statistical approaches are often applied, we demonstrate here that the application of multivariate statistical approaches is highly recommended to fully capture the complexity of data gained using high-throughput methods. We took blood plasma samples from 172 subjects who participated in the prospective Metabolic Syndrome Berlin Potsdam follow-up study (MESY-BEPO Follow-up). We analysed these samples using Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and measured 286 metabolites. Furthermore, fasting glucose levels were measured using standard methods at baseline, and after an average of six years. We did correlation analysis and built linear regression models as well as Random Forest regression models to identify metabolites that predict the development of fasting glucose in our cohort. We found a metabolic pattern consisting of nine metabolites that predicted fasting glucose development with an accuracy of 0.47 in tenfold cross-validation using Random Forest regression. We also showed that adding established risk markers did not improve the model accuracy. However, external validation is eventually desirable. Although not all metabolites belonging to the final pattern are identified yet, the pattern directs attention to amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and redox homeostasis. We demonstrate that metabolites identified using a high-throughput method (GC-MS) perform well in predicting the development of fasting plasma glucose over several years. Notably, not single, but a complex pattern of metabolites propels the prediction and therefore reflects the complexity of the underlying molecular mechanisms. This result could only be captured by application of multivariate statistical approaches. Therefore, we highly recommend the usage of statistical methods that seize the complexity of the information given by high-throughput methods.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3298809", "pubmed_id": "22300499", "doi": "10.1186/2043-9113-2-3", "venue": "Journal of Clinical Bioinformatics", "journal": "Journal of Clinical Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2123872633", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19278639", "20422080", "22626019", "40804166", "17576876", "4834792", "806233", "8525020", "215517786", "2992287", "83756230", "14095502", "21221637", "3093707", "3705703", "57395634", "21911891", "5956609", "9318261", "12625256", "24572042", "26298109", "25207146", "35404071", "2667982", "31018371", "20331973", "38924740", "27624997", "32600025", "38772478", "18627608", "19765896", "10986878", "17211514", "29241791", "43704009", "7172616", "31763930", "22594906", "11091824", "7286279", "24810541", "4434037", "20530080", "25820680", "29213673", "33981546", "41150526", "33669609", "5407063", "45663144", "20477638", "19631283", "43110002", "41689193", "13600252", "968187"], "inbound_citations": ["196182372", "3954833", "29980305", "11624166"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6513445"}

To acquire a full volumetric model, one typically needs either multiple views, or a single view together with a library of unambiguous 3D models that will fit the shape of each individual object in the scene. In this thesis, we present alternative methods for inferring the hidden geometry of table-top scenes. We first introduce two depth-image datasets consisting of multiple scenes, each with a ground truth voxel occupancy grid. We then introduce three methods for predicting voxel occupancy. The first predicts the occupancy of each voxel using a novel feature vector which measures the relationship between the query voxel and surfaces in the scene observed by the depth camera. We use a Random Forest to map each voxel of unknown state to a prediction of occupancy. We observed that predicting the occupancy of each voxel independently can lead to noisy solutions. We hypothesize that objects of dissimilar semantic classes often share similar 3D shape components, enabling a limited dataset to model the shape of a wide range of objects, and hence estimate their hidden geometry. Demonstrating this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm that can make structured completions of unobserved geometry. Finally, we propose an alternative framework for understanding the 3D geometry of scenes using the observation that individual objects can appear in multiple different scenes, but in different configurations. We introduce a supervised method to find regions corresponding to the same object across different scenes. We demonstrate that it is possible to then use these groupings of partially observed objects to reconstruct missing geometry.

In this study we propose two classification algorithms for discriminating ADHD children from normal children using their resting state Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. One algorithm is based on the univariate features extracted from individual EEG recording channels and the other is based on the multivariate features extracted from brain lobes. We focused on entropy measures as non-linear univariate and multivariate features. Average power, Theta/Beta Ratio (TBR), Shannon Entropy (ShanEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), Dispersion Entropy (DispEn) and Multiscale SampEn (MSE) were extracted as linear and non-linear univariate features. Besides, multivariate SampEn (mvSE) and multivariate MSE (mvMSE) were extracted as non-linear multivariate features. Classification was followed by three classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Complexity analysis of multi-channel EEG data was performed using mvMSE approach. Entropy mapping as a useful tool was used to visually track changes of entropies in various brain regions.

Background: Reliably detecting ON/OFF states is important for monitoring PD treatment and progression. Currently, subjective patient diaries capture this information. We investigate if detection of motor signs of ON/OFF states can be achieved by using kinematic measurements from wearable sensor technology combined with a machine learning (ML) pipeline. Design/Methods: Twenty-five PD subjects (19 males, 69\u00b17 years) taking levodopa performed 10-meter Instrumented Stand and Walk (ISAW) tests in their ON and OFF states while wearing Ambulatory Parkinson Disease Monitoring (APDM) sensors on their sternum, wrists, lumbar and lower extremities. A neurologist scored each ISAW according to the MDS-UPDRS-III. We analyzed 98 kinematic features for significance to neurologist total motor score and ON/OFF using both statistical (repeated-measures ANOVA, step-wise mixed-model regression, likelihood-ratio test, ridge regression) and ML methods. Results: Twenty-two features significantly differed between patient reported ON/OFF states, with the most significant being trunk transverse range-of-motion (RofM), arm RofM, mid-swing elevation, stride length, turn velocity, steps in turn and toe out angles. Estimates from regression model showed average difference of 14 points between OFF/ON states in total UPDRS score and 9 points when adjusted for 5 significant features for individual baseline (mean trunk transverse RofM, right arm RofM, and toe out angle having highest effect; coeff. \u22128.67, \u22125.25, \u22123.36 respectively). Several approaches were employed for predicting ON/OFF states based on these features: direct binary classification (acc=0.56), regression to total UPDRS score (acc=0.76), regression to PIGD sub-score (acc=0.64), and classification of ON-OFF/OFF-ON transitions using feature differences (Naive Bayes: acc=0.74, AUC=0.78; Random Forest: acc=0.76, AUC=0.90). Conclusions: Wearable sensor technology holds promise for detecting ON/OFF states in PD patients using an augmented ML approach. This could be particularly useful for monitoring response to therapy in an outpatient setting.

We present two variations of the model in terms of a priori information of task relatedness.

Second, a Bayesian graphical LASSO prior is used on the task precision matrix to impose sparsity in the task relatedness. Motivated by machine learning applications in the biomedical domain, we emphasize interpretability and uncertainty quantification in our models. To encourage model interpretability, linear mappings from the shared input spaces to task-dependent output spaces are used. To encourage uncertainty quantification, conjugate priors are used so that full posterior inference is possible. Using synthetic data, we show that our model is able to recover the underlying task relationships as well as features jointly relevant for all tasks.

However, classification errors often occur in distinguishing passenger cars from small trucks and in distinguishing medium-sized trucks from small trucks. It is mainly attributed to the fact that they are similar in lengths and have similar inter-axle distances. To improve the performance in vehicle classification, we develop a new algorithm using a fuzzy logic. Vehicle weight and speed are used as the inputs to the fuzzy logic block. The output of the fuzzy logic block is a weighting factor to modify the calculated vehicle length.

Self-regularization constrains the orthogonal basis vectors to be similar to the approximated nearest point. The nonnegativity constraint ensures that each nearest point is approximated from a positive linear combination of the set samples. Both constraints are formulated as a single convex optimization problem and the accelerated proximal gradient method with linear-time Euclidean projection is adapted to efficiently find the optimal nearest points between two image sets. Using the nearest points between a query set and all the gallery sets as well as the active samples used to approximate them, we learn a more discriminative Mahalanobis distance for robust face recognition.

Several machine learning techniques have been developed to build network intrusion detection systems for correctly detecting unforeseen cyber-attacks at the network-level. For example, deep artificial neural network architectures have recently achieved state-of-the-art results. In this paper a novel deep neural network architecture is defined, in order to learn flexible and effective intrusion detection models, by combining an unsupervised stage for multi-channel feature learning with a supervised one exploiting feature dependencies on cross channels. The aim is to investigate whether class-specific features of the network flows could be learned and added to the original ones in order to increase the model accuracy. In particular, in the unsupervised stage, two autoencoders are separately learned on normal and attack flows, respectively. As the top layer in the decoder of these autoencoders reconstructs samples in the same space as the input one, they could be used to define two new feature vectors allowing the representation of each network flow as a multi-channel sample. In the supervised stage, a multi-channel parametric convolution is adopted, in order to learn the effect of each channel on the others. In particular, as the samples belong to two different distributions (normal and attack flows), the samples labelled as normal should be more similar to the representation reconstructed with the normal autoencoder than that of the attack one, and viceversa. This expected dependency will be exploited to better disentangle the differences between normal and attack flows.

Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forests (RFT) algorithms produced classified land cover maps which had higher overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients than the Minimum Distance (MD) algorithm. Object-based classification and using a combination of radar- and optic-based imagery are some ways in which oil palm detection can be improved within GEE. Despite its limitations, GEE does have the potential to be developed further into an accessible and low-cost tool for independent bodies to detect and monitor the expansion of oil palm plantations in the tropics.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rsase.2016.11.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2553266079", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["2768395", "205485935", "120565892", "3989202", "15970960", "23541992", "7601908", "55330501", "120276358", "52570996", "62883674", "25156340", "129432055", "140597708"], "inbound_citations": ["53618855", "36569920", "198356687", "51965473", "204856943", "198182641", "204810757", "181608605", "85450368", "134072642", "211547705", "211227775", "182920081", "24744336"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111383739"}

However, the influence of detailed land use dynamics on SOC remains an active research field. We investigated the impact of long-term grass-/cropland conversion dynamics on SOC for the Swiss agroecosystem (8\u2035500 km2). In Switzerland multi-temporal SOC observations are sparse, while the spatio-temporal resolution of available land use data is inadequate to capture small structured and dynamic land use. Thus, we stratified one-time SOC observations of two periods (n1995\u20131999 = 1096; n2011\u20132015 = 502) into typical land use classes of grass-/cropland conversion regimes to analyze states and trends of SOC. First, based on spectral imagery and auxiliary variables, we established a Random Forest classifier to detect annual grass-/cropland distributions in a spatial resolution of 30 \u00d7 30 m for 2000\u20132015. Second, we used the annual land use maps to derive classes of typical land use dynamics based on a pattern description of conversion regimes. Third, we comparatively assessed the SOC covariate importance (IMP) and SOC sample representation of land use dynamics using terrain and climate covariates. Subsequently, we statistically analyzed SOC across land use dynamics and two periods. The land use classifier shows an Overall Accuracy of 86%, while the annual land use maps deviate by 6%\u201311% from census data. 46% of the farmland underlies frequent grass-/cropland conversions. The SOC covariate importance of land use dynamics is increased by at least 2.4 times compared to the SOC covariates. The SOC observations consistently represent land use dynamics across SOC covariates. In both periods, SOC increased as the grassland share within the land use regimes increased. The mean SOC for permanent grasslands is 35 g kg\u22121 and 17 g kg\u22121 for permanent croplands. Areas of land use conversions where grassland is dominant show increased SOC (29\u201330 g kg\u22121) compared to areas where cropland was dominant (23\u201325 g kg\u22121).

More specifically, in order to determine the relative importance of spectra, texture, vegetation index and seasonality on classification accuracy, we design a series of classification feature sets, including: initial feature sets for different seasons, feature selection feature sets for different seasons and multi-seasonal feature sets.

Mostly current works have demonstrated the benefits of knowledge graph embedding in single knowledge graph completion, such as relation extraction. The most significant distinction between multiple knowledge graphs embedding and single knowledge graph embedding is that the former must consider the alignments between multiple knowledge graphs which is very helpful to some applications built on multiple KGs, such as KB-QA and KG integration. In this paper, we proposed a new automatic representation learning model over Multiple Knowledge Graphs (MGTransE) by adopting a bootstrapping method. More specifically, MGTransE consists of three core components: Structure Model, Semantically Smooth Embedding Model and Iterative Smoothness Model. The experiment results on two real-world datasets show that our method achieves better performance on two new multiple KGs tasks compared with state-of-the-art KG embedding models and also preserves the key properties of knowledge graph embedding on traditional single KG tasks as compared to those methods learned from single KG.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.08.070", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2890711249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["164329739"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52977944"}

To address this issue, we propose a novel method to detect violence sequences. Firstly, the motion regions are segmented according to the distribution of optical flow fields. Secondly, in the motion regions, we propose to extract two kinds of low-level features to represent the appearance and dynamics for violent behaviors. The proposed low-level features are the Local Histogram of Oriented Gradient (LHOG) descriptor extracted from RGB images and the Local Histogram of Optical Flow (LHOF) descriptor extracted from optical flow images. Thirdly, the extracted features are coded using Bag of Words (BoW) model to eliminate redundant information and a specific-length vector is obtained for each video clip.

ABSA usually explores supervised inductive learning algorithms, which requires intense human effort for the labeling process. In this paper, we investigate Cross-Domain Transfer Learning approaches, in which aspects already labeled in some domains can be used to support the aspect extraction of another domain where there are no labeled aspects. Existing cross-domain transfer learning approaches learn classifiers from labeled aspects in the source domain and then apply these classifiers in the target domain, i.e., two separate stages that may cause inconsistency due to different feature spaces. To overcome this drawback, we present an innovative approach called CD-ALPHN (Cross-Domain Aspect Label Propagation through Heterogeneous Networks). First, we propose a heterogeneous network-based representation that combines different features (labeled aspects, unlabeled aspects, and linguistic features) from source and target domain as nodes in a single network. Second, we propose a label propagation algorithm for aspect extraction from heterogeneous networks, where the linguistic features are used as a bridge for this propagation. Our algorithm is based on a transductive learning process, where we explore both labeled and unlabeled aspects during the label propagation.

The computational method for the classification of protease cleavage sites is significantly important in the inhibitors and drug design techniques. Matrix metalloproteases (MMP) are one such protease that has a crucial role in the disease process. However, the challenge in the computational prediction of MMPs substrate cleavage persists due to the availability of very few experimentally verified sites. The objective of this paper is to explore the cross-domain learning in the classification of protease substrate cleavage sites, such that the lack of availability of one-domain cleavage sites can be furnished by the other available domain knowledge.

The robustness and acceptability of the TrAdaBoost algorithms in the substrate site identification have been validated by rigorous experiments.

The proposed method is employed through Co-training (type of semi-supervised learning approach) technique by incorporating the discriminative power of widely used classifiers namely Random Forrest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). We used Reddit API to download posts and top five associated comments for construction of a feature space. Results: The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of Co-training based classification rather than the state of the art classifiers by a margin of 3% on average in par with every state of art technique. In future, the proposed method could be employed to investigate any classification problem of any domain by extracting date from the social media.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953087", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2985169259", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3812024", "73426701", "140320849", "515696", "18498622", "16504570", "1690595", "96824", "63156868", "13684595", "15946343", "44096125", "52078741", "169614446", "59336080", "27600741", "32848229", "52162919", "202641601"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208207061"}

Nowadays, these documents are mainly available in the form of unstructured free texts, which require heavy processing for their registration into organized databases. This organization is instrumental for information retrieval, enabling to answer the advanced queries of researchers and practitioners in biology, medicine, and related fields. Hence, the massive data flow calls for efficient automatic methods of text-mining that extract high-level information, such as biomedical events, from biomedical text. The usual computational tools of Natural Language Processing cannot be readily applied to extract these biomedical events, due to the peculiarities of the domain. Indeed, biomedical documents contain highly domain-specific jargon and syntax. These documents also describe distinctive dependencies, making text-mining in molecular biology a specific discipline.ResultsWe address biomedical event extraction as the classification of pairs of text entities into the classes corresponding to event types. The candidate pairs of text entities are recursively provided to a multiclass classifier relying on Support Vector Machines. This recursive process extracts events involving other events as arguments. Compared to joint models based on Markov Random Fields, our model simplifies inference and hence requires shorter training and prediction times along with lower memory capacity.

However, the exact responses of carbon cycle processes to climatic drivers often remain uncertain. Presently, knowledge derived from experiments complemented with a steadily evolving body of mechanistic theory provides the main basis for developing the respective models. The strongly increasing availability of measurements may complicate the traditional hypothesis driven path to developing mechanistic models, but it may facilitate new ways of identifying suitable model structures using machine learning as well. Here we explore the potential to derive model formulations automatically from data based on gene expression programming (GEP). GEP automatically (re)combines various mathematical operators to model formulations that are further evolved, eventually identifying the most suitable structures. In contrast to most other machine learning regression techniques, the GEP approach generates models that allow for prediction and possibly for interpretation. Our study is based on two cases: artificially generated data and real observations. Simulations based on artificial data show that GEP is successful in identifying prescribed functions with the prediction capacity of the models comparable to four state-of-the-art machine learning methods (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, and Kernel Ridge Regressions). The case of real observations explores different components of terrestrial respiration at an oak forest in south-east England. We find that GEP retrieved models are often better in prediction than established respiration models. Furthermore, the structure of the GEP models offers new insights to driver selection and interactions.

That significantly deteriorates the effectiveness of the existing data-driven approaches. This paper proposes a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method to address the imbalanced data problem by explicitly creating additional training data. Generative adversarial networks are firstly used to learn the mapping between the distributions of noise and real machinery temporal vibration data, and additional realistic fake samples can be generated to balance and further expand the available dataset afterwards. Through experiments on two rotating machinery datasets, it is validated that the data-driven methods can significantly benefit from the data augmentation, and the proposed method offers a promising tool on fault diagnosis with imbalanced training data.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107377", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2995758361", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214449644"}

It is thus crucial to assess the driver\u2019s affective state while driving, in particular his state of stress which impacts the decision making and thus driving task performance. In this thesis, we focus on the study of stress level changes, during real-world driving, experienced in city versus highway areas. Classical methods are based on features selected by experts, applied to physiological signals. These signals are preprocessed using specific tools for each signal, then ad-hoc features are extracted and finally a data fusion for stress-level recognition is performed. In this work, we adapted a functional variable selection method, based on Random Forests Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE). In fact, the biosignals considered as functional variables, are first decomposed using wavelet basis. The RF-RFE algorithms are then used to select groups of wavelets coefficients, corresponding to the functional variables, according to an endurance score. The final choice of the selected variables relies on this proposed score that allows to quantify the ability of a variable to be selected and this, in first ranges. At a first stage, we analyzed physiological signals such as: Heart Rate (HR), Electromyogram (EMG), Breathing Rate (BR), and the Electrodermal Activity (EDA), related to 10 driving experiments, extracted from the open database of MIT: drivedb, carried out in Boston area. At a second stage, we have designed and conducted similar city and highway driving experiments in the greater Tunis area. The resulting database, AffectiveROAD, includes, as in drivedb, biosignals as HR, BR and EDA and additional measurement of the driver posture. The developed prototype of the sensors network platform allowed also to gather data characterizing the vehicle internal environment (temperature, humidity, pressure, sound level, and geographical coordinates) which are included in AffectiveROAD database. A subjective stress metric, based on driver video-based validation of the observer\u2019s annotation, is included in AffectiveROAD database. We define here the term stress as the human affective state, including affect arousal, attention, mental workload, and the driver\u2019s perception of the environment complexity. The functional variable selection, applied to drivedb, revealed that the EDA captured on foot followed by the BR, are relevant in the driver\u2019s stress level classification. The RF-RFE method along with non-expert based features offered comparable performances to those obtained by the classical method. When analyzing the AffectiveROAD data, the posture and the EDA captured on the driver\u2019s right wrist emerged as the most enduring variables. For both databases, the placement of the EDA sensor came out as an important consideration in the stress level assessment. A deeper analysis of the EDA was carried out since its emergence as a key indicator in stress level recognition, for the two databases. This is consistent with various human physiology studies reporting that the EDA is a key indicator of emotions. For that, we investigated the fractal properties of this biosignal using a self-similarity analysis of EDA measurements based on Hurst exponent (H) estimated using wavelet-based method. Such study shows that EDA recordings exhibits self-similar behavior for large scales, for the both databases.

So, ELM is integrated with DEFS to overcome the difficulties of selecting the weights. Feature subset selection plays the most important role to classify the river-ice types. First-and second-order statistical texture features are extracted from real river-ice images.

In Mahalanobis distance metric learning, distance matrix M is in symmetric positive semi-definite cone, and in order to avoid overfitting and to learn a better Mahalanobis distance from weakly supervised constraints, the low-rank regularization has been often imposed on matrix M to learn the correlations between features and samples. As the approximations of the rank minimization function, the trace norm and Fantope have been utilized to regularize the metric learning objectives and achieve good performance. However, these low-rank regularization models are either not tight enough to approximate rank minimization or time-consuming to tune an optimal rank. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric learning model using the capped trace norm based regularization, which uses a singular value threshold to constraint the metric matrix M as low-rank explicitly such that the rank of matrix M is stable when the large singular values vary. The capped trace norm regularization can also be viewed as the adaptive Fantope regularization. We minimize singular values which are less than threshold value and the rank of M is not necessary to be k, thus our method is more stable and applicable in practice when we do not know the optimal rank of matrix M. We derive an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the proposed new model and the algorithm convergence proof is also provided in this paper.

While several successful methods have been suggested for this task, some integrating large and diverse datasets, these methods have so far been applied to reconstruct a single response network at a time, even when studying and modeling related conditions. To improve network reconstruction we developed MT-SDREM, a multi-task learning method which jointly models networks for several related conditions. In MT-SDREM, parameters are jointly constrained across the networks while still allowing for condition-specific pathways and regulation. We formulate the multi-task learning problem and discuss methods for optimizing the joint target function. We applied MT-SDREM to reconstruct dynamic human response networks for three flu strains: H1N1, H5N1 and H3N2. Our multi-task learning method was able to identify known and novel factors and genes, improving upon prior methods that model each condition independently. The MT-SDREM networks were also better at identifying proteins whose removal affects viral load indicating that joint learning can still lead to accurate, condition-specific, networks.

Therefore, automatic document classification is needed to help human to classify the documents. Text classification is one of the common tasks in text mining problems.

Because there are so many words in a corpus, we need to be selective which features that are significant to the labels. Feature selection has been introduced to improve the classification task. Moreover, it could be used to reduce the high dimensionality feature space. Feature selection becomes one of the most familiar solutions to high dimensionality problem of document classification. In text classification, selection of good features plays an important role. Feature selection is an approach that can be used to increase model classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

These rules can later be applied to create values for attributes of information items. As learned rules might not be completely correct or might miss values for attributes of objects, we propose a rule relaxation algorithm while applying the learned rules. For this purpose we represent rules by lattices of their variables. As we show, this structure can be easily used to identify reasonable generalizations of an original rule.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "LWA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2138095065", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5303928", "114411523"], "inbound_citations": ["16866074", "14596480", "17510761"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78017"}

The classification accuracy for coniferous and deciduous trees just using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is only around 90% in case the geometric information of the point cloud is used. As deep neural networks (DNNs) have the ability to adaptively learn features from the underlying data, they have outperformed classic machine learning (ML) approaches on well-known benchmark datasets provided by the robotics, computer vision and remote sensing community. Though, tree species classification using deep learning (DL) procedures has been of minor research interest so far. Some studies have been conducted based on an extensive prior generation of images or voxels from the 3D raw data. Since innovative DNNs directly operate on irregular and unordered 3D point clouds on a large scale, the objective of this study is to exemplarily use PointNet++ for the semantic labeling of ALS point clouds to map deciduous and coniferous trees. The dataset for our experiments consists of ALS data from the Bavarian Forest National Park (366 trees/ha), only including spruces (coniferous) and beeches (deciduous). First, the training data were generated automatically using a classic feature-based Random Forest (RF) approach classifying coniferous trees (precision = 93%, recall = 80%) and deciduous trees (precision = 82%, recall = 92%). Second, PointNet++ was trained and subsequently evaluated using 80 randomly chosen test batches a 400 m2. The achieved per-point classification results after 163 training epochs for coniferous trees (precision = 90%, recall = 79%) and deciduous trees (precision = 81%, recall = 91%) are fairly high considering that only the geometry was included. Nevertheless, the classification results using PointNet++ are slightly lower than those of the baseline method using a RF classifier. Errors in the training data and occurring edge effects limited a better performance. Our first results demonstrate that the architecture of the 3D DNN PointNet++ can successfully be adapted to the semantic labeling of large ALS point clouds to map deciduous and coniferous trees. Future work will focus on the integration of additional features like i.e. the laser intensity, the surface normals and multispectral features into the DNN. Thus, a further improvement of the accuracy of the proposed approach is to be expected.

This paper treats such multi-steps ahead regression task as a sequence labeling (regression) problem, and adopts a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CCRF) strategy. This discriminative approach intuitively integrates two layers: the first layer aims at the prior knowledge for the multiple outputs, and the second layer employs edge potential features to implicitly model the interplays of the n interconnected outputs. Consequently, the proposed CCRF makes predictions not only basing on observed features, but also considering the estimated values of related outputs, thus improving the overall predictive accuracy. In particular, we boost the CCRF's predictive performance with a multi-target function as its edge feature. These functions convert the relationship of related outputs with continuous values into a set of \"sub-relationships\", each providing more specific feature constraints for the interplays of the related outputs. We applied the proposed approach to two real-world energy load prediction systems: one for electricity demand and another for gas usage.

Malware variants are growing exponentially by more usage of computer in industries, homes, and other places. Among different types of malware samples, zero-day samples are more challenging. The conventional antivirus systems, which rely on known malware patterns, cannot detect zero-day samples since did not see them before. As reported in [1], in 2018, 76% of successful attacks on organization endpoints were based on zero-day samples. Therefore, predicting these types of attacks and preparing a solution is an open challenge.This paper presents a deep generative adversarial network to generate the signature of unseen malware samples; The generated signature is potentially similar to the malware samples that may be released in the future. After generating the samples, these generated data were added to the dataset to train a robust classifier against new variants of malware. Also, neural network is applied for extracting high-level features from raw bytes for detection. In the proposed method, only the header of the executable file was used for detection, which is a small piece of the file that contains some information about the file. To validate our method, we used three classification algorithms and classified the raw and new representation using them. Also, we compared our work with another malware detection using the PE header.

The main objective of the work is to propose a technique for identifying the language of Hindi-English code-mixed data used in three social media platforms namely, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. The classification of Hindi-English code-mixed data into Hindi, English, Named Entity, Acronym, Universal, Mixed (Hindi along with English)and Undefined tags were performed. Popular word embedding features were used for the representation of each word. Two kinds of embedding features were considered - word-based embedding features and character-based context features. The proposed method was done with the addition of context information along with the embedding features.

It is argued that this inhibitory reversal implements an emergency breaking mechanism - once the evidence for a response is removed (as accrues from mask presentation) the corresponding motor action is suppressed. These results prompt consideration of the computational mechanism that underlies such an inhibitory reversal. Our proposal is that the effect arises from the interplay of response competition (as implemented by lateral inhibition) and a threshold gated direct suppression of strongly activated response nodes.

This study aimed to improve our understanding of the role, magnitude, and spatial distribution of the key environmental and socioeconomic factors driving vegetation change in a southern African savanna. This research was conducted across the Kwando, Okavango and Zambezi catchments of southern Africa (Angola, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia) and explored vegetation cover change across the region from 2001\u20132010. A novel coupled analysis was applied to model the dynamic biophysical factors then to determine the discrete / social drivers of spatial heterogeneity on vegetation. Previous research applied Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA), a multivariate times series dimension reduction technique, to ten years of monthly remotely sensed vegetation data (MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), and a suite of time-series (monthly) environmental covariates: precipitation, mean, minimum and maximum air temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, fire and potential evapotranspiration. This initial research was performed at a regional scale to develop meso-scale models explaining mean regional NDVI patterns. The regional DFA predictions were compared to the fine-scale MODIS time series using Kendall\u2019s Tau and Sen\u2019s Slope to identify pixels where the DFA model we had developed, under or over predicted NDVI. Once identified, a Random Forest (RF) analysis using a series of static social and physical variables was applied to explain these remaining areas of under- and over- prediction to fully explore the drivers of heterogeneity in this savanna system. The RF analysis revealed the importance of protected areas, elevation, soil type, locations of higher population, roads, and settlements, in explaining fine scale differences in vegetation biomass. While the previously applied DFA generated a model of environmental variables driving NDVI, the RF work developed here highlighted human influences dominating that signal. The combined DFRFA model approach explains almost 90% of the variance in NDVI across this landscape from 2001\u20132010. Our methodology presents a unique coupling of dynamic and static factor analyses, yielding novel insights into savanna heterogeneity, and providing a tool of great potential for researchers and managers alike.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6294365", "pubmed_id": "30550542", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0208400", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2905266882", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35528251", "33327092", "85278856", "51826532", "196715236", "4344778", "84731799", "17192930", "37815456", "4427223", "56379510", "129198382", "128619277", "121832520", "129529135", "14207977", "85126298", "128665159", "3417078", "89141", "60993494", "3093707", "85862276", "123476171", "120565892"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54633089"}

Therefore, this research intends to develop a part-of- speech tagger model for twitter speech. using CRF toolkit. The system was developed for nearly 1000 twitter conversations employing Conditional Random Field stochastic model. The data for twitter speech was downloaded from the internet. A POS-tagged text corpus, template file and CoNLL file for both training and testing database were prepared accordingly. The training was carried out for both the unigram model as well as the bigram model. The performance of the system over these models was obtained through this examination which showed a significant efficiency, calculated from the number of correctly tagged words and the total number of words.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/SCSE.2019.8842669", "venue": "2019 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE)", "journal": "2019 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2953258405", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18646822", "277918", "12861120", "417913", "9966171", "14113765"], "inbound_citations": ["213184747"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196184248"}

Smooth Support Vector Machine (SSVM) is one of new formulation to improve the SVM. In SSVM, smoothing method is used to optimize the unconstrained model. Smoothing function can be used to replace plus function in SVM. In this paper we evaluate eight smoothing functions including quadratic polynomial, fourth order polynomial, piecewise polynomial, spline function, sixth order polynomial, advanced fourth order polynomial function, quadratic Bezier function, third order Bezier function, and fourth order Bezier function. Some of those functions have been studied previously in order to find better accuracy in SVM. In this research, we evaluate and analyze the performance of all those eight smoothing functions based on their infinity-norm values. We compare the error approximation between smoothing function and plus function (as the standard kernel function in SVM) where the best smoothing function has the minimum error of its infinity-norm. Based on theoretical analysis and numerical approximation, our results show that piecewise polynomial function is better than quadratic polynomial function, fourth polynomial function, and third order spline function. While the advanced fourth order polynomial function and sixth order polynomial function have error approximation value almost the same as that of plus function. However, since the piecewise polynomial function has less control parameters than those of the advanced fourth order polynomial function and the sixth order polynomial function, we could not conclude which one is the best. Furthermore, based on values of infinity-norm of all the smoothing functions, we found that the quadratic Bezier and quadratic polynomial show the same error values. Meanwhile the forth order Bezier function shows the smallest error approximation value among the other functions which have been tested.

At canopy level, \u03c1 can be affected by a variety of factors, including leaf constituents, canopy structure, background reflectivity, and sun-sensor geometry. Consequently, VIs are mixtures of different information. In this study, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is made for several commonly used satellite-derived VIs in order to better understand the application of these VIs at large scales.

Specifically, combined factors such as canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and canopy water content (CWC) are introduced in the RF-based GSA. We find that for most VIs, the leaf area index is the most influential factor, while the broad-band sensor-derived enhanced VI (EVI) exhibits a strong sensitivity to CCC, and the universal normalized VI (UNVI) is sensitive to CWC. The potential and uncertainty for the application of all the considered VIs are analyzed according to the GSA results.

The inverse kinematics problem is addressed, for the control of the gaze fixation point of two cameras mounted on the robotic head. The proposed approach is based on a biologically-inspired model, which replicates the human brain capability of creating associations between motor and sensory data, by learning. The model is implemented here by self organizing neural maps. During learning, the system creates relations between the motor data associated to endogenous movements performed by the robotic head and the sensory consequences of such motor actions, i.e. the final position of the gaze fixation point. The learnt relations are stored in the neural map structure and are then used, after learning, for generating motor commands aimed at reaching a given fixation point. The approach proposed here allows to solve the inverse kinematics and joint redundancy problems for the ARTS robotic head, with good accuracy and robustness. Experimental trials confirmed the system capability to control the gaze direction and fixation point and also to manage the redundancy of the robotic head in reaching the target fixation point even with additional constraints, such as a clamped joint or two symmetric joint angles (e.g. eye joints).", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570466", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2110147950", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9276113", "9276113", "198120309", "46002066", "197325", "9299532", "15433082", "207610285", "72100639", "57932072", "61644839", "7317620", "123120074"], "inbound_citations": ["4834108", "26622083", "57573664", "6637468", "22774789", "17839073", "586365", "17577961"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:426806"}

In this paper new results are presented which show that within a Bayesian framework not only grammars, but also logic programs are learnable with arbitrarily low expected error from positive examples only. In addition, we show that the upper bound for expected error of a learner which maximises the Bayes' posterior probability when learning from positive examples is within a small additive term of one which does the same from a mixture of positive and negative examples.

Whereas, SVM is far improved. SVM has the capability to select its own support vectors. In case of Back Propagation algorithm, we should know in advance the value of the output and once we receive a value after passing through the neurons, the two values are compared and if there is no match found, backtracking is done as a result of which weights are varied to obtain the exact value. The computational complexity is going to be very great. It proves to be a useful tool when the data is not regular or when the distribution is unknown. SVM gains its flexibility from the kernel which in turn makes it successful. This can provide a unique solution whereas neural networks have multiple solutions for each minima so it does not seem to be robust for different samples.

The proposed method was implemented and evaluated using the abnormal eye images from our own database and normal eye images collected from UBIRIS.v1 database. Our database contains the eye images with different grades of corneal arcus abnormality. The performance of our method was evaluated using the confusion matrix-based metrics.

The collected information is used to enhance the effectiveness of websites. Some major tasks are used in the information collection process, which is identification of a session and frequent itemset generation. In order to identify dynamic web log Sessions, an Online Incremental Learning (OIL) method is used and it is named as (DS-OILSD), because of its automatic selection of threshold based on standard deviation. DS-OILSD provides better results for session identification when compared to timeout methods. Once the web log session identification is done, searching for frequent patterns helps to optimize the web site structure and enhances the performance of web servers. If a web log session has many frequent itemset, then the time for generating association rules is much longer than the time for mining frequent itemset. The challenging task lies in the selection of min support and min confidence value. These problems are reduced by Enhanced Fuzzy Apriori Algorithm (EFAA) which is a combination of itemset generation and Rule Pruning technique. The proposed EFAA method comprise three major steps: (1) Generating frequent itemset from web log session, (2) Pruning itemset and (3) Generating association rules from itemset. Fuzzy Intersection Pruning (FIP) is proposed to prune frequent itemset. In FIP, intersection operation is performed between two frequent itemset. Fuzzy Automated Support (FAS) count value is used to get the optimal minimum support and generates frequent itemset. This Fuzzy Automated Support Confidence Pruning (FASCP) technique arranges the rules in ascending order with support and confidence thresholds. FASCP technique assumes that all rules having high support and confidence values will have quality information. The experimental results shows that, the EFAA method is effective for frequent itemset generation when compared to apriori and modified apriori algorithm in terms of precision, recall, accuracy and time.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCCI.2017.8117723", "venue": "2017 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)", "journal": "2017 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2770689535", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61710119", "64082540", "921552", "10999823", "668000", "62561878", "45660920", "2880491", "37933959", "37933959", "21192", "12266290", "335645", "14475940", "62438023", "35167672", "5108675", "14301161", "15177775", "53448961", "6555412", "2723420"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41285581"}

The diversity and heterogeneity of coastal, estuarine and stream habitats has led to them becoming a prevalent topic for study. Woody ruins are areas of potential riverbed habitat, particularly for fish. Therefore, the mapping of those areas is of interest. However, due to the limited visibility in some river systems, satellites, airborne or other camera-based systems (passive systems) cannot be used. By contrast, sidescan sonar is a popular underwater acoustic imaging system that is capable of providing high- resolution monochromatic images of the seafloor and riverbeds. Although the study of sidescan sonar imaging using supervised classification has become a prominent research subject, the use of composite texture features in machine learning classification is still limited. This study describes an investigation of the use of texture analysis and feature extraction on side-scan sonar imagery in two supervised machine learning classifications: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT). A combination of first- order texture and second-order texture is investigated to obtain the most appropriate texture features for the image classification. SVM, using linear and Gaussian kernels along with Decision Tree classifiers, was examined using selected texture features. The results of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient revealed that SVM using a linear kernel leads to a more promising result, with 77% overall accuracy and 0.62 kappa, than SVM using either a Gaussian kernel or Decision Tree (60% and 73% overall accuracy, and 0.39 and 0.59 kappa, respectively).

Over-exploitation of the groundwater substantially depletes the natural water table and has negative impacts on the water resource availability. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to identify the historical evolution of irrigated cropland for the post-monsoon (rabi) and summer cropping seasons in the Berambadi watershed (Area = 89 km2) of Kabini River basin, southern India. Approximately five-year interval irrigated area maps were generated using 30 m spatial resolution Landsat satellite images for the period from 1990 to 2016. The potential of Support Vector Machine (SVM) was assessed to discriminate irrigated and non-irrigated croplands. Three indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), were derived from multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. Spatially distributed intensive ground observations were collected for training and validation of the SVM models. The irrigated and non-irrigated croplands were estimated with high classification accuracy (kappa coefficient greater than 0.9). At the watershed scale, this approach allowed highlighting the contrasted evolution of multiple-cropping (two successive crops in rabi and summer seasons that often imply dual irrigation) with a steady increase in the upstream and a recent decrease in the downstream of the watershed. Moreover, the multiple-cropping was found to be much more frequent in the valleys. These intensive practices were found to have significant impacts on the water resources, with a drastic decline in the water table level (more than 50 m). It also impacted the ecosystem: Groundwater level decline was more pronounced in the valleys and the rivers are no more fed by the base flow.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs10060893", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2805112544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["17128984", "21753884", "128567102", "129086336", "128680932", "129004357", "55807210", "16235939", "17231898", "131146453", "6180475", "19177121", "46319917", "21734696", "55391118", "140702418", "37827237", "10442373", "42041873", "55025358", "51903355", "28286464", "241743", "12504153", "205657085", "49531176", "5050024", "17505525", "42304956", "2357415", "129803791", "10659969", "157358297", "22519235", "120556509", "119702334", "55398787", "9702055", "34406701", "158003733", "204767558", "53067088", "128421495", "126223502", "25746435", "8639419", "53341649", "8664139", "124173630", "154337425"], "inbound_citations": ["150180823", "208033752", "211539387", "59319569"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51965258"}

The objects are usually ill-posed, occluded, and cluttered with poor lighting, focus, and exposure. Traditional image retrieval approaches face many obstacles such as semantic description of images, robust semantic object segmentation, small sampling problem, semantic gaps between low-level features and high-level semantics, etc. ::: ::: To manage the high diversity of images in a broad domain, we propose a structured learning framework to systematically design domain-relevant visual semantics, known as semantic support regions, to support index and query in a content-based image retrieval system. Semantic support regions are segmentation-free image regions that exhibit semantic meanings and that can be learned statistically to span a new indexing space. They are detected from image content, reconciled across multiple resolutions, and aggregated spatially to form local semantic histograms. The resulting compact and abstract representation can support both similarity-based query and compositional visual query efficiently. The query by spatial icons (QBSI) formulation is a unique visual query language to explicitly specify visual icons and spatial extents in a Boolean expression. ::: ::: For empirical evaluation, we perform the learning and indexing processes of 26 semantic support regions over 2400 heterogeneous consumer photos from a single family using Support Vector Machines.

Current clinical diagnostic criteria are based on electrophysiological examination and exclusion of other ALS-mimicking conditions. Neuroprotective treatments are, however, most promising in early disease stages. Identification of disease-specific CSF biomarkers and associated biochemical pathways is therefore most relevant to monitor disease progression, response to neuroprotective agents and to enable early inclusion of patients into clinical trials. ::: ::: ::: METHODS AND FINDINGS ::: CSF from 35 patients with ALS diagnosed according to the revised El Escorial criteria and 23 age-matched controls was processed using paramagnetic bead chromatography for protein isolation and subsequently analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. CSF protein profiles were integrated into a Random Forest model constructed from 153 mass peaks. After reducing this peak set to the top 25%, a classifier was built which enabled prediction of ALS with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Further analysis of the identified peptides resulted in a panel of five highly sensitive ALS biomarkers. Upregulation of secreted phosphoprotein 1 in ALS-CSF samples was confirmed by univariate analysis of ELISA and mass spectrometry data. Further quantitative validation of the five biomarkers was achieved in an 80-plex Multiple Reaction Monitoring mass spectrometry assay. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: ALS classification based on the CSF biomarker panel proposed in this study could become a valuable predictive tool for early clinical risk stratification. Of the numerous CSF proteins identified, many have putative roles in ALS-related metabolic processes, particularly in chromogranin-mediated secretion signaling pathways. While a stand-alone clinical application of this classifier will only be possible after further validation and a multicenter trial, it could be readily used to complement current ALS diagnostics and might also provide new insights into the pathomechanisms of this disease in the future.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3435306", "pubmed_id": "22970211", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0044401", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2035016723", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["16899984", "1177022", "22725949", "25234611", "6529513", "14054780", "1229364", "24832006", "25192414", "943833", "141960", "10418677", "89141", "8926237", "207561469", "9370801", "24028625", "7326775", "24607460", "2744442", "9651185", "25530160", "20559995", "9553259", "21765740", "2192947", "22539786", "37509126", "7046094", "34398467", "25153441", "35223025", "9594459", "24554571", "23401973", "19298972", "27686280", "207494362", "2106002", "23218408", "25192326", "2973604", "42253683", "281645", "11371763", "17016544", "24984279", "41844566", "45418059", "23593737", "205357235", "5175438"], "inbound_citations": ["3324026", "24757315", "18030121", "49653044", "195761313", "20290618", "198925626", "52876968", "31137856", "215146486", "85141682", "214898095", "53223945", "4419758", "54566386", "10032749", "189814259"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12595516"}

This manuscript describes Support Vector Machine (SVM) based models that have been developed for discriminating interacting and non-interacting pairs of proteins from their amino acid sequence. We have developed SVM models using various types of sequence compositions e.g. amino acid, dipeptide, biochemical property, split amino acid and pseudo amino acid composition. We also developed SVM models using evolutionary information in the form of Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) composition. We achieved maximum Matthews's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 1.00, 0.52 and 0.74 for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Helicobacter pylori, using dipeptide based SVM model at default threshold. It was observed that the performance of a prediction model depends on the dataset used for training and testing. In case of E. coli MCC decreased from 1.0 to 0.67 when evaluated on a new dataset. In order to understand PPI in different cellular environment, we developed species-specific and general models. It was observed that species-specific models are more accurate than general models. We conclude that the primary amino acid sequence based descriptors could be used to differentiate interacting from non-interacting protein pairs. Some amino acids tend to be favored in interacting pairs than non-interacting ones.

The explosion of this kind of data gives rise of new areas: sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

This approach requires an adequate vector representation of linguistic units (words or sentences) to obtain better classification performance. For this reason, we present a new emotional vector representation of words which can faithfully translate their semantic and sentimental characteristics, based on emotion symbols. Furthermore, we propose an enrichment step that aims to enlarge the lexicon and dynamically update word representation according to new contexts.

The benchmark dataset, ADFA-LD, is employed for the simulation study. ADFA-LD dataset contains thousands of system call traces collected during various normal and attack processes for the Linux operating system environment. In order to pre-process and to extract features, windowing on the system call trace data followed by the principal component analysis which is named as Eigentraces is implemented.

This paper presents a novel method for human interaction recognition based on 3D skeleton data captured by Kinect sensor using hierarchical spatial-temporal saliency-based representation method. Hierarchical saliency can be conceptualized as Salient Actions at the highest level, determined by the initial movement in an interaction; Salient Points at middle level, determined by a single time point uniquely identified for all instances of Salient Action; Salient Joints at the lowest level, determined by the greatest positional changes of human joints in a Salient Action sequence. Given the interaction saliency at different levels, several types of features, such as spatial displacement, direction relations, and etc., are introduced based on action characteristics. Since there are few publicly accessible test datasets, we created a new dataset with eight types of interactions named K3HI, using the Microsoft Kinect. The method was tested based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) multi-class classifier. In the experiment, the results demonstrate that the average recognition accuracy of hierarchical saliency-based representation is 90.29%, outperforming methods using other features.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-018-6074-6", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2883171562", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5823093", "32614970", "61507474", "1560772", "17147683", "18238681", "62634207", "62824407", "9443904", "62707120", "195676043", "4333408", "14725937", "4279284", "32623266", "10132724", "9795592", "678506", "2432582", "61962167", "61962167", "606161", "11507099", "12851637", "13555633"], "inbound_citations": ["209410709"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49736620"}

Avoiding repeated training, class-incremental learning (CIL) is based on the combination of separately trained models and the overall model construction by kernel density and probability comparison. For its specific application to acoustic signals, Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) is extracted from the signals and is input to learning algorithms as features of acoustic signals. Experiment results show that the proposed method can applied into acoustic recognition and improve the accuracy compared to other CIL methods.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/sdpc.2017.81", "venue": "2017 International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)", "journal": "2017 International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2775396234", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35539187"}
