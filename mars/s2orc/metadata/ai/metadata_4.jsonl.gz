When developing management plans for mitigation measures at larger scales, complex hydro-biogeochemical models reach their limits due to data availability and spatial discretization. To circumvent this problem, the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in groundwater is estimated using a parsimonious GIS-based statistical approach. Point nitrate concentrations and spatial environmental data as predictors are used to train statistical models. In order to compile the spatial predictors with the respective monitoring sites, different designs of contributing areas (buffer zones) and their effects on the performance of different statistical models are investigated. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) are compared in terms of the predictive performance of each model according to various objective functions. We determine the most influential spatial predictors used in the respective models. After training the models with a subset of the data, we then predict the spatial nitrate distribution in groundwater for the entire federal state of Hesse, Germany on a 1 \u00d7 1 km grid by only the spatial environmental data. The Random Forest model outperforms the other models (R2 = 0.54), relying on hydrogeological units, the percentage of arable land and the nitrogen balance as the three most influencing predictors based on a 1000 m circular contributing area.

Resting state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) is a way to characterize brain networks without confounds associated with task EEG such as task difficulty and performance. A novel framework of how to study dynamic functional connectivity under the notion of functional connectivity microstates (FC\u03bcstates) and symbolic dynamics is further discussed. Furthermore, we introduced a way to construct a single integrated dynamic functional connectivity graph (IDFCG) that preserves both the strength of the connections between every pair of sensors but also the type of dominant intrinsic coupling modes (DICM). The whole methodology is demonstrated in a significant and unexplored task for EEG which is the definition of an objective Chronnectomic Brain Aged index (CBAI) extracted from resting-state data (N = 94 subjects) with both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Novel features have been defined based on symbolic dynamics and the notion of DICM and FC\u03bcstates. The transition rate of FC\u03bcstates, the symbolic dynamics based on the evolution of FC\u03bcstates (the Markovian Entropy, the complexity index), the probability distribution of DICM, the novel Flexibility Index that captures the dynamic reconfiguration of DICM per pair of EEG sensors and the relative signal power constitute a valuable pool of features that can build the proposed CBAI. Here we applied a feature selection technique and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier to discriminate young adults from middle-aged and a Support Vector Regressor to build a linear model of the actual age based on EEG-based spatio-temporal features. The most significant type of features for both prediction of age and discrimination of young vs. adults age groups was the dynamic reconfiguration of dominant coupling modes derived from a subset of EEG sensor pairs. Specifically, our results revealed a very high prediction of age for eyes-open (R2 = 0.60; y = 0.79x + 8.03) and lower for eyes-closed (R2 = 0.48; y = 0.71x + 10.91) while we succeeded to correctly classify young vs. middle-age group with 97.8% accuracy in eyes-open and 87.2% for eyes-closed.

In this work, we report a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) approach to early diagnosis of a form of skin cancer, melanoma, based on the analysis of biological fluids (blood and tissue homogenates) harvested from diseased mice and healthy controls. We acquired femtosecond LIBS spectra and used two different approaches for the analysis: through comparison of the emission intensity of selected analytes in healthy and diseased samples; and by using machine learning classification algorithms (LDA, Linear Discriminant Analysis; FDA, Fisher Discriminant Analysis; SVM, Support Vector Machines; and Gradient Boosting). We also addressed the effect of substrates on the analysis of liquid samples, by using four different substrates (PVDF, Cu, Al, Si) and comparing their performance. We show that with a combination of the most appropriate substrate and algorithm, we are able to discriminate between healthy and diseased mice with accuracy up to 96% while direct analysis of LIBS spectra did not provide any conclusive results.

However, this approach can not effectively constrain the effect of those irrelevant or redundant features. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we introduce a novel multi-surface proximal support machine classification model incorporating feature selection, which simultaneously implements classification and feature selection for improving the classification performance.

Now-a-days, availability of digital data is very high, and to manage them in predefined categories has become a challenging task. Machine learning technique is an approach by which we can train automated classifier to classify the documents with minimum human assistance. This paper discusses the Naive Bayes, Rocchio, k-Nearest Neighborhood and Support Vector Machine methods within machine learning paradigm for automated text categorization of given documents in predefined categories. Keywords Machine learning, Text categorization. 1. INTRODUCTION In this cyber age, availability of digital document is increased drastically. Accessing the documents in convenient way has become difficult task as number and size of documents growing day by day. One such task is Text Categorization (TC), which means to label natural language text in predefined categories. Earlier Knowledge Engineering (KE) techniques were used for TC. KE is used in expert system which consists of manually defined logical rules of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) of type: if ( DNF formula) then (category); unlabeled documents into its appropriate category with high Document can be classified under particular category only if it satisfies the rule. The drawback of is this approach is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. It is process in which expert person have to form DNF for new category. In last decade, the Machine Learning (ML) approach has gained popularity. In this approach, a general inductive process (learner) automatically builds a classifier. Learner automatically classifies document in predefined categories. Automated text categorization of documents in predefined categories is becoming popular in this digital age. Because now-a-days availability of digital documents increase dramatically, it becomes necessary to investigate and develop novel techniques for automated text categorization. Automated text categorization is applicable in document organization. In document organization documents has to be categorized in appropriate category. For example, in news paper agency the incoming advertisement has to be classified in one of the category like real estate, car for sale, office on rent. If such task is done manually than it would take lots of time. Automated systems are required that can accept the advertisement as input and categorize it to one of predefined categories. Let us take one more example where classifying the dynamic collection of text is to be done. Consider the example of e-mail filtering, where the computerized system is trained on \u201cspam\u201d mails to filter it out from non-spam mails [2]. Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence. Machine learning deals with the study of methods for making computers learn like humans. Automated techniques from AI and machine learning have been developed to handle many problems of pattern recognition/categorization. One such task is text categorization of documents. Traditionally text categorization task is being carried out by KE techniques. In KE techniques human assistant is needed for forming decision rules for categorizing individual categories. So the idea is to explore the application of machine learning techniques for automated text categorization [2, 3], which can be free from human interactions. Automated text categorization with machine learning gained a prominent status in the information systems field. In this technique, a learner is implemented which automatically learn from previously classified documents. As discussed from this applications and importance of automated text categorization system encourages implementing computerized system which can classify incoming documents into appropriate predefined category. In implementing automated text categorization system the technique of machine learning algorithm which can be trained for some labeled documents and able to classify the incoming accuracy is to be explored. There are many machine learning algorithms available to build a learner for text categorization system. So it is interesting to implement few popular techniques of classification of text and to perform a comparative analysis in term of accuracy for such techniques. This paper deals with following objects. The first is to explore basic preprocessing steps for text categorization. It also presents the study of some machine learning techniques for text classification. The paper also focuses on investigation of performance issues in text categorization.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5120/12340-8617", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "mag_id": "2160470732", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7207858"}

In this paper, we present a generalized bone fracture detection method that is applicable to multiple bone fracture types and multiple bone structures throughout the body. The method uses features extracted from candidate patches in X-ray images in a novel discriminative learning framework called the Stacked Random Forests Feature Fusion. This is a multilayer learning formulation in which the class probability labels, produced by random forests learners at a lower level, are used to derive the refined class distribution labels at the next level. The candidate patches themselves are selected using an efficient subwindow search algorithm. The outcome of the method is a number of fracture bounding-boxes ranked from the most likely to the least likely to contain a fracture. We evaluate the proposed method on a set of 145 X-rays images.

Each group of samples is studied by a regression equation, and the error terms of the regression equations are correlated in SUR system. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a training method for single-hidden layer feedforward neural network, it is widely used in many machine learning domains due to the good generalization capability and fast training speed. Since a single ELM ignores the correlated information among different groups of samples, it fails to solve the SUR problem effectively. This ineffectiveness becomes more obvious with the correlation among equations going up. In order to overcome this problem, an extended ELM model is proposed in this paper, described as Seemingly Unrelated ELM (SUELM). SUELM simultaneously learns multiple ELMs by sufficiently using the correlated information among different groups of samples, thus it can solve the SUR problem effectively. In comparison with a single ELM, SUELM significantly improves the performance. Simulation results show that SUELM performs better than the single ELM with respect to mean square error and generalization ability, especially when significant correlations exist among different groups of samples. This paper provides an effective way for solving the SUR problem by adopting ELM as the learning model.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.04.067", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2944552498", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164757840"}

Most of these approaches employ supervised machine learning algorithms which are, in general, very data hungry. This hampers the attempts to forecast some of these data series, particularly the ones that depend on (relatively) recent space observations. Here we focus on an attempt to forecast the solar surface longitudinally averaged radial magnetic field distribution using a form of spatial-temporal neural networks. Given that the recording of these spatial-temporal datasets only started in 1975 and are therefore quite short, the forecasts are predictably quite modest. However, given that there is a potential physical relationship between sunspots and the magnetic field, we employ another machine learning technique called transfer learning which has recently received considerable attention in the literature. Here, this approach consists in first training the source spatial-temporal neural network on the much longer time/latitude sunspot area dataset, which starts in 1874, then transferring the trained set of layers to a target network, and continue training the latter on the magnetic field dataset. The employment of transfer learning in the field of computer vision is known to obtain a generalized set of feature filters that can be reused for other datasets and tasks. Here we obtain a similar result, whereby we first train the network on the spatial-temporal sunspot area data, then the first few layers of the neural network are able to identify the two main features of the solar cycle, i.e. the amplitude variation and the migration to the equator, and therefore can be used to train on the magnetic field dataset and forecast better than a prediction based only on the historical magnetic field data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.03193", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/asna.202013690", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2989338080,3015071043", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4049613", "116686329", "9563026"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207847259"}

A number of approaches have sought to alleviate this problem. A Bayesian tree learning algorithm builds a decision tree, and generates a local naive Bayesian classifier at each leaf. The tests leading to a leaf can alleviate attribute inter-dependencies for the local naive Bayesian classifier. However, Bayesian tree learning still suffers from the small disjunct problem of tree learning. While inferred Bayesian trees demonstrate low average prediction error rates, there is reason to believe that error rates will be higher for those leaves with few training examples. This paper proposes the application of lazy learning techniques to Bayesian tree induction and presents the resulting lazy Bayesian rule learning algorithm, called LBR. This algorithm can be justified by a variant of Bayes theorem which supports a weaker conditional attribute independence assumption than is required by naive Bayes. For each test example, it builds a most appropriate rule with a local naive Bayesian classifier as its consequent. It is demonstrated that the computational requirements of LBR are reasonable in a wide cross-section of natural domains. Experiments with these domains show that, on average, this new algorithm obtains lower error rates significantly more often than the reverse in comparison to a naive Bayesian classifier, C4.5, a Bayesian tree learning algorithm, a constructive Bayesian classifier that eliminates attributes and constructs new attributes using Cartesian products of existing nominal attributes, and a lazy decision tree learning algorithm.

This paper explores the development of a large-scale quantum machine in the context of accurately and rapidly classifying molecules to determine photovoltaic efficacy through machine learning. Specifically, this paper proposes several novel representations of molecules that are amenable to learning, in addition to extending and improving existing representations. This paper also proposes and implements extensions to scalable distributed learning algorithms, in order to perform large scale molecular regression. This paper leverages Harvard\u2019s Odyssey supercomputer in order to train various kinds of predictive algorithms over millions of molecules, and assesses cross-validated test performance of these models for predicting photovoltaic efficacy.

Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of these areas is of fundamental importance for the goal of promoting improved territorial governance, emission mitigation and productivity gains. To this effect, this study mapped, through objective criteria and automatic classification methods (Random Forest) applied to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images, the totality of the Brazilian pastures between 2000 and 2016. Based on 90 spectro-temporal metrics derived from the Red, NIR and SWIR1 bands and distinct vegetation indices, distributed between dry and wet seasons, a total of 17 pasture maps with an approximate overall accuracy of 80% were produced with cloud-computing (Google Earth Engine). During this period, the pasture area varied from ~152 (2000) to ~179 (2016) million hectares. This expansion pattern was consistent with the bovine herd variation and mostly occurred in the Amazon, which increased its total pasture area by ~15 million hectares between 2000 and 2005, while the Cerrado, Caatinga and Pantanal biomes showed an increase of ~8 million hectares in this same period. The Atlantic Forest was the only biome in which there was a retraction of pasture areas throughout this series. In general, the results of this study suggest the existence of two relevant moments for the Brazilian pasture land uses. The first, strongly supported by the opening of new grazing areas, prevailed between 2000 and 2005 and mostly occurred in the Deforestation Arc and in the Matopiba regions. From 2006 on, the total pasture area in Brazil showed a trend towards stabilization, indicating a slight intensification of livestock activity in recent years.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs10040606", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2797997284", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6471216", "32904028", "205140747", "37896898", "154594482", "154397660", "87050786", "35324769", "73611400", "84885870", "17887713", "55225191", "11110712", "129229410", "30030583", "125447016", "18098865", "89141", "140620899", "14268978", "4992656", "205252568", "1465034", "164373004", "157489544", "154581245", "130526362", "9391959", "154556398", "33375042", "153553804", "157889358", "7573382", "128621829", "131657200", "215225209", "12630427", "84127038"], "inbound_citations": ["52278571", "209367210", "208345225", "96425322", "210914229", "51957313"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19114193"}

Our approach employs gradient-based optimization to compute object poses in order to imitate an arbitrary target relation by reducing the distance to it under the learned metric.

Emerging evidences suggest that lncRNAs interact with corresponding proteins to perform their regulatory functions. Therefore, identifying interacting lncRNA-protein pairs is the first step in understanding the function and mechanism of lncRNA. Since it is time-consuming and expensive to determine lncRNA-protein interactions by high-throughput experiments, more robust and accurate computational methods need to be developed. In this study, we developed a new sequence distributed representation learning based method for potential lncRNA-Protein Interactions Prediction, named LPI-Pred, which is inspired by the similarity between natural language and biological sequences. More specifically, lncRNA and protein sequences were divided into k-mer segmentation, which can be regard as \u201cword\u201d in natural language processing. Then, we trained out the RNA2vec and Pro2vec model using word2vec and human genome-wide lncRNA and protein sequences to mine distribution representation of RNA and protein. Then, the dimension of complex features is reduced by using feature selection based on Gini information impurity measure. Finally, these discriminative features are used to train a Random Forest classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions. Five-fold cross-validation was adopted to evaluate the performance of LPI-Pred on three benchmark datasets, including RPI369, RPI488 and RPI2241. The results demonstrate that LPI-Pred can be a useful tool to provide reliable guidance for biological research.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6926125", "pubmed_id": "31890140", "doi": "10.1016/j.csbj.2019.11.004", "venue": "Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal", "journal": "Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2994158303", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["51929298", "4412878", "8082988", "46248894", "13201961", "3743666", "205397916", "5499578", "8785951", "215684894", "10187981", "215622742", "34519796", "17540042", "46920940", "3290387", "51880016", "61811591", "54477282", "53028895", "7000062", "17717156", "8681107", "2832168", "1232973", "2407601", "39021228", "16447573", "5959482", "214980593", "44145625", "675041", "42639", "206764015"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209508877"}

This model collaboratively trains the decision boundary from two hyper-planes individually constructed by its own privacy data and global data. C2MP2 can hide true data entries and ensure the two-parties' privacy. We describe its definition and provide an algorithm to predict future data point based on Goethals's Private Scalar Product Protocol. Moreover, we show that C2MP2 can be transformed into existing Minimax Probability Machine (MPM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maxi\u2013Min Margin Machine (M4) model when privacy data satisfy certain conditions. We also extend C2MP2 to a nonlinear classifier by exploiting kernel trick. Furthermore, we perform a series of evaluations on real-world benchmark data sets.

For this purpose we use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on face images for gender classification.

According to the results obtained, the upper region of the face proved to be the most significant for the task of gender classification. Moreover, the changes in the resolution of the facial region images do not produce significant changes in the result. Based on the significance of different facial regions, we propose a gender classification method based on fusion of multiple facial regions and show that this method is able to compensate for facial expressions and lead to better overall performance.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CSIE.2009.871", "venue": "2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering", "journal": "2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2156908162", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59780268", "18615512", "15835416", "18916162", "11962383", "45129728", "5656478", "5425332", "7138354", "7326413", "961425", "16941488"], "inbound_citations": ["5683119", "121275793", "204890493", "27791201", "16488772", "55461649", "44662334", "15364304", "149132160", "202663465", "11951763", "13895946", "38592030", "14490458", "210130119"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211980"}

This unstructured data is a rich source of information for industries. Most of such opinion rich data (more than 85%) is in text format. In this work we have observed the effect of different machine learning algorithms on the text data including the Naive Bayes. Our main focus is on improving the classification efficiency of Naive Bayes using its complemented version with less sensitivity. The results show that the feature selection procedure from our previous work combined with these algorithms results in significant improvement of classification efficiency and reduced over-fitting compared to the previous work. In many cases our decisions are influenced by the opinions of others. Before the internet awareness became widespread, many of us used to ask our friends or neighbors for opinion of an electronic good or a movie before actually buying it. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review websites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. Unfortunately, 85% of these opinion rich resources are available in unstructured format. It has encouraged the analysts to develop an intelligent system that can automatically categorize or classify these text documents. A lot of research has been carried out, and each of them belongs to one of the following two approaches: \uf0b7 Unsupervised approaches manually derive or impose some rules on the data to extract useful information. \uf0b7 Supervised machine learning approaches use the statistical models such as Naive Bayes, SVM and Bayesian networks etc., The proposed approach in this paper is the supervised approach. Here a series of text documents or reviews which have been previously categorized (manually) and a classifier (model) is trained on these documents. Later this trained classifier is used to categorize new (unclassified) documents. The work documented here is an extension of [2]. Previously, the emphasis was on Pre-Processing i.e. converting these unstructured training documents into structural. Here it is mainly concentrated on classification. The movie-review dataset [1] has been used for experimental purposes. A sequence of pre-processing steps will be carried out to convert these documents into structural format i.e. Term-by-Document matrix (TbyD), as most of the machine learning algorithms are designed to work on structural data rather than on the unstructured data. A set of four good classifiers including the simple and complemented Naive Bayesian, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayesian Networks and Discriminative Frequency Estimate with Bayesian Networks are selected for validation.

In this study we apply such an approach in a realistic manipulation scenario, using 10 non-linear incremental regression machines to predict the desired torques for each motor of two robotic hands.

Therefore, the method of adjusting both the parameter C and the parameter \u03c3 was proposed to optimize the performance of support vector machine.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Computer Applications", "mag_id": "2374883010", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56962380"}

The approach classifies new SMS messages as SPAM or HAM (non-SPAM) by zero-thresholding their logit estimates. We tested the approach on a publicly available SMS corpora collected from the UK. Used in semi-supervised fashion, the approach clearly outperformed a competing algorithm, Semi-Boost. Used in unsupervised fashion, the approach outperformed a fully supervised classifier, an SVM (Support Vector Machine), when the number of training messages used by the SVM was small and performed comparably otherwise.

A large body of literature to-date suggests Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the \u201cbest of regression\u201d algorithms for financial data regression. Recent work however found that new deep learning\u2013\u2013Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) outperformed SVM for classification problems. In the present paper we conduct a new unbiased evaluation of these two modelling techniques for regression problems, and we also compare them with a popular regression model - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for financial volatility or risk forecasting. Our experiments using financial data show that the LSTM RNNs performed as good as v-SVR for large interval volatility forecasting and both performed much better than GARCH model for two financial indices (S&P 500 and AAPL). The LSTM RNNS deep learning method can learn from big raw data and can be run with many hidden layers and neurons under GPU to achieve a good prediction for long sequence data compared to the support vector regression. The deep learning technique - LSTM RNNs with big data can be used to improve the volatility prediction instead of v-SVR when the v-SVR does not predict well for some financial stocks of a portfolio.

The powers of the given Diophantine equation are taken as input to the input layer. The training of the network starts with initial random integral weights.

Comparing the unseen sequence with all the identified protein sequences and returning the category index with the highest similarity scored protein, conventional methods are usually time-consuming. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to build an efficient protein sequence classification system. In this paper, we study the performance of protein sequence classification using SLFNs. The recent efficient extreme learning machine (ELM) and its invariants are utilized as the training algorithms. The optimal pruned ELM is first employed for protein sequence classification in this paper. To further enhance the performance, the ensemble based SLFNs structure is constructed where multiple SLFNs with the same number of hidden nodes and the same activation function are used as ensembles. For each ensemble, the same training algorithm is adopted. The final category index is derived using the majority voting method. Two approaches, namely, the basic ELM and the OP-ELM, are adopted for the ensemble based SLFNs. The performance is analyzed and compared with several existing methods using datasets obtained from the Protein Information Resource center. The experimental results show the priority of the proposed algorithms.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3985160", "pubmed_id": "24795876", "doi": "10.1155/2014/103054", "venue": "BioMed Research International", "journal": "BioMed Research International", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2045993561", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["17401535", "17155934", "17365405", "6782579", "14296088", "6233316", "41874679", "9667939", "5835699", "61043716", "17281552", "17042421", "15589402", "116858", "18076010", "17628627", "11124791", "275551", "15874442", "15037168", "117089756", "14619623", "33683506", "36002046", "23712416", "17957498", "125898915", "9279281"], "inbound_citations": ["54047327", "3268345", "3791102", "63649902", "881524", "67736071", "55242480", "55782254", "4884708", "54710845", "8067758", "4307131", "56015231", "143432723", "54011721", "9164460", "55312351", "11536022", "30133440", "19416759", "11619972", "17661634", "14784702", "3984508", "17983607", "28521048", "54994040", "16188686", "55292565", "1669772", "64028489", "21678998", "110103509", "52988195", "39647773", "8639371", "795927", "214857283", "24390705", "5232887", "13980855", "2160090", "53766002", "118315923"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7334818"}

A poor initial population may unnecessarily increase the number of searches or it may cause the algorithm to converge at local optima. In this study, we aim to find a promising method for generating the initial population, in the Feature Subset Selection (FSS) domain. FSS is not considered as an expert system by itself, yet it constitutes a significant step in many expert systems. It eliminates redundancy in data, which decreases training time and improves solution quality. To achieve our goal, we compare a total of five different initial population generation methods; Information Gain Ranking (IGR), greedy approach and three types of random approaches. We evaluate these methods using a specialized Teaching Learning Based Optimization searching algorithm (MTLBO-MD), and three supervised learning classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Learning Machine. In our experiments, we employ 12 publicly available datasets, mostly obtained from the well-known UCI Machine Learning Repository. According to their feature sizes and instance counts, we manually classify these datasets as small, medium, or large-sized. Experimental results indicate that all tested methods achieve similar solutions on small-sized datasets. For medium-sized and large-sized datasets, however, the IGR method provides a better starting point in terms of execution time and learning performance. Finally, when compared with other studies in literature, the IGR method proves to be a viable option for initial population generation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.06.063", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Local Binary Pattern (LBP) has been a widely used texture descriptor, being well developed in vein recognition. However, the use of histogram in LBP as the feature of the vein image leads to the loss of global spatial information. That loss results in final accuracy reduction for absence of geometry structure, being essential to vein representation. In this paper we use Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) to process original LBP feature map as a solution to spatial information loss, because in PCNN pulse emitting and spreading reflects the intensity distribution pattern related to the vein geometry. The image time signature (image icon) produced by pulse emitting and spreading in PCNN is used as the vein feature. Using PCNN to extract time signature, we adopt a multi-valued linking channel in each neuron of the network to control the neighboring influence more precisely, and we introduce an adaptive linking strength (\\( \\beta \\)) to address the less information on vein pattern of the dark region in the vein image. As for the vein binary representation, Unit-linking PCNN is employed. It uses pulse spreading to perform eroding operation on the K-clustering binarization result of the vein image. After computing the time signature and the binary representation, Support Vector Machine (SVM) fusion strategy is used to fuse them.

Although questionnaire instruments are capable of detecting delirium if implemented rigorously, they have not been effectively used due to their lack of efficiency in busy hospital workflows. Their subjective nature is also a drawback. Electroencephalography (EEG) can objectively detect the \u201cdiffuse slowing\u201d of brain waves that is characteristic of delirium. While standard EEG is not suitable for mass screening due to its size, cost, and the expertise required for lead placement and interpretation, simplified two channel EEG devices can still be used to measure frontal EEG changes. Our goal was to investigate if frontal EEG activity could be used to detect delirium and to predict fall risk and mortality among elderly inpatients. Methods A single center, prospective design was used to collect frontal EEG activity (Fp1 and Fp2 EEG signals) from elderly patients (>55 yo) after admission or at the time of an emergency room visit. EEG features (band powers and different combinations of frequency bands) were calculated for both channels and averaged. A bispectral EEG score (\u201cBSEEG score\u201d) was calculated based on the distribution of the scores from the study participants, and normalized with a mean value of zero and one standard deviation (SD) above the mean as 1. The top 9 EEG features were selected using machine learning methods, Random Forest. Subjects were assessed for the clinical presence of delirium and the primary outcomes measured were fall history, and mortality. K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), kernelized SVM, and neural network approaches were used to assess the ability of bispectral EEG to predict delirium status, falls and survival. Results EEG features and outcome data for 274 patients was available for analysis. Clinical presence of delirium and BSEEG score were significantly associated (P = 6.14 \u00d7 10-6; unadjusted, P= 1.17 \u00d7 10-5; adjusted). Of all the classification methods, kernelized SVM yielded the highest prediction accuracies of 69%, 89%, and 81%, for delirium status, falls and mortality, respectively. Hazard ratio (HR) for survival controlling for age, gender, CCI and delirium status based on one SD change of BSEEG score at the time of admission was 1.32, (CI = 1.03 to 1.70, P=0.026). Conclusions In our study, bispectral EEG in delirious elderly inpatients was able to predict patient outcomes including mortality and fall risks. Bispectral EEG monitoring may also be applicable in settings including the primary care clinic, emergency department, and in nursing home or home-care settings. Delirium is particularly dangerous when patients experience it outside of hospitals because they do not have medical attention available on site. The simple, noninvasive nature of a simplified EEG test makes it potentially ideal for routine screening. Potentially it can be used as a next vital sign to monitor the risk of delirium, mortality, and falls among elderly patients. As the aging population is expanding rapidly, such a test would be in high demand.

Cotton is a popular material for surgical garments and drapes because of its comfort and low cost. The acquisition of hydrophobic behaviour will provide haemo-repellancy and the prevention of bacterial attachment. This paper describes a series of designed experiments to vary three parameters for the plasma process, gas concentration, power and duration, and to measure the resulting degrees of hydrophobic behaviour at the cotton surface by means of observing water droplets. Neural networks can provide rapid development of simulation models of processes by adaptation to observed conditions as inputs and the results as outputs. The data from the plasma trials has been used to develop a neural model to predict surface hydrophobic behaviour. The model is itself optimised for interpolative ability, and allows a search to be made through the data space to find the best possible combination of the process parameters to encourage optimal surface treatment, and thus make the cotton most hydrophobic.

Such variation is not arbitrary as body parts (e.g. head, torso, legs) have relative stable spatial distribution. Breaking down the variability of global appearance regarding the spatial distribution potentially benefits the person matching. We therefore learn a novel similarity function, which consists of multiple sub-similarity measurements with each taking in charge of a subregion. In particular, we take advantage of the recently proposed polynomial feature map to describe the matching within each subregion, and inject all the feature maps into a unified framework. The framework not only outputs similarity measurements for different regions, but also makes a better consistency among them. Our framework can collaborate local similarities as well as global similarity to exploit their complementary strength. It is flexible to incorporate multiple visual cues to further elevate the performance. In experiments, we analyze the effectiveness of the major components.

Its success is due to a combination of recent algorithmic breakthroughs, increasingly powerful computers, and access to significant amounts of data. Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning. Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users' private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions, interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem, collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private. Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy (DP) to make information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and Shmatikov at CCS'15. Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data). Interestingly, we show that record-level differential privacy applied to the shared parameters of the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP is not designed to address our attack).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1702.07464", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3133956.3134012", "venue": "CCS '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951368041,2591882872", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["207241585", "18828233", "14757739", "3937335", "3833774", "89141", "486774", "32057588", "1578541", "351666", "16234956", "372467", "14903949", "14119362", "2565493", "13306628", "207178262", "14861086", "11822702", "110359062", "207229839", "2148083", "1033682", "6706414", "85531885", "206741496", "8397498", "10186402", "1248132", "8955577", "7027066", "8999574", "3074096", "60282629", "7625356", "8854558", "120118103", "12834445", "605416", "6875312", "15238391", "11605311", "6144566", "6254678", "17362994", "7004303", "13487372", "18500294", "6056831", "11758569", "195652429", "1687220", "2153469", "2724052", "11715509", "64543020", "38352604", "10488675", "8085841", "604334", "2814088", "2984526", "2692439", "5787871", "2264858", "7885987"], "inbound_citations": ["67856763", "208269154", "59316651", "214666996", "211209009", "189928627", "88490396", "207847245", "50775064", "209320154", "198918302", "211688033", "52918872", "209505397", "208513099", "207941008", "104292559", "61153656", "59316625", "203627027", "52193137", "59606133", "3619789", "51877788", "209460895", "207863297", "53217274", "59555067", "197644134", "3351944", "53430044", "113407556", "211677815", "209495007", "209532905", "21721649", "208310035", "199459168", "160017949", "202888951", "85556183", "57189435", "52186574", "58028999", "197642766", "56598838", "212628473", "202236961", "53238079", "199365902", "212628324", "211476508", "52013737", "49864877", "211677363", "54447962", "214623088", "215548987", "204800475", "208910294", "53459438", "209460844", "195833108", "289366", "202588705", "211685051", "54463965", "214623867", "49471553", "201646222", "211297533", "54461890", "53473500", "212747909", "119286227", "203736521", "117692132", "52162470", "213183250", "211096977", "67750891", "51924019", "52188768", "3052834", "113403787", "210971239", "29166526", "204512539", "211990905", "54069674", "202539472", "210995415", "140112550", "208291264", "52211986", "67855639", "53744099", "208248260", "53048213", "21677034", "207902139", "198986059", "202771304", "212633480", "53099247", "202749976", "3855165", "208229912", "91184074", "59337327", "56895584", "195699554", "56340748", "85498919", "3357865", "67855604", "11527748", "54457439", "208334370", "86412119", "54463821", "182536049", "209439571", "67771690", "202781896", "209386442", "49886672", "51785298", "207758676", "214713568", "156053162", "3627716", "51889364", "201640977", "53774634", "195316471", "214362498", "49574455", "203736488", "3570809", "207870469", "215540981", "25130739", "4722022", "211258745", "210919946", "210116477", "67865045", "209386515", "201646708", "54436587", "204509689", "195798643", "208513473", "211679295", "174798323", "29160393", "54444175", "207830094", "44085059", "202719340", "202583405", "199579523", "131776729", "211677563", "189928475", "214623386", "53288870", "199499986", "54457728", "208138932", "202888587", "52901134", "204862202", "214613484", "198169168"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5051282"}

The Duckworth Lewis method, or D/L method, was created by Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis. The International Cricket Council (ICC) adopted D/L method in 1999 to address the issue of delayed one-day cricket matches due to interruptions such as inclement weather conditions, poor light and floodlight failures, and crowd problems. We have attempted to identify the shortcomings in the existing Duckworth Lewis method using data mining algorithms such as Random Forests and C4.5. We have also shown that the p-values and other data mining techniques serve a dual purpose of not only evaluating whether systems such as D/L method have been exploited by taking advantage of their properties such as simplicity, but also devising alternate and robust approaches (or models). In the first part of this project, we have analyzed fifty one-day international (ODI) cricket matches, in which the Duckworth Lewis method has been applied, using tools such as WEKA and Microsoft Excel. We have observed that the Duckworth Lewis method has some limitations. As a result, using data mining methods we have shown that the Duckworth Lewis system has proven over time to be biased towards the team batting first and the team winning the toss -- a toss refers to the coin-flip at the beginning of the match used to decide who bats or fields. Bias in the context of the report is defined as taking advantage of the properties of systems such as the Duckworth Lewis method. We also seek to show that such an \"exploitation\" of the system permits prediction of the match winner with outcomes that are better than just chance. Using the analyses described above, we propose a modification to the existing Duckworth Lewis method to reduce this bias by considering the \"venue\" of the game as an additional resource along with the two existing resources-overs and wickets - to predict the target score. We have done a basic evaluation of the reduction in bias due to the proposed changes. The modification has helped not only to reduce the bias but also to alleviate the impact of factors such as toss and team batting first in predicting the target scores in limited-overs cricket matches.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDMW.2011.79", "venue": "2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops", "journal": "2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2116431951", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10071304"}

On the other hand, it only employs categorical data. In case of Type II Diabetes Mellitus medical diagnosis, the exploitation of continuous data might be essential. With the aim of solving this complication, Improved Frequent Pattern Growth (IFP Growth) with Hybrid Enhanced Artificial Bee Colony Advanced Kernel Support Vector Machine (HEABC AKSVM IFP Growth) classification based Association Rule Mining (ARM) system is proposed in this study to create rules. This study introduces improved FP growth to effectively derive frequent patterns including from a vague database in which items possibly will come into view in medical database. Then, HEABC AKSVM IFP Growth classifier is emp loyed to create the association rules from the frequent item sets, also keeping away from the rule redundancy and inconsistencies at the time of mining process. Then, results are simulated and evaluated against few classification techniques in terms of classification accuracy, number of derived rules and processing time.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.19026/rjaset.11.1860", "venue": null, "journal": "Research Journal of Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2504210863,2384164624", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["63831262", "4945242", "10799999", "490482", "15347757", "116483931", "62769919", "117964544", "38941978", "14039204", "61206558", "6171546", "15777016", "21920861"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55243463"}

We trained two Random Forest (RF) machine-learning models for cloud mask and cloud thermodynamic phase detection using spectral observations from VIIRS on Suomi-NPP (SNPP). Observations from CALIOP were carefully selected to provide reference labels. The two RF models were trained for all-day and daytime-only conditions using a 4-year collocated VIIRS/CALIOP dataset from 2013 to 2016. Due to the orbit difference, the collocated CALIOP and SNPP VIIRS training samples cover a broad viewing zenith angle range, which is a great benefit to overall model performance. The all-day model uses 3 VIIRS infrared (IR) bands (8.6, 11, and 12 \u03bcm) and the daytime model uses 5 Near-IR (NIR) and Shortwave-IR (SWIR) bands (0.86, 1.24, 1.38, 1.64 and 2.25 \u03bcm) together with the 3 IR bands to detect clear, liquid water, and ice cloud pixels. Up to 7 surface types, namely, ocean/water, forest, cropland, grassland, snow/ice, barren/desert, and shrubland, were considered separately to enhance performance for both models. Detection of cloudy pixels and thermodynamic phase with the two RF models were compared against collocated CALIOP products from 2017. It is shown that the two RF models have high accuracy rates in comparison with the CALIOP reference for both cloud detection and thermodynamic phase. For cloud detection, the accuracy rates of the daytime RF model are higher than 92%thinsp;% for all surface types, while the accuracy rates of the all-day RF model decrease by 3~8%thinsp;%, depending on surface type. For cloud thermodynamic phase, both RF models agree well with CALIOP, except over barren/desert regions. Other existing SNPP VIIRS and Aqua MODIS cloud mask and phase products are also evaluated, with results showing that the two RF models and the MODIS MYD06 optical property phase product are the top 3 algorithms with respect to lidar observations during the daytime. During the nighttime, the RF all-day model works best for both cloud detection and phase, in particular for pixels over snow/ice surfaces. The present RF models can be extended to other similar passive instruments if training samples can be collected from CALIOP or other lidars. However, the quality of reference labels and potential sampling issues that may impact model performance would need further attention.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/amt-2019-409", "venue": null, "journal": "Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213601273"}

The use of sparse, orthogonal hidden-layer representations has been shown to reduce catastrophic interference. The author demonstrates that the use of sparse representations may, in certain cases, actually result in worse performance on catastrophic interference. This paper argues for the necessity of maintaining hidden-layer representations that are both as highly distributed and as highly orthogonal as possible. The author presents a learning algorithm, called context-biasing, that dynamically solves the problem of constraining hiddenlayer representations to simultaneously produce good orthogonality and distributedness. On the data tested for this study, context-biasing is shown to reduce catastrophic interference by more than 50% compared to standard backpropagation.

This is a very challenging problem since the direct extension of state-of-the-art white-box attacks (e.g., CW or PGD) to the hard-label black-box setting will require minimizing a non-continuous step function, which is combinatorial and cannot be solved by a gradient-based optimizer. The only current approach is based on random walk on the boundary, which requires lots of queries and lacks convergence guarantees. We propose a novel way to formulate the hard-label black-box attack as a real-valued optimization problem which is usually continuous and can be solved by any zeroth order optimization algorithm. For example, using the Randomized Gradient-Free method, we are able to bound the number of iterations needed for our algorithm to achieve stationary points. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous random walk approach to attacking convolutional neural networks on MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets. More interestingly, we show that the proposed algorithm can also be used to attack other discrete and non-continuous machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.04457", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951006199,2964346747,2874797877", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2410333", "211115704", "11558223", "12387176", "44220219", "3689056", "2893830", "2179389", "3488815", "19157252", "12368272", "1090603", "25296376", "44079102", "14112046", "14542261", "18268744", "206597351", "206594692", "195953", "211115704"], "inbound_citations": ["211066285", "202734646", "212725250", "198953371", "198952447", "209862281", "143424840", "174802411", "67855372", "204941741", "201103748", "104291897", "211037836", "207852953", "54011126", "210164502", "53293944", "208527215", "208547670", "208617802", "189898680", "86541092", "208548428", "182952352", "203593946", "182952616", "211212270", "182953140", "214714048", "133468229", "155100229", "202777327", "173991158", "204800654", "56895282", "51925625", "197632505", "209500986", "202773018", "211133154", "53027350", "208513473", "212816521", "211132607", "209315630", "210064343", "184486994"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49672236"}

Feature selection selects the most relevant features and considers how to use each of the selected features in the most suitable format.

The proposed method was evaluated by 13 subjects (aged from 23 to 50) in a lab environment. The experimental results illustrate that the large number of features (3 vs. 7 features) are not associated with high classification accuracy using a single Support Vector Machine (SVM) model (61.3% vs. 44.7%). However, the accuracy was improved significantly (83.1% vs. 44.7%), when the selected 7 features were organized as 3 subsets and used to classify 10 postures (9 motionless with 1 motion) in 3 layers via a hierarchical algorithm, which combined a rule-based algorithm with 3 independent SVM models.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IE.2014.10", "venue": "2014 International Conference on Intelligent Environments", "journal": "2014 International Conference on Intelligent Environments", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2048438099", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29083349", "14573187", "14959107", "2791599", "18080013", "13807115", "38656918", "3258484", "36257162", "24802121", "21266356", "31707429", "33578680", "13349949", "17627549", "112137120", "8034460"], "inbound_citations": ["11133988", "35796484", "18533599"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14881829"}

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration.

Specifically, variability in sample, system, and experimental parameters in LIBS studies present a substantive hurdle for robust classification, even when standard multivariate chemometric techniques are used for analysis. Considering pharmaceutical sample investigation as an example, we propose the use of support vector machines (SVM) as a nonlinear classification method over conventional linear techniques such as soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for discrimination based on LIBS measurements. Using over-the-counter pharmaceutical samples, we demonstrate that the application of SVM enables statistically significant improvements in prospective classification accuracy (sensitivity), because of its ability to address variability in LIBS sample ablation and plasma self-absorption behavior. Furthermore, our results reveal that SVM provides nearly 10% improvement in correct allocation rate and a concomitant reduction in misclassification rates of 75% (cf. PLS-DA) and 80% (cf. SIMCA)-when measurements from samples not included in the training set are incorporated in the test data-highlighting its robustness. While further studies on a wider matrix of sample types performed using different LIBS systems is needed to fully characterize the capability of SVM to provide superior predictions, we anticipate that the improved sensitivity and robustness observed here will facilitate application of the proposed LIBS-SVM toolbox for screening drugs and detecting counterfeit samples, as well as in related areas of forensic and biological sample analysis.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3310257", "pubmed_id": "22292496", "doi": "10.1021/ac202755e", "venue": "Analytical chemistry", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "mag_id": "2092388540", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51948040", "37517119", "44341017", "6276742", "4291280", "96317663", "53004148", "51950259", "53305013", "21733516", "22114466", "40857512", "86859045", "103418800", "12680835", "6904727", "122805803"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206353728"}

Wind power generation is increasing rapidly due to concerns about global warming and financial incentives from government. With the increased percentage of wind power in power grid, wind power forecasting has become essential to system operator for electric power scheduling and power reserve allocation. Wind power producers can get benefit of wind power prediction while bidding in the electricity market. This paper presents the wind power forecasting model using Support Vector Machine technique. In this model, wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, air pressure and air density are taken as input parameters to build accurate and efficient model. New statistical computing software called RStudio is used to develop prediction model.

In general, relevance feedback aims to improve the retrieval performance by learning with user's judgements on the retrieval results. Despite widespread interest, but feedback related technologies are often faced with a few limitations. One of the most obvious limitations is often requiring the user to repeat a number of steps before obtaining the improved search results. This makes the process inefficient and tedious search for the online applications. In this paper, a effective feedback related scheme for content-based image retrieval is proposed. First, a decision boundary is learned via Support Vector Machine to filter the images in the database. Then, a ranking function for selecting the most informative samples will be calculated by defining a novel criterion that considers both the scores of Support Vector Machine function and similarity metric between the \"ideal query\" and the images in the database.

Before classification, we employed Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimension of the data.

To this end, we propose an unsupervised and a near-unsupervised method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to classify scenarios as traversable or not based on visual data. Our method is inspired by the recent success of data-driven approaches on computer vision problems and anomaly detection, and reduces the need for vast amounts of negative examples at training time. Collecting negative data indicating that a robot should not go through a space is typically hard and dangerous because of collisions, whereas collecting positive data can be automated and done safely based on the robot's own traveling experience. We verify the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach on a test dataset collected in a previously unseen environment with a mobile robot.

The objectives of this study are to (a) predict classifier error in the context of different CAD problems when larger data cohorts become available, and (b) compare classifier performance and trends (both at the sample/patient level and at the pixel level) as additional data is accrued (such as in a clinical trial).

Recent approaches towards predicting pedestrian intention use motion information and his/her situational awareness to distinguish between intention of either crossing or stopping before a vehicle. We investigate the power of including contextual information into this problem. Examples of contextual cues include pedestrian position with respect to the curb of a road and relative locations of the vehicles with respect to the pedestrian in the scene. We propose a graphical model Factored Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (FLDCRF) to integrate contextual and motion features of a pedestrian as well as to capture the intrinsic relationship between intention and action of a pedestrian. We show that the inclusion of context information aids early prediction of a pedestrian intention and the motion information provides more accuracy to the predicted output, resulting in an early and accurate joint model to predict pedestrian intention. We also show that FLDCRF performs better over the concatenated motion and context features when compared with existing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

Given the ubiquity of high quality recording devices, such as mobile phones, an automated audio analysis tool provides potential for first-level screening of sleep disorders. In this work we explored audio recordings from patients referred for suspected Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), a prevalent but under-diagnosed disorder. We applied a novel multi-scale entropy-based approach to quantify the regularities in the data on different temporal scales. METHODS: GreyFlash (Stowood Scientific Instruments, Oxford, UK) data were recorded in the home of 146 randomly chosen subjects who were referred to a sleep clinic through the UK's National Health Service. A finger photoplethysmogram from which oxygen saturation and pulse rate were derived, nasal airflow and nasal sound from a nasal cannula, body movement, body position and audio from a microphone placed on the nasal cannula were recorded. Of the 146 subjects, 72 had OSA , 50 were benign snorers and 24 were normal. 240 minutes of each recording were analysed, beginning 30 minutes into the recording. Audio data were downsampled from 4kHz to 1Hz. MultiScale Entropy (MSE) was calculated over 40 scales (1-40 seconds) for each subject. Data were split 70:30 into training set and an independent validation set. Combinations of scales derived from the training data were used to train a Support Vector Machine to classify patients as OSA or nonOSA. RESULTS: Using scales 6 (6 seconds), 21 (21 seconds) and 30 (30 seconds) a specificity of 92.5% and positive predictivity of 85.8% in training and a specificity of 90.5% and a positive predictivity of 83.5% on the validation set was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results suggest that audio data provides useful information in screening for OSA. Unlike previous works, this study applies MSE to audio data, examines time series structure over several scales and automates the classification stage. No algorithm is required to segment the data, identify sleep onsets, offsets, arousals, or arbitrary noise, making the process simple to automate. Further investigation is required to assess whether the technique can be applied to audio data recorded on a mobile phone in the home. It is likely that other metrics derived from audio, accelerometry, video or cardiovascular parameters will be required to increase the accuracy of our approach to an acceptable level.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2012.185.1_MeetingAbstracts.A3841", "venue": "ATS 2012", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2320357071", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["116055053", "215632245", "2607173", "13927343"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:76589052"}

To facilitate the training process and ensure better convergence, we also propose a pre-training procedure that jointly trains the neural network with inverse lithography technique (ILT).

For this reason, the machine learning and statistics communities devote considerable research effort on generating inductive-learning algorithms that try to learn the true \"concept\" of a task from a set of its examples. Often times, however, one has additional resources readily available, but largely unused, that can improve the concept that these learning algorithms generate. These resources include available computer cycles, as well as prior knowledge describing what is currently known about the domain. Effective utilization of available computer time is important since for most domains an expert is willing to wait for weeks, or even months, if a learning system can produce an improved concept. Using prior knowledge is important since it can contain information not present in the current set of training examples. ::: In this thesis, I present three \"anytime\" approaches to connectionist theory refinement. Briefly, these approaches start by translating a set of rules describing what is currently known about the domain into a neural network, thus generating a knowledge-based neural network (KNN). My approaches then utilize available computer time to improve this KNN by continually refining its weights and topology. My first method, TopGen, searches for good \"local\" refinements to the KNN topology. It does this by adding nodes to the KNN in a manner analogous to symbolically adding rules and conjuncts to an incorrect rule base. My next approach, R scEGENT, uses genetic algorithms to find better \"global\" changes to this topology. R scEGENT proceeds by using (a) the domain-specific rules to help create the initial population of KNNs and (b) crossover and mutation operators specifically designed for KNNs. My final algorithm, A scDDEMUP, searches for an \"ensemble\" of KNNs that work together to produce an effective composite prediction. A scDDEMUP works by using genetic algorithms to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible.

Methods: The expressions of plasma miRNA were examined with SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time PCR. Results: We identified that the expressions of 10 plasma miRNAs (miR-21, miR-20a, miR-210, miR-145, miR-126, miR-223, miR-197, miR-30a, miR-30d, miR-25), smoking status, fever, cough, chest pain or tightness, bloody phlegm, haemoptysis, were significantly different between lung cancer and control groups (P<0.05). The accuracies of the combined SVM, miRNAs SVM, symptom SVM, combined Fisher, miRNAs Fisher and symptom Fisher were 96.34%, 80.49%, 84.15%, 84.15%, 75.61%, and 80.49%, respectively; AUC of these six model were 0.976, 0.841, 0.838, 0.865, 0.750, and 0.801, respectively. The accuracy and AUC of combined SVM were higher than the other 5 models (P<0.05). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that SVM model based on plasma miRNAs biomarkers may serve as a novel, accurate, noninvasive method for auxiliary diagnosis of lung cancer.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6775617", "pubmed_id": "31602261", "doi": "10.7150/jca.30528", "venue": "Journal of Cancer", "journal": "Journal of Cancer", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2973019908,2982145765", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8795795", "196640882", "24619393", "15611977", "1931538", "7394432", "75425857", "37884576", "323584", "41386584", "3266976", "14792473", "2777049", "16310501", "41807867", "8513590", "7536805", "22885494", "25350395", "3231200", "4210193", "18917984", "4992006", "18671006", "52285241", "19150416", "215711546", "215094437", "1939876", "53287109", "34919648", "7547816", "4611029", "20244529", "32011353", "31344337", "25039693", "7649389", "86816668", "12609116", "8242828", "215126648", "22012536", "34245347", "120801", "3519334", "924951", "4947869", "24450655", "9239088", "214933453", "28059814", "52158488", "3853089", "376774", "4635432", "52814653", "46828162", "32935340"], "inbound_citations": ["211112271"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203493300"}

The assay is based on chemical stimulation of MUTZ-3 cultures, using the compounds to be assayed as stimulatory agents. The readout of the assay is a transcriptional quantification of the genomic predictors, collectively termed the GARD Prediction Signature (GPS), using a complete genome expression array. Compounds are predicted as either sensitizers or nonsensitizers by a Support Vector Machine model. In this report, we provide a proof of concept for the functionality of the GARD assay by describing the classification of 26 blinded and 11 nonblinded chemicals as sensitizers or nonsensitizers.

{"paper_id": "20166245", "title": "Visual Working Memory and Delay Activity in Highly Selective Neurons in the Inferior Temporal Cortex", "authors": [{"first": "Natasha", "middle": [], "last": "Sigala", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) is the kind of active memory needed to represent and monitor visual information in the short term and is often studied with delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. A number of studies have shown that both the inferior temporal cortex (ITC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for performing tasks that involve such cross-temporal contingencies. A neuronal mechanism that has been suggested to support this ability is delay activity, the sustained cell activation during the delay period after the presentation of a stimulus, until a subsequent stimulus or the execution of a response. Particular emphasis has been put on the PFC role in working memory, based on deficits in performance of delay tasks after PFC lesions, persistence of delay activity in some PFC cells even when distractors appear during the delay period, and elevated PET and fMRI BOLD signals from the PFC in humans performing delay tasks (Fuster, 2008). Delay activity in the PFC was discovered already in 1971 (Fuster and Alexander, 1971; Kubota and Niki, 1971) and has been extremely influential in theories of PFC function (e.g. Levy and Goldman-Rakic, 2000), but it has since been reported in most cortical areas, e.g. V1 and ITC (Fuster, 1990), parietal and somatosensory cortex (Koch and Fuster, 1989). According to the current framework neural activity in IT (or other unimodal sensory cortex) represents the stimulus that is no longer visible/available, and this activity is under top-down control exerted by PFC (Ranganath and D'Esposito, 2005). Because IT delay activity is thought to be vulnerable to distractors (Baylis and Rolls, 1987; Miller et al., 1993), it has been proposed that for the reinstatement of the specific memory in ITC, feedback signals from the PFC are necessary (Miller et al., 1996; Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005). ::: ::: In a recent paper Woloszyn and Sheinberg (2009) report highly relevant findings for the robustness of delay activity in the ITC of monkeys performing a delay task. The task has four different conditions, designed to test the effects of distractors on the delay activity of the neurons during the memory delay. In this DMS task a sample image is presented that needs to be encoded and remembered during a 1000-ms delay, and is then compared with a test image, which can be a match or a non-match to the sample, requiring a different kind of response (right or left button press). The first condition contains no distractor, so the screen is blank until the test stimulus appears. In the second condition the sample is gradually occluded by a square of the same colour as the background. The third condition is a slight variation of the second with the square occluder being black and hence visible during occlusion and throughout the delay period. The fourth and most interesting condition uses a complex visual image, so a true distractor during the delay period, which is replaced by the test stimulus at the end of the delay. ::: ::: As expected, task performance reflected the higher difficulty of the complex distractor condition with slower reaction times and higher error rates (Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2009, Figure 1F,G). During recordings 79 neurons with very high visual selectivity were isolated, which enabled the authors to test the hypothesis that delay activity is robust in highly selective IT cells (Mikami, 1995). In the first three conditions there was selective delay activity (evaluated with ROC analysis) at the level of the cell population, while in the fourth and most relevant condition, although the selectivity was not significant at the level of the population, it was evident in 10 cells (out of 79 or 12.7%), which is comparable to the proportion reported earlier (19/171 or 11.11% cells, Mikami, 1995). Furthermore, a linear Support Vector Machine classification analysis showed that combining the selective activity of a small number of cells (64) yields significant classification for effective vs. ineffective stimuli even for the delay activity of the complex distractor trials, with the reliability of the classification improving towards the end of the delay period (see Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2009, Figure 5). It is important to note that the classification analysis provides supportive evidence for the information present at the population level, but the delay activity surviving the distractor presentation is already visible in the spike density functions of the cells (see Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2009, Figure 3A). The finding that delay activity in IT can be robust and survive the presentation of distractors confirms a related finding reported by Takeda et al. (2005). In that study the monkeys performed a paired-associate task and recordings from both IT and PRh cortex showed that cells with target-specific delay activity can maintain their selectivity during the delay period after the presentation of two distractors. ::: ::: The prevailing view is that robust delay activity in PFC is the main mechanism for information maintenance and processing that is fed back to IT (or other posterior cortical areas). Computational models of working memory primarily focus on PFC and have used extensively the delay activity as part of attractor or feedback networks (e.g. Wang, 2001), more recently enriching the models with distractors (Macoveanu et al., 2007), and dopamine modulation of the interaction between PFC and the basal ganglia (Gruber et al., 2006; Chumbley et al., 2008). ::: ::: The accumulating evidence that IT delay activity can also be robust to the presentation of distractors, as well as that PFC delay activity can become weak and lose its selectivity following distractors (Warden and Miller, 2007; Kusunoki et al., 2009), call for a re-evaluation of the emphasis placed on PFC delay activity as the main mechanism supporting VWM. On the one hand, recent evidence suggests that sensory areas also have selective delay activity, so they are involved both in perception and memory (Pasternak and Greenlee, 2005). On the other hand, it is not clear if PFC delay activity is a necessary and adequate mechanism for VWM. Several studies have successfully explored alternative interpretations for the role of delay activity in the PFC, pointing to attentional control, stimulus and action selection (see Lebedev et al., 2004 and Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2009 for relevant studies and discussion). Recent work proposes that VWM can be achieved with alternative mechanisms that do not rely on delay activity (Sugase-Miyamoto et al., 2008). According to this model IT neurons behave like match filters that compare the total activity elicited by the sample and test stimuli, and decision on the match is made when a certain activity threshold is exceeded. The memory trace is stored in the synaptic weights of fast adapting synapses and is independent of the presence of delay activity. The match filter relies on standard stimulus selectivity, and the large difference of activity for effective and ineffective stimuli (see Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2009, Figure 2) creates very different, spatially distributed signals in the synaptic weights. The idea that memory can be stored in synaptic weights has also been modelled in papers addressing the mechanisms of repetition suppression (Sohal and Hasselmo, 2000; Bogacz and Brown, 2003).The important point about the Sugase-Miyamoto et al. model is that it does not rely on the presence of delay activity, and achieves high matching performance by comparing activity levels during the presentation of the sample and test stimuli only. ::: ::: These recent findings taken together pose questions to our interpretation of the role of delay activity, which we should aim to answer with well-designed experiments and an open mind.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2759363", "pubmed_id": "19826617", "doi": "10.3389/neuro.06.011.2009", "venue": "Front.

Currently, nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are available for extracting low-dimensional embeddings, such as manifold learning.

To extract features automatically, a manifold learning method with self-organization mapping is introduced for the first time. Under the non-uniform sample distribution reconstructed by the phase space, the expectation maximization(EM) iteration algorithm is used to divide the local neighborhoods adaptively without manual intervention. After that, the local tangent space alignment(LTSA) algorithm is adopted to compress the high-dimensional phase space into a more truthful low-dimensional representation. Finally, the signal is reconstructed by the kernel regression. Several typical states include the Lorenz system, engine fault with piston pin defect, and bearing fault with outer-race defect are analyzed.

On the contrary, there are plenty of publicly available datasets for emotion recognition which are based on facial expressivity due to the prevailing role of computer vision in deep learning research, nowadays. Thereby, in the current work, we performed a study on cross-modal transfer knowledge between audio and facial modalities within the emotional context. More concretely, we investigated whether facial information from videos could be used to boost the awareness and the prediction tracking of emotions in audio signals. Our approach was based on a simple hypothesis: that the emotional state\u2019s content of a person\u2019s oral expression correlates with the corresponding facial expressions. Research in the domain of cognitive psychology was affirmative to our hypothesis and suggests that visual information related to emotions fused with the auditory signal is used from humans in a cross-modal integration schema to better understand emotions. In this regard, a method called dacssGAN (which stands for Domain Adaptation Conditional Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks) is introduced in this work, in an effort to bridge these two inherently different domains. Given as input the source domain (visual data) and some conditional information that is based on inductive conformal prediction, the proposed architecture generates data distributions that are as close as possible to the target domain (audio data).

To inpaint 3D models with semantic plausibility and contextual details, we introduce a hybrid framework that combines a 3D Encoder-Decoder Generative Adversarial Network (3D-ED-GAN) and a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN). The 3D-ED-GAN is a 3D convolutional neural network trained with a generative adversarial paradigm to fill missing 3D data in low-resolution. LRCN adopts a recurrent neural network architecture to minimize GPU memory usage and incorporates an Encoder-Decoder pair into a Long Short-term Memory Network. By handling the 3D model as a sequence of 2D slices, LRCN transforms a coarse 3D shape into a more complete and higher resolution volume. While 3D-ED-GAN captures global contextual structure of the 3D shape, LRCN localizes the fine-grained details.

Risk adjustment models are typically estimated using linear regression, which does not fully exploit the information in claims data. Moreover, the development of such linear regression models requires substantial domain expert knowledge and computational effort for data preprocessing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for risk adjustment that uses semantic embeddings to represent patient medical histories. Embeddings efficiently represent medical concepts learned from diagnostic, procedure, and prescription codes in patients' medical histories. This approach substantially reduces the need for feature engineering.

However they are suffering from some problems like local minima, slow convergence rate, and intensive human intervention. In this paper, we propose a rapid learning method, namely, deep convolutional extreme learning machine (DC-ELM), which combines the power of CNN and fast training of ELM. It uses multiple alternate convolution layers and pooling layers to effectively abstract high level features from input images. Then the abstracted features are fed to an ELM classifier, which leads to better generalization performance with faster learning speed. DC-ELM also introduces stochastic pooling in the last hidden layer to reduce dimensionality of features greatly, thus saving much training time and computation resources. We systematically evaluated the performance of DC-ELM on two handwritten digit data sets: MNIST and USPS. Experimental results show that our method achieved better testing accuracy with significantly shorter training time in comparison with deep learning methods and other ELM methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5005768", "pubmed_id": "27610128", "doi": "10.1155/2016/3049632", "venue": "Computational intelligence and neuroscience", "journal": "Computational intelligence and neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2516100594", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["116858", "207321848", "45873946", "24743199", "11023093", "206757279", "11927782", "207178999", "61768184", "11701058", "15146942", "1417306", "6949717", "10084707", "2268192", "8935203", "14369928", "9329224", "11310799", "5379721", "215183334", "8907667", "2167514", "14542261", "508435"], "inbound_citations": ["203605817", "207836672", "195698734", "57513846", "21276198", "198190300", "182491864", "201676097", "198361391", "18995640", "10310042", "16466343", "210695145", "121370951"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14823115"}

According to the items above, fuzzy rules are applied to establish the mapping table to get the factors quantized. Next, the cluster technology is utilized to classify the content in the mapping table, and the similar days are chosen based on the clustering level, which is to reduce the numbers of samples and accelerate the speed of selection. Secondly, aiming to eliminating non-gaussian noise contained in the similar days\u2019 power load, lifting wavelet transform is adopted to extract the low sequence components. Finally a Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), which is optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm, is designed to predict the low-frequency part while mean square weighted method is used to predict the high-frequency part. The simulation results show that this fuzzy clustering similar days method is effective.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-4981-2_21", "venue": "Unifying Electrical Engineering and Electronics Engineering", "journal": "Unifying Electrical Engineering and Electronics Engineering", "mag_id": "2417282", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116099260"}

In this paper, we present a new automatic screening method to assess whether a patient from ambulatory care or emergency should be referred to a cardiology service. This method is based on deep neural networks with pretraining and takes as an input a raw ECG signal without annotation.This work is based on a prospective clinical study that took place at Hospital Clnic in Barcelona between 20112012 and recruited 1390 patients. For each patient, we recorded a 12-lead ECG and the diagnosis was conducted by the cardiology service at the same hospital. Normal, borderline normal and normal variant ECGs were labelled as normal and the rest as abnormal.Our deep neural networks with pretraining were tested through cross-validation with a cohort of 416 test patients. The performance of our model was compared against other standard classification methods such as neural networks without pretraining, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machines, k-Nearest Neighbours and a professional classification algorithm certified for medical use that annotates the raw ECG signals prior to classification.The resulting best classifier was a pretrained neural network with three hidden layers and 700 units in every layer. This network yielded an accuracy of 0.8552, a sensitivity of 0.9176 and a specificity of 0.7827. The best alternative classification method was a Support Vector Machine with a Gaussian kernel, which yielded an accuracy of 0.8476, a sensitivity of 0.9446 and a specificity of 0.7346. The professional classification algorithm yielded an accuracy of 0.8407, a sensitivity of 0.8558 and a specificity of 0.8214.Neural networks with pretraining automatically obtain a representation of the input data without resorting to any annotation and, thus, simplify the process of assessing normality of ECG signals. The results that we have obtained are slightly better than those obtained with the professional classification system and, for some network configurations, they can be considered as exchangeable.Neural networks with pretraining open up a promising line of research for the automatic assessment of ECG signals that may be used in the future in clinical practice.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2016.08.013", "venue": "Appl.

It is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning and computer vision. The performances of existing image clustering methods have close relations with features used for clustering, even if unsupervised coding based methods have improved the performances a lot. To reduce the effect of clustering features, we propose a feature-weak-relevant method for image clustering. The proposed method converts an unsupervised clustering process into an alternative iterative process of unsupervised learning and transfer learning. The clustering process firstly starts up from handcrafted features based image clustering to estimate an initial label for every image, and secondly use a proposed sampling strategy to choose images with reliable labels to feed a transfer-learning model to learn representative features that can be used for next round of unsupervised learning. In this manner, image clustering is iteratively optimized. What's more, the handcrafted features are used to boot up the clustering process, and just have a little effect on the final performance; therefore, the proposed method is feature-weak-relevant.

In specific, shapes of target outlines are represented via Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs), which, in turn, are utilized as recognition features. According to the proposed ATR approach, a segmentation stage first isolates the target region from shadow and ground clutter via a sequence of fast thresholding and morphological operations. Next, a number of EFDs are computed that can sufficiently describe the salient characteristics of the target outline. Finally, a classification stage based on an ensemble of Support Vector Machines identifies the target with the appropriate class label. In order to experimentally illustrate the merit of the proposed approach, SAR intensity images from the well-known Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset were used as 10-class and 3-class recognition problems. Furthermore, comparisons were drawn in terms of classification performance and computational complexity to other successful methods discussed in the literature, such as template matching methods.

However, existing T-SS-AL methods mostly focus on the situation where the source domain and the target domain share the same classes. In this paper, we consider a more practical and challenging setting where the source domain and the target domain have different but related classes. We propose a novel cross-class sample transfer based T-SS-AL method, called CC-SS-AL, to exploit the information from the source domain. Our key idea is to select samples from the source domain which are very similar to the target domain classes and assign pseudo labels to them for classifier training.

For example, on the Piagetian view, a child is born without knowing that objects persist in time even when they are occluded; through a process of learning, the child comes to know that objects persist in time. The trouble with this view has always been the lack of a concrete, computational account of how a learning mechanism could lead to such a change. Recently, however, in a book entitled Rethinking Innateness, Elman et al. (Elman, J.L., Bates, E., Johnson, M.H., Karmiloff-Smith, A., Parisi, D., Plunkett, K., 1996. Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) have claimed that connectionist models might provide an account of the development of new kinds of representations that would not depend on the existence of innate representations. I show that the models described in Rethinking Innateness depend on innately assumed representations and that they do not offer a genuine alternative to nativism. Moreover, I present simulation results which show that these models are incapable of deriving genuine abstract representations that are not presupposed. I then give a formal account of why the models fail to generalize in the ways that humans do. Thus, connectionism, at least in its current form, does not provide any support for constructivism.

In conventional data-driven frameworks which use machine learning or statistical models, structural damage diagnosis models are often constructed using supervised learning. The supervised learning requires historical structural response data and corresponding damage states (i.e., labels) for each building to learn the building-specific damage diagnosis model. However, in post-earthquake scenarios, historical data with labels are often not available for many buildings in the affected area. This makes it difficult to construct a damage diagnosis model. Further, directly using the historical data from other buildings to construct a damage diagnosis model for the target building would lead to inaccurate results. This is because each building has unique physical properties and thus unique data distribution. To this end, we introduce a new framework to transfer the model learned from other buildings to diagnose structural damage states in the target building without any labels. This framework is based on an adversarial domain adaptation approach that extracts domain-invariant feature representations of data from different buildings. The feature extraction function is trained in an adversarial way, which ensures that the extracted feature distributions are robust to changes in structures while being predictive of the damage states. With the extracted domain-invariant feature representations, the data distributions become consistent across different buildings. We evaluate our framework on both numerical simulation and field data collected from multiple building structures, which outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.09513", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Signal Processing", "mag_id": "3008116338", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211258949"}

The work of the chapter basically falls into two parts. In the first of these, the programs considered extend the syntax of conventional logic programs by allowing elements of quite general algebraic structures to be present in clause bodies. Such programs include many-valued logic programs, and semiring-based constraint logic programs. In the second part, the programs considered are bilattice-based annotated logic programs in which body literals are annotated by elements drawn from bilattices. These programs are well-suited to handling uncertainty. Appropriate semantic operators are defined for the programs considered in both parts of the chapter, and it is shown that one may construct artificial neural networks for computing these operators.

However, beyond animals, neither the origin nor the evolutionary patterns of PB1-containing proteins are understood. While PB1 domain proteins have been found in other kingdoms, including plants, it is unclear how these relate to animal PB1 proteins. To address this question, we utilized large transcriptome datasets along with the proteomes of a broad range of species. We discovered eight PB1 domain-containing protein families in plants, along with three each in Protozoa and Chromista and four families in Fungi. Studying the deep evolutionary history of PB1 domains throughout eukaryotes revealed the presence of at least two, but likely three, ancestral PB1 copies in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). These three ancestral copies gave rise to multiple orthologues later in evolution. Tertiary structural models of these plant PB1 families, combined with Random Forest based classification, indicated family-specific differences attributed to the length of PB1 domain and the proportion of \u03b2-sheets. This study identifies novel PB1 families and reveals considerable complexity in the protein oligomerization potential at the origin of eukaryotes.

The accurate identification of the cancerlectins should provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of cancers. In this study, a new computational method based on the RF (Random Forest) algorithm is proposed for further improving the performance of identifying cancerlectins. Hybrid feature space before feature selection is developed by combining different individual feature spaces, CTD (Composition, Transition, and Distribution), PseAAC (Pseudo Amino Acid Composition), PSSM (Position-Specific Scoring Matrix), and disorder. The SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is applied to solve the imbalanced data problem. To reduce feature redundancy and computation complexity, we propose a two-step feature selection process to select informative features. A 5-fold cross-validation technique is used for the evaluation of various prediction strategies. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 0.779, a specificity of 0.717, an accuracy of 0.748, and an MCC (Matthew\u2019s Correlation Coefficient) of 0.497.

For tensile strength, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) achieved by SVR is 0.65% and 0.68% for the training and test set, respectively. At the same time, the MAPE for elongation achieved by SVR is 1.51% and 3.36% for the training and test set, respectively.

Accordingly, the established SVR model was adopted to illustrate the relationships among tensile strength, elongation, and the process parameters. From the 3D surface of tensile strength vs. temperature and strain rate, it is found that to reach a higher tensile strength, a strain rate lower than 0.01s-1 is required, and a lower strain will be helpful for achieving the maximum elongation.

Connectionist models have typically suffered from rather severe problems of inadequate generalization (where generalizations are significantly fewer than training inputs) and interference of newly learned items with previously learned items. Taking a cue from the domains in which human learning dramatically overcomes such problems, we see that indeed connectionist learning can escape these problems in combinatorially structured domains. In the simple combinatorial domain of letter sequences, we find that a basic connectionist learning model trained on 50 6-letter sequences can correctly generalize to about 10,000 novel sequences. We also discover that the model exhibits over 1,000,000 virtual memories:new items which, although not correctly generalized, can be learned in a few presentations while leaving performance on the previously learned items intact.

The model uses an encoder trained to generate latent image representations for a low-quality image, the representations corresponding to blur and noise types present in the image. These representations act as inputs to the constructed conditional GAN. Besides these labels, the generator takes a low-quality image as input and is trained to generate a high-quality image as represented by the target images. The discriminator makes use of a standard OCR score to measure the performance of the generator in order to achieve images that are more OCR-friendly than the given target image. The model uses perceptual losses for training to produce clear images and improve convergence. Improving of image resolution is made by the use of super-resolution by means of sub-pixel convolution.

We have previously introduced a successful supervised pairwise ortholog classification approach implemented in a big data platform that considered several pairwise protein features and the low ortholog pair ratios found between two annotated proteomes (Galpert, D et al., BioMed Research International, 2015). The supervised models were built and tested using a Saccharomycete yeast benchmark dataset proposed by Salichos and Rokas (2011). Despite several pairwise protein features being combined in a supervised big data approach; they all, to some extent were alignment-based features and the proposed algorithms were evaluated on a unique test set. Here, we aim to evaluate the impact of alignment-free features on the performance of supervised models implemented in the Spark big data platform for pairwise ortholog detection in several related yeast proteomes. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The Spark Random Forest and Decision Trees with oversampling and undersampling techniques, and built with only alignment-based similarity measures or combined with several alignment-free pairwise protein features showed the highest classification performance for ortholog detection in three yeast proteome pairs. Although such supervised approaches outperformed traditional methods, there were no significant differences between the exclusive use of alignment-based similarity measures and their combination with alignment-free features, even within the twilight zone of the studied proteomes. Just when alignment-based and alignment-free features were combined in Spark Decision Trees with imbalance management, a higher success rate (98.71%) within the twilight zone could be achieved for a yeast proteome pair that underwent a whole genome duplication. The feature selection study showed that alignment-based features were top-ranked for the best classifiers while the runners-up were alignment-free features related to amino acid composition. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The incorporation of alignment-free features in supervised big data models did not significantly improve ortholog detection in yeast proteomes regarding the classification qualities achieved with just alignment-based similarity measures. However, the similarity of their classification performance to that of traditional ortholog detection methods encourages the evaluation of other alignment-free protein pair descriptors in future research.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5934817", "pubmed_id": "29724166", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-018-2148-8", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2806747943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9188816", "6341869", "28680952", "8530119", "11548376", "15816353", "24129450", "11394824", "1781869", "16706434", "5067583", "13970807", "28551738", "2488213", "15114926", "215694821", "9947801", "16573658", "15773221", "9704467", "4396412", "2617359", "3196617", "207166250", "215218561", "18322713", "11253146", "7211907", "9434714", "11746682", "12382724", "10853596", "36866077", "3639671", "1591646", "16863133", "24030267", "24852628", "36083833", "84473933", "19022510", "32969637", "7956687", "140109802", "9749522", "3309638", "13391175", "12895042"], "inbound_citations": ["209489800"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13672927"}

In this paper, we investigate the effects of the word class-based features for the exponential family of models specifically focusing on NLU tasks, and demonstrate that the performance improvements could be attributed to the regularization effect of the class-based features on the underlying model. Our hypothesis is based on empirical observation that shrinking the sum of parameter magnitudes in an exponential model tends to improve performance. We show on several semantic tagging tasks that there is a positive correlation between the model size reduction by the addition of the class-based features and the model performance on a held-out dataset. We also demonstrate that class-based features extracted from different data sources using alternate word clustering methods can individually contribute to the performance gain. Since the proposed features are generated in an unsupervised manner without significant computational overhead, the improvements in performance largely come for free and we show that such features provide gains for a wide range of tasks from semantic classification and slot tagging in NLU to named entity recognition (NER).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TASLP.2015.2511925", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "journal": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2342877923", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["955162", "277918", "9619028", "10599329", "10986188", "2809637", "237020", "982", "6798823", "10576878", "17342979", "23304588", "11553281", "9152760", "16447573", "60003789", "2852525", "16408169", "7138354", "33517925", "13539250", "18764978", "372093", "15548439", "803811", "891605", "1916754", "629094", "7803700", "15819333", "577005", "5628616", "14723701", "17740574", "9769108", "351666", "3116311", "1528374"], "inbound_citations": ["1399655", "198146779", "14461068", "39130572", "49654810"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16725442"}

Two different supervised trained ANN classifiers were applied, on one hand, the well-established borderline-learning Multiple-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and on the other hand, the prototype-based Supervised Relevance Neural Gas (SRNG).

Cognitivists tend to conceive of the mind as a set of distinct specialized modules and they believe that this rich modularity is basically innate. Cognitivist modules are theoretical entities which are postulated in \u201cboxes-and-arrows\u201d models used to explain behavioral data. On the other hand, connectionists tend to think that the mind is a more homogeneous system that basically genetically inherits only a general capacity to learn from experience and that if there are modules they are the result of development and learning rather than being innate. In this chapter we argue for a form of connectionism which is not anti-modularist or antiinnatist. Connectionist modules are anatomically separated and/or functionally specialized parts of a neural network and they may be the result of a process of evolution in a population of neural networks. The new approach, Evolutionary Connectionism, does not only allow us to simulate how genetically inherited information can spontaneously emerge in populations of neural networks, instead of being arbitrarily hardwired in the neural networks by the researcher, but it makes it possible to explore all sorts of interactions between evolution at the population level and learning at the level of the individual that determine the actual phenotype. Evolutionary Connectionism shares the main goal of Evolutionary Psychology, that is, to develop a psychology informed by the importance of evolutionary process in shaping the inherited architecture of human mind, but differs from Evolutionary Psychology for three main reasons: (1) it uses neural networks rather than cognitive models for interpreting human behavior; (2) it adopts computer simulations for testing evolutionary scenarios; (3) it has a less pan-adaptivistic view of evolution and it is more interested in the rich interplay between genetically inherited and experiential information. We present two examples of evolutionary connectionist simulations that show how modular architectures can emerge in evolving populations of neural networks.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7551/mitpress/4734.003.0021", "venue": "MODULARITY.

However, it is difficult to obtain accurate prediction models, in particular for a newly adopted equipment set, if the number of wafer records for the target equipment set are insufficient. While collecting more records is time-consuming and costly, the abundant data of related equipment sets are fruitful sources to improve VM modeling for an equipment set. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of a transfer learning approach based on neural networks to circumvent data insufficiency.

Functional and clinical data were collected after admission to the rehabilitation unit. Biochemical and hematological parameters were obtained from peripheral venous blood samples on all individuals who participated in the study within 24hours from the admission at the rehabilitative treatment. Data regarding the health status were collected at the end of rehabilitative treatment. First, a feature selection has been performed to estimate the mutual dependence between input and output variables. More specifically, the so called Mutual Information criterion has been exploited. In the second stage of the analysis, the Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a non-probabilistic binary machine learning algorithm widely used for classification and regression, has been used to predict the output of the rehabilitation process. Performances of the linear SVM regression algorithm have been evaluated considering a different number of input features (ranging from 4 to 14). The performance evaluation of the model proposed has been investigated in terms of correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Deviation Percentage (MADP). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Results on the test samples show a good correlation between all the predicted and measured outputs (i.e. T1 Barthel Index (BI), T1 Motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM), T1 Cognitive FIM and T1 Total FIM) ranging from 0.75 to 0.81. While the MADP is high (i.e., 83.96%) for T1 BI, the other predicted responses (i.e., T1 Motor FIM, T1 Cognitive FIM, T1 Total FIM) disclose a smaller MADP of 30%. Accordingly, the RMSE ranges from 4.28 for T1 Cognitive FIM to 22.6 for T1 BI. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: In conclusion, the authors developed a new predictive model using SVM regression starting from common inflammatory biomarkers and other ratio markers. The main efforts of our model have been accomplished in regard to the evidence that the type of stroke has not shown itself to be a critical input variable to predict the discharge data, furthermore, among the four selected indicators, Barthel at T1 is the less predictable (MADP > 80%), while it is possible to predict T1 Cognitive FIM with an MADP less than 18%.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30077601", "doi": "10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2018.06.021", "venue": "Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "journal": "Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association", "mag_id": "2886527610", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51923608"}

In vitro assays were subsequently performed for four of the compounds obtained as hits in this in silico screening, to determine their inhibitory activity against human recombinant AR. The two compounds having the highest RF scores (prunetin and ononin) were shown to have the highest activities experimentally (giving \u223c58% and \u223c52% inhibition at a concentration of 15\u03bcM, respectively), while the compounds with lowest RF scores (vanillic acid and cinnamic acid) showed the lowest activities experimentally (giving \u223c29% and \u223c44% inhibition at a concentration of 15\u03bcM, respectively). These simple virtual screening studies were thus helpful in identifying novel inhibitors of AR, but yielded compounds with only very modest (micromolar) potency.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22261024", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2011.12.033", "venue": "Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "journal": "Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "mag_id": "2074033665", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["456840", "10847319", "13768439"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22323125"}

However, only recently has the concept of beauty been scientifically analyzed. This has mostly been due to extensive research done in the area of face recognition and image processing on identification and classification of human features as contributing to facial beauty. Current research aims at precisely and conclusively understanding how humans classify a given individual's face as beautiful. Due to the lack of published theoretical standards and ground truths for human facial beauty, this is often an ambiguous process. Current methods of analysis and classification of human facial beauty rely mainly on the geometric aspects of human facial beauty. The classifiers used in current research include the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, ridge regression, and basic principal component analysis. ::: ::: In this research, various approaches related to the comprehension and analysis of human beauty are presented and the use of these theories is outlined. Each set of theories is translated into a feature model that is tested for classification. Selecting the best set of features that result in the most accurate model for the representation of the human face is a key challenge. This research introduces the combined use of three main groups of features for classification of female facial beauty, to be used with classification through support vector machines. The classifier utilized is Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the accuracy obtained through this classifier is 86%. Current research in the field has produced algorithms with percentages of accuracy that are in the range of 75-85%. The approach used is one of analysis of the central tenets of beauty, the successive application of image processing techniques, and finally the usage of relevant machine learning methods to build an effective system for the automatic assessment of facial beauty. The ground truths used for verifying results are derived from ratings extracted from surveys conducted. ::: ::: ::: The proposed methodology involves a novel algorithm for the representation of facial beauty, which combines the use of geometric, textural, and shape based features for the analysis of facial beauty. This algorithm initially develops an overall landmark model of the entire human face. A significant advantage of this methodology is the accurate model of the human face which synthesizes the geometric, textural and shape-related aspects of the face. The landmark model is then used for extracting critical characteristics which are then used in a feature vector for training using machine learning. The features extracted help to represent facial characteristics in three major areas. Geometric features help to represent the symmetrical properties and ratio-based properties of landmarks on the face. Textural features extracted help capture information related to skin texture and composition. Finally, face shape and outline features help to categorize the overall shape of a given face, which helps to represent the given female face shape and outline for further analysis of any deviations from the basic face shapes. These features are then used in a classifier to appropriately categorize each image. The database used for the source of images contains images of female subjects from a variety of backgrounds and levels of attractiveness.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2787165632", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67311073"}

Moreover, the inspection takes much time when applied to medical examination in schools. To overcome these difficulties, a moire method has been proposed which takes moire topographic images of human subject backs and checks symmetry/asymmetry of the moire patterns in a twodimensional way on visual screening. In this paper, we propose a new technique for automatic detection of spinal deformity from moire topographic images.

Regions of interest are then automatically selected on the moire image from its upper part to the lower part. Numerical representation of the degree of asymmetry is therefore useful in evaluating the deformity.

To extend pGBM to detect pure epistasis well on unbalanced dataset, average AUC difference value is chosen as the metric that quantifies the SNP interactions intensity. The experiment results demonstrate that our method has a high success rate with both balanced/unbalanced simulation and real dataset.

We compared the results from models at intermediate (20 m 2 ) and fine (5 m 2 ) resolutions in five test areas where acoustic multibeam echosounder and backscatter data were available. The inclusion of backscatter variables did not substantially improve model accuracy. The intermediate-resolution model performed well with an accuracy of 75%, except in very steep habitats such as coastal inlets; it was used to estimate the total habitat area and the percent of rocky habitat in 144 RCAs in southern BC. We also compared the amount of habitat estimated by our 20 m 2 model to the 100 m 2 management model used to designate the RCAs and found that a slightly lower proportion of habitat (18% vs 20%) but a considerably smaller area (400 km 2 vs 1370 km 2 ) is protected in the RCAs, likely as a result of the poor resolution of the original model.

By leveraging the flexibility and high degree parallelism offered by reconfigurable fabrics, we propose a Run-Time Reconfiguration(RTR) framework to accelerate the on-line training of LS-SVM. To realize maximum computational parallelism, we divide the training process into two parts, the kernel matrix formulation and the least-square problem solving.

In the kernel matrix formulation part, we design a piecewise linear interpolation method to realize the radial basis function.

Automatic keyword extraction is an important research direction in text mining, natural language processing and information retrieval. Keyword extraction enables us to represent text documents in a condensed way. The compact representation of documents can be helpful in several applications, such as automatic indexing, automatic summarization, automatic classification, clustering and filtering. For instance, text classification is a domain with high dimensional feature space challenge. Hence, extracting the most important/relevant words about the content of the document and using these keywords as the features can be extremely useful. In this regard, this study examines the predictive performance of five statistical keyword extraction methods (most frequent measure based keyword extraction, term frequency-inverse sentence frequency based keyword extraction, co-occurrence statistical information based keyword extraction, eccentricity-based keyword extraction and TextRank algorithm) on classification algorithms and ensemble methods for scientific text document classification (categorization). In the study, a comprehensive study of comparing base learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression and Random Forest) with five widely utilized ensemble methods (AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, Random Subspace and Majority Voting) is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical analysis, which evaluates the effectiveness of statistical keyword extraction methods in conjunction with ensemble learning algorithms. The classification schemes are compared in terms of classification accuracy, F-measure and area under curve values. To validate the empirical analysis, two-way ANOVA test is employed. The experimental analysis indicates that Bagging ensemble of Random Forest with the most-frequent based keyword extraction method yields promising results for text classification. For ACM document collection, the highest average predictive performance (93.80%) is obtained with the utilization of the most frequent based keyword extraction method with Bagging ensemble of Random Forest algorithm. In general, Bagging and Random Subspace ensembles of Random Forest yield promising results.

Researchers have proposed some solutions for cloud security. Virtual Machine (VM)-level solutions are configured and controlled at VM. They are less robust and can be easily subverted by attackers. In this paper, we propose an out-VM monitoring security approach named as Malicious Network Packet Detection (MNPD) which monitors the VMs from outside at both network and virtualization layer in cloud environment. MNPD performs the behavioral analysis of network traffic at Cloud Networking Server (CNS); providing primary defense from intrusions at network level. MNPD does the VM traffic validation at hypervisor of Cloud Compute Server (CCoS) to detect spoofing attacks, originated from VMs. The non-spoofed packets are further analyzed using behavior analysis of network traffic to detect any abnormality in the virtual traffic; providing second level of defense from intrusions at virtualization level. MNPD employs statistical learning technique (Random Forest) with ensemble of feature selection approach to learn the behavior of traffic patterns.

In such scenarios, the detection of change (or drift) in the concept being learned is important to ensure that correct, timely and relevant models are constructed. In addition, such data is often imbalanced and, to further complicate the issue, we are frequently interested in learning the minority class. It follows that ignoring these two aspects during learning may lead to unreliable, or even incorrect, models being built. In this research we discuss the interplay between concept drift detection and imbalanced data sets in order to ensure reliable results. We introduce a novel algorithm that, rather than considering a single performance evaluation measure such as accuracy for change detection, considers all the components of a confusion matrix and employs the cosine similarity coefficient. We evaluate our algorithm against a real world mobile phone database, as well as benchmarking datasets, and we compare it with two other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our approach is particularly sensitive to concept drifts occurring in imbalanced data sets. Our evaluation indicates that our algorithm is able to detect concept drift reliably.

We describe a fast multiscale procedure for repeatedly compressing, or homogenizing, Markov decision processes (MDPs), wherein a hierarchy of sub-problems at different scales is automatically determined. Coarsened MDPs are themselves independent, deterministic MDPs, and may be solved using existing algorithms. The multiscale representation delivered by this procedure decouples sub-tasks from each other and can lead to substantial improvements in convergence rates both locally within sub-problems and globally across sub-problems, yielding significant computational savings. A second fundamental aspect of this work is that these multiscale decompositions yield new transfer opportunities across different problems, where solutions of sub-tasks at different levels of the hierarchy may be amenable to transfer to new problems. Localized transfer of policies and potential operators at arbitrary scales is emphasized.

This paper aims to develop a model with good accuracy for predicting subjective HIV infection status using the random forest approach. A total of 12,796 responses of Malawians over a 12-year period were assessed. Fourteen risk factors including behavioral, health, and sociodemographic information were analysed as potential predictors of subjective Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection status in the general population and thirteen behavioral, health, and sociodemographic information were analysed among males and females. The random forest approach was adopted to build a comprehensive model comprising 14 risk factors in Malawi. It was revealed that age, worries about infection, and health rate were the most significant predictors as compared to use of condoms, marital status, and education which were the least important predictors of subjective Human Immunodeficiency Virus status in Malawi. However, the importance of infidelity on the part of a spouse and marital status as predictors of subjective Human Immunodeficiency Virus status alternated among males and females. The importance of infidelity and marital status was relatively high among females than among males.

Experimental identification of glycosylation sites is expensive and laborious. Hence, there is significant interest in the development of computational methods for reliable prediction of glycosylation sites from amino acid sequences.ResultsWe explore machine learning methods for training classifiers to predict the amino acid residues that are likely to be glycosylated using information derived from the target amino acid residue and its sequence neighbors. We compare the performance of Support Vector Machine classifiers and ensembles of Support Vector Machine classifiers trained on a dataset of experimentally determined N-linked, O-linked, and C-linked glycosylation sites extracted from O-GlycBase version 6.00, a database of 242 proteins from several different species. The results of our experiments show that the ensembles of Support Vector Machine classifiers outperform single Support Vector Machine classifiers on the problem of predicting glycosylation sites in terms of a range of standard measures for comparing the performance of classifiers.

This is because these techniques analyse call pattern by a single feature e.g. call frequency or average call duration. In this paper, we propose a multi-feature call pattern analysis with unsupervised Random Forests classifier, which is one of the excellent classification algorithms. We also propose two simple but helpful features for better classification. We show the effectiveness of Random Forests based classification without supervised training data and which features contribute to classification.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICC.2013.6654830", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2002599059", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11454016", "2162068", "89141", "118238414", "1766202", "21432660", "245216", "13252401", "10445065", "1364481", "3093707"], "inbound_citations": ["140122479", "18118934", "2043545", "14123534", "2379409", "34709862", "52965980"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27176468"}

Adequate knowledge about this relationship can potentially improve accuracy for local protein structure prediction. One of approaches for protein local structure prediction uses the conventional clustering algorithms to capture the sequence-to-structure relationship. The cluster membership function defined by conventional clustering algorithms may not reveal the complex nonlinear relationship adequately. Compared with the conventional clustering algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) can capture the nonlinear sequence-to-structure relationship by mapping the input space into another higher dimensional feature space. However, SVM is not favorable for huge datasets including millions of samples. Therefore, we propose a novel computational model called Clustering Support Vector Machines (CSVMs). Taking advantage of both theory of granular computing and advanced statistical learning methodology, CSVMs are built specifically for each information granule partitioned intelligently by the clustering algorithm. This feature makes learning tasks for each CSVM more specific and simpler. CSVMs modeled for each granule can be easily parallelized so that CSVMs can be used to handle complex classification problems for huge datasets. Average accuracy for CSVMs is over 80%, which indicates that the generalization power for CSVMs is strong enough to recognize the complicated pattern of sequence-to-structure relationships. Compared with the conventional clustering algorithm, our experimental results show that accuracy for local structure prediction has been improved noticeably when CSVMs are applied.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2005.12.011", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Using 9 terrestrial biosphere models (Support Vector Machine-based regressions, TOPS, CASA, VISIT, Biome-BGC, DAYCENT, SEIB, LPJ, and TRIFFID), we conducted two simulations: (1) point simulations at four flux sites in Japan and (2) spatial simulations for Japan with a 10 default model (based on original settings) and an improved model (based on calibration using flux observations). Generally, models using default model settings showed large deviations in model outputs from observation with large model-by-model variability. However, after we calibrated the model parameters using flux observations (GPP, RE and NEP), most models successfully simulated seasonal variations in the carbon 15 cycle, with less variability among models. We also found that interannual variations in the carbon cycle are mostly consistent among models and observations. Spatial analysis also showed a large reduction in the variability among model outputs, and model calibration using flux observations significantly improved the model outputs. These results show that to reduce uncertainties among terrestrial biosphere models, we need 20 to conduct careful validation and calibration with available flux observations.

In object recognition, semi-supervised learning, which incorporates a large amount of unsupervised training data (unlabeled data) along with a small amount of supervised data (labeled data), is regarded as an effective tool to reduce the burden of manual annotation. However, some unlabeled data in semi-supervised models contain outliers that negatively affect the parameter estimation during the training stage. Such outliers often cause an over-fitting problem especially when a small amount of training data is used. Furthermore, another problem that occurs when using the conventional methods is that when labeling an image based on super-pixel representation, the lack of discrimination of the image features and the scale variance of the objects decreases the recognition accuracy because the feature extraction is based on the mono-scale segmentation. In this paper, we propose an object recognition method for solving both problems.

Our approach is to apply a fast novel centroid-based algorithm, the Class-Feature-Centroid Classifier (CFC), to perform efficient cross-domain classification. Experiments showed that this algorithm achieves a comparable accuracy than k-NN and is slightly better than Support Vector Machines (SVM), yet at linear time cost for training and classification. The benefit of this approach is that the linear time complexity enables us to efficiently generate an accurate classifier, reflecting the topic drift, several times per day on a huge dataset.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICITST.2009.5402559", "venue": "2009 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, (ICITST)", "journal": "2009 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, (ICITST)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2125536261", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15353445", "61894598", "11011583", "11683846", "16588134", "14730491", "17133587", "6340813", "17369929", "44971656", "7138354", "56563878", "120349231", "1965284"], "inbound_citations": ["54772409"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6681415"}

The LR, SVM and RF models built in this paper are quite effective and provide a theoretical base for prevention and reduction of debris flow. Additionally, 41 mud sensors data distributed in this region were collected, based on which the debris flow probability of these area were obtained by LR model to explore the effect of mud on debris flow.

Finally, an online autofeedback semiactive control strategy is developed by resorting to SVM and then used for designing MR dampers.

We design a novel stereoscopic saliency detection algorithm by machine learning technique. First, the features of luminance, color and texture are extracted to calculate the feature contract for predicting feature maps of stereoscopic images. Furthermore, the depth features are extracted for depth feature map computation. Sematic features including the center-bias factor and other top-down cues are also applied as the features in the proposed stereoscopic saliency detection method. Support Vector Regression (SVR) is applied to learn the saliency detection model of stereoscopic images.

Many sentimental analysis frameworks with state of the art results have been proposed in the literature. However, many of these frameworks have low accuracy on the textual data corpus contains emoticons and special texts. In addition, many of these frameworks are also energy and computation intensive with which puts limitation in their real time deployment. In this paper, we aim to address these issues by proposing a novel sentimental analysis framework based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed framework uses a novel technique to tokenize the text documents, wherein stop words, special characters, emoticons present in the text documents are eliminated.

Point cloud segmentation is a crucial step in scene understanding and interpretation. The goal is to decompose the initial data into sets of workable clusters with similar properties. Additionally, it is a key aspect in the automated procedure from point cloud data to BIM. Current approaches typically only segment a single type of primitive such as planes or cylinders. Also, current algorithms suffer from oversegmenting the data and are often sensor or scene dependent. In this work, a method is presented to automatically segment large unstructured point clouds of buildings. More specifically, the segmentation is formulated as a graph optimisation problem. First, the data is oversegmented with a greedy octree-based region growing method. The growing is conditioned on the segmentation of planes as well as smooth surfaces. Next, the candidate clusters are represented by a Conditional Random Field after which the most likely configuration of candidate clusters is computed given a set of local and contextual features. The experiments prove that the used method is a fast and reliable framework for unstructured point cloud segmentation. Processing speeds up to 40,000 points per second are recorded for the region growing. Additionally, the recall and precision of the graph clustering is approximately 80%. Overall, nearly 22% of oversegmentation is reduced by clustering the data. These clusters will be classified and used as a basis for the reconstruction of BIM models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W8-25-2017", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2770292730", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4724154", "6518359", "945694", "17236445", "7132597", "31320394", "18007363", "206522602", "61592504", "342976", "121501608", "55759243", "125604645", "16567107", "205295600", "6291032"], "inbound_citations": ["174819555"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54804015"}

Increase use and waste water withdrawal of surface water causes drastic changes in surface water quality. Water quality, importance as the most vulnerable and important water supply resources is absolutely clear. Unfortunately, in the recent years because of city population increase, economical improvement, and industrial product increase, entry of pollutants to water bodies has been increased. According to that water quality parameters express physical, chemical, and biological water features. So the importance of water quality monitoring is necessary more than before. Each of various uses of water, such as agriculture, drinking, industry, and aquaculture needs the water with a special quality. In the other hand, the exact estimation of concentration of water quality parameter is significant. ::: Material and Methods: In this research, first two input variable models as selection methods (namely, correlation coefficient and principal component analysis) were applied to select the model inputs. Data processing is consisting of three steps, (1) data considering, (2) identification of input data which have efficient on output data, and (3) selecting the training and testing data. Genetic Algorithm-Least Square Support Vector Regression (GA-LSSVR) algorithm were developed to model the water quality parameters. In the LSSVR method is assumed that the relationship between input and output variables is nonlinear, but by using a nonlinear mapping relation can create a space which is named feature space in which relationship between input and output variables is defined linear. The developed algorithm is able to gain maximize the accuracy of the LSSVR method with auto LSSVR parameters. Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of evolutionary algorithm which automatically can find the optimum coefficient of Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR). The GA-LSSVR algorithm was employed to model water quality parameters such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, So42-, Cl-, pH, Electric conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in the Sefidrood River. For comparison the selected input variable methods coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliff (NS) are applied. ::: Results and Discussion: According to Table 5, the results of the GA-LSSVR algorithm by using correlation coefficient and PCA methods approximately show similar results. About pH, EC, and TDS quality parameters, the results of PCA method have, the more accuracy, but the difference of RMSE between the PCA method and correlation coefficient method is not significant. The PCA method cause improvement in NS values to 22 and 0.1 percentages in pH and TDS water quality parameters to the correlation coefficient method, respectively,and NS criteria value for EC water quality parameter did not change in both methods. As a result, according to positive values of NS criteria in both PCA and correlation methods, it is clear that GA-LSSVR has a high ability for modeling of water quality parameters. Because of summation of NS criteria for PCA method is 5.53 and for correlation coefficient is 5.62, we can say that the correlation coefficient method has more applicable as a data processing method, but both methods have a high ability. Orouji et all. (18) used assumed models to model Na+, K+, Mg2+, So42- , Cl- , pH, EC, and TDS by Genetic programming (GP) method. The RMSE criteria of the better models for testing data are 2.1, 0.02, 0.85, 0.93, 2.18, 0.33, 404.15, and 246.15, respectively. For comparison the orouji et al. (18) and table (5), the Results show using the correlation coefficient method as a data processing method can improve the results to 5.5 times. The results indicate the superiority of developingalgorithm increases the modeling accuracy. It is worth mentioning that according to NS criteria both selected inputs variable methods (correlation coefficient and PCA) are capable to model the water quality parameters. Also the result shows that using correlation coefficient method lead to more accurate results than PCA. ::: Conclusion: In this study, GA algorithm as one of the most applicable optimization algorithms in the different sciences was used to optimize the LSSVR coefficients and Then GA-LSSVR was developed to model the water quality parameters. To comparison data processing methods (correlation coefficient and PCA methods), the input variables of both methods were determined and GA-LSSVR was performed for each of the input variables. To compare the results of the PCA and correlation coefficient methods, some statistics were used. It is worth mentioning that according to NS criteria both input selection methods are capable to model water quality parameters.

This paper presents a scheme for feature extraction that can be applied for classification of corals in submarine coral reef images. In coral reef image classification, texture features are extracted using the proposed Improved Local Derivative Pattern (ILDP). ILDP determines diagonal directional pattern features based on local derivative variations which can capture full information. For classification, three classifiers, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) with four distance metrices, namely Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Canberra distance and Chi-Square distance, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with three kernel functions, namely Polynomial, Radial basis function, Sigmoid kernel are used.

To this aim, in this paper we propose a strategy based on ensemble learning in order to tackle the short-term load forecasting problem. In particular, our approach is based on a stacking ensemble learning scheme, where the predictions produced by three base learning methods are used by a top level method in order to produce final predictions. We tested the proposed scheme on a dataset reporting the energy consumption in Spain over more than nine years. The obtained experimental results show that an approach for short-term electricity consumption forecasting based on ensemble learning can help in combining predictions produced by weaker learning methods in order to obtain superior results. In particular, the system produces a lower error with respect to the existing state-of-the art techniques used on the same dataset.

Learning involves the interaction of information provided by instruction with existing information already in the learner's memory (Ausubel, 1968; Bruner, 1990). When a learner commits to a lesson response, that response reflects the learner's immediate understanding of that instructional instance, thus initial lesson response (ILR) provides a measure of a learner's existing information. Describing what happens to memory traces of ILRs that are errors is necessary for determining whether errors interfere with attaining correct responses, and so is one key to understanding how feedback works. Among a number of connectionist learning rules, the delta rule (Shanks, 1995; Widrow & Hoff, 1960) is one of the simplest and most common that includes the effects of feedback on learning. Clariana (1999) has suggested that a connectionist approach using the delta rule can be used to predict posttest memory activation levels of ILR errors and of correct responses for immediate and delayed feedback. This experimental investigation provides empirical support for the potential of a connectionist approach to predict instructional feedback effects. Posttest data from high school students is compared to values predicted by the delta rule. Results and implications are provided. (Contains 27 references.)

The robot can move the inspected parts into the corresponding boxes, which are divided into 5 groups and those are \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cBridging,\u201d \u201cMissing,\u201d \u201cBurn,\u201d and \u201cNo connection.\u201d A general image processing technique, blob analysis, in conjunction with neurofuzzy c-means (NFC) clustering with branch and bound (BNB) technique to find the best structure in all possible candidates was proposed to increase the performance of the entire robotics system. The results from two clustering techniques which are K-means, Kohonen network, and neurofuzzy c-means were investigated to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Training results from the 30x microscope inspection with 300 samples show that the best accuracy for clustering is 99.67% achieved from the NFC clustering with the following features: area, moment of inertia, and perimeter, and the testing results show 92.21% accuracy for the conventional Kohonen network. The results exhibit the improvement on the clustering when the neural network was applied. This application is one of the progresses in neurorobotics in industrial applications.

Episodic regeneration failure (\u201cdie-off\u201d) has been observed in cheatgrass monocultures and can have negative ecosystem consequences, but can also provide an opportunity for restoration of native species and ecological function within the imperiled sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Proximate causes of cheatgrass die-off are uncertain, although several taxa of fungal soil pathogens have been implicated. Die-off occurrence is stochastic and can occur in remote areas. Thus, developing remote sensing indicators that are repeatable over long time periods, across extensive regions, and at relatively fine spatial resolution would be beneficial for accurately pinpointing events. We developed a remote sensing approach for mapping historical die-off from the Landsat archive (1985\u20132015), and used this to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of die-off occurrence annually at 30-m resolution. A Random Forests classification of image-derived spectral endmembers, trained on 2014 data, predicted die-off with 93% accuracy (\u03ba = 0.845) when applied to independent validation data from 2009. Die-off extent varied greatly across years, though some areas experienced die-off multiple times during the observation period. We found a strong correspondence between die-off occurrence and winter drought conditions, with strongest negative associations with current-year winter precipitation and previous years\u2019 lagged winter and annual precipitation. Die-off duration was heavily skewed towards single-year die-off (81.5% of events), even in localized areas of more frequent occurrence (\u2018die-off hotspots\u2019). Our retrospective classification of the Landsat archive suggests that cheatgrass die-off occurrence is predictable as the intersection of particular site environmental conditions with annual weather conditions, possibly because they are favorable for disease expression. Associations with previous year conditions suggest that die-off may also depend upon feedbacks between cheatgrass dominance and litter production, suitable sites for seedling establishment, and abundance and persistence of pathogen inoculum. Remote sensing indicators such as those developed in this study are needed to develop hypotheses about die-off causal factors, as well as support improved management of cheatgrass, mitigation for negative consequences associated with die-off (e.g. wind erosion), and successful restoration of native plant communities on die-off areas.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.024", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Indicators", "mag_id": "2616048565", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215090292", "91086117", "91103317", "208224194", "197573866", "55474688", "3733039", "90242873"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90229188"}

First, we combine ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling and implicit generative models by learning a hierarchical and interpretable sampling process. A key component of our method is that we train a posterior inference network for the hidden variables. Second, instead of using only state-of-the-art Wasserstein GAN objective, we propose a sandwiching objective, which results in a tighter Wasserstein distance estimate than the commonly used dual form. Thereby, PC-GAN defines a generic framework that can incorporate many existing GAN algorithms. We validate our claims on ModelNet40 benchmark dataset. Using the distance between generated point clouds and true meshes as metric, we find that PC-GAN trained by the sandwiching objective achieves better results on test data than the existing methods. Moreover, as a byproduct, PC- GAN learns versatile latent representations of point clouds, which can achieve competitive performance with other unsupervised learning algorithms on object recognition task.

To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end GAN-based unsupervised VC model applied to impaired speech. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms CycleGAN.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1810.12656", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21437/interspeech.2019-1265", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2898786057,2972689158", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["16280779", "16485263", "2914563", "61486085", "49526471", "11578451", "3271495", "13947808", "8318986", "2250964", "2866787", "11161146", "2697097", "1346276", "3416173", "4717935", "980236", "206771128", "2019311", "16516553", "3366315", "5273326", "6200260", "206770979", "26516599"], "inbound_citations": ["212633493", "119304586"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53114789"}

Since these diseases may become fatal, their early diagnosis is important. In this paper, a classification system for the diagnosis of Primary and Secondary Polycythemia is proposed. The proposed system classifies input data into three classes; Healthy, Primary Polycythemic (PP) and Secondary Polycythemic (SP) and is implemented using two separate binary classification levels. The first level performs the Healthy/non-Healthy classification and the second level the PP/SP classification. To this end, a novel wrapper feature selection algorithm, called the LM-FM algorithm, is presented in order to maximize the classifier's performance. The algorithm is comprised of two stages that are applied sequentially: the Local Maximization (LM) stage and the Floating Maximization (FM) stage. The LM stage finds the best possible subset of a fixed predefined size, which is then used as an input for the next stage. The FM stage uses a floating size technique to search for an even better solution by varying the initially provided subset size. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for the discrimination of the data at each classification level. The proposed classification system is compared with various well-established feature selection techniques such as the Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) and the Maximum Output Information (MOI) wrapper schemes, and with standalone classification techniques such as the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and SVM classifier. The proposed LM-FM feature selection algorithm combined with the SVM classifier increases the overall performance of the classification system, scoring up to 98.9% overall accuracy at the first classification level and up to 96.6% at the second classification level.

The Random Forests (RF) algorithm, which is a machine learning method, has recently been applied to data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity, and so it is instructive to further study its efficacy in this particular field. This case study, carried out using data from Abra (Philippines), examines (a) if RF modeling can be used for data-driven modeling of mineral prospectivity in areas with a few (i.e., <20) mineral occurrences and (b) if RF modeling can handle evidential data with missing values. We found that RF modeling outperforms weights-of-evidence (WofE) modeling of porphyry-Cu prospectivity in the Abra area, where 12 porphyry-Cu prospects are known to exist. Moreover, just like WofE modeling, RF modeling allows analysis of the spatial associations of known prospects with individual layers of evidential data. Furthermore, RF modeling can handle missing values in evidential data through an RF-based imputation technique whereas in WofE modeling values are simply represented by zero weights. Therefore, the RF algorithm is potentially more useful than existing methods that are currently used for data-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. In particular, it is not a purely black-box method like artificial neural networks in the context of data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity. However, further testing of the method in other areas with a few mineral occurrences is needed to fully investigate its usefulness in data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity.

Accurate wind power forecasting can make an enormous contribution to the alleviation of the negative impacts on the power system. This study proposes a hybrid wind power generation forecasting model to enhance prediction performance. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was applied to decompose the original wind power generation series into different sub-series with various frequencies. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the number of inputs without lowering the forecasting accuracy through identifying the variables deemed as significant that maintain most of the comprehensive variability present in the data set.

Here, we developed a novel approach to delineate allosteric effects in proteins. In this approach, we applied robust machine learning methods, including Deep Neural Network and Random Forest, on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to distinguish otherwise similar allosteric states of proteins. Using PDZ3 domain of PDS-95 as a model protein, we demonstrated that the allosteric effects could be represented as residue-specific properties through two-dimensional property-residue maps, which we refer as \u201cresidue perturbation maps\u201d. These maps were constructed through two machine learning methods and could accurately describe how different properties of various residues are affected upon allosteric perturbation on protein. Based on the \u201cresidue perturbation maps\u201d, we propose allostery as a residue-specific concept, suggesting all residues could be considered as allosteric residues because each residue \u201csenses\u201d the allosteric events through perturbation of its one or multiple attributes in a quantitatively unique way. The \u201cresidue perturbation maps\u201d could be used to fingerprint a protein based on the unique patterns of residue perturbations upon binding events, providing a novel way to systematically describe the protein allosteric effects of each residue upon perturbation. Author Summary Allostery is protein regulation at distance. A perturbation at one site of the protein could distantly affect another site. The residues involved in these sites are considered as allosteric residues. The allostery concept has been widely used to understand protein mechanisms and to design allosteric drugs. It is long believed only a small number of residues are allosteric residues. Here, we argue that all residues in a protein are allosteric residues. Upon the perturbation of the allosteric events, the different properties of each residue are affected at the distinct extend. We used hybrid models including molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning components to reveal that not only many properties of residues are affected upon ligand binding, but also each residue is affected through perturbation of its various properties, which makes the residue distinguishable from other residues. According to our findings in a model protein, we defined a \u201cresidue perturbation map\u201d as a two-dimensional map that fingerprint a protein based on the extent of perturbation in different properties of all its residues in a quantitative fashion. This \u201cresidue perturbation map\u201d provides a novel way to systematically describe the protein allosteric effects of each residue upon perturbation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/355370", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2810739176", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["3610740", "102495839", "20285401", "41924983", "14225357", "21939754", "26108392", "17990249", "19080229", "11784410", "7677365", "6307472", "17136049", "6620238", "4324647", "18968546", "16880471", "44551866", "1152351", "14078432", "29300500", "10659969"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90257427"}

However, photovoltaic energy is volatile in nature because it depends on weather conditions, which makes the integration, control and exploitation of this type of energy difficult for grid operators. In the traditional grid architecture, system operators have accumulated enough experience that enables them to determine how much operating reserves are required to maintain system reliability based on statistical tools. Still, with the introduction of renewable energy (wind and photovoltaic), the grid structure has changed, and to maintain grid stability, it is becoming fundamental to know renewable energy state and production that can be combined with other less variable and more predictable sources to satisfy the energy demand. Therefore, renewable energy forecasting is a straightforward way to integrate safely this kind of energy into the current electric grid, especially photovoltaic power forecasting, which is still at a relative infancy stage compared to wind power forecasting, which has reached a relatively mature stage. The goal of this work is to present, first, a short-term offline forecasting model that uses only in-situ (local) collected data. Also, the performances of several pure non-linear auto-regressive models are investigated against those of non-linear auto-regressive models with exogenous inputs.

Many somatic variant callers have been developed yet accurate ascertainment of somatic variants remains a considerable challenge as evidenced by the varying mutation call rates and low concordance among callers. Statistical model-based algorithms that are currently available perform well under ideal scenarios, such as high sequencing depth, homogeneous tumor samples, high somatic variant allele frequency (VAF), but show limited performance with sub-optimal data such as low-pass whole-exome/genome sequencing data. While the goal of any cancer sequencing project is to identify a relevant, and limited, set of somatic variants for further sequence/functional validation, the inherently complex nature of cancer genomes combined with technical issues directly related to sequencing and alignment can affect either the specificity and/or sensitivity of most callers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: For these reasons, we developed SNooPer, a versatile machine learning approach that uses Random Forest classification models to accurately call somatic variants in low-depth sequencing data. SNooPer uses a subset of variant positions from the sequencing output for which the class, true variation or sequencing error, is known to train the data-specific model. Here, using a real dataset of 40 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, we show how the SNooPer algorithm is not affected by low coverage or low VAFs, and can be used to reduce overall sequencing costs while maintaining high specificity and sensitivity to somatic variant calling. When compared to three benchmarked somatic callers, SNooPer demonstrated the best overall performance. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: While the goal of any cancer sequencing project is to identify a relevant, and limited, set of somatic variants for further sequence/functional validation, the inherently complex nature of cancer genomes combined with technical issues directly related to sequencing and alignment can affect either the specificity and/or sensitivity of most callers. The flexibility of SNooPer's random forest protects against technical bias and systematic errors, and is appealing in that it does not rely on user-defined parameters.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed polysomnography (PSG) data obtained from 2111 participants in the Sleep Heart Health Study, who were followed up for a median of 11.8 years after PSG acquisition. During follow-up, 1252 participants suffered CVD events (CVD group) and 859 participants remained CVD-free (non-CVD group). HRV measures, derived from time-domain and frequency-domain, were calculated. Regression models were created to determine the independent predictor for long-term CVD outcomes, and to explore the association between HRV and CVD latency. Furthermore, based on HRV and other clinical features, a model was trained to automatically predict CVD outcomes using eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm. Results Compared with the non-CVD group, decreased HRV during sleep was found in the CVD group. HRV, particularly its component of high frequency (HF), was demonstrated to be independent predictor of CVD outcomes. Moreover, normalized HF was positively correlated with CVD latency. The proposed prediction model achieved a total accuracy of 75.3%, in which sleep HRV features served as a supplement to the well-recognized CVD risk factors, such as aging, adiposity and sleep disorders. Conclusions Association between sleep HRV and long-term CVD outcomes was demonstrated here, suggesting that altered HRV during sleep might occur many years prior to the onset of CVD. Machine learning models, combining sleep HRV and other clinical characteristics, should be promising in the early prediction of CVD outcomes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31972509", "doi": "10.1016/j.sleep.2019.11.1259", "venue": "Sleep medicine", "journal": "Sleep medicine", "mag_id": "2995911330", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210880254"}

Estimation of forage intake and monitoring the feeding behavior are key activities to evaluate the health and welfare state of animals.

Acoustic-based algorithms have shown promising results, however they were limited by the effects of noises, the simplicity of classification rules, or the computational cost. In this work, a new algorithm called Chew-Bite Intelligent Algorithm (CBIA) is proposed using concepts and tools derived from pattern recognition and machine learning areas. It includes (i) a signal conditioning stage to attenuate the effects of noises and trends, (ii) a pre-processing stage to reduce the overall computational cost, (iii) an improved set of features to characterize jaw-movements, and (iv) a machine learning model to improve the discrimination capabilities of the algorithm. Three signal conditioning techniques and six machine learning models are evaluated. The overall performance is assessed on two independent data sets, using metrics like recognition rate, recall, precision and computational cost.

(1) Vertical partitioning of data along feature space and horizontal partitioning along samples in order to ease the task of data parallelism. (2) Parallel Multilevel Feature Selection (M-FS) algorithm to select optimal and important features for improved classification of cancer sub-types.

These units are connected and distributed in a connectionist network. The activation of clusters of ::: units in retrained tasks will provide signals to other different but connected tasks that have not been retrained. ::: Adopting the concept of the connectionist model, the relearning of tasks after brain damage enhances the relearnt ::: skills by transferring them to other tasks that share similar units within the same connectionist network, resulting in ::: generalisation.

Several computational-based methods have been developed to improve the prediction of DNA-binding proteins in previous years. However, insufficient work has been done on the prediction of DNA-binding proteins from protein sequence information. In this paper, a novel predictor, DNABP (DNA-binding proteins), was designed to predict DNA-binding proteins using the random forest (RF) classifier with a hybrid feature. The hybrid feature contains two types of novel sequence features, which reflect information about the conservation of physicochemical properties of the amino acids, and the binding propensity of DNA-binding residues and non-binding propensities of non-binding residues. The comparisons with each feature demonstrated that these two novel features contributed most to the improvement in predictive ability. Furthermore, to improve the prediction performance of the DNABP model, feature selection using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method combined with incremental feature selection (IFS) was carried out during the model construction.

In order to leverage these data, automatic knowledge extraction - whereby we map from observations to interpretable states and transitions - must be done at scale. As such, we have seen many recent IoT data sets include annotations with a human expert specifying states, recorded as a set of boundaries and associated labels in a data sequence. These data can be used to build automatic labeling algorithms that produce labels as an expert would. Here, we refer to human-specified boundaries as breakpoints. Traditional changepoint detection methods only look for statistically-detectable boundaries that are defined as abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. However, we observe that breakpoints occur on more subtle boundaries that are non-trivial to detect with these statistical methods. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised approach, based on deep learning, that outperforms existing techniques and learns the more subtle, breakpoint boundaries with a high accuracy. Through extensive experiments on various real-world data sets - including human-activity sensing data, speech signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity traces - we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for practical applications.

The results generated, using this approach, for an airborne infrared application highlight the non-linear relationship between the constituent algorithms and show quantitatively that the system performance can be strongly class and segmenter/classifier dependent.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5244/C.16.52", "venue": "BMVC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2108903553", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["55809453", "15657807", "4193919", "714597", "125133067", "60554370", "6530745", "58180322"], "inbound_citations": ["16659881", "13599974", "55780225", "16948359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12695075"}

In particular, SVMs are able to identify even non-linear relationship by mapping non-linearly separable data into potentially linearly separable one through families of spatial transformation (kernel trick). With respect to this, several parameters (i.e., kernel function and its internal parameters) have to be tuned; however the optimal configuration is usually difficult to be defined a-priori. In this paper, a hyper-solution framework for SVM classification is presented. The main idea is to perform, simultaneously, three different SVM-based classification learning tasks: Model Selection, Multiple Kernel Learning and Ensemble Learning. The meta-heuristic known as Genetic Algorithms (GA) has been proposed to search for the most reliable final hyper-classifier (an SVM with a basic kernel, an SVM with a combination of kernel, or an ensemble of different SVMs, respectively), and the corresponding optimal configuration. We have applied the proposed framework on a critical and quite complex problem: the on-line assessment of structural health of aircraft fuselage panels, a crucial task both in military and civilian settings. In particular, the framework has been used to implement a diagnosis task, that is detecting a possible damage and identifying the structural component involved, according to the strain field measured through a monitoring sensor network deployed on the helicopter fuselage panels. Finite Elements (FE) simulation has been configured to simulate the response of a real panel to different damages. The resulting simulated strain fields have been used to build a dataset. Results obtained through 3 folds-cross validation proved the framework is reliable.

A multi-classifier is introduced to the new GANs to utilize the labeled images during the training of the GANs, which shares the low level layers with the discriminator.

{"paper_id": "70347744", "title": "Enhancing classification performance by handling noise and imbalanced data with fuzzy classification techniques", "authors": [{"first": "Ratchakoon", "middle": [], "last": "Pruengkarn", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis studied the methodologies to improve the quality of training data in order to enhance classification performance. Noise and imbalance problems are two significant factors affecting data quality. Class noise is considered as the most harmful type of noise to a classifier\u2019s performance, since incorrectly labelled examples may severely bias the learning method and result in inaccurate models. Removing mislabelled instances is more efficient than repairing and relabelling them. However, excessive removal of instances can be the cause of serious and irremediable loss of information. Under any circumstance, maintaining the noisy instances is worse than over eliminating. For these reasons, the conservation of instances without excessive filtering must be considered. Therefore, in the first part of this study, a noise removal technique using the Complementary technique with the Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (CMTFSVM) is proposed by considering misclassification analysis, in order to eliminate high potential uncertainty instances, which could lead to the mislabeling of samples in the training data. The results indicated that the CMTFSVM can reduce class noise and enhance the classification accuracy across different learning algorithms: Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM). ::: ::: On the other hand, there exists the imbalance issue, which is the cause of poor performance for existing learning algorithms. In such situations, there are some classes which have their number of instances greater than the other classes. Traditional learning algorithms tend to be overwhelmed by the majority classes and ignore the minority classes. The minority classes are as important despite their rareness, as they can contain useful information, as well as being difficult to recognise because of their infrequency and casualness. The second part of this study is designed to overcome this bias, by utilising a combination of the CMTFSVM undersampling technique, along with the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) rebalancing technique called CMTSMT. CMTSMT has been proposed for handling the binary imbalance problem in order to filter the uncertainty instances out of the training datasets, as well as to promote the importance of the minority classes. The results revealed that CMTSMT can improve classification performance with various imbalance ratios approximately 96% and 40% in terms of Geometric Mean (G-mean) and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). ::: ::: Another type of imbalance problem is dealing with multiclass imbalance classification. Multiclass learning has been seen as a difficult task for classification algorithms as multiclass classification may have a significantly lower performance than binary cases. Most existing techniques applied directly to a binary class imbalance problem could not be applied directly to multiclass problems. In addition, between-class and within-class are the two main factors causing issues for learning algorithms. Decomposition techniques such as One-vs-One and One-vs-All are common techniques to deal with multiclass imbalance data. However, their drawbacks are the losing of balancing performance on all classes, as they require a high memory space and more classifiers. Thus, a hybrid Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM) and SMOTE called FCMSMT is proposed. The results presented that the FCMSMT technique could reduce between-class and within-class problems by balancing all the classes to have a similar number of class instances and randomly selecting instances (at least one) from each cluster. Moreover, the number of instances, after applying the FCMSMT technique, are of a similar number to the original dataset instances, in order to prevent an over undersampling and oversampling of class instances. The percentage of performance improvement between the original data and the FCMSMT technique with highly imbalanced data approximately 10% and 5% with G-mean and AUC respectively. Thus, the FCMSMT technique could be an alternative way to deal with the multiclass imbalance classification problem.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2900115826", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70347744"}

These featuresets are combined to form the finall feature vector that describes the human shape, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifier is used for classification purposes. Improving the precision will allow the human movement detector to make better detections by reducing false positives and missed detections, which are the problems faced by current detection techniques. Training of the algorithm is done using the INRIA dataset and tested on sequences depicting conditions of moving humans in different environments. In the testing phase, the search space is reduced using an upper body detector, which is done using haar features. The reduced space is used to carry out human detection using the proposed feature extraction technique. The proposed detector approach performs well, and the number of missed detections are reduced. However, some false detections are still performed, but this is due the fact that some objects resemble humans. The proposed model is benchmarked with the current state-of-the-art detectors using a challenging test dataset, which is used to test the performance.

Based on the RUL prediction result, we can conclude that: (1) ARMA model achieved better result than SVM, however, the result shows a linear trend, which fail to properly reflect the degradation trend of the battery; (2) SVM often suffers from over fitting problem and is more suitable for single-step prediction; and (3) PF approach achieved a better prediction and reflected the trends of degradation of the battery owing to its combined with specific model.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.717.390", "venue": null, "journal": "Advanced Materials Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1966673325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59752996", "16563654", "122830292", "94604955", "14525224", "110025296", "32600847"], "inbound_citations": ["131811897", "208280673", "21667175"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108944700"}

One of the most import applications of natural language processing from industry perspective is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the most eminent branch of NLP because of its capability to classify any textual document to either as positive or negative polarity. With the proliferation of World Wide Web, huge textual unstructured data in form of tweets, messages, articles, social networking discussions, reviews of products and movies are available so as to extract right information from the large pool. Thus, a need is felt to analyze this data to bring out some hidden facts based on the intention of the author of the text. The intention can be either criticism (negative) of product and movie review or it can be admiration (positive). Although, The intention can vary from strongly positive to positive and strongly negative to negative. This thesis completely focuses on classification of movie reviews in either as positive or negative review using machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. Further, a N-gram Model has been proposed where the documents are classified based on unigram, bigram and trigram composition of words in a sentence. Two dataset are considered for this study; one is a labeled polarity dataset where each movie review is either labeled as positive or negative and other one is IMDb movie reviews dataset. Finally, the prediction accuracy of above mentioned machine learning algorithms in different manipulations of same dataset is studied and a comparative analysis has been made for critical examination.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2395668544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18397233", "12968935", "94818", "2427083", "388", "7105713", "484335", "1469556", "388", "1619039", "17862748", "1034974", "18397233", "2178380", "63247680", "7311285", "592170", "16940133", "15583512", "40670085", "12542466", "12596803", "5651839", "15770428", "7068903"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63210836"}

To address these problems, this paper proposes a machine learning algorithm that utilizes gradient-boosting to assemble a ReLU (rectified linear unit)/softplus Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). By using historical data from the airport and Badaling expressways collected between November 2012 and September 2014, sigmoid ELM, ReLU ELM, softplus ELM, ReLU gradient ELM boosting (GBELM) and softplus GBELM were applied for RST forecasting, RMSE (root mean squared error), PCC (Pearson Correlation Coefficient), and the accuracy of these methods were analyzed. The experimental results show that ReLU/softplus can improve the performance of traditional ELM, and gradient boosting can further improve its performance. Thus, we obtain a more accurate model that utilizes GBELM with ReLU/softplus to forecast RST. For the airport expressway, our proposed model achieves an RMSE within 3 \u00b0C, an accuracy of 81.8% and a PCC of 0.954.

All secondary users are considered as EH nodes that are allowed to harvest energy from multiple bands of Radio Frequency (RF) sources. A win-win framework is proposed, where SUs can sense the spectrum to determine whether the spectrum is busy, and hence they may harvest from RF energy, or if it is idle, and hence they can use it for transmission. Only a subset of the SUs can sense in order to reduce sensing energy, and then machine learning is used to characterize areas of harvesting and spectrum usage. We formulate an optimization problem that jointly optimize number of sensing samples and sensing threshold in order to minimize the sensing time and hence maximize the amount of energy harvested. A near optimal solution is proposed using Geometric Programming (GP) to optimally solve the problem in a time-slotted period.

Analysis shows that the minimized error bound is reduced for systems with poles that lie close to each other (that is, for systems with similar response times).

The token level component relies on a Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier that uses decisions from several underlying components such as language models, a named entity recognizer and and a morphological analyzer to label each word in the sentence. The sentence level component uses a classifier ensemble system that relies on two independent underlying classifiers that model different aspects of the language.

Modern tracking algorithms treat tracking as a binary classification problem between the object class and the background class. The binary classifier can be learned offline, if a specific object model is available, or online, if there is no prior information about the object's appearance. In this paper, we propose the use of online distance metric learning in combination with nearest neighbor classification for object tracking. We assume that the previous appearances of the object and the background are clustered so that a nearest neighbor classifier can be used to distinguish between the new appearance of the object and the appearance of the background. In order to support the classification, we employ a distance metric learning (DML) algorithm that learns to separate the object from the background. We utilize the first few frames to build an initial model of the object and the background and subsequently update the model at every frame during the course of tracking, so that changes in the appearance of the object and the background are incorporated into the model. Furthermore, instead of using only the previous frame as the object's model, we utilize a collection of previous appearances encoded in a template library to estimate the similarity under variations in appearance. In addition to the utilization of the online DML algorithm for learning the object/background model, we propose a novel feature representation of image patches. This representation is based on the extraction of scale invariant features over a regular grid coupled with dimensionality reduction using random projections. This type of representation is both robust, capitalizing on the reproducibility of the scale invariant features, and fast, performing the tracking on a reduced dimensional space.

In the first stage of the two stage methodology suggested for optimal in-situ bioremediation design, the optimal number of wells and their locations was determined from preselected candidate well locations. The pumping rate and well location in the first stage were subsequently optimized in the second stage of the methodology. The highly nonlinear system of equations governing in-situ bioremediation comprises the equations of flow and solute transport coupled with relevant biodegradation kinetics. A finite difference model was developed to simulate the process of in-situ bioremediation using an Alternate-Direction Implicit technique. This developed model (BIOFDM) yields the spatial and temporal distribution of contaminant concentration for predefined initial and boundary conditions. BIOFDM was later validated by comparing the simulated results with those obtained using BIOPLUME III for the case study of Shieh and Peralta (2005). The results were found to be in close agreement. Moreover, since the solution of the highly nonlinear equation otherwise requires significant computational effort, the computational burden in this study was managed within a practical time frame by replacing the BIOFDM model with a trained SVM model. Support Vector Machine which generates fast solutions in real time was considered to be a universal function approximator in the study. Apart from reducing the computational burden, this technique generates a set of near optimal solutions (instead of a single optimal solution) and creates a re-usable data base that could be used to address many other management problems. Besides this, the search for an optimal pumping pattern was directed by a simple PSO technique and a penalty parameter approach was adopted to handle the constraints in the PSO. The results showed that the costs involved in the proposed management solution were consistent with that resulting from other nontraditional optimization techniques which use embedded/linked bioremediation simulation models. Moreover, an optimal transient pumping strategy resulted in an overall reduction in pumping cost by almost 20% when compared to cases where a steady state pumping strategy was adopted. A considerable reduction in the number of simulations was achieved using the SVM approach.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23771102", "doi": "10.1016/j.jconhyd.2013.05.003", "venue": "Journal of contaminant hydrology", "journal": "Journal of contaminant hydrology", "mag_id": "2008118853", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["149937791"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24847614"}

Automatic identification of change-prone classes are useful for the software development team as they can focus their testing efforts on areas within the source code which are more likely to change. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for predicting change-prone classes based on the application of source code metrics as indicators. However, most of the work has focused on within-project training and model building. There are several real word scenario in which sufficient training dataset is not available for model building such as in the case of a new project.

We conduct experiments on 10 open-source Eclipse plug-ins and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We frame several research questions comparing the performance of within project and cross project prediction and also propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach for identifying the best set of source code metrics. We conclude that for within project experimental setting, Random Forest (RF) technique results in the best precision.

Moreover, for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation, SAR scattering statistics that are essential to SAR image processing are not considered in the CRF model. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical CRF (HIECRF) model for SAR image segmentation. The HIECRF model belongs to the discriminative models according to the semantic structure. While inheriting the advantages of the CRF model, the HIECRF model achieves the integration of the image features and SAR scattering statistics and captures the contextual structure information in the spatial and scale spaces. Moreover, we derive a hierarchical inference algorithm for the HIECRF model in virtue of the mean-field approximation (MFA) to provide the maximization of the posterior marginal (MPM) estimate of the HIECRF model. Then, by the bottom-up and the top-down recursions in the hierarchical inference procedure, the HIECRF model effectively exploits the global and local image information, including the contextual structures, the image features, and the scattering statistics, to achieve the MPM segmentation.

However, the high variability of abiotic factors inherent in estuarine water areas often makes the effects of eutrophication hardly distinguishable from those generated by other natural and/or anthropogenic fluctuations of hydrological and hydrochemical parameters. In addition, estuarine environmental zones of primary marine, fresh water, and brackish water characteristics can support diverse species communities with different sensitivity to various environmental factors. In the present work we clarified the structure of fish fauna in the lower Dniester and Dniester estuary area (north-western Black Sea coast) and assessed its changes as a response to various environmental factors. We applied hierarchical clustering with successive indicator species analysis, and Random Forest analysis on the data on fish community parameters (species richness, diversity, and evenness) to discover that the area under study contains three separate fish communities, each with a different response to fluctuations of environmental factors. Subsequent examination of parasitological data readily confirmed the conclusion about presence of three fish communities. There is no simple universal indicator, such as abundance of a single species in any of the three communities, which can be used to monitor the eutrophication impact in the area of research.

The real-time sensitive application offers an interesting challenge for the optimization of the quality and quantity of previous approaches, thus obtaining an efficient system with regard to surveillance environment.

In this paper, we propose an online similarity function learning framework to learn the metric that can well reflect the cross-modal semantic relation.

To effectively learn the aggregated similarity function, we develop three different similarity combination strategies, i.e., average kernel, multiple kernel learning, and layer gating. The former two kernel-based strategies assign uniform weights on different layers to all data pairs; the latter works on the original feature representation and assigns instance-aware weights on different layers to different data pairs, and they are all learned by preserving the bi-directional relative similarity expressed by a large number of cross-modal training triplets.

The accelerating requirement for processing SVM yields the implementation of an SVM algorithm on the hardware. In general, the training phase for SVM is performed using software. The SVM algorithm is implemented on the hardware through the parameters generated from the training phase. Hence, training time and hardware overhead are two significant metrics to consider when improving SVM. In this paper, we propose a innovative model of SVM called Highly Parallel SVM (HPSVM) for binary classification. The HPSVM is capable of saving training time and hardware overhead while simultaneously maintaining good classification accuracy. The idea of the HPSVM is to perform the newly proposed Concurrent Gaussian Selection for picking significant training data to learn an ensemble of linear classifiers for approximation of the complicated classifier. By doing so, training time and hardware cost can be tremendously reduced.

This paper proposes a Two-Pathway Generative Adversarial Network (TP-GAN) for photorealistic frontal view synthesis by simultaneously perceiving global structures and local details. Four landmark located patch networks are proposed to attend to local textures in addition to the commonly used global encoder-decoder network. Except for the novel architecture, we make this ill-posed problem well constrained by introducing a combination of adversarial loss, symmetry loss and identity preserving loss. The combined loss function leverages both frontal face distribution and pre-trained discriminative deep face models to guide an identity preserving inference of frontal views from profiles. Different from previous deep learning methods that mainly rely on intermediate features for recognition, our method directly leverages the synthesized identity preserving image for downstream tasks like face recognition and attribution estimation.

By large margin learning, the proposed algorithm inherits most benefits from the SVM-like margin-based classifiers, such as the provable generalization error bounds. Moreover, the soft-max approximation employed in our approach yields a convex optimization similar to the standard CRF learning with only slight modification in the potential functions.

To learn such features, existing methods are focused on the striping-based approach that builds multi-branch neural networks to learn local features in each part of the identities, with one-branch network dedicated to one part. This results in complex models with a large number of parameters. To address this issue, this paper proposes to learn the multifaceted features in a simple unified single-branch neural network.

The approach is hence directly applicable to the analysis of multiple species collections, with labelling provided by crowd-sourced collection. We evaluated the performance of the bird sound recognition system on a realistic number of candidate classes, corresponding to real conditions. We investigated the use of two canonical classification methods, chosen due to their widespread use and ease of interpretation, namely a k Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifier with histogram-based features and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with time-summarisation features. We further investigated the use of a certainty measure, derived from the output probabilities of the classifiers, to enhance the interpretability and reliability of the class decisions. Our results demonstrate that both identification methods achieved similar performance, but we argue that the use of the kNN classifier offers somewhat more flexibility. Furthermore, we show that employing an outcome certainty measure provides a valuable and consistent indicator of the reliability of classification results. Our use of generic training data and our investigation of probabilistic classification methodologies that can flexibly address the variable number of candidate species/classes that are expected to be encountered in the field, directly contribute to the development of a practical bird sound identification system with potentially global application.

Many of the motion skills required by the robot to perform such tasks can be pre-programmed. However, it is normally agreed that a truly useful robotic companion should be equipped with some learning capabilities, in order to adapt to unknown environments, or, what is most difficult, learn to perform new tasks. Many learning algorithms have been proposed for robotics applications. However, these learning algorithms are often task specific, and only work if the learning task is predefined in a delicate representation, and a set of pre-collected training samples is available. Besides, the distributions of training and test samples have to be identical and the world model is totally or partially given (Tan et al., 2005). In a human world, these conditions are commonly impossible to achieve. Therefore, these learning algorithms involve a process of optimization in a large search space in order to find the best behaviour fitting the observed samples, as well as some prior knowledge. If the task becomes more complicated or multiple tasks are involved, the search process is often incapable of satisfying real-time responses. Learning by observation and imitation constitute two important mechanisms for learning behaviours socially in humans and other animal species, e.g. dolphins, chimpanzees and other apes (Dautenhahn & Nehaniv, 2002). Inspired by nature, and in order to speed up the learning process in complex motor systems, Stefan Schaal appealed for a pragmatic view of imitation (Schaal, 1999) as a tool to improve the learning process. Current work has demonstrated that learning by observation and imitation is a powerful tool to acquire new abilities, which encourages social interaction and cultural transfer. It permits robots to quickly learn new skills and tasks from natural human instructions and few demonstrations (Alissandrakis et al., 2002, Breazeal et al., 2005, Demiris & Hayes, 2002, Sauser & Billard, 2005). In robotics, the ability to imitate relies upon the robot having many perceptual, cognitive and motor capabilities. The impressive advance of research and development in robotics over the past few years has led to the development of this type of robots, e.g. Sarcos (Ijspeert et al., 2002) or Kenta (Inaba et al., 2003). However, even if a robot has the necessary skills to imitate the human movement, most published work focus on specific components of an imitation system (Lopes & Santos-Victor, 2005). The development of a complete imitation architecture is difficult. Some of the main challenges are: how to identify which features of an action are important; how to reproduce such action; and how to evaluate the performance of the imitation process (Breazeal & Scassellati, 2002).", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/4821", "venue": "Humanoid Robots, Human-like Machines", "journal": "Humanoid Robots, Human-like Machines", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2160951478", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8737910", "34331748", "18198751", "17468972", "3190692", "988905", "18839954", "60852184", "9292003", "7407408", "59842754", "5091727", "36031267", "36686224", "15009135", "14266944", "17648373", "11405389", "30956329", "14610921", "20124430", "18718395", "202547837", "14128955", "10253714", "9002480", "38766760", "18998331", "17900407", "12710439", "7124120", "11446855", "20781525", "14825309", "353246", "2715202"], "inbound_citations": ["26941010", "37887994", "14997956", "13397645"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1708450"}

When dealing with video-based applications such as 2D (2-dimensional) to 3D (3-dimensional) video conversion, however, these approaches tend to produce temporally inconsistent depth maps, since their CNN models are optimized over single frames. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a novel spatial-temporal conditional random fields (CRF) model into the DCNN architecture, which is able to enforce temporal consistency between depth map estimations over consecutive video frames. In our approach, temporally consistent superpixel (TSP) is first applied to an image sequence to establish the correspondence of targets in consecutive frames.

The spatial distribution of the tree in the administrative Region (Abruzzo) was used to define the ecological traits while three modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, Random Forest) were used to build a Species distribution model according to two climatic scenarios. Main results: The marginal population's range was predicted to shift at higher elevations as consequence of climatic adaptation. Many zones, represented by the higher part of the mountains surrounding the study area (currently bare and inhospitable for trees), were identified as suitable in future for the species. However, in the case of a rapid climate change, this marginal population may not be able to move as fast as necessary. An in-situ adaptive management integrated with an assisted migration protocol might be considered to enforce the natural regeneration and improve the richness and variability of the genetic pool. Research highlights : Most of the genetic richness is held in small populations at the borders of natural distribution of forest species. Monitoring this MAP could be useful to understand the adaptive processes of the species and could support the future management of many other within-core populations.

In this study, the distinctive characteristic compared to classical modeling models is \"from image based model to mechanical based model (e.g. stress, strain, and deformation)\". In such framework, a neural network architecture named ReConNN is proposed and the ReConNN mainly contains two neural networks that are CNN and GAN. A classical topology optimization is considered as an experimental example, and the CNN is employed to construct the mapping between contour images during topology optimization and compliance. Subsequently, the GAN is utilized to generate more contour images to improve the reconstructed model. Finally, the Lagrange polynomial is applied to complete the reconstruction. However, typical CNN architectures are commonly applied to classification problems, which appear powerless handling with regression of images for simulation problems. Meanwhile, the existing GAN architectures are insufficient to generate high-accuracy \"pseudo contour images\". Therefore, a Convolution in Convolution (CIC) architecture and a Convolutional AutoEncoder based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN-CAE) architecture are suggested. Specially, extensive experiments and comparisons with existing architectures of CNN and GAN demonstrate that the CIC is highly accurate and corresponding computational cost also can be significantly reduced when handling the regression problem of contour images, and the WGAN-CAE achieves significant improvements on generating contour images.

A long tonal low call (\u226415.5 s duration) and a very high call (peak frequency \u223c750 Hz) were described for the first time. Random Forest multivariate analysis of 28 measured variables was used to classify calls with a high degree of accuracy (82%).

The regulatory layer contributed by the epigenetic layer has been one of the favourite areas of interest recently. This layer of regulation as we know today largely comprises of DNA modifications, histone modifications and noncoding RNA regulation and the interplay between each of these major components. Epigenetic regulation has been recently shown to be central to development of a number of disease processes. The availability of datasets of high-throughput screens for molecules for biological properties offer a new opportunity to develop computational methodologies which would enable in-silico screening of large molecular libraries. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In the present study, we have used data from high throughput screens for the inhibitors of epigenetic modifiers. Computational predictive models were constructed based on the molecular descriptors. Machine learning algorithms for supervised training, Naive Bayes and Random Forest, were used to generate predictive models for the small molecule inhibitors of histone methyl-transferases and demethylases. Random forest, with the accuracy of 80%, was identified as the most accurate classifier.

Hyperspectral data provide a wide spectral range, coupled with a very high spectral resolution, and are suitable for detection and classification of surfaces and chemical elements in the observed image. The main problem with hyperspectral data for these applications is the (relatively) low spatial resolution, which can vary from a few to tens of meters. In the case of classification purposes, the major problem caused by low spatial resolution is related to mixed pixels, i.e., pixels in the image where more than one land cover class is within the same pixel. In such a case, the pixel cannot be considered as belonging to just one class, and the assignment of the pixel to a single class will inevitably lead to a loss of information, no matter what class is chosen. In this paper, a new supervised technique exploiting the advantages of both probabilistic classifiers and spectral unmixing algorithms is proposed, in order to produce land cover maps of improved spatial resolution. The method is in three steps. In a first step, a coarse classification is performed, based on the probabilistic output of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Every pixel can be assigned to a class, if the probability value obtained in the classification process is greater than a chosen threshold, or unclassified. In the proposed approach it is assumed that the pixels with a low probabilistic output are mixed pixels and thus their classification is addressed in a second step. In the second step, spectral unmixing is performed on the mixed pixels by considering the preliminary results of the coarse classification step and applying a Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS) method to every unlabeled pixel, in order to obtain the abundances fractions of each land cover type. Finally, in a third step, spatial regularization by Simulated Annealing is performed to obtain the resolution improvement. Experiments were carried out on a real hyperspectral data set. The results are good both visually and numerically and show that the proposed method clearly outperforms common hard classification methods when the data contain mixed pixels.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.864938", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1990877833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["140616264", "29605000", "1091025", "14495716", "6906514", "52997034", "133512341", "16727786", "140674768", "27361437", "28637672", "961425", "6445796", "56563878", "137888315", "1046577", "205939", "13964020"], "inbound_citations": ["56170625", "124068736"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2686987"}

Global Mutual Information (MI) based feature selection optimizes the search process of finding best feature subsets in order to select the highly correlated predictors for ovarian cancer diagnosis. The maximal discriminative cancer predictors are then passed to a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier, and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to optimise the search process with respect to the estimated error rate of the LDA classifier (MI-LDA). Experiments were performed using an ovarian cancer dataset obtained from the FDA-NCI Clinical Proteomics Program Databank.

Malicious Web sessions are characterized with forty three different features (i.e., session attributes) extracted from Web server logs.

Our results show that attacks differ from vulnerability scans only in a small number of features (i.e., session attributes).

With its focus on learning based upon graded, malleable, distributed representations, connectionist modeling has reopened the question of what could be learned from the environment in the absence of detailed innate knowledge. This paper provides an overview of connectionist models of language processing, at both the lexical and sentence levels. Although connectionist models have been applied to the full range of perceptual, cognitive, and motor domains (see McClelland, Rumelhart, & PDP Research Group, 1986; Quinlan, 1991; McLeod, Plunkett, & Rolls, 1998), it is in their application to language that they have evoked the most interest and controversy (e.g., Pinker & Mehler, 1988). This is perhaps not surprising in light of the special role that language plays in human cognition and culture. It also stems in part from the considerable difference in goals and methods between linguistic and psychological approaches to the study of language. This rift goes deeper than a simple dichotomy of emphasizing competence versus performance (Chomsky, 1957)\u2014it cuts to the heart of the question of what it means to know and use a language (Seidenberg, 1997). Traditional approaches to language processing have been based on explicit, discrete representations which are difficult or impossible to learn from a reasonable linguistic environment (Gold, 1967). Therefore, it has come to be accepted that much of our linguistic representations and knowledge is innate. With its focus on learning based upon graded, malleable, distributed representations, connectionist modeling has reopened the question of what could be learned from the environment in the absence of detailed innate knowledge. Although the need to learn internal representations potentially gives connectionist networks great power and flexibility, it also introduces limitations.

In this study, ESM data of patients with psychosis spectrum disorder and controls were used to examine daily life emotions and higher order patterns thereof. We attempted to determine whether aggregated ESM data, in which statistical measures represent the distribution and dynamics of the original data, were able to distinguish patients from controls in a predictive modeling framework. Variable importance, recursive feature elimination, and ReliefF methods were used for feature selection. Model training, tuning, and testing were performed in nested cross-validation, based on algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. ROC analysis was used to post-process these models. Stability of model performance was studied using Monte Carlo simulations. The results provide evidence that patterns in emotion changes can be captured by applying a combination of these techniques. Acceleration in the variables anxious and insecure was particularly successful in adding further predictive power to the models.

FunHunt is also able to choose a near-native orientation among models submitted by predictor groups, demonstrating its general applicability for model selection.

Then, the feature vector of the testing keystroke is compared with the standard features. The most similar keystroke is matched and recognized after three times of voting. Based on this algorithm, we can identify the easily confused keystrokes and understand the mechanisms behind it. With this interpretability, we will be able to achieve the customized ring-type virtual keyboard application if necessary. The performance of this algorithm was evaluated by using a dataset with 1500 keystrokes of three different subjects. The results show that our algorithm is more effective in keystroke recognition than traditional algorithms for this ring-type keyboard. In addition to its application on virtual keyboards, this algorithm can also be potentially applied on other classification tasks with easy-to-understand results.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968495", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3002044836", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11074234", "2104969", "16925305", "24836250", "53080345", "49565961", "195251439", "117738888", "115204259", "40455026", "15917396", "27556876", "18488847", "3404003", "6279899", "1721457", "18057522", "2785136", "9741320", "62448576", "18866938", "16425237", "207158142", "1063727", "57376570", "54451786", "260383", "1092937", "21616297", "6332742", "14246573", "11985257", "2112296", "110780505", "38305531", "3425543", "28335163", "7439583", "53084097", "794771", "821106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211057833"}

Three classification schemes\u2014classification based solely on WV2; WV3; and bi-temporal WV2 and WV3 images\u2014were examined. Our study showed that the single-date image did not produce satisfying classification results as both producer and user accuracies of tree species were relatively low (44.7%\u201382.5%), whereas those derived from bi-temporal images were on average 10.7% higher. In addition, the overall accuracy increased substantially (9.7%\u201320.2% for the CNU area and 4.7%\u201312% for BNU). A thorough analysis concluded that near-infrared 2, red-edge and green bands are always more important than the other bands to classification, and spectral features always contribute more than textural features.

This study proposes a robust principal component analysis (RPCA)-embedded transfer learning (TL) to generate a personalized cross-day model with less labeled data, while obviating intra- and inter-individual differences. Upon the add-session-in validation on two datasets MDME (five-day data of 12 subjects) and SDMN (single-day data of 26 subjects), the experimental results showed that TL enabled the classifier of an MDME individual (using his/her 1st-day session only) to improve progressively in valence and arousal classification by adding similar source sessions (SSs) via the within-dataset TL (wdTL) and cross-dataset TL (cdTL) manners. When recruiting three SSs to test on the 5th-day session, the wdTL improvement (valence: 11.19%, arousal: 5.82%) marginally outperformed the subject-dependent (SD) counterpart (valence: 9.75%, arousal: 3.77%) that was obtained using their own 2nd-4th-day sessions only. The cdTL returned a similar trend in valence (8.35%), yet it was less effective in arousal (0.81%).

A promising paradigm to alleviate this data movement bottleneck is near-memory computing (NMC), which consists of placing compute units close to the memory/storage units. There is substantial research effort that proposes NMC architectures and identifies workloads that can benefit from NMC. System architects typically use simulation techniques to evaluate the performance and energy consumption of their designs. However, simulation is extremely slow, imposing long times for design space exploration. In order to enable fast early-stage design space exploration of NMC architectures, we need high-level performance and energy models. We present NAPEL, a high-level performance and energy estimation framework for NMC architectures. NAPEL leverages ensemble learning to develop a model that is based on microarchitectural parameters and application characteristics.

Isospectral manifold learning is one of the main contents of spectrum method. Isospectral manifold learning stems from the conclusions that if only the spectrums of manifold are the same, so are their internal structures. However, the difficult task about the calculation of the spectrum is how to select the optimal neighborhood size and construct reasonable neighboring weights. In this paper, a supervised technique called isospectral manifold learning algorithm(IMLA) is proposed. By modifying directly sparse reconstruction weight, IMLA takes into account the within-neighboring information and between-neighboring information. Thus, it not only preserves the sparse reconstructive relationship, but also sufficiently utilizes discriminant information. Compared with PCA and other algorithms, IMLA has obvious advantages.

In this paper, SensHand V1 and SensFoot V2, two inertial wearable sensors for upper and lower limbs, were developed to acquire motion data in ten tasks of the MDS-UPDRS III. Fifteen healthy subjects of control, 15 IH people, and 15 PD patients were enrolled. Seventy-one parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis, and the most significant were selected to distinguish among the different classes. Performances of supervised learning algorithms (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) were compared on two-group and three-group classification and considering upper and lower limbs separately or together as a full system. Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (accuracy 1.00 for RF, and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including IH subjects (0.92 F-measure with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, the best performances were obtained using the full system with an RF classifier. The system is, thus, suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Furthermore, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, people at risk for PD can be appropriately analyzed, and subtle changes in motor performance that characterize the prodromal phase and the early PD onset can be identified.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31946823", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856804", "venue": "2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "journal": "2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2980178973", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35476485", "23589520", "36306547", "206248344", "39582655", "11390596", "3902671", "13458649", "21802995", "7229733", "18872792", "15270936", "9389265", "51706129", "73502250", "6052459", "23344674", "12392152", "12211379"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204229693"}

A total of 416 Regions of Interest (ROIs) of the endometrium were extracted (208 normal and 208 abnormal) from 45 subjects. RGB images were gamma corrected and were converted to the YCrCb color system. The following texture features were extracted from the Y, Cr and Cb channels: (i) Statistical Features (SF), (ii) Spatial Gray Level Dependence Matrices (SGLDM), and (iii) Gray Level Difference Statistics (GLDS). The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), statistical learning and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) neural network classifiers were also applied for the investigation of classifying normal and abnormal ROIs in different scales. Results showed that the highest percentage of correct classification (%CC) score was 79% and was achieved for the SVM models trained with the SF and GLDS features for the 1x1 scale. This %CC was higher by only 2% when compared with the CAD system developed, based on the SF and GLDS feature sets computed from the Y channel only. Further increase in scale from 2\u00d72 to 9\u00d79, dropped the %CC in the region of 60% for the SF, SGLDM, and GLDS, feature sets, and their combinations. Concluding, a CAD system based on texture analysis and SVM models can be used to classify normal and abnormal endometrium tissue in difficult cases of gynaecological cancer.

Hence the method suffers from a lack of detailed geometry. To resolve this issue, we propose Y2Seq2Seq, a view-based model, to learn cross-modal representations by joint reconstruction and prediction of view and word sequences. Specifically, the network architecture of Y2Seq2Seq bridges the semantic meaning embedded in the two modalities by two coupled \u201cY\u201d like sequence-tosequence (Seq2Seq) structures.

In this paper, we argue that connectionism is best suited to theorize this challenging notion. Based on the view that a connectionist model should describe psychological processes that carry out psychological functions grounded in a biological living system, we propose the I-SELF (Imitative and Sequence Learning Functional) model, which is designed to capture the temporal dynamics of a stream of consciousness whose content can be acquired via symbolically mediated social interaction with others in society. We identify four implications of the James-Mead model of dynamic self (embodiment, narrative and self, individual and collective self, and culture and self), and report computer simulations to show the utilit...", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/10478400701416129", "venue": null, "journal": "Psychological Inquiry", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2153219515", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["14130215", "2379278", "6654763", "154675936", "190677994", "17348884", "142481901", "6729779", "143390125", "17590960", "988905", "11818459", "15204379", "25623850", "23545802", "10387880", "2623702", "17427551", "142072063", "2268306", "144730829", "2034426", "2763403", "143637046", "43472593", "147789377", "19382101", "142990861", "142786829", "15603671", "143272660", "142038726", "10197772", "13616378", "144465313", "3204300", "197658709", "145189648", "140800176", "145634514", "146209915", "145485001", "151734280", "151335955", "145741197", "67804616", "41579035", "144571577", "24119196", "552425", "141336576", "397886", "172389013", "62240765", "143716493", "141287862", "16418164", "39459402", "50647419", "1619720", "13606371", "145137698", "5656844", "38094945", "145101708", "145299943", "199177227", "151985997", "143088637", "7070644", "17799138", "146563849", "15796512", "144204098", "142675903", "144055093", "143438810", "23161930", "161213311", "1729870", "143295281", "50263509", "165185072", "142804819", "22862771", "20941174", "145258501", "798249", "22829321", "17781724", "18670762", "149640798", "140764752", "729948", "55150508", "155034", "15561117", "14548597", "142899088", "144399084", "143138399"], "inbound_citations": ["56013926", "144314952", "55448316", "145530448", "5633857"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54591116"}

In line with this consideration, crisp unmixing accuracy assessment, where unmixing performance is assessed using a mean squared error of the estimated endmember fractions, can be misleading. In this paper, alterative spectral unmixing assessment methods are introduced to account for the uncertainty contained in the spectral measurements and during the ground truth data collection. Two fuzzy measures are developed to assess unmixing performance. One is fuzzy unmixing fraction error for a realistic assessment and the other is pixel level unmixing accuracy to provide a good quantitative understanding of the unmixing success rates spatially. To demonstrate and illustrate how they work, the two fuzzy measures are applied to evaluate the performance of several spectral unmixing methods including both single spectrum based and multiple spectra based algorithms. Crisp assessments and fuzzy results at various tolerance levels are presented and compared. Based on the realistic measures proposed, it is found the recent developed unmixing method with extended Support Vector Machines outperforms other algorithms tested.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2264313", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1983140909", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["61610448", "137888315", "11112426", "15107853", "16042362", "9740077", "128430364", "6713715", "7014915", "26466868", "27361437", "19806476", "129099259", "130051971", "128762103", "1507025", "28471748", "1584748", "16181961", "14309785", "60985554", "3577860", "16203715", "16156943", "128786202", "140697633", "117765120", "59395121"], "inbound_citations": ["211210861", "30905675", "20457801", "24170172", "23236817"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45520004"}

In this study, new solubility prediction models were developed for both hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethane, propane, and butane) and non-hydrocarbon gases (CO2 and N2) in aqueous solutions of strong electrolytes using a hybrid modeling strategy, which links the Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) to the Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) technique. Comparing the models\u2019 predictions with experimentally determined solubility values, a very good agreement was noticed, leading to the overall correlation coefficients of 0.9880 and 0.9907 for the hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases, respectively. These models were also found to succeed in capturing the physical trends among experimental datasets through performing sensitivity analysis between the dependent and independent parameters. Developed models can be utilized to predict the solubility of pure and/or a mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases in aqueous electrolyte solutions, covering wide ranges of ionic strength, pressures, and temperatures up to supercritical conditions.

In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have drawn a lot of attention in the machine learning area and have had different remote sensing applications, especially on data fusion. This study presents two different feature-learning strategies for the fusion of hyperspectral thermal infrared (HTIR) and visible remote sensing data.

To validate the results with other learning strategies, a shallow feature model was used, as well. This model was based on feature fusion and decision fusion that classified and fused the two datasets. A co-registered thermal infrared hyperspectral (HTIR) and Fine Resolution Visible (Vis) RGB imagery was available from Quebec of Canada to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Images and LiDAR point clouds are the two major data sources used by the photogrammetry and remote sensing community. Although different, the synergy between these two data sources has motivated exploration of the potential for combining data in various applications, especially for classification and extraction of information in urban environments. Despite the efforts of the scientific community, integrating LiDAR data and images remains a challenging task. For this reason, the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) along with the integration and synchronization of positioning receivers, inertial systems and off-the-shelf imaging sensors has enabled the exploitation of the high-density photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) as an alternative, obviating the need to integrate LiDAR and optical images. This study therefore aims to compare the results of PPC classification in urban scenes considering radiometric-only, geometric-only and combined radiometric and geometric data applied to the Random Forest algorithm. For this study the following classes were considered: buildings, asphalt, trees, grass, bare soil, sidewalks and power lines, which encompass the most common objects in urban scenes. The classification procedure was performed considering radiometric features (Green band, Red band, NIR band, NDVI and Saturation) and geometric features (Height \u2013 nDSM, Linearity, Planarity, Scatter, Anisotropy, Omnivariance and Eigenentropy). The quantitative analyses were performed by means of the classification error matrix using the following metrics: overall accuracy, recall and precision.

In particular, new visuo\u2013motor mappings must be learned while old skills have to be kept, such that after adaptation, subjects may be able to quickly change between two different modes of generating movements (\u2018dual\u2013adaptation\u2019). A fundamental question is how the adaptation schedule determines the acquisition speed of new skills. Given a fixed number of movements in two different environments, will dual\u2013adaptation be faster if switches (\u2018phase changes\u2019) between the environments occur more frequently? We investigated the dynamics of dual\u2013adaptation under different training schedules in a virtual pointing experiment. Surprisingly, we found that acquisition speed of dual visuo\u2013motor mappings in a pointing task is largely independent of the number of phase changes. Next, we studied the neuronal mechanisms underlying this result and other key phenomena of dual\u2013adaptation by relating model simulations to experimental data. We propose a simple and yet biologically plausible neural model consisting of a spatial mapping from an input layer to a pointing angle which is subjected to a global gain modulation. Adaptation is performed by reinforcement learning on the model parameters. Despite its simplicity, the model provides a unifying account for a broad range of experimental data: It quantitatively reproduced the learning rates in dual\u2013adaptation experiments for both direct effect, i.e. adaptation to prisms, and aftereffect, i.e. behavior after removal of prisms, and their independence on the number of phase changes. Several other phenomena, e.g. initial pointing errors that are far smaller than the induced optical shift, were also captured. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms, a local adaptation of a spatial mapping and a global adaptation of a gain factor, explained asymmetric spatial transfer and generalization of prism adaptation, as observed in other experiments.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3812208", "pubmed_id": "24204643", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0076601", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2025828515", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["142517497", "1375972", "39380447", "715084", "194035", "14235736", "6332563", "31639395", "13495231", "121630001", "1555547", "15852080", "878792", "42034783", "5318064", "3488820", "8429934", "39802803", "11534967", "15915932", "6993399", "21366690", "1014578", "1829814", "875742", "144566535", "930559", "202775045", "37814083", "42985113", "1645312", "12415720", "12496296", "198175867", "45933589", "29347395", "14670286"], "inbound_citations": ["215113101", "25825737"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:531916"}

Due to the importance of context information (e.g., size/shape/texture) for classifying urban LULC features, Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) techniques are commonly employed for mapping urban areas. Regardless of adopting a pixel- or object-based framework, the selection of a suitable classifier is of critical importance for urban mapping. The popularity of deep learning (DL) (or deep neural networks (DNNs)) for image classification has recently skyrocketed, but it is still arguable if, or to what extent, DL methods can outperform other state-of-the art ensemble and/or Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms in the context of urban LULC classification using GEOBIA. In this study, we carried out an experimental comparison among different architectures of DNNs (i.e., regular deep multilayer perceptron (MLP), regular autoencoder (RAE), sparse, autoencoder (SAE), variational autoencoder (AE), convolutional neural networks (CNN)), common ensemble algorithms (Random Forests (RF), Bagging Trees (BT), Gradient Boosting Trees (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)), and SVM to investigate their potential for urban mapping using a GEOBIA approach. We tested the classifiers on two RS images (with spatial resolutions of 30 cm and 50 cm). Based on our experiments, we drew three main conclusions: First, we found that the MLP model was the most accurate classifier. Second, unsupervised pretraining with the use of autoencoders led to no improvement in the classification result. In addition, the small difference in the classification accuracies of MLP from those of other models like SVM, GB, and XGB classifiers demonstrated that other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers are still versatile enough to handle mapping of complex landscapes.

On the basis of depth matching, sensitive well logging parameters are preferred by core calibration. That, which means should be used to denoise, is a key issue for acquiring precise and high quality data. Then, intrinsic mode functions (IMF) decomposed by EMD algorithm is established and applied for denosing. Further, denoised data is classified into two categories, one for training and the other for validating. Aiming for TOC predicting model, SVR is implemented both for training and predicting, and simultaneously some conventional methods such as \uf044logR, back propagation artificial neural networks(BP-ANN), and multiple linear regressions are also exerted for comparisons. The result shows that EMD-SVR is the best solution for TOC predicting, with the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest mean squared errors.

To overcome this weakness, the simulation of rare fault signals is proposed in this paper. Specifically, frequency spectra are employed as model signals, then Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) is implemented to generate simulated signals based on a labeled dataset. Finally, the real and artificial signals are combined to train stacked autoencoders (SAE) to detect mechanical health conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed WGAN-SAE method, two specially designed experiments are carried out and some traditional methods are adopted for comparison. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method can deal with imbalanced fault classification problem much more effectively. The improved performance is mainly due to the artificial fault signals generated from the WGAN to balance the dataset, where the signals that are lacking in training dataset are effectively augmented. Furthermore, the learned features in each layer of the generator network are also analyzed via visualization, which may help us understand the working process of the WGAN.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924003", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952193749", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["64756582", "116053275", "3818866", "125845685", "2380770", "110988692", "63041811", "4075534", "5112121", "21788936", "881212", "12992737", "125778268", "113605408", "14272714", "1554582", "36310439", "123250444", "24776130", "20082504", "3964805", "18828233", "2057420", "118347220", "7461219"], "inbound_citations": ["208632538", "209376485", "212703092"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196185454"}

Because the conditions are changing of smoke and temperature distributions after fire burning with different situations, such as ventilation mode and fire source character and so on, it is important to study all the related issues with various fire conditions and find the optimal fire proof design method. This paper takes a fire prevention zone of a real highway tunnel as the reduced scale model (1:9) of tunnel fire test platform. The orthogonal tests of fire in tunnel model under different situations are carried out, with different fire heat release rates and ventilation velocities and fire source locations. The support vector machine (SVM) regression method is used to analyze the CO concentration and temperature in two references firstly, which shows the availability for tunnel fires in steady stage. Then CO2 gas concentration and movement are analyzed during the fire initial burning state based on the SVM regression method for our experiments. It is revealed that CO2 gas concentration in different situations can be predicted during the fire burning initial stage, and the orthogonal tests accompanied with the SVM regression can indicate the influence of various fire conditions for concentration and further guide the experiment scheme.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.proeng.2017.12.103", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Engineering", "mag_id": "2792559958", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210721931", "208157586", "77380363"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116781169"}

This theory provides a unifying framework for integrating symbolic and subsymbolic methods as complementary aspects of human intelligence. Top-down symbolic approaches benefit from the vast experience with logical reasoning and with high-level knowledge processing in humans. Connectionist methods use bottom-up approach to generate intelligent behavior by mimicking subsymbolic aspects of the operation of brains and nervous systems. Neurophysiological correlates of intentionality and cognition include sequences of oscillatory patterns of mesoscopic neural activity. Oscillatory patterns are viewed as intermittent representations of generalized symbol systems, with which brains compute. These dynamical symbols are not rigid but flexible.

We use histograms of Gabor and Gaussian derivative responses as the appearance features. We apply our approach to the face expression recognition problem where local appearances play an important role.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning algorithms allow the automatic classification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensional parameter space. In this work, we tailored the SVM for classifying stars, AGNs and galaxies, and applied this classification to the VIPERS data. We train the SVM using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the VIPERS and VVDS surveys. We tested two SVM classifiers and concluded that including NIR data can significantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. The self-check of the best optical + NIR classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification of galaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for AGNs in the 5-dimensional colour space. In the test on VIPERS sources with 99% redshift confidence, the classifier gives an accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars, and 82% for AGNs. The method was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify their classification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4 900 objects.

As massive unlabeled data are generated rapidly today, eliminating outliers from noisy data in a fast and unsupervised manner is gaining increasing attention in practical applications. This paper tackles this challenging problem by proposing a novel Recurrent Adaptive Reconstruction Extreme Learning Machine (RAR-ELM). Specifically, with the given noisy data collection, RAR-ELM recurrently learns to reconstruct data and automatically excludes those data with high reconstruction errors as outliers by a novel adaptive labeling mechanism. Compared with existing methods, the proposed RAR-ELM enjoys three major merits: first, RAR-ELM inherits the fast and sound learning property of original extreme learning machine (ELM). RAR-ELM can be implemented at a tens or hundreds of times faster speed while achieving a superior or comparable outlier removal performance to existing methods, which makes RAR-ELM particularly suitable for application scenarios like real-time outlier removal; secondly, instead of priorly specifying a decision threshold, RAR-ELM is able to adaptively find a reasonable decision threshold when processing data with different proportions of outliers, which is vital to the case of unsupervised outlier removal where no prior knowledge of outliers in the data is available; thirdly, we also propose Online Sequential RAR-ELM (OS-RAR-ELM) can be implemented by an online or sequential mode, which makes RAR-ELM easily applicable to massive noisy data or online sequential data.

Therefore, various classification and feature selection algorithms can be utilized to build a predictive model and classify the unseen geochemical samples into the pre-defined anomaly and background classes. In this study, some of the state-of-art feature selection and classification algorithms were utilized for supervised anomaly detection in the Kuh Panj porphyry-Cu district. Filter, wrapper and embedded mode feature selection algorithms were used to remove redundant and irrelevant elements from the classification procedure. Subsequently, AdaBoost (ADB), support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were trained with borehole and surface rock samples from the drilled parts of the study area to create a classified map depicting anomalous areas in the undrilled parts of the district. Results show that feature selection algorithms could play an important role in increasing the accuracy and generalization ability of the classifiers used. Wrapper mode subset selection method combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) search method resulted in the best performance in the study area. Applied classification algorithms outperform Gaussian linear discriminant analysis (GLDA) and provide more accurate, robust and reliable results. Among the applied classification methods, ADB achieved the best leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) error rate of 0.06. Meanwhile, comparison of the resulted classified map using ADB with another one created via concentration\u2013area fractal model indicated advantage of the former one in terms of detecting high-promising prospective target areas in the study region.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.gexplo.2015.06.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Geochemical Exploration", "mag_id": "598667868", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215531902", "195878602", "134835700", "135128043", "57886668", "134208522", "164460279", "126283318", "207988370", "134852205"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127448980"}

At the first stage of the study, a landslide inventory map with 282 landslide locations was identified using aerial photographs, satellite images, and field surveys. Of this, 70 % of the landslides (196 landslide locations) are used as a training dataset and the rest (86 landslide locations) were used as the validation dataset. Then, 15 landslide conditioning factors were prepared, i.e., altitude, aspect, slope, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), sediment transport index (STI), plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, distance from road, distance from fault, lithology, land use, NDVI, and rainfall. Using these conditioning factors, landslide susceptibility indexes were calculated using SVM with the four kernel functions. Subsequently, the results were exported and plotted in ArcGIS and four landslide susceptibility maps were produced. The four susceptibility maps were validated and compared using the landslide locations and the success rate and prediction rate methods.

Nevertheless, it is not known how much land is under cultivation. Mapping land cover at finer resolution and global scales has been particularly difficult in Ethiopia. The study area falls in a region of high mapping complexity with environmental challenges which require higher quality maps. Here, remote sensing is used to classify a large area of the central and northwestern highlands into eight broad land cover classes that comprise agriculture, grassland, woodland/shrub, forest, bare ground, urban/impervious surfaces, water, and seasonal water/marsh areas. We use data from Landsat spectral bands from 2000 to 2011, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its temporal mean and variance, together with a digital elevation model, all at 30-m spatial resolution, as inputs to a supervised classifier. A Support Vector Machines algorithm (SVM) was chosen to deal with the size, variability and non-parametric nature of these data stacks. In post-processing, an image segmentation algorithm with a minimum mapping unit of about 0.5 hectares was used to convert per pixel classification results into an object based final map. Although the reliability of the map is modest, its overall accuracy is 55%\u2014encouraging results for the accuracy of agricultural uses at 85% suggest that these methods do offer great utility. Confusion among grassland, woodland and barren categories reflects the difficulty of classifying savannah landscapes, especially in east central Africa with monsoonal-driven rainfall patterns where the ground is obstructed by clouds for significant periods of time. Our analysis also points out the need for high quality reference data. Further, topographic analysis of the agriculture class suggests there is a significant amount of sloping land under cultivation.

While the noninvasive nature of pulse oximetry is advantageous, the estimates of oxygen saturation generated by these devices are prone to motion artifacts and ambient noise, reducing the reliability of such estimations. Clinicians combat this by assessing the quality of oxygen saturation estimation by visual inspection of the photoplethysmograph (PPG), which represents changes in pulsatile blood volume and is also generated by the pulse oximeter. In this paper, we propose six morphological features that can be used to determine the quality of the PPG signal and generate a signal quality index. Unlike many similar studies, this approach uses machine learning and does not require a separate signal, such as ECG, for reference. Multiple algorithms were tested against 46 30-min PPG segments of patients with cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, including atrial fibrillation, hypoxia, acute heart failure, pneumonia, ARDS, and pulmonary embolism. These signals were independently annotated for signal quality by two clinicians, with the union of their annotations used as the ground-truth. Similar to any physiological signal recorded in a clinical setting, the utilized dataset is also unbalanced in favor of good quality segments. The experiments showed that a cost-sensitive Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperformed other tested methods and was robust to the unbalanced nature of the data.

Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (>20 m3 ha\u22121). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondonia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (<15 m3 ha\u22121). We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Para, northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon.

One representation that has been proposed involves encoding each sequence element with respect to its local context; this is known as a \"Wickelfeature\" representation. Handcrafted Wickelfeature representations suffer from a number of limitations, as pointed out by Pinker and Prince (1988). However, these limitations can be avoided if the representation is constructed with a priori knowledge of the set of possible sequences. This paper proposes a specialized connectionist network architecture and learning algorithm for the discovery of faithful Wickelfeature representations -- ones that do not lose critical information about the sequence to be encoded.

In this work, the boundary of the failure domain, for a computational problem with expensive function evaluations, is approximated using a Support Vector Machine and an adaptive sampling scheme. The approximation is sequentially refined using a new adaptive sampling scheme referred to as generalized \u201cmax-min\u201d. This technique efficiently targets high probability density regions of the random space. This is achieved by modifying an adaptive sampling scheme originally tailored for deterministic spaces (Explicit Space Design Decomposition). In particular, the approach can handle any joint probability density function, even if the variables are dependent. In the latter case, the joint distribution might be obtained from copula. In addition, uncertainty on the probability of failure estimate are estimated using bootstrapping. A bootstrapped coefficient of variation of the probability of failure is used as an estimate of the true error to determine convergence. The proposed method is then applied to analytical examples and a beam bending reliability assessment using copulas.Copyright \u00a9 2014 by ASME", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2014-34051", "venue": "Volume 1A: 34th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "journal": "Volume 1A: 34th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1995495539", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["60771840", "123535355", "7138354", "122860063", "119798548", "15870024", "123042696", "17268605", "15466123", "16295928", "129327739", "59039465", "198120286"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15797551"}
