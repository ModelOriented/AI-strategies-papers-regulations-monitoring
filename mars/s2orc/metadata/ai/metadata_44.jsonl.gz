Genetic mutations can cause this function to not be fulfilled correctly, which would cause cancer cells to multiply. Frequently mutated in many types of cancer, the most common genetic variations of TP53 are of the Missense type. To identify which variants can be pathogenic, current guidelines include the use of so-called in-silico tools, predictive models that play a crucial role in prioritizing variants. The latest in-silico tools recommended for the missense variants of TP53 are the models called aGVGD, BayesDel and REVEL. These last two are meta-predictor tools that were not specifically designed for TP53. ::: ::: Objective: To develop a meta-predictor exclusively designed to predict the pathogenicity of TP53 missense variants. ::: ::: Materials and methods: An in-silico tool development study was designed. As a study population, 1764 missense variants cured in the UMD TP53 database were taken. From the dbNSFP database, 25 in-silico tools were used for the assembly of a Random Forest, which predicted the pathogenicity of the variants at four levels (Benign, Possibly Pathogenic, Probably Pathogenic and Pathogenic). With the out-of-bag data, the performance of the model was estimated. Through a ROC analysis, the cut-off points of the probability of membership to the Pathogenic class were refined to use the model in two different prioritization scenarios. The models obtained were applied to the missense variants of uncertain significance (unknown pathogenicity) of TP53. ::: ::: Results: Respectively, an AUC of 0.99; 0.77; 0.67 and 0.78 was obtained for the Benign, Possibly Pathogenic, Probably Pathogenic and Pathogenic classes. From the ROC analysis, a first refinement of the model, for a required sensitivity of 90%, obtained a cut-off point of 0.07 for the probability of membership to the pathogenic class. In the second refinement a maximum positive predictive value of 0.67 corresponding to a cut-off point of 0.66 was obtained. ::: ::: Conclusions: The model can be used to rule out benign variants or to be used in two different prioritization schemes. In future studies, the use of the meta-predictor can be evaluated in combination with other algorithms such as aGVGD and its use in variant interpretation guidelines could be recommended. Variants prioritized as Pathogenic by this model can be analyzed in future molecular and population studies in cancer research.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2999312656", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213059695"}

The learning effectiveness and speed of artificial neural networks are therefore critical factors in applications for speech enhancement tasks. To address these issues, we present an extreme learning machine (ELM) framework, aimed at the effective and fast removal of background noise from a single-channel speech signal, based on a set of randomly chosen hidden units and analytically determined output weights. Because feature learning with shallow ELM may not be effective for natural signals, such as speech, even with a large number of hidden nodes, hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) architectures are deployed by leveraging sparse auto-encoders. In this manner, we not only keep all the advantages of deep models in approximating complicated functions and maintaining strong regression capabilities, but we also overcome the cumbersome and time-consuming features of both greedy layer-wise pre-training and back-propagation (BP)-based fine tuning schemes, which are typically adopted for training deep neural architectures. The proposed ELM framework was evaluated on the Aurora\u20134 speech database. The Aurora\u20134 task provides relatively limited training data, and test speech data corrupted with both additive noise and convolutive distortions for matched and mismatched channels and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, the task includes a subset of testing data involving noise types and SNR levels that are not seen in the training data. The experimental results indicate that when the amount of training data is limited, both ELM- and H-ELM-based speech enhancement techniques consistently outperform the conventional BP-based shallow and deep learning algorithms, in terms of standardized objective evaluations, under various testing conditions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766675", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2765164841", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["86831245", "60992701", "57709065", "17600621", "41307335", "10146873", "8356578", "7148809", "106886436", "21205594", "37200676", "41640555", "57215463", "59004072", "34162388", "37049224", "57009570", "16066264", "42684", "119892560", "15495531", "119838313", "34731046", "11358505", "15361420", "6386310", "13456698", "45246818", "59875789", "1658773", "62437194", "25742153", "17804904", "171208", "16830281", "25720339", "10298334", "15088220", "21639324", "16149642", "4002607", "206602390", "116858", "118517", "206757279", "19438642", "18310814", "12249030", "1700660", "26495202", "15037168", "4995930", "13174065", "11154521", "3072879", "61010805", "13972181", "6275630", "17073520", "15636421"], "inbound_citations": ["204848245", "202694662", "131774484", "211118495", "209485462", "209484212", "3829058", "214714154", "199111530", "199550727", "85527902", "71149136", "195775110", "58675237", "208208492", "3869591", "53948895"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:474949"}

{"paper_id": "18556305", "title": "Connectionist models of recognition memory: Constraints imposed by learning and forgetting functions", "authors": [{"first": "Roger", "middle": [], "last": "Ratcliff", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Multilayer connectionist models of memory based on the encoder model using the backpropagation learning rule are evaluated. The models are applied to standard recognition memory procedures in which items are studied sequentially and then tested for retention. Sequential learning in these models leads to 2 major problems. First, well-learned information is forgotten rapidly as new information is learned. Second, discrimination between studied items and new items either decreases or is nonmonotonic as a function of learning. To address these problems, manipulations of the network within the multilayer model and several variants of the multilayer model were examined, including a model with prelearned memory and a context model, but none solved the problems. The problems discussed provide limitations on connectionist models applied to human memory and in tasks where information to be learned is not all available during learning. The first stage of the connectionist revolution in psychology is reaching maturity and perhaps drawing to an end. This stage has been concerned with the exploration of classes of models, and the criteria that have been used to evaluate the success of an application have been necessarily loose. In the early stages of development of a new approach, lax acceptability criteria are appropriate because of the large range of models to be examined. However, there comes a second stage when the models serve as competitors to existing models developed within other theoretical frameworks, and they have to be competitively evaluated according to more stringent criteria. A few notable connectionist models have reached these standards, whereas others have not. The second stage of development also requires that the connectionist models be evaluated in areas where their potential for success is not immediately obvious. One such area is recognition memory. The work presented in this article evaluates several variants of the multilayer connectionist model as accounts of empirical results in this area.

A request corresponds to a given area of interest to capture on Earth. This exercise is challenging for different reasons. First, satellites are limited by maneuvers and power consumption constraints resulting in a limited surface that can be covered at each orbit. Consequently, many requests are in competition with each other and so all of them cannot be treated at each orbit. When a request priority is boosted, it may incidentally penalise surrounding requests. Second, there are several uncertain factors such as weather (in particular cloud cover) and future incoming requests that can impact the completion progress of the requests. With order books of increasing size and the planned operations of a growing number of satellites in a close future, there is a clear need for a decision support method. In this paper, we investigate the potential of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) for this problem and propose several approaches to optimise request priorities based on Local Search and Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL). Using a certified algorithm to decode request priorities into satellite actions and a satellite simulator developed by Airbus, we are able to realistically evaluate the potential of these methods and benchmark them against operator baselines. Experiments on several scenarios and order books show that EAs can outperform baselines and significantly improve operations both in terms of delay reduction and successful image capture. While black-box approaches yield significant improvements over the baseline when there are many delayed requests in the order books, introducing domain knowledge is required to handle cases with fewer delayed requests.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3321707.3321859", "venue": "GECCO '19", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2954866822", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212717712"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195795429"}

In many cases the intrinsic dimension of this manifold is highly lower than the representation dimension. In order to ease data processing, manifold-based dimension reduction algorithms were put forward since this century. The real purpose of manifold learning (MAL) is to learn a suitable metric in the low dimensional space. One main limitation of the existing MAL algorithms is that they all do not consider the intrinsic curvature of the embedded manifold, which means that the intrinsic geodesic distance cannot be uncovered by these algorithms. The intrinsic geodesic distance on the manifold is measured by Riemannian metric which is highly affected by Riemannian curvature. With this idea in mind, our work proposes to formulate a new algorithm by adding the curvature information to metric learning. We study a new curvature flow from input dataset. By employing this curvature flow, we obtain a Mahalanobis metric which can better uncover the intrinsic structure of the embedded manifold.

To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework to learn a discriminative and spatially invariant classification model for object and indoor scene recognition using multi-modal RGB-D imagery. This is achieved through three postulates: 1) spatial invariance $-$ this is achieved by combining a spatial transformer network with a deep convolutional neural network to learn features which are invariant to spatial translations, rotations, and scale changes, 2) high discriminative capability $-$ this is achieved by introducing Fisher encoding within the CNN architecture to learn features which have small inter-class similarities and large intra-class compactness, and 3) multi-modal hierarchical fusion $-$ this is achieved through the regularization of semantic segmentation to a multi-modal CNN architecture, where class probabilities are estimated at different hierarchical levels (i.e., image- and pixel-levels), and fused into a Conditional Random Field (CRF)-based inference hypothesis, the optimization of which produces consistent class labels in RGB-D images. Extensive experimental evaluations on RGB-D object and scene datasets, and live video streams (acquired from Kinect) show that our framework produces superior object and scene classification results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28866483", "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2747134", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2752585553", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11830123", "207763512", "1241368", "18968162", "16347866", "16027004", "2522960", "6242669", "8990541", "15174950", "15015476", "6099034", "14124313", "1629541", "7037275", "21466530", "10149762", "25530533", "13250628", "15539264", "4309276", "207224096", "1458265", "2430892", "59942950", "6033252", "15495480", "1053307", "6670425", "925787", "704982", "16900529", "13626748", "206943841", "2608922", "11664336", "1849990", "4260948", "16708269", "623137", "1996665", "206766608"], "inbound_citations": ["131776464", "53325821", "204858634", "115198485", "215487834", "3519253", "69413575", "209149172", "102344486", "211206394"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26462259"}

To improve classification accuracy inclusion of features from auxiliary geospatial datasets in classification models is applied since 1980s. However, the method is mostly limited to pixel-based classifications, and the coverage, accuracy and resolution of free and open-access auxiliary datasets have been poor until recent years. We evaluated how recent global coverage open-access geospatial datasets improve object-based LULC classification accuracy compared to using only spectral and texture features from satellite images. We applied feature sets topography, population, soil, canopy cover, distance to watercourses and spectral-temporal metrics from Landsat-8 time series on the southern foothills and savanna of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, where the landscape is characterized by heterogeneous and fragmented mosaic of disturbed savanna vegetation, croplands, and settlements. The classification was based on image objects (groups of spectrally similar pixels) derived from segmentation of four Formosat-2 scenes with 8 m spatial resolution using 1370 ground reference points for training, validation, and for defining 17 LULC classes. We built six Random Forest classification models with different sets of object features in each. The baseline model having only spectral and texture features was compared with five other models supplemented with auxiliary features. Inclusion of auxiliary features significantly improved classification overall accuracy (OA). The baseline model gave a median OA of 60.7%, but auxiliary features in other models increased median OA between 6.1 and 16.5 percentage points. The best OA was achieved with a model including all features of which elevation was the most important auxiliary feature followed by Enhanced Vegetation Index temporal range and slope degree. Applying object-based classification to geospatial information on topography, soil, settlement patterns and vegetation phenology, the discriminatory potential of challenging LULC classes can be significantly improved. We demonstrated this for the first time, and the technique shows good potential for improving LULC mapping across a multitude of fragmented landscapes worldwide.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2019.111354", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2972170785", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202914566"}

In the case of exception words, sublexical knowledge competes with the correct pronunciation driven by lexical knowledge, whereas no such competition occurs for regular words. The dominant view is that the cost of this \"regularity\" effect is evidence that sublexical spelling-sound conversion is impossible to prevent (i.e., is \"automatic\"). This view has become so reified that the field rarely questions it. However, the results of simulations from the most successful computational models on the table suggest that the claim of \"automatic\" sublexical phonological recoding is premature given that there is also a benefit conferred by sublexical processing. Taken together with evidence from skilled readers that sublexical phonological recoding can be stopped, we suggest that the field is too narrowly focused when it asserts that sublexical phonological recoding is \"automatic\" and that a broader, more nuanced and contextually driven approach provides a more useful framework. Keywords: automaticity, phonological recoding, computational models, reading aloud Words with irregular or exceptional spelling-sound correspondences are read aloud more slowly than words with regular spelling-sound correspondences (e.g., PINT vs. MINT), provided that the words are lower frequency and that the irregularity occurs early in the word (e.g., Roberts, Rastle, Coltheart, & Besner, 2003). The best account of this \"regularity\" effect is provided by dual route theory (see Roberts et al., 2003, for evidence that parallel distributed processing (PDP) models do not simulate this effect).1 Computational models of the dual route theory are able to simulate the regularity effect (among many others). Currently, the two dominant computational models are the Dual Route Cascaded model (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001), hereafter, DRC 1 .2 or simply DRC, and the Connectionist Dual Process model (Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2007), hereafter CDP+2. The Lexical Route When presented with a letter string, dual route models identify features that are present in each letter position, and these features activate letters at a letter level. Beyond the letter level, processing diverges along the two routes. Along the lexical route, the letter level activates the orthographic input lexicon (OIL), which contains a single lexical entry for the spelling of each word known to the model. Activation in the OIL then feeds forward to the phonological output lexicon (POL), which contains the stored pronunciation for each word known to the model. Activation from the POL then feeds into the phonemic buffer, where pronunciations are held in preparation for speech. The letter level, OIL, POL, and phonemic buffer are all engaged in interactive activation. The Sublexical Route Each model also implements a second route based on sublexical spelling-sound correspondences. In the DRC model, letters are converted sequentially into phonology according to a set of rules explicitly specified by the modeler. In the CDP+ model, sublexical translation is accomplished by a two-layer assembly (TLA) network that has learned these correspondences through exposure to print. The two models differ in other ways, but we dispense with a more thorough discussion, as it has no bearing here. In both models, the pronunciation produced by the sublexical route is passed to the phonemic buffer where it mixes with the pronunciation produced by the lexical route. A Competition Account of the Regularity Effect The regularity effect in these models arises because the sublexical route assigns the \"regular\" pronunciation to items like PINT (rhyming it with MINT), whereas the correct pronunciation is generated by the lexical route. These pronunciations compete in the phoneme buffer. For regular words like MINT, there is no conflict between routes because they activate the same set of phonemes. \u2026", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21668092", "doi": "10.1037/a0021642", "venue": "Canadian journal of experimental psychology = Revue canadienne de psychologie experimentale", "journal": "Canadian journal of experimental psychology = Revue canadienne de psychologie experimentale", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2067501103", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["45004814", "12740495", "24273935", "5871122", "10013060", "20522842", "17740763", "13881111", "198879486"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24294441"}

CNN carryout feature extraction on labelled data to perform classification. Multi-label classification assigns more than one label to a particular data sample in a data set. In multi-label classification, properties of a data point that are considered to be mutually exclusive are classified. However, existing multi-label classification requires some form of data pre-processing that involves image training data cropping or image tiling. The computation and memory requirement of these multi-label CNN models makes their deployment on edge devices challenging. In this paper, we propose a methodology that solves this problem by extending the capability of existing multi-label classification and provide models with lower latency that requires smaller memory size when deployed on edge devices.

In four selected reference sites of the Cabriel River (province of Cuenca, Spain), the presence of Eastern Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus guiraonis) was related to environmental variables linked to different mesohabitat characteristics.

The setting exists in many tasks such as semi-supervised image classification, image clustering, and image retrieval. Unlike previous methods, which develop or learn sophisticated regularizers for classifiers, our method learns a new image representation by exploiting the distribution patterns of all available data for the task at hand. Particularly, a rich set of visual prototypes are sampled from all available data, and are taken as surrogate classes to train discriminative classifiers; images are projected via the classifiers; the projected values, similarities to the prototypes, are stacked to build the new feature vector. The training set is noisy. Hence, in the spirit of ensemble learning we create a set of such training sets which are all diverse, leading to diverse classifiers. The method is dubbed Ensemble Projection (EP). EP captures not only the characteristics of individual images, but also the relationships among images. It is conceptually simple and computationally efficient, yet effective and flexible. Experiments on eight standard datasets show that: (1) EP outperforms previous methods for semi-supervised image classification; (2) EP produces promising results for self-taught image classification, where unlabeled samples are a random collection of images rather than being from the same distribution as the labeled ones; and (3) EP improves over the original features for image clustering.

The alternative two methods widely used when laboratory experiments are not available are: equation of state (EOS) and empirical PVT correlations. The EOS requires lots of numerical computations based on identifying the full compositions of the reservoir fluids properties. The measurement and calculation of these properties are very expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, using of PVT correlations which are based on easily measured field data such as reservoir pressure and temperature, and gas and oil density is reliable and more economic. In this work, three artificial intelligence (AI) technique models were developed to predict the oil\u2013gas ratio (Rv) for volatile oil and gas condensate reservoirs. Thirteen actual reservoir fluid samples (five volatile oils and eight gas condensates) covering a wide range of fluid behavior and characteristics were used. Whitson and Torp three parameters EOS were used to generate modified black oil (MBO) PVT properties that were used as a data set for model development. The MBO PVT data points were extracted for each sample using commercial PVT software at five different separator conditions. The nature of the input data was studied showing that data type is clustered. In addition, the correlations between the input parameters were checked. This preprocessed is helpful in selecting the best method to deal with the input parameters that will be fed to the developed models. According to this analysis and since the input parameters have different ranges, normalization of these parameters is vital to improve the accuracy of the models and to get the solution quickly and efficiently. Results showed that taking the log for the input parameters is the best among the other normalization techniques. The AI techniques that have been implemented in this research are; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, Functional Networks (FNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Models developed based on these techniques used 17,941 data points and a ratio of 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. To develop these models, three Matlab codes were written for each tool where the provided input data in excel format were read and prepressed before implementation. Results obtained using these techniques showed that the ANN model predicted Rv with an average square correlation coefficient of 0.9999 and an average relative error of 0.15% while FNs predicted Rv with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9635 and an average relative error of 27.6%. It was noted that SVMs gave the best results with an average correlation coefficient of 0.9990 and an average relative error of 0.12%. The results concluded that ANN and SVM accurately predicted such data since this type of data are clustered and these two models can handle this kind of data.

Most existing works deem this \u2019good\u2019 embedding just to be the discriminative one and thus race to devise powerful metric objectives or hard-sample mining strategies for leaning discriminative embedding. However, in this paper, we first emphasize that the generalization ability is a core ingredient of this \u2019good\u2019 embedding as well and largely affects the metric performance in zero-shot settings as a matter of fact. Then, we propose the Energy Confused Adversarial Metric Learning (ECAML) framework to explicitly optimize a robust metric. It is mainly achieved by introducing an interesting Energy Confusion regularization term, which daringly breaks away from the traditional metric learning idea of discriminative objective devising, and seeks to \u2019confuse\u2019 the learned model so as to encourage its generalization ability by reducing overfitting on the seen classes. We train this confusion term together with the conventional metric objective in an adversarial manner. Although it seems weird to \u2019confuse\u2019 the network, we show that our ECAML indeed serves as an efficient regularization technique for metric learning and is applicable to various conventional metric methods. This paper empirically and experimentally demonstrates the importance of learning embedding with good generalization, achieving state-of-theart performances on the popular CUB, CARS, Stanford Online Products and In-Shop datasets for ZSRC tasks.

We prove that error backpropagation can be naturally and elegantly implemented through native HTM message passing based on belief propagation.

Accurately identifying the flavor of Chinese liquors is not always possible through the subjective consciousness of a taster. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)-based electronic nose (e-nose) can perform this task because of its keen ability to imitate human senses. It does so by using a sensor array and a pattern-recognition system. In this paper, the behavior of a pattern-recognition system based on a random forest (RF) classifier is optimized by revising the number of decision trees and the number of variables in the decision trees of the RF. Raw data from the characteristics of Chinese liquors collected from the QCM-based e-nose were used by the RF classifier without processes of feature extraction and data pretreatment, which can reserve detailed information as much as possible. The prediction accuracies and computation times indicate a superior performance by the RF classifier over three other classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, backpropagation artificial neural network, and support vector machine).

We propose using an automated visual feature extraction technique by transforming bin-averaged phase-folded light curves into image based representations. This eliminates much of the noise and the missing phase data, due to sampling defects, should have a less destructive effect on these shape features as they still remain at least partially present. There is also no need for feature engineering as the learning algorithms can learn shape features directly from the light curves. We produced a set of scaled images based on a threshold of data points in each pixel. Training on the same feedforward network, we achieve an area under the curve of 0.6348. By introducing the Period and Amplitude as features into this dataset therefore giving meaning to the dimensions of the image we show this improves to 0.7952.

The approach uses fuzzy logic to transform gene expression values into qualitative descriptors that can be evaluated by using a set of defined rules. The algorithm uses neurofuzzy network to model genes effects on other genes followed by four stages of decision making to extract gene interactions. One of the main features of the proposed algorithm is that an optimal number of fuzzy rules can be easily and rapidly extracted without overparameterizing. Data analysis and simulation are conducted on microarray expression profiles of S. cerevisiae cell cycle and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only selects the patterns of the time series gene expression data accurately, but also provides models with better reconstruction accuracy when compared with four published algorithms: DBNs, VBEM, time delay ARACNE, and PF subjected to LASSO.

Assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and the potential for recultivation hinges on incomplete knowledge about the spatial patterns of fallow and abandoned farmland, especially at broad geographic scales. Our goals were to develop a methodology to map active and fallow land using MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and to provide the first European-wide map of the extent of abandoned farmland (cropland and grassland) and recultivation. We used a geographically well-distributed training dataset to classify active and fallow farmland annually from 2001 to 2012 using a Random Forests classifier and validated the maps using independent observations from the field and from satellite images. The annual maps had an average overall accuracy of 90.1% (average user's accuracy of the fallow class was 73.9%), and we detected an average of 128.7 million hectares (Mha) of fallow land (24.4% of all farmland). Using the fallow/active time series, we mapped fallow frequency and hotspots of farmland abandonment and recultivation of unused farmland. We found a total of 46.1 Mha of permanently fallow farmland, much of which may be linked to abandonment that occurred after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc. Up to 7.6 Mha of farmland was additionally abandoned from 2001 to 2012, mainly in Eastern Europe, Southern Scandinavia, and Europe's mountain regions. Yet, recultivation is widespread too (up to 11.2 Mha) and occurred predominantly in Eastern Europe (e.g., European Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania) and in the Balkans. We also tested the robustness of our maps in relation to different abandonment and recultivation definitions, highlighting the usefulness of time series approaches to overcome problems when mapping transient land-use change. Our maps provide, to our knowledge, the first European-wide assessment of fallow, abandoned and recultivated farmland, thereby forming a basis for assessing the environmental outcomes of abandonment and recultivation and the potential of unused land for food production, bioenergy, and carbon storage.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2015.03.028", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1968299234", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["131549198", "16638306", "130506920", "7282612", "24947372", "52088087", "86229367", "56318962", "89141", "38951693", "128277847", "34186430", "4426569", "129830932", "21286056", "129905182", "6998361", "17727823", "21907725", "4068417", "4346486", "53124176", "30030583", "128913165", "84890721", "62803995", "27545358", "129158909", "6471216", "134704846", "153965730", "55106487", "52083630", "158069092", "59428528", "11451672", "129713177", "153768666", "201855029", "153951173", "12195237", "34293897", "12553412", "58934224", "73611400", "95480604", "13148044", "153798766", "154680281", "2243677", "127208437", "95160498", "155022331", "30151959", "32291744", "5863118", "49530389", "140670581", "25609790", "128322713", "54842350", "18061770", "2849835", "53443606", "153957373", "15531970", "129699716", "154850375", "140611318", "41609951", "15347659", "26860668", "53122205", "13397039", "140566109", "126771840", "128998009", "84655428", "85928060", "31509788", "128239770", "15693019"], "inbound_citations": ["90095702", "134901259", "53588341", "204840637", "52084461", "203238687", "134069995", "155380982", "85505907", "54715299", "134141909", "135375317", "202565064", "157348961", "208957894", "85524527", "4000132", "91937469", "212629875", "55968723", "210702367", "134867412", "53711153", "53375452", "158319750", "52309989", "211565061", "18260525", "54050228", "18523795", "130897319", "53944188", "84839186", "155789161", "155617131", "53711152", "3539423", "52083012", "197511551", "23644807", "52085020", "35182243", "4646874", "25435306", "117240554", "157211178", "204810757", "134093730", "209340521", "158970092", "5816447", "157473392", "16789883", "207834322", "204812264", "204432394", "133607946", "92479247", "6078458", "20929160", "147200142", "14351773", "186241126", "73493523", "125743599", "4825377", "210964485", "215577325", "134292749", "201216474", "17711349", "51694227", "49670048", "132213212", "212711847"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59129835"}

In Lipski's approach possible tables are created from the original information table and each possible table has a possibilistic degree with which it is the actual information table. In each possible table, rough approximations are obtained for a set of objects. The possible membership degree of an object is the maximum of possibilistic degrees of possible tables where the object is included in the rough approximations. The certain membership degree is one minus the maximum of possibilistic degrees of possible tables where the object is not included in the rough approximations. Therefore, the certain and possible membership degrees are the lower and upper bounds of the membership degree that the object actually has. This leads an object to have membership degrees expressed by not a single, but an interval value for rough approximations, which is essential in possibilistic information systems. For the rough approximations, the complementarity property holds, as is so in complete information systems. This gives justification for dealing with possibilistic information under Lipski's approach. It is required to use rough approximations whose element consists of a pair of an object and a rule that it supports in order to induce rules from an information table.

As control optimization based on the development of physical models is in many cases very time consuming and cost intensive or not even feasible an alternative consists in analyzing historical process data, as lots of it is usually available. Hereby an approach is to use computational intelligent methods as these can identify characteristic control patterns and classify them according to their contribution for process optimization. As data coming from these processes is in general only available as time series a crucial question is how to generate and find these significant features from the measured data concerning a prior defined performance index. Traditional ways of finding these features need plenty of knowledge about the underlying process. In this paper we propose an automated feature extraction and ranking methodology based on Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR).

Hence, in this paper we investigate the use of graph kernels for the problems of workflow discovery, workflow recommendation, and workflow pattern extraction, paying special attention on the typical situation of few labeled and many unlabeled workflows.

The Enhanced Deep Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (EDSRGAN) is trained on the Deep Learning Digital Rock Super Resolution Dataset, a diverse compilation 12000 of raw and processed uCT images. The network shows comparable performance of 50% to 70% reduction in relative error over bicubic interpolation. GAN performance in recovering texture shows superior visual similarity compared to SRCNN and other methods. Difference maps indicate that the SRCNN section of the SRGAN network recovers large scale edge (grain boundaries) features while the GAN network regenerates perceptually indistinguishable high frequency texture. Network performance is generalised with augmentation, showing high adaptability to noise and blur. HR images are fed into the network, generating HR-SR images to extrapolate network performance to sub-resolution features present in the HR images themselves. Results show that under-resolution features such as dissolved minerals and thin fractures are regenerated despite the network operating outside of trained specifications. Comparison with Scanning Electron Microscope images shows details are consistent with the underlying geometry of the sample.

The theoretical results of Radiative Transfer Theory based on the ground truth parameters are used to de. ne training sets of the different rice planting schedules in the feature space of Entropy Decomposition.

Firstly, we applied the Scatter method for the class division problem. Secondly, we formed the class divisions in a Half-Against-Half structure by a random choice. We performed extensive experimental tests with four different feature sets and tested every feature set with seven different kernel functions in the case of HAH-SVM.

Different from Deep Neural Decision Forests (DNDF), this paper adopts an end-to-end training approach by representing the classification distribution with multiple randomly initialized softmax layers, which enables the placement of the forest trees after each layer in the neural network and greatly improves the training speed and stability. Furthermore, DSP is proposed to reduce the redundant connections of the network in a soft fashion which has high flexibility but demonstrates no performance loss compared with previous approaches.

Majority of the existing filter methods utilize a single feature-ranking technique, which may overlook some important assumptions about the underlying regression function linking input variables with the output. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection framework that combines clustering of variables with multiple feature-ranking techniques for selecting an optimal feature subset. Different feature-ranking methods typically result in selecting different subsets, as each method has its own assumption about the regression function linking input variables with the output. Therefore, we employ multiple feature-ranking methods having disjoint assumption about the regression function. The proposed approach has a feature ranking module to identify relevant features and a clustering module to eliminate redundant features. First, input variables are ranked using regression coefficients obtained by training $L1$ regularized Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests models. Those features which are ranked lower than a certain threshold are filtered-out. The remaining features are grouped into clusters using an exemplar-based clustering algorithm, which identifies data-points that exemplify the data better, and associates each data-point with an exemplar. We use both linear correlation coefficients and information gain for measuring the association between a data-point and its corresponding exemplar. From each cluster the highest ranked feature is selected as a delegate, and all delegates from the three ranked lists are combined into the final feature set using union operation. Empirical results over a number of real-world data sets confirm the hypothesis that combining features selected using multiple heterogeneous methods results in a more robust feature set and improves prediction accuracy. As compared to other feature selection approaches evaluated, features selected using linear correlation-based multi-filter feature selection achieved the best classification accuracy with 98.7%, 100%, 92.3% and 100% for Ionosphere, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Sonar and Wine data sets respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947701", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2980874176", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["38916788", "2982392", "743041", "536023", "15159133", "7218153", "215212331", "54979942", "1658773", "1102692", "8325788", "16162039", "7138354", "67866846", "49540430", "55691142", "42187768", "5704971", "62190121", "106407457", "10715511", "60704659", "17768717", "15025579", "7133515", "6550271", "13027072", "10813151", "10599038", "6481020", "3092608", "23449", "46457448", "120323840", "54002139", "14370656", "1455429", "379259", "8776249", "26333848", "2043246", "15245447", "14864905", "207720429", "10142996", "2321629", "16731338", "89141", "289288", "18531079", "6502291", "8190856", "35449048", "26836919", "31707429", "12795832", "9729751", "6526065"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204970973"}

Methods We examine how data recorded using seven alternative survey designs (random, systematic, environmentally stratified by class and environmentally stratified using P-median, biased due to accessibility, biased by human density aggregation and biased towards protected areas) could affect SDM predictions generated with nine modelling techniques (BIOCLIM, Gower distance, Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean distance, GLM, MaxEnt, ENFA and Random Forest). We also study how sample size, species\u2019 characteristics and modelling technique affected SDM predictive ability, using six evaluation metrics.

However, the insufficiency of labeled SAR data always leads to over-fitting, causing significant performance degradation. To solve the mentioned problem, a semi-supervised transfer learning method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is presented in the present paper. The discriminator of GAN with an encoder and a discriminative layer is redesigned to make it capable of learning the feature representation of input data with unsupervised settings. Instead of training a deep neural network with the insufficient labeled data set, we first train a GAN with varieties of unlabeled samples to learn generic features of SAR images. Subsequently, the learned parameters are readopted to initialize the target network to transfer the generic knowledge to specific SAR target recognition task. Lastly, the target network is fine-tuned using both the labeled and unlabeled training samples by a semi-supervised loss function. We evaluate the proposed method on the MSTAR and OpenSARShip data set with 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of the training set labeled, respectively.

What rationalizes these results is that: (a) the environment is structured enough for a connectionist learning mechanism to extract the information needed (Elman et al., 1996), and (b) distributional biases in the lexicon code phonetic information (Albano, 2001). Here we report on experiments about the role of information carried by intervocalic segments in learning V-to-V relations. Experiments We trained the same connectionist architecture (an SRN) with different training sets, reflecting different intervocalic conditions. They were made up of non-words which preserved the format of the words in the original work (i.e. trisyllabic penultimate-stressed phone strings corresponding to 3,700 nouns in Brazilian Portuguese). The general form of the strings was C 1 XC 3 V 3 , where C 1 , C 3 and V 3 were randomly generated. The X substrings were manipulated in order to partially (Exp. 1) or fully (Exp. 2) preserve the distributional biases in the previous simulation. the original corpus. As a result, PC 1 kept marking the distinction between V 1 and V 2 , while PC 2 now clearly distinguished between harmony and contour. Discussion Table 1 shows that reduced (random) intervocalic consonant information (Exp. 1) hinders the ability of the network to learn H/C dynamics. On the contrary, complete intervocalic information (Exp. 2), allowed learning of H/C dynamics comparable to that obtained in the original experiment. Table 1: PCs coding of phonotactic features in words and non-words (NW). Factor loading for each PC is indicated. V 1 /V 2 H/C Words PC 1 PC 6 Exp. 1 NW PC 1 >99,99% PCs 2 <0,001% Exp. 2 NW PC 1 95,87% PC 2 04,13% A cluster analysis of the hidden units\u2019 vectors shows that, in both the original and the second experiment, the network organizes its representational space in terms of linguistic constraints, yielding distinctions between vowels and consonants, and between stressed and non-stressed vowels. In the first experiment, however, given the poorer linguistic information available, it tends to structure representations according to positional constraints only. Acknowledgments First Experiment The most natural interpretation for the results of the original simulation would be that harmony and contour are learned solely on the basis of the distributional biases affecting V 1 and V 2 . Thus, we trained the network with a set of non- words where the X substrings represented V 1 C 2 V 2 sequences \u2013 C 2 s were randomly generated and V 1 and V 2 preserved the same distributional pattern of the original 3,700 word corpus. A principal component analysis of the activation of the hidden units revealed that, as in the original experiment, PC 1 distinguished between pre-stressed (V 1 ) and stressed (V 2 ) vowels. The distinction between harmony (H) and contour (C) was only weakly marked by PCs 2 and 3. Second Experiment In the second experiment, the X substrings preserved exactly the same distributional pattern for V 1 and V 2 , and exactly the same distribution of intervocalic segments as in Research funded by FAPESP (01/00136-2).

From a drug discoveryperspective, cheminformatic principles can be applied fromthe earliest stages of lead discovery (e.g., chemical similarityand library design) to lead optimization (e.g., QSAR studies)through to preclinical and clinical development (e.g., predic-tive toxicology). The popularity of cheminformatics and itsuse in academia and the pharmaceutical industry can beappreciated from the fact that at least five scientific journalsexist almost exclusively dedicated to the field (The Journal ofCheminformatics, The Journal of Chemical Information andModeling, The Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design,Molecular Bioinformatics,andQSAR and CombinatorialScience), and more than 15000 scientific journal articles havebeen published during just the last 5 years that describecheminformatic research. This intense interest in cheminfor-matics stems from the promise that, if underlying relation-ships between a given chemical structure and a host ofbiological end points exist and can be elucidated, drug dis-covery timelines can be significantly reduced. Given thepressure on the pharmaceutical industry to increase produc-tivity while decreasing costs, prior knowledge of which mole-cules have the highest probability of success (or at leastknowing which molecules are likely to fail) is worthy ofvigorous pursuit.Over the past decade there have been several significantadvancements in our understanding and application of che-minformatic principles. Approaches to measuring and com-paring chemical information have become both moresophisticated and accessible.

A large number of screen-rendered attentions have been paid to the English text detection, multi-language scene detection and indefinite length recognition. However, these studies mainly focus on getting the screen rendered image from the device itself. In the actual scene, lots of screen rendered text is mainly captured by the mobile device, and text image has a certain capturing angle. Because of the tilted text line, the current method has a severe degradation in detection performance. This paper proposes a Chinese-style scene text detection method for tilting screens capturing by mobile devices. Firstly, in order to obtain robust detection performance, the Connectionist Text Proposal Network (CTPN) method is employed for horizontal text detection. Secondly, to overcome the dependence of detection on horizontal text, the lightweight Oxford Visual Geometry Group network (VGGnet) is used to correct the tilted direction of the whole image. Moreover, the word width of special characters and punctuation characters are far below average value, so this paper uses the Gaussian removal method to delete the narrow word width and designed a more accurate network to recognize characters.

Moreover, the detection of short translation products (e.g. coded from small Open Reading Frames, sORFs) is very difficult as the short length makes it hard to distinguish true coding ORFs from ORFs occurring by chance. Nevertheless, over the past few years many such non-canonical genes (with ORFs < 100 AAs) have been discovered in different organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster. Thanks to advances in sequencing, bioinformatics and computing power, it is now possible to scan the genome in unprecedented scrutiny, for example in a search of this type of small ORFs. ::: Methods : Using bioinformatics methods, we performed a systematic search for putatively functional sORFs in the Mus musculus genome. A genome-wide scan detected all sORFs which were subsequently analyzed for their coding potential, based on evolutionary conservation at the AA level using UCSC multiple species alignments, and ranked using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model. The ranked sORFs are finally overlapped with ribosome profiling data proving sORF translation. All candidates are visually inspected using an in-house developed genome browser. ::: Preliminary Data : The genome-wide search for sORFs with sORFfinder resulted in the prediction of 2,414,589 single-exon sORFs with high coding potential, out of a total pool of 40,704,347 sORFs. To assess their peptide-coding potential, all sORFs were analyzed using a UCSC multi-species alignment of 8 vertebrate species. For each sORF a number of basic peptide conservation characteristics were deduced and gathered. We used an SVM approach to classify the sORFs into a coding and non-coding group based on all aforementioned characteristics. After training the SVM on 4/5th of the data and testing the SVM on the remainder, we reached a correct classification for up to 93% of the test subjects, with a false positive rate not exceeding 4%. Even with very stringent parameters this genome-wide in silico prediction approach gives rise to hundreds, even thousands of possibly interesting sequences. Therefore we reanalyzed ribosome profiling data obtained from a mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC) sample, uniquely mapping the reads to sORFs located in intergenic or ncRNA regions. Retaining only those sORFs that overlap with ribosome profiles at their start position in the harringtonine treated sample data and that have a sequence coverage of at least 75% relative to the untreated sample data, led to a set of 221 intergenic sORFs and 489 sORFs located in ncRNA regions. Looking only at lincRNA sORFs, as data points to their expression in these regions, further decreases the sample size to 33 sORFs. All sORFs are made accessible through an in-house developed H2G2 genome browser. Next to the sORF information, static visualization tracks are added depicting genomic annotation from Ensembl, phastCons conservation scores and other relevant information. Experimental ribosomal profiling data are incorporated using individual tracks for every analysis on the different samples (with or without harringtonine treatment).", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2296839580,2275299758", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:87009965"}

The following classifier feature filters of TWS were investigated: minimum, maximum, mean, and variance each evaluated over a pixel radius of 2n, (n = 0\u20134). Also noise reduction and edge preserving filters, Gaussian, bilateral, Kuwahara, and anisotropic diffusion, were evaluated. The algorithm used 200 trees with 2 features per node. A training data set was established using an anonymized patient's (male, 20 yr, 72 kg) chest-abdomen-pelvis CT examination. To establish segmentation ground truth, the training data were manually segmented using Eclipse planning software, and an intra-observer reproducibility test was conducted. Six additional patient data sets were segmented based on classifier data generated from the training data. Accuracy of segmentation was determined by calculating the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between manual and auto segmented images. ::: ::: Results: ::: The optimized autosegmentation algorithm resulted in 16 features calculated using maximum, mean, variance, and Gaussian blur filters with kernel radii of 1, 2, and 4 pixels, in addition to the original CT number, and Kuwahara filter (linear kernel of 19 pixels). Ground truth had a DSC of 0.94 (range: 0.90\u20130.99) for adult and 0.92 (range: 0.85\u20130.99) for pediatric data sets across all seven segmentation classes.

Toward this end, the differential vector plus KPCA is first proposed to reduce the dimension of process data and enlarge the feature difference. In DV-KPCA, the differential vector is the difference between the input sample and the common sample, which is obtained from the historical data and represents the common invariant properties of the class. The optimal feature vectors of input sample and the common sample are obtained by KPCA procedure for the difference vectors. Through the differential operation between the input vectors and the common vectors, the reconstructed feature is derived by calculating the two-norm distance for the result of differential operation. The reconstructed features are then utilized to detect the process faults that may occur. In order to enhance the accuracy of fault recognition, a new DROS-ELM is developed by adding a self-feedback unit from the output of hidden layer to the input of hidden layer to record the sequential information. In the DROS-ELM, the output weight of feedback layer is updated dynamically by the change rate of output of the hidden layer. The DV-KPCA for feature reconstruction is exemplified using UCI handwriting (UCI handwriting recognition data: Database, using \u201cPen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits\u201d produced in the Department of Computer Engineering Bogazici University, Istanbul 80815, Turkey, 1998), which the classification accuracy is obviously enhanced. Meanwhile, the DROS-ELM for process prediction is tested by the sunspot data from 1700 to 1987, which also shows better prediction accuracy than common methods. Finally, the new joint DROS-ELM with DV-KPCA method is exemplified in the complicated Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process to illustrate the efficiencies. The results show that the DROS-ELM with DV-KPCA shows superiority not only in detection sensitivity and stability but also in timely fault recognition.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/1.4028716", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Dynamic Systems Measurement and Control-transactions of The Asme", "mag_id": "2009295883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62145965"}

Land use change is due to the urban expansion and reduction in natural green areas resulted from enhanced economic growth. The three objectives of this study are (i) to estimate the land use and land cover changes (LULC) in Iskandar Malaysia from 1989 to 2014, (ii) to investigate the effect of LULC changes on land surface temperature (LST) change in the study area and (iii) to predict the LST by 2025. Remote sensing data namely Landsat (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of Terra product (MOD11A1) were used to classify various LULC and to calculate the LST in Iskandar Malaysia. There are two digital classification techniques used to classify and test the different LULC in this study area. Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) technique provided higher accuracies compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. Consequently, the classified satellite images using the MLC technique were used to monitor changes in LULC in Iskandar Malaysia. LST was extracted using mono window. The mean LST using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis according to LULC shows that water areas recorded the highest night time LST value, while forest recorded the lowest day time LST value. Urban areas are the warmest land use during the day and the second warmest land use during the night time. Moreover, the weighted average used to predict the mean LST of entire Iskandar Malaysia, it was found that if green space increases LST value would decrease by 0.5\u25cbC. To predict the effect of LULC changes on mean LST of each LULC types linear curve fitting model was used. According to the results, the mean night LST from 2000 to 2025 will increase in Iskandar Malaysia as urban (20.89\u00b0C to 22.39\u00b0C\u00b10.45), mangrove (20.88\u00b0C to 22.59\u00b0C\u00b10.50), forest (20.39\u00b0C to 21.04\u00b0C\u00b10.18), oil palm (20.39\u00b0C to 21.25\u00b10.25), rubber (20.34\u00b0C to 22.36\u00b0C \u00b1 0.57), and water (21.61 \u00b0C to 23.31\u00b0C \u00b1 0.51). The results show increment in day time at urban (29.26\u00b0C to 32.78\u00b0C\u00b11.07), mangrove (26.23\u00b0C to 28.82 \u00b0C\u00b10.89), forest (25.76\u00b0C to 27.54\u00b0C\u00b10.49), oil palm (27.02\u00b0C to 29.54\u00b10.70), rubber (26.49\u00b0C to 27.24\u00b0C \u00b10.29), and water (26.10 \u00b0C to 28.77 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.8) respectively. Moreover, the relationship between LST and several impervious and vegetation indexes show that there is a strong relationship between impervious indexes and LST, and an inverse relationship between vegetation indexes and LST. Finally, this study concluded that replacing green natural area with improvise surface can increase the land surface temperature and have negative effect on urban thermal comfort.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2913601211", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134591154"}

This algorithm is introduced to serve as the cornerstone of our classification method exploiting the trait that the importance of the feature variables and generalization error can be calculated during the training process of the random forest classifier. Following that the selected feature subset is used to train a random forest classifier for evaluating the traversability of the terrain.

This method is based on Flexible Analytic Wavelet Transform (FAWT), which decomposes the HRV signals into different sub-band signals. Further, Accumulated Fuzzy Entropy (AFEnt) and Accumulated Permutation Entropy (APEnt) are computed over cumulative sums of these sub-band signals. This provides complexity analysis using fuzzy and permutation entropies at different frequency scales. We have extracted 20 features from these signals obtained at different frequency scales of HRV signals. The Bhattacharyya ranking method is used to rank the extracted features from the HRV signals of three different lengths (500, 1000 and 2000 samples). These ranked features are fed to the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier. Our proposed system has obtained a sensitivity of 98.07%, specificity of 98.33% and accuracy of 98.21% for the 500-sample length of HRV signals.

However, the existing GAN-based image fusion methods only establish one discriminator in the network to make the fused image capture gradient information from the visible image, which may result in the loss of some infrared intensity information and texture information on the fused images. To solve this problem and improve the performance of GAN, we extend GAN to multiple discriminators and propose an end-to-end multi-discriminators Wasserstein generative adversarial network (MD-WGAN). In this framework, the fused image can preserve major infrared intensity and detail information from the first discriminator, and keep more texture information that existing in visible image from the second discriminator. We also design a texture loss function via local binary patterns to preserve more texture from visible image.

This paper proposed a novel energy-fluctuated multiscale feature mining approach based on wavelet packet energy (WPE) image and deep convolutional network (ConvNet) for spindle bearing fault diagnosis. Different from the vector characteristics applied in intelligent diagnosis of spindle bearings, wavelet packet transform is first combined with phase space reconstruction to rebuild a 2-D WPE image of the frequency subspaces. This special image can reconstruct the local relationship of the WP nodes and hold the energy fluctuation of the measured signal.

Other than the traditional neural network architecture, to maintain the global and local information simultaneously, deep ConvNet combines the skipping layer with the last convolutional layer as the input of the multiscale layer.

In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic method based on multi-sequence MRI to differentiate these two types of brain tumors. Our method consists of three steps: 1) the key slice is selected from 3D MRIs and region of interests (ROIs) are drawn around the tumor region; 2) different features are extracted based on prior clinical knowledge and validated using a t-test; and 3) features that are helpful for classification are used to build an original feature vector and a support vector machine is applied to perform classification. In total, 58 GBM cases and 37 lymphoma cases are used to validate our method. A leave-one-out crossvalidation strategy is adopted in our experiments.

Several geostatistical and determistic interpolation methods as well as data mining techniques such as, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were investigated for spatial and temporal modeling of groundwater level. The study revealed that co-kriging gives the best estimation of spatial distribution of water table when soil infiltration information is provided. On the other hand, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was found to model groundwater table fluctuation more accurately compared to other data mining approaches. Therefore, ANN was used to project the changes in groundwater level under projected climate data obtained through statistical downscaling of global circulation model outputs. Groundwater drought situations during base year and under projected climate were investigated using the Cumulative Deficit approach in a geographical information system. The study revealed that groundwater scarcity in at least 27% of the study area will be an every year phenomenon in the region due to climate change.

Accurate identification of recombination spots is useful for DNA function study. To improve the prediction accuracy, researchers have proposed several computational methods for recombination spot identification. The k-mer feature is one of the most useful features for modeling the properties and function of DNA sequences. However, it suffers from the inherent limitation. If the value of word length k is large, the occurrences of k-mers are closed to a binary variable, with a few k-mers present once and most k-mers are absent. This usually causes the sparse problem and reduces the classification accuracy. To solve this problem, we add gaps into k-mer and introduce a new feature called gapped k-mer (GKM) for identification of recombination spots. By using this feature, we present a new predictor called SVM-GKM, which combines the gapped k-mers and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for recombination spot identification.

However, this assumption is questionable as a group of transformations often reside on a curved manifold rather staying in a flat Euclidean space. For this reason, we should use the geodesic to characterize how an image transform along the manifold of a transformation group, and adopt its length to measure the deviation between transformations. Particularly, we present to autoencode a Lie group of homography transformations PG(2) to learn image representations. For this, we make an estimate of the intractable Riemannian logarithm by projecting PG(2) to a subgroup of rotation transformations SO(3) that allows the closed-form expression of geodesic distances.

Automatic email classification of the incoming emails allows to increase the communication efficiency by decreasing the delay between the query and its response. This thesis takes part within the IMAIL project, which aims to provide an automatic answering solution to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SSIA) (\u201cForsakringskassan\u201d in Swedish). The goal of this thesis is to analyze and compare the classification performance of different sets of features extracted from SSIA emails on different automatic classifiers. The features extracted from the emails will depend on the previous preprocessing that is carried out as well. Compound splitting, lemmatization, stop words removal, Part-of-Speech tagging and Ngrams are the processes used in the data set. Moreover, classifications will be performed using Support Vector Machines, kNearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes. For the analysis and comparison of different results, precision, recall and F-measure are used. From the results obtained in this thesis, SVM provides the best classification with a F-measure value of 0.787. However, Naive Bayes provides a better classification for most of the email categories than SVM. Thus, it can not be concluded whether SVM classify better than Naive Bayes or not. Furthermore, a comparison to Dalianis et al. (2011) is made. The results obtained in this approach outperformed the results obtained before. SVM provided a F-measure value of 0.858 when using PoS-tagging on original emails. This result improves by almost 3% the 0.83 obtained in Dalianis et al. (2011). In this case, SVM was clearly better than Naive Bayes.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2725592050", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["5135041"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64582663"}

To overcome these constraints, we analyzed and optimized the performance of a combined Random Forest (RF) classifier/object-based approach and applied it to multisource satellite data to produce land use maps of a smallholder agricultural zone in Madagascar at five different nomenclature levels. The RF classifier was first optimized by reducing the number of input variables. Experiments were then carried out to (i) test cropland masking prior to the classification of more detailed nomenclature levels, (ii) analyze the importance of each data source (a high spatial resolution (HSR) time series, a very high spatial resolution (VHSR) coverage and a digital elevation model (DEM)) and data type (spectral, textural or other), and (iii) quantify their contributions to classification accuracy levels. The results show that RF classifier optimization allowed for a reduction in the number of variables by 1.5- to 6-fold (depending on the classification level) and thus a reduction in the data processing time. Classification results were improved via the hierarchical approach at all classification levels, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.7% and 64.4% for the cropland and crop subclass levels, respectively. Spectral variables derived from an HSR time series were shown to be the most discriminating, with a better score for spectral indices over the reflectances.

It can detect fall of the human without hardware modification, extra environmental setup, or any wearable device. We implement WiFall on desktops equipped with commodity 802.11n NIC, and evaluate the performance in three typical indoor scenarios with several layouts of transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) links.

In order to obtain a robust metric for measuring (dis)similarities of (un)matched image pairs, metric learning has been introduced recently. Most existing works focus on seeking a Mahalanobis distance by employing sparse pair wise (dis)similarity constraints. However, the pair wise constraints have ignored a large portion of useful similarity information, and could not provide global similarity information. This paper proposes a novel metric learning method that could effectively exploit the global similarities. Specifically, we predefine lists of similarity scores, and measure (dis)similarities by the relevance of feature vectors. Subsequently, we learn a relevance metric by using the predefined list wise constraints, where the learnt metric is enforced to conserve predefined list wise similarities. Our main contributions lie on three folds: (1) we propose a metric learning method, which could effectively encode the global similarity information by using list wise constraints, (2) we formulate the relevance metric learning into a convex optimization problem, which could be solved efficiently, (3) we further kernelize the proposed method to support nonlinear mappings.

However, this is sometimes difficult to achieve. Each new algorithm published is evaluated from different perspectives and based on different assumptions. Without a common ground, it is almost impossible to compare different algorithms directly. Choosing an incompetent algorithm for an application can incur significant cost. This is especially true for packet classification in network routers, since packet classification is intrinsically a hard problem and all existing algorithms are based on some heuristics and filter set characteristics. The performance of the packet classification subsystem is critical to the overall performance of the network routers. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed so far, a benchmark that can give them consistent evaluation and reveal their comparable performance is still missing. This paper summarizes our efforts toward improving this situation. First, we conduct a high-level survey on the existing algorithms and extract some insights on the general design ideas. Second, we describe an open-source platform dedicated for advocacy-free evaluation of packet classification algorithms. Many representative algorithms are actually implemented under a set of uniform conditions and assumptions. The freely available implementations allow other researchers to easily test them under different scenarios. We also enforce some consistent and fundamental criteria for the algorithm evaluation, so that their performance and potentials are directly comparable, regardless of the actual implementation platforms. This project serves dual purpose: It helps the researchers to accelerate the innovation in the area of packet classification algorithm development by relieving them from the labor of replicating the previous work and by enabling them to quickly compare and evaluate algorithms. Meanwhile, it also helps the system implementers to easily choose the capable algorithm for their particular applications.

Accurate spatial and temporal modelling of solar irradiance is a key factor in the evaluation of PV technology potential for harvesting solar energy. We present here a data-driven approach based on an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines using geographic and topographic features in input to predict the global horizontal irradiance in Switzerland from coarse-resolution satellite measurements. This provides a precise mapping of hourly global solar irradiance for each (250 \u00d7 250) m2 pixel of a grid covering the entire country. The uncertainty on predicted values is quantified through a variance-based analysis, able to distinguish between model and data uncertainty. The former amounts to 1%, whereas the latter is close to 15% of the predicted values. The presented methodology is scalable and applicable to any large environmental dataset.

The basic idea is to view continuously arriving data of runoff and its impact factors as a data stream, and dynamically learn its relationship. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare its performance with that of three data driven models (ANN, SVR, Random Forest) and six representative hydrological models (SWAT, AWBM, SimHyd, SMAR, Sacramento, and Tank) in simulating monthly runoff. The proposed method performs well with the best NSE of 0.88, being superior to comparable models.

Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97 802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable to those previously obtained.

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN). In CMN we first cluster the benign training data and then from each cluster we build a separate markov network to model the benign behavior. During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data. We experimentally show that CMN approach outperforms several other approaches and performs similar to CMN-OS and we show that it is less sensitive to noise as compared to other approaches.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDMW.2013.161", "venue": "2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops", "journal": "2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2075009801", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207172599", "128775129", "15756191", "2847306", "9110854", "60994568", "1234512", "125577081", "6278891", "116930672", "13861754", "10659969", "33071784", "9684298", "10012689", "11707259", "214801365"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6945465"}

INDDEx is based on Inductive Logic Programming [1], which learns easily interpretable qualitative logic rules from active ligands that give an insight into chemistry, relate molecular substructure to activity, and can be used to guide the next steps of drug design chemistry. Support Vector Machines weight the rules to produce a quantitative model of structure-activity relationships. Whereas earlier testing [2,3] was performed on single dataset examples, this talk presents the largest and fullest test of the method. The method was benchmarked on the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) datasets [4], using the same methodology described in the paper on the assessment of LASSO [5] and DOCK. For each of the DUD datasets, the known active ligands were mixed with all the decoy compounds in DUD, and the retrieval rates of INDDEx and DUD were measured when they were trained on 2, 4, and 8 of the known active ligands (Figure 2). Early retrieved compounds showed high topological differences to molecules used as training data, showing the strength of this method for scaffold hopping.

Researchers often face considerable challenges in understanding consumers\u2019 preferences for such products. This paper proposes an adaptive decompositional framework to elicit consumers\u2019 preferences for complex products. The proposed method starts with collaborative-filtered initial part-worths, followed by an adaptive question selection process that uses a fuzzy support vector machine active learning algorithm to adaptively refine the individual-specific preference estimate after each question. Our empirical and synthetic studies suggest that the proposed method performs well for product categories equipped with as many as 70 to 100 attribute levels, which is typically considered prohibitive for decompositional preference elicitation methods. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural remedy for a long-standing challenge in adaptive question design by gauging the possibility of response errors on the fly and incorporating the results into the survey design. This research also explores in a live setting how responses from previous respondents may be used to facilitate active learning of the focal respondent\u2019s product preferences.

Many studies have examined risk factors for CHD, but their predictive abilities have not been evaluated. In particular, few studies have attempted to predict risks of CHD from, necessarily unbalanced, population-based cross-sectional data. Therefore, we developed and validated machine learning models for predicting, before and during pregnancy, women's risks of bearing children with CHD. We compared the results of these models in a large-scale, comprehensive population-based retrospective cross-sectional epidemiological survey of birth defects in six counties in Shanxi Province, China, covering 2006 to 2008. This contained 78 cases of CHD among 33831 live births. We constructed nine synthetic variables to use in the models: maternal age, annual per capita income, family history, maternal history of illness, nutrition and folic acid deficiency, maternal illness in pregnancy, medication use in pregnancy, environmental risk factors in pregnancy, and unhealthy maternal lifestyle in pregnancy. The machine learning algorithms Weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM) and Weighted Random Forest (WRF) were trained on, and a logistic regression (Logit) was fitted to, two-thirds of the data. Their predictive abilities were then tested in the remaining data. True positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), accuracy (ACC), area under the curves (AUC), G-means, and Weighted accuracy (WTacc) were used to compare the classification performance of the models. Median values, from repeating the data partitioning 1000 times, were used in all comparisons. The TPR and TNR of the three classifiers were above 0.65 and 0.93, respectively, better than any reported in the literature.

Based on the international experience prevention of flood events may not be completely possible, however identifying susceptible and vulnerable areas through prediction models is considered as a more visible task with flood susceptibility mapping being an essential tool for flood mitigation strategies and disaster preparedness. In this context, the present study proposes a novel approach to construct a flood susceptibility map in the Poyang County, JiangXi Province, China by implementing fuzzy weight of evidence (fuzzy-WofE) and data mining methods. The novelty of the presented approach is the usage of fuzzy-WofE that had a twofold purpose. Firstly, to create an initial flood susceptibility map in order to identify non-flood areas and secondly to weight the importance of flood related variables which influence flooding. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented considering eleven flood related variables, namely: lithology, soil cover, elevation, slope angle, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport index, plan curvature, profile curvature and distance from river network.

Unlike LBP which samples small-size neighboring pixels and computes binary codes with a fixed coding strategy, CBFD samples large-size neighboring pixels and learn a feature filter to obtain binary codes automatically. Subsequently, we present a prototype-based discriminative feature learning(PDFL) method to learn mid-level discriminative features with low-level descriptor for kinship verification. Unlike most existing prototype-based feature learning methods which learn the model with a strongly labeled training set, this approach works on a large unsupervised generic set combined with a small labeled training set.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of those attacks through a number of experiments. However, some researchers in academia and Tor community demonstrated that the assumptions of WF attacks studies greatly simplify the problem and don\u2019t reflect the evaluation of this vulnerability in practical scenarios. That leads to suspicion in the Tor community and among Tor Browser users about the efficacy of those attacks in real-world scenarios. In this thesis, we survey the literature of WF showing the research assumptions that have been made in the WF attacks against Tor. We then assess their practicality in real-world settings by evaluating their compliance to Tor Browser threat model, design requirements and to the Tor Project recommendations. Interestingly, we found one of the research assumptions related to the active content configuration in Tor Browser to be a reasonable assumption in all settings. Disabling or enabling the active content are both reasonable given the fact that the enabled configuration is the default of the Tor Browser, and the disabled one is the configuration recommended by Tor Project for users who require the highest possible security and anonymity. However, given the current published WF attacks, disabling the active con- tent is advantageous for the attacker as it makes the classification task easier by reducing the level of a web page randomness. To evaluate Tor Browser security in our proposed more realistic threat model, we collect a sample of censored dynamic web pages with Tor Browser in the default setting, which enables active content such as Javascript, and in the recommended setting by the Tor Project which disables the active content. We use Panchenko Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to study the identifiability of this sample of web pages. For pages that are very dynamic, we achieve a recognition rate of 42% when JavaScript is disabled, compared to 35% when turned on. Our results show that the recommended \u201dmore secure\u201d setting for Tor Browser is actually more vulnerable to WF attacks than the default and non-recommended setting.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.20381/ruor-20806", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2748738362", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116166835"}

We propose approaching the problem from a feature learning perspective. Our hypothesis is that, in the absence of a good model of the data generation process, it is better to learn the features from data, instead of using hand-crafted features that have no resemblance to the signature generation process.

The real-time recording of death certificates, thanks to Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS), provides valuable data for reactive mortality surveillance based on medical causes of death in free-text format. Reactive mortality surveillance is based on the monitoring of mortality syndromic groups (MSGs). An MSG is a cluster of medical causes of death (pathologies, syndromes or symptoms) that meets the objectives of early detection and impact assessment of public health events. The aim of this study is to implement and measure the performance of a rule-based method and two supervised models for automatic free-text cause of death classification from death certificates in order to implement them for routine surveillance. Method A rule-based method was implemented using four processing steps: standardization rules, splitting causes of death using delimiters, spelling corrections and dictionary projection. A supervised machine learning method using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was also implemented. Two models were produced using different features (SVM1 based solely on surface features and SVM2 combining surface features and MSGs classified by the rule-based method as feature vectors). The evaluation was conducted using an annotated subset of electronic death certificates received between 2012 and 2016. Classification performance was evaluated on seven MSGs (Influenza, Low respiratory diseases, Asphyxia/abnormal respiration, Acute respiratory disease, Sepsis, Chronic digestive diseases, and Chronic endocrine diseases). Results The rule-based method and the SVM2 model displayed a high performance with F-measures over 0.94 for all MSGs. Precision and recall were slightly higher for the rule-based method and the SVM2 model. An error-analysis shows that errors were not specific to an MSG. Conclusion The high performance of the rule-based method and SVM2 model will allow us to set-up a reactive mortality surveillance system based on free-text death certificates. This surveillance will be an added-value for public health decision making.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31522022", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.06.022", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "mag_id": "2954102128", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["191514557"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198246550"}

In order to effectively address this problem, this work firstly introduces a bijective metric so that the distance measurement and metric learning process can be directly adopted in image domain for an image reconstruction task. Secondly, a distillation process is introduced to maximize the information exploited from the blackbox face recognition engine. Then a Feature-Conditional Generator Structure with Exponential Weighting Strategy is presented for a more robust generator that can synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation.

Method: New users, usage intensity, usage frequency, exceptions, and release date and duration measured for complex proprietary mobile applications for Android and iOS. Utilized Bayesian Network and Random Forest models to explain the interrelationships and to derive the usage independent release quality measure. Investigated the interrelationship among various code complexity measures, usage (downloads), and number of issues for 520 NPM packages and derived a usage-independent quality measure from these analyses, applied it on 4430 popular NPM packages to construct timelines for comparing the perceived quality (issues) and our derived measure of quality for these packages.Results: We found the number of new users to be the primary factor determining the number of exceptions, and found no direct link between the intensity and frequency of software usage and software faults. Release quality expressed as crashes per user was independent of other usage-related predictors, thus serving as a usage independent measure of software quality.

Within the scope of the EU project GLOWORM, samples from 3,359 randomly selected farms in 849 municipalities in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Sweden were collected and their infection status assessed using an indirect bulk tank milk (BTM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dairy farms were considered exposed when the optical density ratio (ODR) exceeded the 0.3 cut-off. Two ensemble-modelling techniques, Random Forests (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), were used to obtain the spatial distribution of the probability of exposure to Fasciola hepatica using remotely sensed environmental variables (1-km spatial resolution) and interpolated values from meteorological stations as predictors. The median ODRs amounted to 0.31, 0.12, 0.54, 0.25 and 0.44 for Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Poland and southern Sweden, respectively. Using the 0.3 threshold, 571 municipalities were categorized as positive and 429 as negative. RF was seen as capable of predicting the spatial distribution of exposure with an area under the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.83 (0.96 for BRT). Both models identified rainfall and temperature as the most important factors for probability of exposure. Areas of high and low exposure were identified by both models, with BRT better at discriminating between low-probability and high-probability exposure; this model may therefore be more useful in practise. Given a harmonized sampling strategy, it should be possible to generate robust spatial models for fasciolosis in dairy cattle in Europe to be used as input for temporal models and for the detection of deviations in baseline probability.

However, it is difficult to distinguish such traffic types and their characteristics solely by IP addresses/port numbers. In addition, the increase in HTTPS traffic makes application-level packet inspection difficult. In this paper, we propose a traffic classification method on a mobile core network. The proposed method captures packets on the mobile core network, constructs TCP flows, and labels each flow by considering the regularity of BG traffic and the randomness of FG traffic using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with selected feature indexes obtained from the TCP/IP layer. Also, we attempt to restrict the indexes that can be obtained in the observation of the initial part of each TCP flow in order to reduce the calculation cost. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy using experimental data through the Wi-Fi connections of smartphones.

The precision of segmentation scheme relies on its competence to differentiate unlike tissues on multiple modalities like T1-weighted, T2-weighted as well as T1-contrast enhanced images irrespective of having different contrasts for same tissue type. In this paper, we proposed a technique to carry out volumetric segmentation of brain tumor in three dimensions on several variations of brain MRI using a hybrid Confidence connected region growing algorithm and active contour model. The proposed technique is assessed and demonstrated that proposed technique achieves good result in similarity with ground truth and additional advanced schemes. The results presents 3D visualization of tumor volume that can support the practitioners in the identification of brain tumor for future treatment planning by providing information regarding tumor location and its features.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CCAA.2018.8777718", "venue": "2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)", "journal": "2018 4th International Conference on Computing Communication and Automation (ICCCA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2965760498", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["493463", "15329957", "58450985", "35736702", "20158164", "215210746", "45724060", "79888679", "52051955", "215221047", "7735763", "16297525", "73721930", "10649701", "75281670", "5680197"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199059588"}

There is a continuous effort to tackle this problem by improving the implementation methodology and the network protocols. However, in general, fraud detection is difficult and currently addressed in a proactive manner. Fraudulent callers exploit the weaknesses of specific protocol level solutions and avoid detection of the gray traffic.

Multi capillary column-ion mobility spectrometry (MCC-IMS) is a promising technology for the detection of volatile organic compounds in the air of exhaled breath.

Currently, several steps of this analysis process require manual intervention of human experts. Our goal is to identify a fully automatic pipeline that yields competitive disease classification results compared to an established but subjective and tedious semi-manual process.We combine a large number of modern methods for peak detection, peak clustering, and multivariate classification into analysis pipelines for raw MCC-IMS data. We evaluate all combinations on three different real datasets in an unbiased cross-validation setting. We determine which specific algorithmic combinations lead to high AUC values in disease classifications across the different medical application scenarios.The best fully automated analysis process achieves even better classification results than the established manual process. The best algorithms for the three analysis steps are (i) SGLTR (Savitzky-Golay Laplace-operator filter thresholding regions) and LM (Local Maxima) for automated peak identification, (ii) EM clustering (Expectation Maximization) and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for the clustering step and (iii) RF (Random Forest) for multivariate classification.

This study introduces a new hyperspectral phenotyping system, which combines the high throughput of canopy scale measurements with the advantages of high spatial resolution and a controlled measurement environment. Furthermore, the measured barley canopies were grown in large containers (called Mini-Plots), which allow plants to develop field-like phenotypes in greenhouse experiments, without being hindered by pot size.ResultsSix barley cultivars have been investigated via hyperspectral imaging up to 30 days after inoculation with powdery mildew. With a high spatial resolution and stable measurement conditions, it was possible to automatically quantify powdery mildew symptoms through a combination of Simplex Volume Maximization and Support Vector Machines. Detection was feasible as soon as the first symptoms were visible for the human eye during manual rating. An accurate assessment of the disease severity for all cultivars at each measurement day over the course of the experiment was realized. Furthermore, powdery mildew resistance based necrosis of one cultivar was detected as well.ConclusionThe hyperspectral phenotyping system combines the advantages of field based canopy level measurement systems (high throughput, automatization, low manual workload) with those of laboratory based leaf level measurement systems (high spatial resolution, controlled environment, stable conditions for time series measurements). This allows an accurate and objective disease severity assessment without the need for trained experts, who perform visual rating, as well as detection of disease symptoms in early stages.

In this study, we proposed an improved computational approach for SIP prediction, termed SPAR (Self-interacting Protein Analysis serveR). Firstly, we developed an improved encoding scheme named critical residues substitution (CRS), in which the fine-grained domain\u2013domain interaction information was taken into account. Then, by employing the Random Forest algorithm, the performance of CRS was evaluated and compared with several other encoding schemes commonly used for sequence-based protein\u2013protein interaction prediction. Through the tenfold cross-validation tests on a balanced training dataset, CRS performed the best, with the average accuracy up to 72.01 %. We further integrated CRS with other encoding schemes and identified the most important features using the mRMR (the minimum redundancy maximum relevance) feature selection method. Our SPAR model with selected features achieved an average accuracy of 92.09 % on the human-independent test set (the ratio of positives to negatives was about 1:11). Besides, we also evaluated the performance of SPAR on an independent yeast test set (the ratio of positives to negatives was about 1:8) and obtained an average accuracy of 76.96 %.

However, the application of wood ash may affect the emission of greenhouse gases. Here, the effect of wood ash application on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from different soil environments were investigated in a 40 days incubation experiment comprising ten different soil types amended with five different wood ash concentrations (0, 3, 9, 20, and 54 t ash ha\u22121). The emitted N2O was measured continuously, and initial soil properties without ash application (carbon (C), nitrogen (N), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3\u2212), and pH) and resulting soil properties (pH, NH4+, and NO3\u2212) were measured prior and after the incubation period, respectively. The Random Forests (RF) model was used to identify which factors (initial and resulting soil properties, vegetation, management, wood ash doze, and respiration rate) were the most important to predict the development of emitted N2O after ash application. Wood ash either increased, decreased, or had no effect on the amount of emitted N2O depending on soil type and ash dose. The RF model identified the final resulting pH as the most important factor for the prediction of emitted N2O. The results suggest that wood ash can mitigate N2O emissions from soil, however, this effect depends on soil type where a mitigating effect of wood ash application was observed mainly in low pH soils with high soil organic matter whereas an increase in N2O emissions was observed in mineral soils that had previously received N fertilization.

In this context, a new text feature selection method named as the symmetrical strength of the N-Grams (SSNG) is proposed using a two pass filtering based feature selection (TPF) approach. Initially, in the first pass of the TPF, the SSNG method chooses various informative N-Grams from the entire extracted N-Grams of the corpus. Subsequently, in the second pass the well-known Chi Square (\u03c72) method is being used to select few most informative N-Grams.

As the critical part, its original clustering method is not good enough at data structure exploration due to poor robustness on the data with various shapes and densities. In this paper, a new transfer learning algorithm based on fuzzy neighborhood density-based clustering and re-sampling is proposed, which is more robust to datasets with various shapes and densities, and could explore more data structure information.

Detection and objective quantification of dyskinesia is essential for optimizing the medication regime and developing novel treatments for PD.

However, few studies have explored the potential of TLS application in this field, especially when using only mono-temporal data. In this study, a single-scan TLS data-based method was developed and validated to classify defoliation at both individual-tree scale and plot scale. The objects were classified into three classes: healthy/slightly defoliated, moderately defoliated and severely defoliated. Sixty features were extracted from TLS data and optimized to six (individual-tree scale) and five (plot scale) explanatory variables by using a Random Forest method to accomplish the classification. By this approach, individual trees can be classified into three defoliation levels with 80% overall accuracy (kappa value 0.70), while plot-scale classification had 94% overall accuracy (kappa value 0.91).

Multiple time series clinical liver cancer dataset is collected from different dataset and time interval. A merging algorithm is used to merge all attributes collected from different sources in multiple time periods. In order to preserve the originality of information, statistical measures of each attribute is calculated and considered them as additional attributes for accurate prediction. However the merged dataset is unbalanced, in which, the number of samples from HCC recurrence class is much smaller than from HCC non recurrence. The feature weighting scheme select optimal features and parameter of classifiers are sequentially obtained from multiple iterations which causes higher computation time. In this paper, an efficient sampling approach is proposed using Inverse Random under Sampling (IRUS) to overcome class imbalance issue. IRUS under sample the majority class which creates a number of distinct partitions with a boundary separated minority and majority class samples. Additionally an optimization approach is proposed using Artificial Plant Optimization (APO) algorithm to select optimal features and parameters of classifiers to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of classification. The optimization approach reduces the number of iteration and computation time for feature selection and parameter selection for classifiers which classify the recurrence and non recurrence of HCC.

Specifically, the AI-CD models the conditional distribution of cloud reflectance fields given a set of large-scale environmental conditions such as instantaneous sea surface temperature, estimated inversion strength, surface wind speed, relative humidity and large-scale subsidence rate together with random noise. We show that AI-CD can not only generate realistic cloudy scenes but also capture known, physical dependence of cloud properties on large-scale variables. AI-CD is stochastic in nature because generated cloud fields are influenced by random noise. Therefore, given a fixed set of large-scale variables, an ensemble of cloud reflectance fields can be generated using AI-CD.

In this paper, we propose GAGAN, an extension method to the Generative Adversarial Network, that is the first work to generate specific images from a trained GAN model. To control the characteristics of images, a DNA pool of the trained GAN model is introduced and evolved by a genetic algorithm (GA). Then, with the DNA pool, GAGAN can generate the corresponding latent vector (DNA) of target images. Furthermore, GAGAN can synthesize images containing a single specific characteristic or multiple specific attributes (including AND and OR relation).

At each iteration, it selects a set of hyperparameters and uses the accuracy of the model on the validation set as the reward signal to update its internal parameters. After multiple iterations, the agent learns how to improve its decisions. However, the computation of the reward requires significant time and leads to low sample efficiency. To speed up training, we employ a neural network to predict the reward. The training process for the agent and the prediction network is divided into three phases: Real-Predictive-Real (RPR). First, the agent and the prediction network are trained by the real experience; then, the agent is trained by the reward generated from the prediction network; finally, the agent is trained again by the real experience. In this way, we can speed up training and make the agent achieve a high accuracy. Besides, to reduce the variance, we propose a Bootstrap Pool (BP) to guide the exploration in the search space.

However, such signals are only available for a small fraction of users due to the difficulty in manual collection process by retailers. Most previous work on this problem explores different types of features and usually predicts different attributes independently. However, manually defined features require professional knowledge and often suffer from under specification. Meanwhile, modeling the tasks separately may lose the ability to leverage the correlations among different attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-task Representation Learning (MTRL) model to predict users\u2019 demographic attributes. Comparing with the previous methods, our model conveys the following merits: (1) By using a multi-task approach to learn the tasks, our model leverages the large amounts of cross-task data, which is helpful to the task with limited data; (2) MTRL uses a supervised way to learn the shared semantic representation across multiple tasks, thus it can obtain a more general and robust representation by considering the constraints among tasks. Experiments are conducted on a real-world retail dataset where three attributes (gender, marital status, and education background) are predicted. The empirical results show that our MTRL model can improve the performance significantly compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-30671-1_7", "venue": "ECIR", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2472187219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["556277", "10347997", "3757350", "15163514", "719551", "9020814", "153364206", "207763512", "11754890", "456889", "7051002", "11196829", "577005", "15640135", "3210714", "18196207", "13319321", "35015790", "11190653"], "inbound_citations": ["202729474", "23223233", "210993863", "196181206", "148869669"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42229133"}

In order to classify the frames into clusters, the method utilizes a powerful Self-Growing and Self-Organized Neural Gas (SGONG) network. Its main advantage is that it adjusts the number of created neurons and their topology in an automatic way. Thus, after training, the SGONG give us the appropriate number of output classes and their centers.

This work refers to an assistive tool that receives an unconstrained video of a speaker, captured at an arbitrary view, and not only locates the mouth region but also displays augmented versions of the lips in the frontal and profile views. This is made using deep Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on several pairs of images. In the training set, each pair contains a mouth picture taken at a random angle and the corresponding picture (i.e., relative to the same mouth shape, person, and lighting condition) taken at a fixed view. In the test phase, the networks are able to receive an unseen mouth image taken at an arbitrary angle and map it to the fixed views -- frontal and profile. Because building a large-scale pairwise dataset is time consuming, we use realistic synthetic 3D models for training, and videos of real subjects as input for testing.

Then, for each of apple mosaic virus, apple rust and apple alternaria leaf spot, 40 apple leaf images are selected as the training samples, whose feature vectors are made up of the dictionary of the sparse representation, respectively. Each testing sample is classified into the class with the minimal residual.

However, there exist three issues in S3VMs: (i) S3VMs require concurrently training c one-against-all (OAA) classifiers (c is the number of classes) for multiclass classification, which is prohibitive for large c; (ii) S3VMs require huge computational time and large storage (because of the large kernel matrix) in large-scale training and testing; (iii) S3VMs require the balance constraint in the unlabeled data, which not only needs prior knowledge from the unlabeled data (the prior knowledge is unavailable in some applications), but also makes their nonconvex optimization problem more intractable. To address these issues, a novel method called Extreme Semi-Supervised Learning (ESSL) is proposed in this paper. First, the framework of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adopted to handle both binary and multiclass classification problems in a unified model. Second, the hidden layer is encoded by an extremely small approximate empirical kernel map (AEKM) to greatly reduce the computational cost and the memory usage for training and testing. Third, the balance constraint (prior knowledge) in the unlabeled data is removed through the elaborative design of weighting function (which emphasizes the importance of labeled data and the minority pattern in the labeled data).By these three ways, ESSL can be solved effectively and efficiently based on alternating optimization (AO). More specifically, ESSL can be analytically and simply solved by generalized pseudoinverse and oneHotMap function (without any optimization solver and the OAA strategy) in the AO procedure, and consequently, better performance and much faster training speed are always achieved in ESSL. Our empirical study shows that ESSL significantly outperforms existing efficient SSL methods (e.g., meanS3VM and SS-ELM) in terms of accuracy, efficiency and memory, especially for large-scale multiclass problems. As an example, on the 20Newsgroups dataset, ESSL respectively runs 45 and 120 times faster than meanS3VM for training and testing with the improvement in accuracy of 3%, while the memory usage is reduced to 1/14. It is noteworthy that even though all the model parameters are with default values, ESSL already produces very excellent performance without fine-tuning parameters.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.09.039", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2975348219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212717921"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204204850"}

These variables were processed using Canonical Correlation Analysis and the resulting canonical variates scores were used as input to RVM to estimate the selected low flow indices. In ASD, the significantly correlated climate variables were subjected to backward stepwise predictor selection and the selected predictors were subsequently used to estimate the selected low flow indices using Multiple Linear Regression. With respect to the correlation between climate variables and the selected low flow indices, it was observed that all indices are influenced, primarily, by wind components (Vertical, Zonal and Meridonal) and humidity variables (Specific and Relative Humidity). The downscaling performance of the framework involving RVM was found to be better than ASD in terms of Relative Root Mean Square Error, Relative Mean Absolute Bias and Coefficient of Determination.

The nearest-instance-centroid-estimation (NICE) kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm provides an appropriate time-space tradeoff with good performance. Its centers in the input/feature space are organized by quasi-orthogonal regions for greatly simplified filter evaluation. Instead of using all centers to evaluate/update the function approximation at every new point, a linear search among the iteratively-updated centroids determines the partial function to be used, naturally forming locally-supported partial functionals. Under this framework, partial functionals that compose the adaptive filter are quickly stored/retrieved based on input, each corresponding to a specialized \u201cspatial-band\u201d subfilter. The filter evaluation becomes the update of one of the subfilters, creating a content addressable filter bank (CAFB). This CAFB is incrementally updated for new signal applications with mild constraints, always using the past-learned partial filter sums, opening the door for transfer learning and significant efficiency for new data scenarios, avoiding training from scratch as have been done since the invention of adaptive filtering. Using energy conservation relation, we show the sufficient condition for mean square convergence of the NICE-KLMS algorithm and establish the upper and lower bounds of steady-state excess-mean-square-error (EMSE).

On the basis of the opinions of experienced construction company managers, this paper, through presenting a fuzzy system, identifies the important criteria in selecting a project manager.

Among supervised learning algorithms, there are the so-called Support Vector Machines (SVM), exhibiting accurate solutions and low training time. They are based on the statistical learning theory and provide the solution by minimizing a quadratic type cost function. SVM, in conjunction with the use of kernel methods, provide non-linear classification models, namely separations that cannot be expressed using inequalities on linear combinations of parameters. There are some issues that may reduce the effectiveness of these methods. For example, in multi-center clinical trials, experts from different institutions collect data on many patients. In this case, techniques currently in use determine the model considering all the available data. Although they are well suited to cases under consideration, they do not provide accurate answers in general. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a subset of the training set which contains all available information, providing a model that still generalizes to new testing data. It is also possible that the training sets vary over time, for example, because data are added and modified as a result of new tests or new knowledge. In this case, the current techniques are not able to capture the changes, but need to start the learning process from the beginning. The techniques, which extract only the new knowledge contained in the data and provide the learning model in an incremental way, have the advantage of taking into account only the experiments really useful and speed up the analysis.

The classification strategy is based on three principles: the EMG energy of one channel is typically larger than the others during one specific muscle contraction; the spectral characteristics of the EMG signals produced by the frontalis and temporalis muscles during different movements are different; the EMG signals from adjacent channels typically have correlated energy profiles.

These proteins undergo an autocatalytic, intramolecular self-cleavage reaction in which a covalently bound pyruvoyl group is generated on a conserved serine residue. Traditional detections of the modified serine sites are performed by experimental approaches, which are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we initiated in an attempt for the computational predictions of such serine sites with Feature Selection based on a Random Forest. Since only a small number of experimentally verified pyruvoyl-modified proteins are collected in the protein database at its current version, we only used a small dataset in this study. After removing proteins with sequence identities >60%, a non-redundant dataset was generated and was used, which contained only 46 proteins, with one pyruvoyl serine site for each protein. Several types of features were considered in our method including PSSM conservation scores, disorders, secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, amino acid factors and amino acid occurrence frequencies. As a result, a pretty good performance was achieved in our dataset. The best 100.00% accuracy and 1.0000 MCC value were obtained from the training dataset, and 93.75% accuracy and 0.8441 MCC value from the testing dataset. The optimal feature set contained 9 features. Analysis of the optimal feature set indicated the important roles of some specific features in determining the pyruvoyl-group-serine sites, which were consistent with several results of earlier experimental studies. These selected features may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the mechanism of the post-translational self-maturation process, providing guidelines for experimental validation.

The estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic languages generated by PA and admit a very concise canonical representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable, it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES, introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages. The aim of this paper is twofold.

In this paper, we propose a Semi-supervised Hierarchical Attention Network Embedding method, named as SHANE, which can incorporate external information in a semi-supervised manner. First, a hierarchical attention network is used to learn the text-based embeddings according to the content of nodes. Then, the text-based embeddings and the structure-based embeddings are integrated in a closed interaction way. After that, we further introduce the label information of nodes into the embedding learning, which can promote the nodes with the same label closed in the embedding space.

Multiple methods have been developed for assigning cause of death from a VA but their application is restricted by uncertainty about their reliability. Methods: We investigated the validity of five automated VA methods for assigning cause of death: InterVA-4, Random Forest (RF), Simplified Symptom Pattern (SSP), Tariff method (Tariff), and King-Lu (KL), in addition to physician review of VA forms (PCVA), based on 12,535 cases from diverse populations for which the true cause of death had been reliably established. For adults, children, neonates and stillbirths, performance was assessed separately for individuals using sensitivity, specificity, Kappa, and chance-corrected concordance (CCC) and for populations using cause specific mortality fraction (CSMF) accuracy, with and without additional diagnostic information from prior contact with health services. A total of 500 train-test splits were used to ensure that results are robust to variation in the underlying cause of death distribution. Results: Three automated diagnostic methods, Tariff, SSP, and RF, but not InterVA-4, performed better than physician review in all age groups, study sites, and for the majority of causes of death studied. For adults, CSMF accuracy ranged from 0.764 to 0.770, compared with 0.680 for PCVA and 0.625 for InterVA; CCC varied from 49.2% to 54.1%, compared with 42.2% for PCVA, and 23.8% for InterVA. For children, CSMF accuracy was 0.783 for Tariff, 0.678 for PCVA, and 0.520 for InterVA; CCC was 52.5% for Tariff, 44.5% for PCVA, and 30.3% for InterVA. For neonates, CSMF accuracy was 0.817 for Tariff, 0.719 for PCVA, and 0.629 for InterVA; CCC varied from 47.3% to 50.3% for the three automated methods, 29.3% for PCVA, and 19.4% for InterVA. The method with the highest sensitivity for a specific cause varied by cause.

Farming being a major occupation, crop protection from plant diseases has become a serious concern. The occurrence of plant diseases is hugely dependent on environmental factors which are uncontrollable. Ongoing agricultural research and the advanced computational technologies can be coalesced to determine an effective solution, which can improve the yield and result in better harvests. The objective is to minimize the economic and production losses. Researchers have developed several modeling techniques, viz. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Learning for prediction and preferably early detection of diseases in plants. Mostly, images of the diseased plant are given as input to these prediction models. Early detection leads to minimizing the pesticide usage, hence, resulting in lowering the expense along with the ecological impact. Also, it is essential that the prediction techniques are nondestructive in nature. This paper delves into the Machine Learning based plant disease prediction models, along with a brief study of diverse imaging techniques, viz., RGB, multi- and hyperspectral, thermal, fluorescence spectroscopy, etc., catering to different features/parameters of a plant, useful in the prediction of diseases.

Notably, in the context of production and distribution of television programmes, it has been successfully demonstrated how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support innovation in the creative sector. In the context of delivering TV programmes of stunning visual quality, the applications of deep learning have enabled significant advances when the original content is of poor quality / resolution, or when delivery channels are very limited. Examples when the enhancement of originally poor quality is needed include new content forms (e.g. user generated content) and historical content (e.g. archives), while limitations of delivery channels can, first of all, be addressed by improving content compression. As a state-of-the-art example, the benefits of deep-learning solutions have been recently demonstrated within an end-to-end platform for management of user generated content [2], where deep learning is applied to increase video resolution, evaluate video quality and enrich the video by providing automatic metadata. Within this particular application space where large amount of user generated content is available, the progress has also been made in addressing visual story editing using social media data in automatic ways, making programmes from large amount of content faster [3]. Broadcasters are also interested in restauration of historical content more cheaply. For example, adding colour to \"black and white\" content has until now been an expensive and time-consuming task. However, recently new algorithms have been developed to perform the task more efficiently. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become the baseline for many image-to-image translation tasks, including image colourisation. Aiming at the generation of more naturally coloured images from \"black and white\" sources, newest algorithms are capable of generalisation of the colour of natural images, producing realistic and plausible results [4]. In the context of content delivery, new generations of compression standards enable significant reduction of required bandwidth [5], however, with a cost of increased computational complexity. This is another area where AI can be utilised for better efficiency - either in its simple forms as decision trees [6,7] or more advanced deep convolutional neural networks [8]. Looking forward, this penetration of AI opens new challenges, such as interpretability of deep learning (to enable use AI in an accountable way as well as to enable AI-inspired low-complexity algorithms) and applicability in systems which require low-complexity solutions and/or do not have enough training data. However, overall further benefits of these new approaches include automatization of many traditional production tasks which has the potential to transform the way content providers make their programmes in cheaper and more effective ways.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3347449.3357490", "venue": "AI4TV '19", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2988890341", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["144208088", "174802377", "199543688", "146081297", "133605724"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207758957"}

The sampling-based reliability analysis requires only the classification information \u2014 a success or a failure \u2013 but the response surface methods provide real function values as their output, which requires more computational effort. The problem is even more challenging to deal with high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. In the newly proposed virtual support vector machine (VSVM), virtual samples are generated near the limit state function by using linear or Kriging-based approximations. The exact function values are used for approximations of virtual samples to improve accuracy of the resulting VSVM decision function. By introducing the virtual samples, VSVM can overcome the deficiency in existing classification methods where only classified function values are used as their input. The universal Kriging method is used to obtain virtual samples to improve the accuracy of the decision function for highly nonlinear problems. A sequential sampling strategy that chooses a new sample near the true limit state function is integrated with VSVM to maximize the accuracy. Examples show the proposed adaptive VSVM yields better efficiency in terms of the modeling time and the number of required samples while maintaining similar level or better accuracy especially for high-dimensional problems.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2011-47538", "venue": "DAC 2011", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1990320099", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60313560", "110689343", "123031421", "125486812", "134748278", "11628438", "59358766", "26257441", "111298514", "117073841", "38967286", "110093963", "28637672", "59342666", "194951", "64266140", "7138354", "207923855", "64543020", "16071085", "15870024", "59972536", "109352352", "403298", "10241552", "236211", "14589538"], "inbound_citations": ["33342341", "33342341", "33342341", "16676904"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11545261"}

Palaeoendemism scores were strongly predicted by constantly moist climates lacking extreme temperatures, and by open vegetation types with rare or no fire. The palaeoendemics occupied a climate space that is globally rare and very different from that of non-palaeoendemics. Main conclusions: ::: ::: These patterns suggest the persistence since the Cretaceous of open vegetation in constantly moist areas with equable temperatures and few or no fires. This conclusion is consistent with an increasing body of fossil and phylogenetic evidence for the antiquity of open vegetation. The methods here produce quantitative values of palaeoendemism that can be compared among regions.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/geb.12389", "venue": null, "journal": "Global Ecology and Biogeography", "mag_id": "2108564091", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210921798", "56224002", "6480650", "24033212", "89198030", "90420479"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86371698"}

However, most of these methods suffer from two problems. First, the incremental dimensionality reduction problem, which means the algorithms cannot compute the embedding of new added data incrementally. Second, the high dimensional data reconstruction problem, which means the algorithms cannot recover the original high dimensional data from the embeddings. Both problems limit the application of the existing DR algorithms. In this paper, a dictionary-based algorithm for manifold learning is proposed to address the problems of incremental dimensionality reduction and high dimensional data reconstruction. In this algorithm, two dictionaries are trained. One is for the manifold in the high dimensional space and the other one is for the embeddings which can be computed by any existing DR method in the low dimensional space. When new data is added, dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction can just be conducted by coding this input data over one dictionary, and then use this code to recover the output data via the other dictionary. The proposed algorithm provides a general framework for manifold learning. It can be integrated into many existing DR algorithms to make them feasible to both incremental dimensionality reduction and high dimensional data reconstruction. The algorithm is efficient due to the closed-form solution for sparse coding and dictionary updating. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is space-saving because it only needs to store two dictionaries instead of the whole training samples.

One of the main reasons that CNNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy is using many multi-scale learnable windowed feature detectors called kernels. Fetching of kernel feature weights from memory and performing the associated multiply and accumulate computations consume massive amount of energy. This hinders the widespread usage of CNNs, especially in embedded devices. In comparison with CNNs, decision forests are computationally efficient since they are composed of decision trees, which are binary classifiers by nature and can be implemented using AND-OR gates instead of costly multiply and accumulate units. In this paper, we investigate the migration of CNNs to decision forests as one of the promising approaches for reducing both execution time and power consumption while achieving acceptable accuracy. We introduce POLYCiNN, an architecture composed of a stack of decision forests. Each decision forest classifies one of the overlapped sub-images of the original image. Then, all decision forest classifications are fused together to classify the input image. In POLYCiNN, each decision tree is implemented in a single 6-input Look-Up Table and requires no memory access. Therefore, POLYCiNN can be efficiently mapped to simple and densely parallel hardware designs.

In the next level of complexity, neural net was trained to operate a stack memory to recognize context free sequences.

The first stage shifts the object so that the centroid of the object coincides with the center of the image plane. The second stage is a variation of the polar- coordinate transformation used to obtain two N-dimensional representations of the input object.

The third stage is a variation of the rapid transform, which provides invariant representations of cyclic-shift inputs.

Speech is one of the easily available biometrics in today's hi-tech world. But, most of the speech biometric evidence acquired for investigative purposes will usually be highly distorted. Among these distortions, most prominent is the distortion introduced by the speech codec. Speech codec may either remove or distort some of the speaker-specific features, and this may reduce the speaker verification accuracy. The effect of distortion on commonly used speaker-specific features namely Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (PNCC), due to Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) codec (the most widely used speech codec in today's mobile telephony), is quantified in this paper. The features which are least affected by the codec are experimentally determined as PNCC. But, when these PNCC coefficients are directly employed, speaker verification error rate obtained is 20% with Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) classifier. To improve the verification accuracy, PNCCs are slightly modified, and these modified PNCCs (MPNCC) are used as the feature set for the speaker verification. With these modified PNCCs, the error rate is reduced to 15%. By fusing these MPNCCs with MFCC, the error rate is further reduced to 8.75%. A series combination of GMM-UBM and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers is also proposed here to enhance the speaker verification accuracy further. The speaker verification error rates for different baseline classifiers are compared with that of the proposed serially combined GMM-UBM and SVM classifiers. The classifier fusion with the fused feature set largely reduced the error rates to 2.5% which is very much less than that of baseline classifiers with normal PNCC features.

The ozone molecule (O3), outside of ozone layer, is harmful to the air quality. This paper focuses on two predictive models which are used to calculate the approximate amount of ozone gas in air. The models being, Random Forest and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. By evaluating the prediction models, it was found that Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines model has a better prediction accuracy than Random Forest as it produced better datasets. A thorough comparative study on the performances of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Random Forest was performed. Also, variable importance for each prediction model was predicted. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines provides the result by using less variables as compared to the other prediction model. Furthermore, Random Forest model generally takes more time, here it took 45 s more as per the evaluation for building the tree. Monitoring the different graphs produced by the models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines provides the closest curve for both the train set and test set when compared.

The considerable reduction in size and energy consumption of CMOS circuitry together with the self-organizational capability of network nodes are leading WSNs to be ubiquitous. WSNs operate under very strict energy constraints and the power supply is usually the most expensive component of the node being designed. This study proposes a methodology to reduce the power consumption by means of an energy-efficient management of node resources and tasks. We focus our attention on hydrometric level sensors. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to predict the nonlinear dynamics of hydrometric level given a limited set of previous measurements. The procedure takes the error committed by the predictor and the battery charge status as input parameters. Based on the input state, fuzzy logic (FL) is used to infer the most appropriate sensor sampling rate and the need to transmit real-time data to the gateway node. The idea is that when battery charge is low and no flood events are occurring, then data transmission can be deferred and sampling rate can be decreased.

In this regard, deterministic and probabilistic models have been proposed for generalizing MPs to new task parameters, thus providing limited generalization. Although generalization of MPs using probabilistic models has been studied, it is not clear how such generalizable models can be learned efficiently. Reinforcement learning can be more efficient when the exploration process is tuned with data uncertainty, thus reducing unnecessary exploration in a data-efficient way. We propose an empirical Bayes method to predict uncertainty and utilize it for guiding the exploration process of an incremental learning framework. The online incremental learning framework uses a single human demonstration for constructing a database of MPs. The main ingredients of the proposed framework are a global parametric model (GPDMP) for generalizing MPs for new situations, a model-free policy search agent for optimizing the failed predicted MPs, model selection for controlling the complexity of GPDMp, and empirical Bayes for extracting the uncertainty of MPs prediction. Experiments with a ball-in-a-cup task demonstrate that the global GPDMP model generalizes significantly better than linear models and Locally Weighted Regression especially in terms of extrapolation capability. Furthermore, the model selection has successfully identified the required complexity of GPDMP even with few training samples while satisfying the Occam Razor's prinicple. Above all, the uncertainty predicted by the proposed empirical Bayes approach successfully guided the exploration process of the model-free policy search.

As a consequence, it has become more difficult for companies to obtain a loan. Many people and companies leave a trail of information about themselves on the Internet. Searching and extracting this information is accompanied with uncertainty. In this research, we study whether this uncertain online information can be used as an alternative or extra indicator for estimating a company's creditworthiness and how accounting for information uncertainty impacts the prediction performance. A data set consisting 3579 corporate ratings has been constructed using the data of an external data provider. Based on the results of a survey, a literature study and information availability tests, LinkedIn accounts of company owners, corporate Twitter accounts and corporate Facebook accounts were chosen as an information source for extracting indicators. In total, the Twitter and Facebook accounts of 387 companies and 436 corresponding LinkedIn owner accounts of this data set were manually searched. Information was harvested from these sources and several indicators have been derived from the harvested information. Two experiments were performed with this data. In the first experiment, a Naive Bayes, J48, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifier was trained and tested using solely these Internet features. A comparison of their accuracy to the 31% accuracy of the ZeroR classifier, which as a rule always predicts the most occurring target class, showed that none of the models performed statistically better. In a second experiment, it was tested whether combining Internet features with financial data increases the accuracy. A financial data mining model was created that approximates the rating model of the ratings in our data set and that uses the same financial data as the rating model. The two best performing financial models were built using the Random Forest and J48 classifiers with an accuracy of 68% and 63% respectively. Adding Internet features to these models gave mixed results with a significant decrease and an insignificant increase respectively. An experimental setup for testing how incorporating uncertainty affects the prediction accuracy of our model is explained. As part of this setup, a search system is described to find candidate results of online information related to a subject and to classify the degree of uncertainty of this online information. It is illustrated how uncertainty can be incorporated into the data mining process.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1872153670", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["167217443"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109473929"}

In contrast, we show in this paper that GANs can in principle learn distributions in Wasserstein distance (or KL-divergence in many cases) with polynomial sample complexity, if the discriminator class has strong distinguishing power against the particular generator class (instead of against all possible generators). For various generator classes such as mixture of Gaussians, exponential families, and invertible neural networks generators, we design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets of specific architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) induced by the discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance and/or KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the learned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance or KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes.

Knowledge of wetland species distribution is critical for sustainable management and resource assessment. In this study, multi-temporal single- and full-polarized RADARSAT-2 and single-polarized TerraSAR-X data were applied to characterize the wetland extent of a test site located in the north east of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The accuracy and information content of wetland maps using remote sensing data depend on several factors, such as the type of data, input features, classification algorithms, and ecological characteristics of wetland classes. Most previous wetland studies examined the efficiency of one or two feature types, including intensity and polarimetry. Fewer investigations have examined the potential of interferometric coherence for wetland mapping. Thus, we evaluated the efficiency of using multiple feature types, including intensity, interferometric coherence, and polarimetric scattering for wetland mapping in multiple classification scenarios. An ensemble classifier, namely Random Forest (RF), and a kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) were also used to determine the effect of the classifier. In all classification scenarios, SVM outperformed RF by 1.5\u20135%. The classification results demonstrated that the intensity features had a higher accuracy relative to coherence and polarimetric features. However, an inclusion of all feature types improved the classification accuracy for both RF and SVM classifiers.

The machine learning approach to activity recognition consists on finding the signatures characterizing the activities to be recognized, with the hope of identifying them (pattern matching) within the stream of sensor data. The finding of those signatures can be very complex, thus many approaches deal with the streams of sensor data by segmenting them into sections or \u201ctime-windows\u201d, before processing them by a feature extraction procedure. The problem then concerns the association of features to class labels. In this paper, we propose the use of the Gamma Growing Neural Gas algorithm to unsupervisely discover templates in a recording containing gestures performed by a person in a home environment. The system is able to do vector quantization from the time-series of data coming from one accelerometer, and finds salient patterns (e.g., templates) in the signal. These templates integrate information not only from single time-windows but do consider the recent history of the incoming signal (e.g., multiple time-windows). Those templates are then associated to activity classes by supervised learning.

We address this problem by segmenting the parts of objects at an instance-level, such that each pixel in the image is assigned a part label, as well as the identity of the object it belongs to. Moreover, we show how this approach benefits us in obtaining segmentations at coarser granularities as well. Our proposed network is trained end-to-end given detections, and begins with a category-level segmentation module. Thereafter, a differentiable Conditional Random Field, defined over a variable number of instances for every input image, reasons about the identity of each part by associating it with a human detection.

Data-driven soft sensors infer the process quality variables from the available historical process data. A considerable amount of process data such as pressures, temperatures, etc., are measured routinely and stored permanently. However, the quality of these data often varies. Measurement noises and data outliers are the most common effects which lead to poor quality of process data. Application of standard statistical techniques to operate data may lead to model deterioration due to contaminating observations. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present a robust approach for the development of data-driven soft sensors. In this paper, the modeling method that is used to develop soft sensor is a combination of Nonlinear Auto Regressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) structure with Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR). The LSSVRs' parameters are optimized by a new evolutionary optimization technique known as the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA). Then in order to make the soft sensor robust against the data outliers and noises especially the long tail noises, a new approach is proposed. The proposed method is based on the Iteratively Weighted LSSVR (IWLSSVR) which uses the Myriad weighting function. The proposed approach was applied to the prediction of the n-butane ( C 4) concentration in a debutanizer column unit. The technique was consequently compared against the conventional LSSVR algorithm which is based on the quadratic loss function. It turns out that reweighting the LSSVR estimate using the Myriad weight function improves the performance of the LSSVR-based soft sensor when noises and outliers exist in the measured data. The designed robust soft sensor is also compared with another robust soft sensor which is recently developed based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) optimized by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The simulation results show that the designed IWLSSVR-based soft sensor is more robust when the measured data have some impurities.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jngse.2014.11.017", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "1988832001", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3438661", "4539549", "111699503", "212706159", "8876641"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109082323"}

The fuzzy techniques are applied as a first level classifier to classify the risk levels of epilepsy based on extracted parameters which include parameters like energy, variance, peaks, sharp spike waves, duration, events and covariance from the EEG signals of the patient. Support Vector Machine (SVM) may be identified as a post classifier on the classified data to obtain the optimized risk level that characterizes the patient's epilepsy risk level. Epileptic seizures result from a sudden electrical disturbance to the brain. Approximately one in every 100 persons will experience a seizure at some time in their life. Some times seizures may go unnoticed, depending on their presentation which may be confused with other events, such as a stroke, which can also cause falls or migraines. Unfortunately, the occurrence of an epileptic seizure seems unpredictable and its process is very little understood The Performance Index (PI) and Quality Value (QV) are calculated for the above methods. A group of twenty patients with known epilepsy findings are used in this study. High PI such as 98.5% was obtained at QV's of 22.94, for SVM optimization when compared to the value of 40% and 6.25 through fuzzy techniques respectively. We find that the SVM Method out performs Fuzzy Techniques in optimizing the epilepsy risk levels. In India number of persons are suffering from Epilepsy are increasing every year.

Since the data used in this study is observational (i.e., collected outside the purview of a designed experiment); an information discovery approach is adopted for this study. Random Forests, which are ensembles of individual trees grown by CART (Classification and regression tree) algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this purpose. However, recent research has shown that the \u2018Gini index\u2019 criterion used in the algorithm is biased towards continuous variables or categorical variables with more levels. Since the \u2018Gini index\u2019 criterion searches for a favorable split, the chance of finding one increases if the variable satisfies the above criteria. The fallout is that a variable could be selected even though it\u2019s not particularly informative in terms of its relationship with the target variable. To overcome this issue conditional inference forests have been implemented. In each tree of the conditional inference forest, splits are based on how good the association is, i.e., the resulting daughter node should have a higher association with the binary dependent variable. Chi-square test statistics are used to measure the association. Apart from identifying the variables which improve classification accuracy, the methodology also clearly identifies the variables which are neutral to accuracy and also those which decrease it. The methodology is quite insightful in identifying the variables of interest in the database. For example, the usual suspects like alcohol/ drug use and higher posted speed limits are contributing to severe crashes. Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of driver/passenger in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 years) increased the severity of crashes. A new variable, \u2018element\u2019 has been used in this study which assigns crashes to segments, intersections or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control and presence of signals. The authors were able to identify roadway locations where severe crashes tend to occur. For example, segments and access points were found to be riskier for single vehicle crashes. Higher skid resistance and k-factor also contributed towards increased severity of crashes.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "565115352", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108266497"}

Salt segmentation on seismic data is a challenging task due to several aspects. In general, the salt structures have a very complex geometrical shape, hence is more complicated to define an a-priori geometric model than in layered environments. The high impedance contrast at vicinity of salt reduces dramatically the seismic energy propagating through the salt bodies. This makes difficult to illuminate pre-salt targets, and to correctly model salt boundaries. In modern interpretative processing workflows salt modeling is one key aspect to effectively produce accurate seismic images near the salt. The main object of this research is to develop an automatic salt segmentation solution.

All the nodes in a tree use the same set of random weights but different from the set of weights in other trees. So, the importance given to the attributes will be different in each tree and that will differentiate their construction. The method is compared to Bagging, Random Forest, Random-Subspaces, AdaBoost and MultiBoost, obtaining favourable results for the proposed method, especially when using noisy data sets.

In recent years gene expression data have been successfully used to complement the clinical and histological criteria traditionally used in such prediction. Many \"gene expression signatures\" have been developed, i.e. sets of genes whose expression values in a tumor can be used to predict the outcome of the pathology. Here we investigate the use of several machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer patients using one of such signatures, the well established 70-gene signature.ResultsWe show that Genetic Programming performs significantly better than Support Vector Machines, Multilayered Perceptrons and Random Forests in classifying patients from the NKI breast cancer dataset, and comparably to the scoring-based method originally proposed by the authors of the 70-gene signature. Furthermore, Genetic Programming is able to perform an automatic feature selection.ConclusionsSince the performance of Genetic Programming is likely to be improvable compared to the out-of-the-box approach used here, and given the biological insight potentially provided by the Genetic Programming solutions, we conclude that Genetic Programming methods are worth further investigation as a tool for cancer patient classification based on gene expression data.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3108919", "pubmed_id": "21569330", "doi": "10.1186/1756-0381-4-12", "venue": "BioData Mining", "journal": "BioData Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2143972711", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["21092844", "23916430", "13738123", "9466924", "9061359", "14888951", "207720429", "8784315", "53303729", "7694246", "20832024", "567097", "39116639", "7779856", "9649983", "8584167", "58317776", "60577818", "60993494", "89141"], "inbound_citations": ["53712848", "215212050", "201124851", "53032142", "132259313", "13425496", "6216139", "53105530", "215251278", "59496480", "17156958", "195189293", "206859397", "5835407", "11852825", "3839183", "52156017", "215335705", "2828056", "6590812"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15416698"}

Yet the drivers of this process remain unclear, with a range of local and global factors postulated. The traditional ecological narrative dictates that shrub encroachment is a localised phenomenon, resulting from poor land management regimes. The most frequently proposed mechanisms are overgrazing and suppression of fire, both of which are common management techniques in sub-Saharan Africa. More recently, increased focus has been directed at the role of global factors in woody cover dynamics. As savannah woody cover is constrained by both total and wet season rainfall, changes in precipitation regime have been proposed as drivers of shrub encroachment. This theory has been supported by small-scale field experiments showing shrubs disproportionally benefiting from increases in rainfall frequency, amount, and variability. A further potential global factor is the ongoing rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the industrial revolution. A theoretical understanding of water limitations to woody cover in savannahs makes it reasonable to assume that CO2-driven increases would be concentrated in water-limited environments. This has been observed across South Africa using aerial photography and globally using satellite-derived Rain Use Efficiency (RUE). Here, we combine satellite-derived fractional woody cover maps with a suite of potentially explanatory variables, to elucidate on the potential drivers and mechanisms of woody cover change, in South African savannahs. The study area consists of the Limpopo and North West Provinces in northern South Africa. These municipalities cover a plurality of the savannah biome within South Africa (193,200 km2, 49% of the total savannah area), in addition to containing 33,830 km2 of grassland. More specifically, we test the three, abovementioned, competing hypotheses on the drivers of woody encroachment for South African savannahs. Our modelling framework was developed using Generalised Additive Models (GAM). We collated a series of 11 variables that have a hypothetical basis for explaining woody cover changes. These variables can be grouped into three categories: rainfall-derived, human, and natural factors. Fractional woody cover changes were mapped using Landsat-derived % woody cover layers, based on the methodology developed in Higginbottom et al. (2018, ISPRS Journal Ph&RS, 139, 88-102). In summary, two five-year epochs (1984-1988 and 2008-2012) of Landsat imagery were used to generate pixel-level seasonal spectral variability metrics, at 120 m resolution. Reducing the pixel resolutions improves the classification accuracies, and is more suited for observing overall trends. High-resolution imagery were classified into woody/non woody masks, and used as training data for a Random Forest regression for the fractional cover of each 120m-pixel. The Random Forest model was applied to the Landsat metric stacks to generate the two epochal maps. We then calculated both the absolute percentage change, and the relative percentage change in woody cover between the two maps. The fitted models had R2 values of 0.39 for absolute change and 0.41 for relative change. The results show that the modelled variables most closely matched the a-priori responses of the carbon fertilisation hypothesis. In recent years, this explanation has been postulated by studies using a variety of methods to account for the observed woody encroachment. Further work in this arena is still necessary, particularly where the data sources are sub-optimal. Land-use history and rainfall dynamics are especially difficult to quantify and would require further investigation. Furthermore, additional factors, such as reactive nitrogen deposition and mega-fauna extinctions, are likely to be relevant but where not included in our models. If carbon fertilisation is the key driver of shrub encroachment in savannahs, it would raise concerns for future environmental change: as CO2 levels continue to rise more savannahs and grassland are likely to experience an increase in woody cover levels, which has been linked to savannah land degradation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2985601629", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210263577"}

The proposed EMD-KRR model is tested for predicting wind speed and wind power time series data over a time horizon spanning intervals of 10 min, 30 min, 1 h and 3 h ahead, respectively. Further the performance of EMD-KRR prediction model is compared with two other widely used non-iterative prediction models like EMD based Random vector functional link network (RVFL), and EMD based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Also an iterative Mutated Firefly Algorithm with Global Optima concept (MFAGO) optimized RVFL network is used for comparison to prove the advantages of non-iterative models over the iterative ones. The performance metrics of the proposed EMD-KRR and EMD-RVFL confirm the effectiveness and precision in producing an accurate forecast of both wind speed and wind power in comparison to all other prediction models using the wind power data from three real world wind farms.

Transfer Learning aims to utilize the learned knowledge from source tasks to help new tasks to improve the sample complexity of the new tasks. Considering that data collection in RL is both more time and cost consuming and Q-learning converges slowly comparing to supervised learning, different kinds of transfer RL algorithms are designed. However, most of them are heuristic with no theoretical guarantee of the convergence rate. Therefore, it is important for us to clearly understand when and how will transfer learning help RL method and provide the theoretical guarantee for the improvement of the sample complexity. In this paper, we propose to transfer the Q-function learned in the source task to the target of the Q-learning in the new task when certain safe conditions are satisfied. We call this new transfer Q-learning method target transfer Q-Learning. The safe conditions are necessary to avoid the harm to the new tasks and thus ensure the convergence of the algorithm. We study the convergence rate of the target transfer Q-learning. We prove that if the two tasks are similar with respect to the MDPs, the optimal Q-functions in the source and new RL tasks are similar which means the error of the transferred target Q-function in new MDP is small. Also, the convergence rate analysis shows that the target transfer Q-Learning will converge faster than Q-learning if the error of the transferred target Q-function is smaller than the current Q-function in the new task. Based on our theoretical results, we design the safe condition as the Bellman error of the transferred target Q-function is less than the current Q-function.

In spite of the existence of various efficient community detection algorithms in the literature, most of them uses global information about the network, not applicable to distributed networks. This paper proposes a genetic-based algorithm to detect communities in directed networks based on local information to generate the offspring.

This step is directly influenced by the crossover operator that depends largely on the individual representation. In the introduced strategy, GA-LP, the individual is locally stored in the vertices as labels, what brings more flexibility in the system to be adapted to address applications that involve, for example, dynamic networks.

To address this limitation, we propose a new approach for clustering, called semi-crowdsourced clustering that effectively combines the low-level features of objects with the manual annotations of a subset of the objects obtained via crowdsourcing. The key idea is to learn an appropriate similarity measure, based on the low-level features of objects and from the manual annotations of only a small portion of the data to be clustered. One difficulty in learning the pairwise similarity measure is that there is a significant amount of noise and inter-worker variations in the manual annotations obtained via crowdsourcing.

Waveform metrics derived from basic statistics e.g. percentile of energy of the lidar waveform, such as canopy height and height of median energy, have been applied to biomass estimation in numerous studies. In this study, a set of metrics based on Gaussian decomposition GD results were developed and evaluated for forest above-ground biomass estimation using NASA\u2019s laser vegetation imaging sensor LVIS data. The GD metrics were designed to explicitly incorporate lidar intensity and vertical structures of canopy layers for biomass estimation. The proposed GD metrics used information related to the above-ground height of each Gaussian centroid and the Gaussian area index GAI, where GAI is the area covered by a Gaussian function. Two types of novel GD metrics were developed: 1 percentile-height GAI metrics expressing the GAI summation of a subset of Gaussian centroids located within a certain percentile height range; and 2 height-weighted GAI metrics, a summation of GAIs of a waveform weighted by the corresponding heights of their Gaussian centroids. A biomass regression model was built by eight newly developed GD metrics using GAI information and five pre-existing GD-derived metrics that have not previously been used for biomass estimation. The performance of the regression model was then compared to another regression model using 12 previously published metrics non-GD metrics. The Random Forests RF regression algorithm was employed for predicting biomass. The RF out-of-bag results indicated that above-ground biomass estimations using GD metrics achieved significantly better results than those derived from non-GD metrics for deciduous plots 19% lower root mean square error RMSE, 25% higher coefficient of determination R2, and marginally better results in coniferous plots 4% lower RSME, 6% higher R2. The combination of GD and non-GD metrics achieved comparable biomass estimation results to the model using exclusively GD metrics. GD metrics also showed strong correlation with forest attributes such as mean diameter at breast height DBH and stem density.

An abundant literature covers the last two decades and several softwares are now available. However, urban areas are very complex environments. Inevitably, practitioners still have to visually assess, at city-scale, the correctness of these models and detect frequent reconstruction errors. Such a process relies on experts, and is highly time-consuming with approximately two hours/km 2 per expert. This work proposes an approach for automatically evaluating the quality of 3D building models. Potential errors are compiled in a novel hierarchical and versatile taxonomy. This allows, for the first time, to disentangle fidelity and modeling errors, whatever the level of details of the modeled buildings. The quality of models is predicted using the geometric properties of buildings and, when available, Very High Resolution images and Digital Surface Models. A baseline of handcrafted, yet generic, features is fed into a Random Forest classifier. Both multi-class and multi-label cases are considered: due to the interdependence between classes of errors, it is possible to retrieve all errors at the same time while simply predicting correct and erroneous buildings.

In this avenue, manifold learning has been applied to embed nonlinear image data in lower dimensional spaces for subsequent analysis. The result allows a geometric interpretation of image spaces with relevant consequences for data topology, computation of image similarity, discriminant analysis/classification tasks and, more recently, for deep learning issues. In this paper, we firstly review Riemannian manifolds that compose the mathematical background in this field. Such background offers the support to set up a data model that embeds usual linear subspace learning and discriminant analysis results in local structures built from samples drawn from some unknown distribution. Afterwards, we discuss topological issues in data preparation for manifold learning algorithms as well as the determination of manifold dimension. Then, we survey dimensionality reduction techniques with particular attention to Riemannian manifold learning. Besides, we discuss the application of concepts in discrete and polyhedral geometry for synthesis and data clustering over the recovered Riemannian manifold with emphasis in face images in the computational experiments. Next, we discuss promising perspectives of manifold learning and related topics for image analysis, classification and relationships with deep learning methods.

In this paper, we study Mondrian Forests in a batch setting and prove their consistency assuming a proper tuning of the lifetime sequence. A thorough theoretical study of Mondrian partitions allows us to derive an upper bound for the risk of Mondrian Forests, which turns out to be the minimax optimal rate for both Lipschitz and twice differentiable regression functions. These results are actually the first to state that some particular random forests achieve minimax rates \\textit{in arbitrary dimension}, paving the way to a refined theoretical analysis and thus a deeper understanding of these black box algorithms.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.05784", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2793869429", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["9653974", "925063", "14463568", "1290347", "14518730", "10844956", "89141", "123042984", "8079788", "8758844", "116929976", "121989827", "15137276", "43315484", "6007004", "165022", "42825955", "118861904", "566759", "1075580", "7588185", "7724157", "8869713", "153583", "15676251", "123964735", "532478"], "inbound_citations": ["195584509", "211678099"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53665727"}

The first problem is representing each sequence as a feature vector, and the second is designing a model that can identify the protein interactions. Thus, effective feature extraction methods can lead to improved model performance. In this study, we used two types of feature extraction methods-global encoding and pseudo-substitution matrix representation (PseudoSMR)-to represent the sequences of amino acids in human proteins and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) to address the classification problem of predicting protein-protein interactions. We also compared principal component analysis (PCA) with independent principal component analysis (IPCA) as methods for transforming Rotation Forest. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The results show that using global encoding and PseudoSMR as a feature extraction method successfully represents the amino acid sequence for the Rotation Forest classifier with PCA or with IPCA. This can be seen from the comparison of the results of evaluation metrics, which were >73% across the six different parameters. The accuracy of both methods was >74%. The results for the other model performance criteria, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score, were all >73%.

An important line of research in the MTL is the robust MTL (RMTL) methods, which use trace-norm regularization to capture task relatedness via a low-rank structure. The existing algorithms for the RMTL optimization problems rely on the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) scheme that needs repeated full singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. However, the time complexity of a full SVD is $O(\\min (md^{2},m^{2}d))$ for an RMTL problem with $m$ tasks and $d$ features, which becomes unaffordable in real-world MTL applications that often have a large number of tasks and high-dimensional features. In this paper, we propose a scalable solution for large-scale RMTL, with either the least squares loss or the squared hinge loss, by a divide-and-conquer method. The proposed method divides the original RMTL problem into several size-reduced subproblems, solves these cheaper subproblems in parallel by any base algorithm (e.g., APG) for RMTL, and then combines the results to obtain the final solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that, with high probability, the recovery errors of the proposed divide-and-conquer algorithm are bounded by those of the base algorithm. Furthermore, in order to solve the subproblems with the least squares loss or the squared hinge loss, we propose two efficient base algorithms based on the linearized alternating direction method, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, with little loss of accuracy, our method is substantially faster than the state-of-the-art APG algorithms for RMTL.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25775500", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2406759", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2097154431", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13650160", "14655047", "472227", "13945520", "207752942", "16193644", "13895067", "156436", "12833219", "12817931", "17228944", "6418451", "6395450", "2098528", "8084514", "7662718", "11089238", "6617228", "7894269", "7265538", "7128002", "5453786", "1254778", "832721", "16162039", "16727656", "206787478", "122538093", "53662922", "8329460"], "inbound_citations": ["149445038", "69723750", "52057446", "24928086", "126706152", "44071037", "29921801", "4380515"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10590559"}

In this paper, we begin by first analyzing the design defects of feature pyramid in FPN, and then introduce a new feature pyramid architecture named AugFPN to address these problems. Specifically, AugFPN consists of three components: Consistent Supervision, Residual Feature Augmentation, and Soft RoI Selection. AugFPN narrows the semantic gaps between features of different scales before feature fusion through Consistent Supervision. In feature fusion, ratio-invariant context information is extracted by Residual Feature Augmentation to reduce the information loss of feature map at the highest pyramid level. Finally, Soft RoI Selection is employed to learn a better RoI feature adaptively after feature fusion. By replacing FPN with AugFPN in Faster R-CNN, our models achieve 2.3 and 1.6 points higher Average Precision (AP) when using ResNet50 and MobileNet-v2 as backbone respectively.

Specifically, our approach, Learning TO Diversify via Weighted Kernels (L2DWK), performs classifier combination by optimizing a direct but simple criterion: maximizing ensemble accuracy and adaptive diversity simultaneously by minimizing a convex loss function. Given a measure formulation, the diversity is calculated with weighted kernels (i.e., the diversity is measured on the component classifiers' outputs which are kernelled and weighted), and the kernel weights are automatically learned. We minimize this loss function by estimating the kernel weights in conjunction with the classifier weights, and propose a self-training algorithm for conducting this convex optimization procedure iteratively.

Conventionally, depositional microfacies are manually identified by geologists based on the observation of core samples. This conventional method for identifying depositional microfacies is time-consuming, and only the depositional microfacies in a few wells can be identified due to the limited core samples in these wells. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is proposed to identify depositional microfacies automatically using well logs. The application of SVM includes the following steps: First, the depositional microfacies are determined manually in several wells with core samples. Then, the training sets used in the SVM algorithm are extracted from the well logs.

In this study, machine learning was utilized to classify and predict pulse wave of hypertensive group and healthy group and assess the risk of hypertension by observing the dynamic change of the pulse wave and provide an objective reference for clinical application of pulse diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Method. The basic information from 450 hypertensive cases and 479 healthy cases was collected by self-developed H20 questionnaires and pulse wave information was acquired by self-developed pulse diagnostic instrument (PDA-1). H20 questionnaires and pulse wave information were used as input variables to obtain different machine learning classification models of hypertension. This method was aimed at analyzing the influence of pulse wave on the accuracy and stability of machine learning model, as well as the feature contribution of hypertension model after removing noise by K-means. Result. Compared with the classification results before removing noise, the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) had been improved. The accuracy rates of AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest (RF) were 86.41%, 86.41%, and 85.33%, respectively. AUC were 0.86, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively. The maximum accuracy of SVM increased from 79.57% to 83.15%, and the AUC stability increased from 0.79 to 0.83. In addition, the features of importance on traditional statistics and machine learning were consistent. After removing noise, the features with large changes were h1/t1, w1/t, t, w2, h2, t1, and t5 in AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting (top10). The common variables for machine learning and traditional statistics were h1/t1, h5, t, Ad, BMI, and t2. Conclusion.

The local manifold regularization can well capture local saliency cues. However, its local-to-global mechanism often ignores the completeness of salient objects especially when the contrast between the foreground and background is low, while the global regularization can discover the long-range semantic structure but easily neglect the details. To comprehensively utilize their advantages, we respectively construct a local regularizer (LR) and a global regularizer (GR), and incorporate them into the SVM models, which are then self-trained across superpixels by pseudo labeled ones. The LR-SVM and GR-SVM models are further refined by updating training sample with higher-level object proposals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art saliency detection methods.

The main reason is attributed to the application of slow gradient-based algorithms, and the model parameter of the networks is estimated iteratively and hence, ELM has been widely used in real-life applications due to its fast and easy way of learning. The ill-conditioning of the input-to\u2013hidden layer matrix reduces the stability of ELM and the regularization is employed to overcome this problem. In general, Tikhonov ( l 2 -norm based) and Lasso ( l 1 -norm based) techniques are widely used regularization techniques applied in the current work. The choice of the regularization parameter affects the performance of either of the regularized ELM. The singular value decomposition based generalized cross-validation method is also used in the literature for automatically estimating the value of the regularization parameter. This method increases the computational complexity, as it involves the repeated inversion of a large matrix. In the proposed methods, the regularized Minimum Residual Method (MRM) is adopted along with the Golden-section line search to find the optimal value of the regularization parameter. One of the important contributions of the proposed work is to suitably modify MRM to estimate the regularization parameter for the Lasso technique. MT-ELM is a l 2 -norm regularization based ELM method where the regularization parameter is estimated using MRM. Similarly, ML-ELM is a l 1 -norm regularization based ELM method where the regularization parameter is estimated using a suitable MRM. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, experiments are carried out on several benchmark classification data sets and are compared on several performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 -score. Through the extensive numerical results and floating point operation counts, it is shown that the proposed MRM-based methods are capable of estimating the regularization parameter optimally compare to the existing ones. It is also observed that the proposed methods improve the accuracy measure by seven per cent compared to the conventional ELM, thus enhancing the capability of ELM.

A novel feature of this work is the use of a general purpose semantic tagger \u2013 the USAS tagger \u2013 to generate features. Background We outline the application context for this work (the BioCaster epidemiological text mining system), before going on to describe the experimental data used in our classification experiments (the 1000 document BioCaster corpus). Feature sets Three broad groups of features are used in this work: Named Entity based features, n-gram features, and features derived from the USAS semantic tagger. Methodology Three standard machine learning algorithms \u2013 Naive Bayes, the Support Vector Machine algorithm, and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm \u2013 were used for classifying experimental data (that is, the BioCaster corpus). Feature selection was performed using the \u03c7 2 feature selection algorithm. Standard text classification performance metrics \u2013 Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity and F -score \u2013 are reported. Results A feature representation composed of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and features derived from a semantic tagger, in conjunction with the Naive Bayes algorithm and feature selection yielded the highest classification accuracy (and F -score). This result was statistically significant compared to a baseline unigram representation and to previous work on the same task. However, it was feature selection rather than semantic tagging that contributed most to the improved performance. Conclusion This study has shown that for the classification of disease outbreak reports, a combination of bag-of-words, n-grams and semantic features, in conjunction with feature selection, increases classification accuracy at a statistically significant level compared to previous work in this domain.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19447070", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.03.010", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2611876886,2022377934", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1755700", "10915911", "16467426", "9027460", "809191", "25225364", "2330598", "60458454", "143447301", "14498663", "1947631", "16567111", "12439248", "140109802", "5083193"], "inbound_citations": ["78090398", "17889383", "12412559", "16142539", "214816766", "6430524", "53057625", "215518036", "62329206", "11275982", "7919794", "750037", "2886343", "58577304", "14814912", "51910764", "11095441", "52841448", "3420416", "16832174", "15262978", "2890660", "632653", "3950821", "2775664", "205712574", "18201324", "215274757", "6104649", "15838114", "16703290", "10974019"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18870943"}

Such an instance-level transfer problem is more challenging than conventional domain-level transfer tasks, especially when paired data is unavailable. Makeup style is also different from global styles (e.g., paintings) in that it consists of several local styles/cosmetics, including eye shadow, lipstick, foundation, and so on. Extracting and transferring such local and delicate makeup information is infeasible for existing style transfer methods. We address the issue by incorporating both global domain-level loss and local instance-level loss in an dual input/output Generative Adversarial Network, called BeautyGAN. Specifically, the domain-level transfer is ensured by discriminators that distinguish generated images from domains' real samples. The instance-level loss is calculated by pixel-level histogram loss on separate local facial regions. We further introduce perceptual loss and cycle consistency loss to generate high quality faces and preserve identity. The overall objective function enables the network to learn translation on instance-level through unsupervised adversarial learning. We also build up a new makeup dataset that consists of 3834 high-resolution face images.

Experiments on accelerometer data from four publicly available activity recognition datasets demonstrate the significant potential of our approach to address both contemporary activity recognition tasks and next generation problems such as skill assessment and the detection of novel activities.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5591/978-1-57735-516-8/IJCAI11-290", "venue": "IJCAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "22482183", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2170109", "1912854"], "inbound_citations": ["18484355", "67787927", "570992", "59236638", "1014220", "2945098", "7870225", "14025144", "111714508", "53712578", "109926907", "54064988", "210993324", "16763006", "2282097", "4514338", "15510387", "36550731", "7551351", "17116150", "53032806", "269338", "27511116", "53024967", "211686987", "8553730", "12570890", "21710823", "20443520", "26608482", "53435673", "2333743", "18457118", "3997714", "53968354", "26107090", "196001152", "53189983", "49428582", "17438964", "13610395", "4436428", "11133988", "38844858", "10721272", "18607499", "214816135", "26544554", "171091861", "11151160", "195357258", "6395413", "24701722", "18404513", "49535717", "73467380", "43958917", "56173445", "208107924", "204246601", "57754966", "203700", "7626104", "36367356", "22663560", "210698372", "40542965", "198172093", "6377626", "3951404", "3233172", "16342116", "198146637", "5687667", "49297963", "13195869", "9306975", "52297844", "52821990", "52179260", "52309268", "214605693", "202159276", "202159276", "204749681", "11450608", "210838728", "85528308", "9326192", "46955439", "53345288", "202159562", "52148716", "55509771", "5395311", "202159268", "10985974", "195664819", "195777791", "209459718", "202567918", "29028964", "46823051", "52931598", "43953426", "19221181", "49551723", "15613179", "52984847", "88489164", "204916061", "15333320", "697754", "47716077", "1078903", "28639814", "44104961", "16721833", "14761852", "51736220", "53948313", "67859113", "18787607", "15295658", "53030574", "49902207", "207330385", "43945673", "3754968", "19000794", "52943195", "15321881", "214890197", "52943286", "211507001", "208838916", "16426092", "61848724", "61848724", "52929379", "204230946", "19476662", "53150145", "67882802", "13021806", "202677373", "211523919", "202541688", "15520470"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8020936"}

A modified Support Vector Machine (SVM) based framework is proposed to estimate annual precipitation using oceanic-atmospheric oscillations. Oceanic-atmospheric oscillations, consisting of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and El Nino\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for a period of 1900\u20132008, are used to generate annual precipitation estimates with a 1 year lead time. The SVM model is applied to 17 climate divisions encompassing the Colorado River Basin in the western United States. The overall results revealed that the annual precipitation in the Colorado River Basin is significantly influenced by oceanic-atmospheric oscillations. The long-term precipitation predictions for the Upper Colorado River Basin can be successfully obtained using a combination of PDO, NAO, and AMO indices, whereas coupling AMO and ENSO results in improved precipitation predictions for the Lower Colorado River Basin. The results also show that the SVM model provides better precipitation estimates compared to the Artificial Neural Network and Multivariate Linear Regression models. The annual precipitation estimates obtained using the modified SVM modeling framework may assist water managers in statistically understanding the hydrologic response in relation to large scale climate patterns within the Colorado River Basin.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1029/2011WR010667", "venue": null, "journal": "Water Resources Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1987218732,2616150360", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["154431189", "110510566", "109154981", "128687360", "154705202", "122616310", "128402690", "62837195", "55397565", "10056773", "55834642", "129096940", "140624229", "207165665", "122756393", "14342008", "128547222", "129890706", "131211755", "53400036", "129152494", "121870542", "128873723", "127559545", "126704573", "128397068", "122850616", "195707283", "56094315", "124426327", "11686652", "53534572", "130276334", "119364084", "4018828", "108781982", "39706541", "129677467", "120871156", "123792878", "12154028", "53978985", "60577818", "55975550", "85556926", "109529081", "123237371", "130615233", "23769140", "140572312", "127235413", "53378798", "26715402", "128495378", "128476144", "121402325", "124431419", "49233429", "30874024", "129427351", "121956809", "120875954", "39988829", "38947600", "1411323", "129780961", "128417849", "18422697", "129479547", "123309705", "130003173", "27418729", "42946462", "3067430", "16933310", "155018369", "11186951", "154456939", "140164618", "129597168", "122872197", "128626919", "438128", "129730851", "31322191", "140668845", "128857222", "1855980", "129240152", "67853194", "129161594", "122205249", "1900499", "14386354", "98771521", "155078231", "129214480", "17440807", "1174681", "15480929", "33327820", "62698647", "16096142", "129292908", "128834046", "128534456", "128619546", "140710493", "23948730", "7138354", "28637672", "153465768", "96410533", "129714308", "129433101", "150384403", "129151228", "53352373", "140595220", "140149602", "129109825"], "inbound_citations": ["148448788", "43975499", "18661569", "182406379", "206943755", "43943356", "134278484", "122961094", "43926110", "43949490", "134249585", "43928607", "114257049", "158945711", "55263397", "43974243", "135424528", "134285971", "130536823", "135065477", "156872408", "154897723"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23872922"}

Such advances triggered the emergence of future generation wireless networks and services to address the increasingly strin- gent requirements of quality-of-service (QoS) at various levels. The expected growth in wireless network activity and the number of wireless users will enable similar growth in bandwidth-crunching wireless applications to meet the QoS requirements. Mobility prediction of wireless users and units plays a major role in efficient planning and manage- ment of the bandwidth resources available in wireless networks. In return, this efficiency will allow better planning and improved overall QoS in terms of continuous service availability and efficient power management. In this paper, we propose extreme learning machines (ELMs), known for universal approximation, to model and predict mobility of arbitrary nodes in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). MANETs use mobility prediction in location-aided routing and mobility aware topology control protocols. In these protocols, each mobile node is assumed to know its current mobility information (position, speed and movement direction angle). In this way, future node positions are predicted along with future distances between neighboring nodes. Unlike multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), ELMs capture better the existing interaction/correlation between the cartesian coordinates of the arbitrary nodes leading to more realistic and accurate mobility prediction based on several standard mobility models. Simulation results using standard mobility models illustrate how the proposed prediction method can lead to a significant improvement over conventional methods based on MLPs. Moreover, the proposed solution circumvents the prediction accuracy limitations in current algorithms when predicting future distances between neighboring nodes. The latter prediction is required by some applications like mobility aware topology control protocols.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2013.06.043", "venue": "ANT/SEIT", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2005757740", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12292381", "17448023", "1585391", "207234968", "15091312", "12606049", "6297942", "27046535", "1539", "17120462", "116858", "18186769"], "inbound_citations": ["2771648", "49562576", "212649336", "3398770", "12187684", "8211394", "30841967", "189928341", "198973479", "59292417", "110177193", "54445396", "17762098", "24894133", "37270655", "88494858", "49405222", "53280887", "14605572", "196119081", "6344722", "215212477", "111380399", "113228289", "23136769", "206578345", "189800670", "126803433", "12360124", "141055967", "64383518", "2882606", "59316666", "125938190", "16049567", "157302247", "197643844", "204861704", "212695515", "10458922", "59605635"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17451899"}

Single province in each year was deemed as a sample in building these models. Firstly, with minimum principle of mean square error(MSE), nonlinear multi-round screening was implemented to the 23 independent variables, and the important factors associated with emergence size in pest management were obtained. Then on the basis of retained factors, the nonlinear regression SVR model of emergence size of cotton bollworm was established and the R2=0.901 2; meanwhile, the significance of the SVR model was verified by the non-linear interpretive system based on F test.

Firstly we incorporate the visual features into the ranking model together with related textual features. Then an optimal problem of learning the ranking parameters based on the large margin method is schemed. Finally the cutting plane algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the optimal problem. This paper compared the performance of RLM-AVF with the textual ranking methods using the well-known learning to rank algorithms and reranking methods.

However, as time goes by, social network users may change preferences and likings: they may like different types of clothes, listen to different singers or even different genres of music and so on.

Routine identification of these products is hampered by the difficulty in distinguishing them from innocuous plant materials such as foods, herbs, and spices. It is demonstrated here that several of these products have unique but consistent headspace chemical profiles and that multivariate statistical analysis processing of their chemical signatures can be used to accurately identify the species of plants from which the materials are derived. For this study, the headspace volatiles of several species were analyzed by direct analysis in real-time high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS). These species include Althaea officinalis, Calea zacatechichi, Cannabis indica, Cannabis sativa, Echinopsis pachanoi, Lactuca virosa, Leonotis leonurus, Mimosa hositlis, Mitragyna speciosa, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Piper methysticum, Salvia divinorum, Turnera diffusa, and Voacanga africana. The results of the DART-HRMS analysis revealed intraspecies similarities and interspecies differences. Exploratory statistical analysis of the data using principal component analysis and global t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding showed clustering of like species and separation of different species. This led to the use of supervised random forest (RF), which resulted in a model with 99% accuracy. A conformal predictor based on the RF classifier was created and proved to be valid for a significance level of 8% with an efficiency of 0.1, an observed fuzziness of 0, and an error rate of 0. The variables used for the statistical analysis processing were ranked in terms of the ability to enable clustering and discrimination between species using principal component analysis-variable importance of projection scores and RF variable importance indices.

In Kazakhstan, the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) is the main host for plague (Yersinia pestis infection) and poses a public health threat, yet their spatial distribution is unknown. Great gerbils are social animals that live in family groups in burrows in desert environments. Plague is transmitted from gerbil to gerbil via fleas, and can also be transmitted to humans. In Kazakhstan, an abundance threshold exists above which plague can spread over larger areas. This means that the great gerbils\u2019 distribution is crucial to the spread and persistence of this disease. ::: ::: To gain information on the spatial distribution of the great gerbils, the spatial distribution of their burrows needs to be known. High-resolution satellite images were used in combination with a classification technique called Random Forests to identify the burrows of the great gerbils, which resulted in overall accuracies ranging from 87 to 97%. ::: ::: Once the burrow distribution was known, the relation between the abundance of great gerbil burrows and the landscape was studied. Multiple regression showed that burrow density was negatively related to Greenness, especially in the floodplain areas. ::: ::: The spatial distribution of the host species is thought to influence the plague dynamics, such as the direction of plague spread, however no detailed analysis existed on the possible corridors and barriers that were present. Corridors and barriers were mapped using a burrow density threshold, and were mostly aligned on the NWSE axis. To investigate whether plague spread was radially symmetric in the past, a plague presence and absence data set was used. Results showed that plague spread had occurred mostly along the NWSE axis. This associates great-gerbil-burrow density with the direction of plague spread. ::: ::: In plague-prediction models, great-gerbil burrows are assumed to be randomly or regularly distributed. However, this assumption has never been validated. Spatial point-pattern statistics were used on field data to see whether the occupied burrows are clustered within the total population of burrows. The results showed that burrows irrespective of occupancy were regularly distributed. It also showed that occupied burrows are clustered, but that this can only be detected in squares of 500 m and larger. ::: ::: To be able to predict plague outbreaks in Kazakhstan effectively, the real-time distribution of occupied burrows needs to be known, preferably for large areas. An NDVI time-series was used to identify occupied burrows, and classify them from space. Classification accuracies are promising with an overall accuracy of 65%. ::: ::: It is concluded that great gerbil burrows irrespective of occupancy are spatially structured and related to the landscape at larger scales, and that they are regularly distributed at local scales. Occupied burrows are spatially clustered. This should be incorporated into plague models. Furthermore, with the newly developed method, occupied burrows can now be detected from space. This will aid the prediction of plague outbreaks.

In this paper, the performance of a robust hybrid approach, composed of a Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm and a new class of neural network called Extreme Learning Machine, is discussed. The Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm is focused on obtaining the most relevant features among the set of initial ones, by including an exponential prediction model. While previous approaches consider that the number of macroeconomic variables used for prediction is a parameter of the algorithm (i.e., it is fixed a priori), the proposed Variable Neighborhood Search method optimizes both: the number of variables and the best ones. After this first step of feature selection, an Extreme Learning Machine network is applied to obtain the final energy demand prediction.

In this paper, we present and compare the results of the application of two different methods to identify the main structural factors that explain the likelihood of fire occurrence at European scale. Data on the number of fires for the countries of the European Mediterranean region during the main fire season (June\u2013September) were obtained from the European Fire Database of the European Forest Fire Information System. Fire density (number of fires/km2) was estimated based on interpolation techniques and was used as the dependent variable in the model. As predictors, different physical, socio-economic and demographic variables were selected based on their potential influence in fire occurrence and on their availability at the European level. Two different methods were applied for the analysis: traditional Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest, the latter being a non-parametric alternative based on an ensemble of classification and regression trees. The predictive ability of the two models, the variables selected by each method and their level of importance were compared and the potential implications to forest management and fire prevention were discussed. The Random Forest model showed a higher predictive ability than Multiple Linear Regression. Furthermore, the analysis of the residuals also indicated a better performance of the Random Forest model, showing that this method has potentiality to be applied in the assessment of fire-related phenomena at a broad scale. Some of the variables selected are common to both models; precipitation and soil moisture seem to influence fire occurrence to a large extent. Unemployment rate, livestock density and density of local roads were also found significant by both methods. Maps of the likelihood of fire occurrence were obtained from each method at 10 km resolution, based on the selected variables. Both models show that the spatial distribution of fire occurrence likelihood is highly variable in this region: highest fire likelihood is prevalent in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula and southern Italy, whereas it is low in northern France, northeast Italy and north of Greece. In the most fire-prone areas, preventive measures could be implemented, associated to the factors identified by both models.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2012.03.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2010150056", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["7003488", "85645648", "84801943", "119977987", "89141", "128624696", "128706641", "134509120", "15676956", "84721682", "3626971", "14953216", "53957113", "130038129", "153697617", "14864905", "11771645", "11755510", "15553479", "14079431", "54954675", "155006061", "132839281", "129419714", "127913188", "153445514", "128974232", "25448541", "85434147", "23254327", "128768534", "31000388", "129789168", "10796569", "155019173", "84308277", "14327012", "38030307", "84410410", "134509120", "128689693", "31714386", "40021593", "10660498", "52083391", "128613895", "153976866"], "inbound_citations": ["55070265", "149630241", "53600563", "158142247", "158418088", "199445532", "35642339", "15971997", "4473814", "202021196", "17160937", "210627115", "214951303", "21677754", "51692704", "62823355", "55769187", "34589712", "130421804", "5288252", "91377297", "52480574", "134116008", "12767160", "3541354", "51965529", "132828420", "52978582", "146806321", "55976669", "55553700", "204151219", "55185055", "4566685", "19124447", "3421338", "132993057", "207870061", "33341095", "215421468", "5018620", "62866627", "18128366", "4673800", "125166372", "157063922", "51965299", "2853627", "35059731", "12319152", "202321105", "85498435", "290238", "20077003", "201625155", "215009622", "208040050", "8261118", "14107270", "134773792", "55613347", "209382406", "87455157", "53692520", "164789316", "202687093", "17219684", "199474006", "55006148", "202458333", "54651140", "133472324", "55129839", "17010224", "3384654", "214689328", "14128173", "5981495", "18346702", "134958577", "16646823", "206380734", "60442698", "46993086", "90148933", "53284190", "15263558", "3423202", "214904998", "49228805", "52962561", "42589257", "134440798", "22359451", "4716158", "210295409", "6818387", "126131737", "9028450", "197561166", "215206563", "134347264", "56111727", "155436382", "52277620", "55041160", "22986924", "132652368", "55777386", "127160949", "158445488", "215451910", "215499104", "54473223", "135386201", "4519637", "52951651", "5439546", "96438431", "126198271", "53030184", "207202695", "3590807", "208252124"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:84527740"}

However most association techniques used for these studies consider only one genetic variant at a time and rarely the interactions between them. For this reason we looked ensemble methods applied to a known case: beta-thalassemia mutation carriers. Beta-thalassemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation inside the betahemoglobin gene. Only homozygous individuals for the mutation manifest the clinical traits of the disease, however carriers, although completely sane, show a reduced mean cell volume (MCV) of red blood cells, and this parameter can be used to identify them. In our study we show that we can trace back the position of the mutation out of about 500000 single nucleotide polimorfism (SNPs) genotyped in 500 samples that come from Talana a small village of Sardinia using Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001). We were also able to determine the probability of a person to carry the beta-thalassemia mutation. The relatedness of the samples used and the knowledge of the presence of the same mutation all over Sardinia makes the beta-thalassemia mutation easier to find. Nonetheless the amount of markers measured on the genome (about 500 thousands) and the presence of other genes, which could affect MCV makes the finding not trivial. This situation many variables for few samples, that in a near future will rise increase to 1.8 million, is difficult to manage by classical regression methods or even Bayes methods such as the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) proposed by H. A. Chipman, E. I. George and R. E. McCulloch (2006). For this reason we propose to use RF in order to estimate the probability of MCV alteration given a certain genomic profile. Finally, another advantage of RF is that they are highly parallelizable and they are actually implemented for running in a cluster of CPUs which makes them suitable for studying such a high number of variables which require millions of iteractions.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2274005126", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61677230"}

Such a learning objective may make it not to be able to well capture the manifold structure of the discriminative appearances. In contrast, our unified formulation is based on a principled metric learning framework, which seeks for a discriminative embedding for appearance modeling. In our formulation, both appearance modeling and visual matching are performed online by efficient gradient based optimization. Our formulation is also able to deal with multiple targets, where the exclusive principle is naturally reinforced to handle occlusions. Its efficacy is validated in a wide variety of challenging videos.

Taking as a prototype the Ising model and using the Support Vector Machine as a tool to classify Monte Carlo generated configurations, we show that the critical region of the system can be clearly identified and the symmetry that drives the transition can be reconstructed from the performance of the learning process. The role of the discrete symmetry of the system in obtaining this result is discussed. A finite size analysis of the learned Support Vector Machine decision function allows us to determine the critical temperature and critical exponents with a precision that is comparable to that of the most efficient numerical approaches relying on a known Hamiltonian description of the system. For the determination of the critical temperature and of the critical exponent connected with the divergence of the correlation length, other than the availability of a range of temperatures having information on both phases, the method we propose does not rest on any physical input on the system, and in particular is agnostic to its Hamiltonian, its symmetry properties and its order parameter.

The abnormalities that occur in the brain, such as epilepsy, can be seen through a particular pattern on the EEG signal. A recurrent unprovoked seizure occurs in epilepsy patients as a result of excessive brain cell activity. EEG is a non-linear and non-stationary signal, so a visual interpretation is difficult to conduct. One method to measure EEG characteristics is the entropy that quantifies the signal complexity. Several studies have been conducted to classify epileptic EEG signal using entropy as the feature set. Previous studies has shown a promising result for epileptic EEG signal classification. However, to achieve effectiveness for the classification process, we propose a new method to reduce the number of features with a competitive accuracy. In this research, we propose a wavelet-based entropy method named multilevel wavelet packet entropy (MWPE) for automatic EEG signal analysis. MWPE is calculated from the wavelet packet entropy (WPE) which performed at some decomposition level. WPE was calculated from wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) which give more informations in every signal subbands compared to discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Using MWPE, we got informations about the distribution of subband energy in every level of signal decomposition. MWPE and support vector machine (SVM) are used as the feature extraction and classifier respectively. The result showed that the method is able to classify three classes of the EEG data set (normal, interictal, seizure). The best accuracy is 94.3% which achieved by using a 1\u20135 decomposition level with biorthogonal 2.8 wavelet, and cubic or quadratic SVM.

However, eQTL data sets often go underexploited because legacy QTL methods are used to map the relationship between the expression trait and genotype. Often these methods are inappropriate for complex traits such as gene expression, particularly in the case of epistasis.ResultsHere we compare legacy QTL mapping methods with several modern multi-locus methods and evaluate their ability to produce eQTL that agree with independent external data in a systematic way. We found that the modern multi-locus methods (Random Forests, sparse partial least squares, lasso, and elastic net) clearly outperformed the legacy QTL methods (Haley-Knott regression and composite interval mapping) in terms of biological relevance of the mapped eQTL. In particular, we found that our new approach, based on Random Forests, showed superior performance among the multi-locus methods.ConclusionsBenchmarks based on the recapitulation of experimental findings provide valuable insight when selecting the appropriate eQTL mapping method.

To assess the performance of S-GTM prediction models, a descriptor space (ISIDA descriptors) of a set of 1325 GPCR ligands was related to a B-dimensional (B = 1 or 8) activity space corresponding to pKi values for eight different targets.

Among these algorithms, the label propagation algorithm is simple, easy to perform and its time complexity is linear, but it has a strong randomness. Small communities in the label propagation process are easy to be swallowed. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to improve the partition results of label propagation algorithm based on the pre-partition by circularly searching core nodes and assigning label for nodes according to similarity of nodes. First, the degree of each node of the network is calculated. We go through the whole network to find the nodes with the maximal degrees in the neighbors as the core nodes. Next, we assign the core nodes\u2019 labels to their neighbors according to the similarity between them, which can reduce the randomness of the label propagation algorithm. Then, we arrange the nodes whose labels had not been changed as the new network and find the new core nodes. After that, we update the labels of neighbor nodes according to the similarity between them again until the end of the iteration, to complete the pre-partition. The approach of circularly searching for core nodes increases the diversity of the network partition and prevents the smaller potential communities being swallowed in the process of partition. Then, we implement the label propagation algorithm on the whole network after the pre-partition. Finally, we adopt a modified method based on the degree of membership determined by the bidirectional attraction of nodes and their neighbor communities. This method can reduce the possibility of the error in partition of few nodes. Experiments on artificial and real networks show that the proposed algorithm can accurately divide the network and get higher degree of modularity compared with five existing algorithms.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1142/S0218001416590242", "venue": "IJPRAI", "journal": "IJPRAI", "mag_id": "2297750820", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["12515171", "54459939"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29379989"}

An evolutionary algorithm is applied to select the most informative features from an initial set of 2550 EEG statistical features. Optimisation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is performed with an evolutionary approach before classification to estimate the best hyperparameters of the network. Deep learning and tuning with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are also explored, and Adaptive Boosting of the two types of models is tested for each problem. Three experiments are provided for comparison using different classifiers: one for attention state classification, one for emotional sentiment classification, and a third experiment in which the goal is to guess the number a subject is thinking of. The obtained results show that an Adaptive Boosted LSTM can achieve an accuracy of 84.44%, 97.06%, and 9.94% on the attentional, emotional, and number datasets, respectively. An evolutionary-optimised MLP achieves results close to the Adaptive Boosted LSTM for the two first experiments and significantly higher for the number-guessing experiment with an Adaptive Boosted DEvo MLP reaching 31.35%, while being significantly quicker to train and classify.

However, for many lipidomics applications, it is necessary to know at least the lipid category or class that is associated with a detected spectral feature to derive a biochemical interpretation. Our goal is to develop a method for robustly classifying elemental molecular formula assignments into lipid categories for an application to SMIRFE-generated assignments. Using a Random Forest machine learning approach, we developed a method that can predict lipid category and class from SMIRFE non-adducted molecular formula assignments. Our methods achieve high average predictive accuracy (>90%) and precision (>83%) across all eight of the lipid categories in the LIPIDMAPS database. Classification performance was evaluated using sets of theoretical, data-derived, and artifactual molecular formulas. Our methods enable the lipid classification of non-adducted molecular formula assignments generated by SMIRFE without orthogonal information, facilitating the biochemical interpretation of untargeted lipidomics experiments.

However, all these diagnostic methods either have limited reliability and validity or are very time-consuming. In contrast, biopotentials can be automatically analyzed with machine learning algorithms to provide a surrogate measure of pain intensity. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: In this context, we created a database of biopotentials to advance an automated pain recognition system, determine its theoretical testing quality, and optimize its performance. Eighty-five participants were subjected to painful heat stimuli (baseline, pain threshold, two intermediate thresholds, and pain tolerance threshold) under controlled conditions and the signals of electromyography, skin conductance level, and electrocardiography were collected. A total of 159 features were extracted from the mathematical groupings of amplitude, frequency, stationarity, entropy, linearity, variability, and similarity. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: We achieved classification rates of 90.94% for baseline vs. pain tolerance threshold and 79.29% for baseline vs. pain threshold.

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a minimum spanning tree (MST) classification framework to identify Alzheimer's disease (AD), MCI, and normal controls (NCs). The proposed method mainly uses the MST method, graph-based Substructure Pattern mining (gSpan), and graph kernel Principal Component Analysis (graph kernel PCA). Specifically, MST is used to construct the brain functional connectivity network; gSpan, to extract features; and subnetwork selection and graph kernel PCA, to select features. Finally, the support vector machine is used to perform classification. We evaluate our method on MST brain functional networks of 21 AD, 25 MCI, and 22 NC subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves classification accuracy of 98.3, 91.3, and 77.3%, for MCI vs. NC, AD vs. NC, and AD vs. MCI, respectively.

These customer transactions using mobile payments can then be utilized further to derive retailers\u2019 total customer flows indirectly, thereby overcoming the constraints that small retailers face.

A major challenge in developing these systems arises from the large individual differences typically seen in the neural/physiological responses. As a result, many researchers use individually-trained recognition algorithms to process this data. In order to minimize time, cost, and barriers to use, there is a need to minimize the amount of individual training data required, or equivalently, to increase the recognition accuracy without increasing the number of user-specific training samples. One promising method for achieving this is collaborative filtering, which combines training data from the individual subject with additional training data from other, similar subjects. This paper describes a successful application of a collaborative filtering approach intended for a BCI system. This approach is based on transfer learning (TL), active class selection (ACS), and a mean squared difference user-similarity heuristic. The resulting BCI system uses neural and physiological signals for automatic task difficulty recognition. TL improves the learning performance by combining a small number of user-specific training samples with a large number of auxiliary training samples from other similar subjects.

As a model for neural activity in the brain, it attracts a lot of attention, especially because of its very simple training method.

Scaling delay lines down from optical fiber scale to chip scale results in RC systems that compute faster, but at the same time requires that the input signals be scaled up in speed, which might be impractical or expensive. In this brief, we show that this problem can be alleviated by a masked RC system in which the amplitude of the input signal is modulated by a binary-valued mask. For a speech recognition task, we demonstrate that the necessary input sample rate can be a factor of 40 smaller than in a conventional RC system.

Emergency evacuation is a complex task which is difficult to solve with reinforcement learning, since an emergency situation is highly dynamic, with a lot of changing variables and complex constraints that makes it difficult to train on. In this paper, we propose the first fire evacuation environment to train reinforcement learning agents for evacuation planning. The environment is modelled as a graph capturing the building structure. It consists of realistic features like fire spread, uncertainty and bottlenecks. We have implemented the environment in the OpenAI gym format, to facilitate future research. We also propose a new reinforcement learning approach that entails pretraining the network weights of a DQN based agents to incorporate information on the shortest path to the exit. We achieved this by using tabular Q-learning to learn the shortest path on the building model's graph. This information is transferred to the network by deliberately overfitting it on the Q-matrix. Then, the pretrained DQN model is trained on the fire evacuation environment to generate the optimal evacuation path under time varying conditions. We perform comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO, VPG, SARSA, A2C and ACKTR. The results show that our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art models by a huge margin including the original DQN based models. Finally, we test our model on a large and complex real building consisting of 91 rooms, with the possibility to move to any other room, hence giving 8281 actions. We use an attention based mechanism to deal with large action spaces.

However, the current experimentally-derived networks are generally small and should be augmented by computational methods for less-biased biological inference. From the point of view of computational modelling, data scarcity, data unavailability and negative data sampling are the three major problems for host-pathogen protein interaction networks reconstruction. In this work, we are motivated to address the three concerns and propose a probability weighted ensemble transfer learning model for HIV-human protein interaction prediction (PWEN-TLM), where support vector machine (SVM) is adopted as the individual classifier of the ensemble model. In the model, data scarcity and data unavailability are tackled by homolog knowledge transfer. The importance of homolog knowledge is measured by the ROC-AUC metric of the individual classifiers, whose outputs are probability weighted to yield the final decision. In addition, we further validate the assumption that only the homolog knowledge is sufficient to train a satisfactory model for host-pathogen protein interaction prediction. Thus the model is more robust against data unavailability with less demanding data constraint. As regards with negative data construction, experiments show that exclusiveness of subcellular co-localized proteins is unbiased and more reliable than random sampling. Last, we conduct analysis of overlapped predictions between our model and the existing models, and apply the model to novel host-pathogen PPIs recognition for further biological research.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3832534", "pubmed_id": "24260261", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0079606", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2028273907", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4419762", "30865055", "6854065", "1943310", "2832168", "11423858", "44969975", "9611541", "18231194", "2144759", "10817560", "13223729", "10652502", "15266612", "2024305", "9673034", "15865414", "11406613", "14220133", "22581883", "13429205", "41816177", "8279095", "12651390", "5369079", "20951", "56563878", "23902335", "3188125", "207159665", "205593494", "11586387", "25952565", "19848415", "36081041", "40464451", "30704030", "15657266", "15207307"], "inbound_citations": ["91079175", "215013540", "215581259", "204739304", "53032806", "196662387", "46469050", "8263652", "1085728", "14027121", "16739086", "1222000", "215221798", "215497632", "24581245", "1572419", "18356492", "49531305", "11242828", "11209753", "215464902", "210707754", "4736859", "8753027", "53104221", "52887687", "9753166", "43801329", "5788561", "13738438"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2847798"}

We assign modern pollen samples from Africa and Arabia to five biome classes using a previously published African pollen dataset and a global ecosystem classification scheme. To test the applicability of traditional and machine-learning based classification models for the task of biome prediction from high dimensional modern pollen data, we train a total of eight classification models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. The ability of each model to predict biomes from pollen data is statistically tested on an independent test set. The Random Forest classifier outperforms other models in its ability correctly classify biomes given pollen data. Out of the eight models, the Random Forest classifier scores highest on all of the metrics used for model evaluations and is able to predict four out of five biome classes to high degree of accuracy, including arid, montane, tropical and subtropical closed and open systems, e.g. forests and savanna/grassland. The model has the potential for accurate reconstructions of past biomes and awaits application to fossil pollen sequences. The Random Forest model may be used to investigate vegetation changes on both long and short time scales, e.g. during glacial and interglacial cycles, or more recent and abrupt climatic anomalies like the African Humid Period.

Studies of this type allow researchers and practitioners to visualize the hierarchical structure of the concept being studied. Unfortunately, the Socially Responsible Consumer (SRC) research community still remains unable to construct a second-order SRC index. Most researchers argue that the statistical requirements for the construction of the second-order index are not met. They typically try to construct the second-order index by applying linear factor analysis techniques. It is worth mentioning that this is a widespread practice in the social sciences. In this manuscript, we aim to show how better indices can be created by applying non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. Specifically, we have modified the Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machine (UELM) method to promote orthogonality in the basis function space. These methods are able to model interactions among the input variables, but unfortunately, they are usually considered black boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose the use of Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) techniques, which are able to estimate the importance of each variable by itself and in conjunction with the others. To test the methodology, we have used a sample of 703 Spanish consumers and a multidimensional SRC metric that considers both social and environmental issues.

It constructs a tree containing a literal (an atomic formula or its negation) or a conjunction of literals in each node, and assigns a numerical value to each leaf. SRT provides more comprehensible results than purely statistical methods, and can be applied to a class of problems most other ILP systems cannot handle.

The kernel Sobel filter is used with eight masks to derive the gradient components for each pixel in the image. Two types of gradient images are extracted for different directions denoted as xy and lr. The robust Elongated Quinary Pattern (EQP) descriptor is then used to quantize neighborhood local gradients around each point using five discrimination levels. We next divide each encoded image into a number of blocks and concatenate the local histogram features of each image individually.

To solve this problem, we present a more robust prior data distribution information extraction method named relative density, and two novel FSVM-CIL algorithms based on the relative density information in this paper. In our proposed algorithms, a K-nearest neighbors-based probability density estimation (KNN-PDE) alike strategy is utilized to calculate the relative density of each training instance. In particular, the relative density is irrelevant with the dimensionality of data distribution in feature space, but only reflects the significance of each instance within its class; hence, it is more robust than the absolute distance information. In addition, the relative density can better seize the prior data distribution information, no matter the data distribution is easy or complex. Even for the data with small injunctions or a large class overlap, the relative density information can reflect its details well.

It is a critical part in many applications such as image search, surveillance, human-computer interaction or image auto-annotation. Most successful approaches to non-rigid object detection make use of part-based models. In particular, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have been successfully embedded into a discriminative parts-based model framework due to its effectiveness for learning and inference (usually based on a tree structure). However, CRF-based approaches do not incorporate global constraints and only model pairwise interactions. This is especially important when modeling object classes that may have complex parts interactions (e.g. facial features or body articulations), because neglecting them yields an oversimplified model with suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical CRF (HCRF). The main contribution is to build a hierarchy of part combinations by extending the label set to a hierarchy of product label spaces.

This paper presents a framework for video-based surveillance where detection and tracking are addressed simultaneously in a unified framework (i.e., detection results trigger tracking, and tracking re-enforces detections)to improve detection results. In contrast to methods that apply target detection and tracking sequentially and independently from each other (i.e., \"detect-then-track\"), we feed the results of tracking back to the detection stage to adaptively optimize the threshold used in the detection stage and improve system robustness (i.e., \"detect-and-track\"). Specifically, the initial locations and representations of the targets are extracted by background subtraction. To model the background, we employ Support Vector Regression (SVR) along with an on-line learning scheme to update it efficiently over time. Target detection is performed by thresholding the outputs of the SVR model. Tracking uses shape projection histograms to iteratively localize the targets and achieve a high shape matching confidence level. Feeding back the results of tracking to the detection stage restricts the range of threshold values, suppress false alarms due to noise, and allows to continuously detect small targets as well as targets undergoing projection distortions. We have validated the proposed framework by detecting vehicles and pedestrians in traffic scenes using both visible and thermal video sequences.

HRGAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network. A unified network jointly estimating transmission maps, atmospheric light, and haze-free images (called UNTA) is proposed as the generator network of HRGAN. Instead of being optimized by minimizing the pixel-wise loss, HRGAN is optimized by minimizing a novel loss function consisting of pixel-wise loss, perceptual loss, and adversarial loss produced by a discriminator network. Classical model-based image dehazing algorithms consist of three separate stages: 1) estimating transmission map; 2) estimating atmospheric light; and 3) restoring haze-free image by using an atmospheric scattering model to process the transmission map and atmospheric light. Such a separate scheme is not guaranteed to achieve optimal results. On the contrary, UNTA performs transmission map estimation and atmospheric light estimation simultaneously to obtain joint optimal solutions.

An image background patch is used as constraint to bias environmental texturing. A global approximation function within the generator is directly applied on the point-cloud (Point-Net).

The problem of insufficient data for training in a target domain is manipulated by taking advantage of similar data, data distribution, network or task from a source domain. Both domains need to be related however they are different. Arabic emotion detection (ED) is a field characterized by lack of resources and available training sets are small for a deep learning implementation.

Indeed, speech-based interface design has been an expert job for a long time. It necessitates good skills in speech technologies and low-level programming. Moreover, rapid development and reusability of previously designed systems remains uneasy. This makes optimality and objective evaluation of design very difficult. The design process is therefore a cyclic process composed of prototype releases, user satisfaction surveys, bug reports and refinements. It is well known that human intervention for testing is time-consuming and above all very expensive. This is one of the reasons for the recent interest in dialog simulation for evaluation as well as for design automation and optimization. In this paper we expose a probabilistic framework for a realistic simulation of spoken dialogs in which the major components of a dialog system are modeled and parameterized thanks to independent data or expert knowledge. Especially, an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system model and a User Model (UM) have been developed. The ASR model, based on articulatory similarities in language models, provides task-adaptive performance prediction and Confidence Level (CL) distribution estimation. The user model relies on the Bayesian Networks (BN) paradigm and is used both for user behavior modeling and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modeling. The complete simulation framework has been used to train a reinforcement-learning agent on two different tasks.

In this paper, speech emotion recognition of spontaneous speech in Malay language using prosodic features and Random Forest classifier is presented. We also investigate the influence of age categorized as children, young adults and middle-aged on emotion recognition.

As a consequence, text classification has emerged as a field of great interest in machine learning in the last decade. In many real-world applications, textual documents can naturally be labeled in different categories, and moreover, the value of their features can change over time requiring learning approaches with the ability to adjust their hypothesis in a very efficient way. Therefore, online learning and multilabel classification are in the spotlight nowadays, since very few currently available approaches are able to handle such problems simultaneously without requiring problem transformation. In this study, we propose a new multilabel text classification method based on the minimum description length principle that can be applied to real-world, dynamic, and large-scale problems because it does not require transformation of the classification problem and naturally supports online learning.

However, quantifying spatial patterns of key metrics, such as aboveground biomass, at landscape scales remains a challenge. This stems from difficulties in accurately estimating grassland biomass at fine scales over large areas and determining what spatial scale is most appropriate to monitor how grassland impacts (e.g., livestock grazing) affect spatial patterns of biomass (i.e., spatial heterogeneity). Here, we use lidar metrics (volume, max height, and intensity) in Random Forest models to quantify fine-resolution (pixel size 1.0668 m (3.5 ft)) aboveground biomass estimates (pseudo R2 = 0.59; RMSD = 139.4 g m-2) across a bunchgrass prairie grassland system. To determine both the effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and which pixel size is most sensitive to the effects of livestock grazing on grassland heterogeneity, we aggregated fine-resolution biomass maps to coarser pixel resolutions (3 m, 5 m, 8 m, 20 m, 30 m) across 23 pastures with varying levels of grazing intensity. Following aggregation to coarser pixel resolutions, we observed that semivariogram models produced statistically different (\u03b1 = 0.05) measures of biomass heterogeneity. The range statistic was the only pasture-level semivariogram metric sensitive to grazing, and this relationship was only significant when using the finer-resolution datasets (~1 m to 8 m pixels). Our results demonstrate 1) the applicability of lidar data for quantifying biomass in short-statured grasslands, 2) that grazing in pacific northwest bunchgrass prairie can decrease spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and 3) that fine-resolution satellite data (", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2019.111432", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2981535574", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210632697"}

In our SVM based user navigation, we first regard User interest Set as input, then apply the SVM classifier to sort out users on the basis of their interests or attributes, and what is more, combine the merit that user attributes classification promise better service being offered to users whose using frequency is not high, a dual-classified collaborating navigation between user attribute classification, and SVM user classification by using mapping matrix is being proposed. We use the mapping method to mix their advantages of common classification methods which lead them to collaborate and to provide the new and old custom with navigation. Using Classification T to statistic the latest and the most frequently used demands of each user type, then applying a mapping from user attribute class (A) to user interest class (T) with the purpose to judge what kind of user type in Classification T has the most possibility the user might belong, to and then to provide the user with the latest services according to their interests. From the experiments, the fitting degree of A and T classification and the true personality of users are derived by tracking the demand of 50 users. We can see that with the increase of frequency in use, the matching degree between Users Attribute Classification (A) and real types of user are essentially the same, and User Personalized Classification (T) is gradually reaching saturation. Regarding the certain point as a dividing line, after using classification mapping, the user's true extent of matching has a broader applicability. SVM have excellent generalization performance and minimum structural risk, which is a good machine learning method that elicits objective regulation from complex statistical dates. So we have improved the user model of active service navigation system and user navigation combined with User Attribute Classification A and SVM User Interest Classification T by mapping matrix.

In this paper, we proposed a method combining calculation model and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which can automatically identify the local blurred region and deblurring. Also, the blurred part can be filled back correctly. Firstly, the gradient image of the complete image is calculated based on the Sobel operator. The boundary information of the fuzzy region and the Gauss function variance of the blurred and clear region are obtained. And the power spectral gradient of the whole image and each local pixel block are further compared with the variance of the Gauss function. After the analysis is accomplished, a more accurate fixed position is achieved. After finishing extracting with clipping pixels, the extracted fuzzy region is input into the pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network to restore the local image.

Two different core conceptual approaches were developed to explain the findings. In integrationist models the key mechanism to achieve pattern selectivity is the nonlinear integration of V1 motion activity. In contrast, selectionist models focus on the motion computation at positions with 2D features. ::: Methodology/Principal Findings ::: Recent experiments revealed that neither of the two concepts alone is sufficient to explain all experimental data and that most of the existing models cannot account for the complex behaviour found. MT pattern selectivity changes over time for stimuli like type II plaids from vector average to the direction computed with an intersection of constraint rule or by feature tracking. Also, the spatial arrangement of the stimulus within the receptive field of a MT cell plays a crucial role. We propose a recurrent neural model showing how feature integration and selection can be combined into one common architecture to explain these findings. The key features of the model are the computation of 1D and 2D motion in model area V1 subpopulations that are integrated in model MT cells using feedforward and feedback processing. Our results are also in line with findings concerning the solution of the aperture problem. ::: Conclusions/Significance ::: We propose a new neural model for MT pattern computation and motion disambiguation that is based on a combination of feature selection and integration.

Information such as generic top-level domain (e.g. com, org, gov) only provides \u2018coarse-grained\u2019 data about what these nodes are. However, social scientists often require more detailed information about the websites under analysis. Usually this involves manually labelling, or \u2018coding\u2019, nodes into categories, using techniques similar to textual or documentary analysis. However, the size and nature of hyperlink networks often makes this task quite time-consuming and costly. In this exploratory pilot study we investigate the use of supervised machine learning to automatically code websites in government hyperlink networks into discrete policy domains (e.g. health, education, environment). This involves extracting or \u2018scraping\u2019 text from the HTML of the sample websites in order to provide data for the algorithm to \u2018learn\u2019 from. Specifically, we deploy Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on a sample of websites already correctly categorised into policy domains by a human coder. The sample is then divided into a \u2018training sample\u2019 and a \u2018test sample\u2019; SVMs learn from websites in the training sample and are tasked with correctly predicting policy domains for websites in the test sample. Preliminary results indicate a surprising level of accuracy, with some policy domains correctly classified more than 90% of the time. This suggests that supervised machine learning may offer a powerful and useful tool for social science research involving large-scale analysis of websites, particularly where the categories of websites are discrete and fairly well-defined (e.g. policy domains in government hyperlink networks).

In this paper, we propose to incorporate metamodels into Decision Support Systems to improve its efficiency and enable larger and more complex models to be effectively analyzed with Decision Support Systems. To evaluate the different metamodel types, a systematic comparison is first conducted to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of five popular metamodeling techniques (Artificial Neural Network, Radial Basis Function, Support Vector Regression, Kriging, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) for stochastic simulation problems. The results show that Support Vector Regression achieves the best performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. We further propose a general optimization framework GA-META, which integrates metamodels into the Genetic Algorithm, to improve the efficiency and reliability of the decision making process.

We propose a new Image-to-Image based recognition approach which is both fast and accurate. We use color information for face recognition.

This representation makes our scheme invariant to changes in illumination or tanning. Classification is performed by Kernel classifiers such as the Support Vector Machines and a newly proposed Random classifier. As a result, our scheme eliminates the time consuming dimensionality-reduction step (widely used in face recognition), since it is independent of the dimensionality of the input features. Moreover, our parallel architecture allows for computational benefits as well as the ability to integrate depth information in the future. A very short sequence of video (2 seconds) is required for face authentication. Performance evaluations using a standard frontal-face video database show a recognition accuracy of around 99.9%.

Further, we construct three diagnostic models based on Support Vector Machine for the three types of syndromes: Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, phlegmstasis in channels, and wind formation from yin deficiency syndrome. To evaluate our solution, we propose to use the TS score as a measure of our models. Results: We achieved a high classification accuracy rate of stroke syndrome: 99.54% for qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, 92.06% for phlegm-stasis in channels, and 85.24% for wind formation from yin deficiency syndrome. Conclusion:This diagnostic model of Support Vector Machine has a high accuracy rate.

At the core of this field are robots controlled by simulated nervous systems that model the structure and function of biological brains at varying levels of detail. In a typical neurorobotics experiment, a robot or agent will perceive its current environment through a set of sensors that transmit their signals to a simulated brain. The brain model may then produce signals that will cause the robot to move, thereby changing the agent's perception of the environment. Observing how the robot then interacts with its environment and how the robot's actions influence its future sensory input allows scientists to study how brain and body have to work together to produce the appropriate response to a given stimulus. Neurorobotics is a strategic pillar of the Human Brain Project HBP, one of Europe's biggest research projects in the area of ICT. The aim of this pillar is two-fold: (i) to provide roboticists with the methods and tools to build robots with brain-derived controllers and (ii) to provide neuroscientists with brain-controlled robots that they can use for their experiments. Thus, neurorobotics links robotics and neuroscience, enabling a seamless exchange of knowledge between these two disciplines. The HBP is currently building the neurorobotics platform NRP, which will enable roboticists and neuroscience researchers to perform neurorobotics experiments both in the virtual and \u2014 completely synchronously \u2014 in the real world. We expect the productivity in brain-derived robotics development to increase exponentially when the NRP reaches full operability.

Image labeling accuracy reached 79.89% with 95%-CI ranging between 76 to 83%.

Samsonovich (asamsono@gmu.edu) Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study, George Mason University 4400 University Dr. MS 2A1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA Kenneth A. De Jong (kdejong@gmu.edu) Department of Computer Science and Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study George Mason University, 4400 University Dr., Fairfax, VA 22030 USA Introduction This work is an attempt to bring together three topics that belong to three different levels of science: (1) symbolic unsupervised learning, (2) the self of a cognitive system, and (3) a universal criterion for conscious experience. We study cases when a cognitive system develops new abilities by reinterpreting its own episodic memories, using the self- concept and the schema of a motivated voluntary action. Within our framework (Samsonovich & DeJong, 2003), the subject-self per se is not represented as a virtual entity in the cognitive system. Instead, the set of axioms that constitute a self-concept (Aleksander & Dunmall, 2003; Samsonovich & Nadel, in press) are implemented via dynamical rules and constraints. These principles are demonstrated in a model paradigm and have implications for the philosophy of mind. Approach The proposed approach is based on the general framework of schemas, charts and mental states described previously (Samsonovich & DeJong, 2003). The term schema was introduced by Kant (1781/1929). Here schemas are units of semantic knowledge, primitives of action, reasoning, sensation, etc. A schema has a header (specifying rules and conditions of binding and expected effects of execution) and a body (specifying how, if at all, the schema is executed). Paradigm: Leveraging Self-Learning with the Self In this paradigm, a set of specially designed virtual worlds is used as a \u201ctraining facility\u201d to help the virtual robot to develop useful and powerful schemas. Innate schemas may include elementary moves and senses, as well as relevant reasoning primitives. The robot \u201cwakes up\u201d in a first-level world and starts by repeating the following procedure: 1. Select an action schema and mutate its header to produce an idea of an action that is not straightforward. 2. Take the new header as a challenge and solve it in each of several encountered situations (execute the solutions). 3. Reinterpret own behavior: find an apparent common motivation in the performed intermediate steps in all cases. 4. Based on the above, write the body of the new schema and add the schema to semantic memory. As the robot learns essentials at the first level, it is taken to the next level, and so on. At each new stage, previously developed schemas are used for solving new challenges. Demonstration by Example The scheme outlined above will be demonstrated in the poster by computer simulations based on a push-push puzzle setup. A minimal set of innate schemas includes a one-step move and some useful cognitive primitives, e.g., the notion of Euclidean distance. At the first stage the robot learns to move in an open space. Then it learns to navigate a maze, to push blocks, to avoid irreversible moves, etc. After that, when given a goal, it is capable of solving simple puzzle configurations and learns to deal with more complex ones. Philosophical Implications The above analysis has interesting implications for the philosophy of mind. Some philosophers believe that the phenomenon of conscious experience will always remain a mystery, while others maintain that this mystery is illusory. How can one decide, when and whether this phenomenon should occur? Chalmers (1994) answers with the Principle of Organizational Invariance. His answer sounds like this: there is an abstract mathematical model M of a functional organization of a cognitive system, such that, whenever M can be mapped onto a given physical object, that object is conscious. Therefore, a criterion for consciousness can be given in terms of M. We define it as follows: M must instantiate the self as a noumenon (a notion introduced by Kant, 1781/1929), which we understand as an imaginary thing that seems to determine system\u2019s dynamics, and yet it cannot be explicitly represented in the system due to its fundamental properties. The proposed framework in which the self is implemented via a set of self-axioms (constraints) about system\u2019s own dynamics conforms to this concept. References Aleksander, I., & Dunmall, B.

In machine learning, this subject is approached through 'multitask learning', where parallel tasks are modeled as multiple outputs of the same network. In multilevel analysis this is generally implemented through the mixed-effects linear model where a distinction is made between 'fixed effects', which are the same for all tasks, and 'random effects', which may vary between tasks. In the present article we will adopt a Bayesian approach in which some of the model parameters are shared (the same for all tasks) and others more loosely connected through a joint prior distribution that can be learned from the data. We seek in this way to combine the best parts of both the statistical multilevel approach and the neural network machinery. The standard assumption expressed in both approaches is that each task can learn equally well from any other task. In this article we extend the model by allowing more differentiation in the similarities between tasks. One such extension is to make the prior mean depend on higher-level task characteristics. More unsupervised clustering of tasks is obtained if we go from a single Gaussian prior to a mixture of Gaussians. This can be further generalized to a mixture of experts architecture with the gates depending on task characteristics. All three extensions are demonstrated through application both on an artificial data set and on two real-world problems, one a school problem and the other involving single-copy newspaper sales.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1162/153244304322765658", "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2119187866", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["64585013", "119939356", "12565208", "122570752", "62254677", "121768372", "4193919", "125025953", "1376989", "6142135", "67000854", "11858560", "14332165", "147613", "120559124", "60449368", "10420876", "426619"], "inbound_citations": ["15984631", "3824775", "10033197", "15044299", "2992893", "3606279", "54458463", "488434", "211243896", "17934555", "3889579", "11770716", "53212155", "3113769", "16879973", "51613808", "11474670", "2000446", "18923361", "85544221", "158879805", "15888544", "16670462", "77374047", "102350676", "15334417", "11311635", "3892318", "14879495", "52988525", "9801408", "6418451", "49185552", "207449683", "61808334", "17231847", "44430082", "7998687", "4848121", "16067120", "5662224", "16578560", "11380119", "13890110", "16366895", "17833826", "1997491", "49321468", "29627130", "9070096", "8458687", "1702051", "31040242", "168169829", "84846473", "21190117", "23709080", "14795224", "211082731", "5749801", "14335467", "27255988", "16237677", "211055375", "53229043", "10391952", "15535851", "52957972", "20374265", "7863607", "13675490", "6395450", "15737451", "212646933", "5686301", "30172385", "56332621", "17767419", "4703661", "17620446", "113397476", "16838542", "18134734", "14034405", "3431569", "109917389", "216356", "8778990", "3116402", "14270676", "3415069", "16906604", "16717179", "13999083", "53679896", "11319685", "5931006", "15417560", "14819647", "31960243", "7144363", "1451332", "1536883", "24636270", "7249642", "10858913", "9071349", "23945718", "8431734", "8189944", "12116091", "26564803", "55728827", "1461081", "29760121", "15037374", "8873859", "6745074", "12657514", "1842392", "26164706", "17036703", "2969462", "12871803", "5726093", "733120", "209503386", "2934134", "18237764", "9128102", "18969330", "195831510", "17673449", "14016961", "1011066", "51771120", "52966103", "1535316", "2945797", "12213941", "17033159", "51607450", "8431316", "34998276", "12705903", "53736599", "740063", "2733792", "2385031", "15634378", "5356447", "744275", "6140479", "15694883", "11516175", "56224235", "16109063", "2098528", "112789", "88521372", "14414833", "53304539", "53047413", "13838726", "10347931", "15621019", "52938664", "5987467", "8705663", "25496713", "96443267", "354787", "145887073", "32860391", "208038727", "6720437", "2495672", "8988304", "160027365", "7766979", "8822227", "20123264", "17065576", "54850536", "9437372", "15144827", "210839011", "18133320", "53802740", "14173436", "4889421", "189760793", "14817116", "211298338", "8737624", "208498579", "54035096", "70124686", "9494747", "18125890", "212628682", "15908897", "24499211", "15737493", "207056947", "70349918", "14447555", "10050749", "14770299", "2323885", "7821379", "55703299", "10772262", "3113933", "15206045", "53282303", "7667298", "27930575", "9154062", "7635546", "13860788", "17810246", "52307902", "18961224", "411547", "14127330", "14777184", "209515718", "11019028", "17221053", "13204051", "18334760", "195069420", "314384", "7912150", "13570924", "49652273", "207960575", "9806771", "67872664", "17076133", "52989100", "52236139", "2633057", "6125599", "2859706", "195764072", "16808808", "208202124", "13595273", "10752363", "14675391", "9943805", "14122668", "16274995", "214623054", "12273279", "55825796", "715932", "52917000", "8907695", "88517749", "14065372", "30904623", "7655632", "15332779", "13707838", "164297", "5244204", "677249", "15320176", "18034940", "52956481", "1611958", "9015144", "59222596", "28758189", "9996526", "6609179", "13749597", "148811592", "49652741", "17982292", "29519775", "60853820", "27955387", "936851", "15629382", "208176406", "8862935", "11679442", "2467509", "202619204", "16719722", "204030577", "19222606", "1433599", "3140051", "10790217"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10436583"}

It's a well-known approach that is used in many real-life machine learning and data mining applications. Active learning uses a query function and an oracle or expert (e.g., a human or information source) for labeling unlabeled data instances to boost up the performance of a classifier. Labeling the unlabeled data instances is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. In this paper, we have proposed an approach based on cluster analysis for selecting informative training instances from large number of unlabeled data instances or big data that helps us to select less number of training instances to build a classifier suitable for active learning. The proposed method clusters the unlabeled big data into several clusters and find the informative instances from each cluster based on the center of the cluster, nearest neighbors of the center of the cluster, and also selecting random instances from each cluster. The objective is to find the informative unlabeled instances and label them by the oracle for scaling up the classification results of the machine learning algorithms to be applied on big data. We have tested the performance of the proposed method on seven benchmark datasets from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository employing following five well-known machine learning algorithms: C4.5 (decision tree induction), SVM (support vector machines), Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting (AdaBoost).

Testing drugs on patients in large clinical trials is one way to assess their efficacy and toxicity, but it is impractical to test hundreds of drugs currently under development. Therefore the preclinical prediction model is highly expected as it enables prediction of drug response to hundreds of cell lines in parallel. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Recently, two large-scale pharmacogenomic studies screened multiple anticancer drugs on over 1000 cell lines in an effort to elucidate the response mechanism of anticancer drugs. To this aim, we here used gene expression features and drug sensitivity data in Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) to build a predictor based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a recursive feature selection tool. Robustness of our model was validated by cross-validation and an independent dataset, the Cancer Genome Project (CGP). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Our model achieved good cross validation performance for most drugs in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (\u226580% accuracy for 10 drugs, \u226575% accuracy for 19 drugs). Independent tests on eleven common drugs between CCLE and CGP achieved satisfactory performance for three of them, i.e., AZD6244, Erlotinib and PD-0325901, using expression levels of only twelve, six and seven genes, respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: These results suggest that drug response could be effectively predicted from genomic features.

However, limited understanding of algorithm selection, ensemble weights and temporal transferability assessment undermines confidence in their predictions. Transferable predictive models, based on objective and proven selection criteria could therefore provide effective tools for defining species-environment relationships. This study developed a framework for generating SDMs in the marine environment that improves models\u2019 temporal transferability. The methodological approach steps were: 1) Collection of predictors related to species ecology and their records and species grouping according to their ecological requirements. Twenty-one seaweeds were used as a case study. Environmental and distribution data were divided into two independent periods to evaluate temporal transferability. 2) A model for each species was built in each period with nine algorithms (Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, Mixture Discriminant Analysis, Classification and Regression Trees, Support Vector Machine, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, MAXENT) and projected into the other period. Predictor contributions to the final models were obtained. 3) Assessment of predictive performance for each model was made using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and true skill statistics metric for both models\u2019 accuracy and temporal transferability capabilities. All values were over 0.8 for all groups. In turn, the geographical pattern of all models were shown to be ecologically coherent. The algorithms and their weights that fit best were used to generate transferable models over time in the marine environment and retained for each species. In general, machine learning algorithms produce models with higher sensitivity than regression-based approaches. This methodology sets the scene for further inquiries in the marine environment when developing consistent practices for model development and transferability. Results are satisfactory for broad application in marine research, allowing a comparative framework between species predictions and facilitating the use of transferable models, especially in climate change studies across large areas.

Most existing methods, which assume the existence of a clean background during the reconstruction period, are not suitable for video sequences such as highway traffic surveillance videos, whose complex foreground movements may not meet the assumption of a clean background. Therefore, we propose a novel joint Gaussian conditional random field (JGCRF) background extraction algorithm for estimating the optimal weights of frame composition for a fixed-view video sequence. A maximum a posteriori problem is formulated to describe the intra- and inter-frame relationships among all pixels of all frames based on their contrast distinctness and spatial and temporal coherence. Because all background objects and elements are assumed to be static, patches that are motionless are good candidates for the background. Therefore, in the algorithm method, a motionless extractor is designed by computing the pixel-wise differences between two consecutive frames and thresholding the accumulation of variation across the frames to remove possible moving patches. The proposed JGCRF framework can flexibly link extracted motionless patches with desired fusion weights as extra observable random variables to constrain the optimization process for more consistent and robust background extraction.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to semantic query suggestion based on Random Forests.

In this scheme, multi-objective simulated annealing is utilized to tune the parameters of Random Forests algorithm, i.e. the number of trees forming the ensemble and the number of features to split at each node. In addition, the weighted voting is utilized to combine the predictions of trees based on their predictive performance.

The accurate retrieval of LAI is important when modeling biophysical processes of vegetation and the productivity of earth systems. The Random Forests (RF) method aggregates an ensemble of decision trees to improve the prediction accuracy and demonstrates a more robust capacity than other regression methods. This study evaluated the RF method for predicting grassland LAI using ground measurements and remote sensing data. Parameter optimization and variable reduction were conducted before model prediction. Two variable reduction methods were examined: the Variable Importance Value method and the principal component analysis (PCA) method. Finally, the sensitivity of RF to highly correlated variables was tested. The results showed that the RF parameters have a small effect on the performance of RF, and a satisfactory prediction was acquired with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1956. The two variable reduction methods for RF prediction produced different results; variable reduction based on the Variable Importance Value method achieved nearly the same prediction accuracy with no reduced prediction, whereas variable reduction using the PCA method had an obviously degraded result that may have been caused by the loss of subtle variations and the fusion of noise information. After removing highly correlated variables, the relative variable importance remained steady, and the use of variables selected based on the best-performing vegetation indices performed better than the variables with all vegetation indices or those selected based on the most important one. The results in this study demonstrate the practical and powerful ability of the RF method in predicting grassland LAI, which can also be applied to the estimation of other vegetation traits as an alternative to conventional empirical regression models and the selection of relevant variables used in ecological models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61303-X", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Integrative Agriculture", "mag_id": "2585334141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4936303", "197672639", "54564646", "208787997", "201099342"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91090663"}

In order for any circuit simulation tool to accurately predict the performance of a CMOS design, it should generate models to predict the transistors electrical characteristics. The circuit simulation tools have access to massive amounts of data that are not only dynamic but generated at high speed in real time, hence making fast simulation a bottleneck in integrated circuit design. Using all the available data is prohibitive due to memory and time constraints. Accurate and fast sampling has been shown to enhance processing of large datasets without knowing all of the data. However, it is difficult to know in advance what size of the sample to choose in order to guarantee good performance. Thus, determining the smallest sufficient dataset size that obtains the same accurate model as the entire available dataset remains an important research question. This paper focuses on adaptively determining how many instances to present to the simulation tool for creating accurate models. We use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with Chernoff inequality to come up with an efficient adaptive sampling technique, for scaling down the data. We then empirically show that the adaptive approach is faster and produces accurate models for circuit simulators as compared to other techniques such as progressive sampling and Artificial Neural Networks.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.micpro.2016.03.007", "venue": "Microprocess.

Reliable systems for object detection, in particular, may simplify our lives significantly or make them safer (e.g.~in driver assistance scenarios). %This dissertation studies object detection in challenging scenes based on graphical models. Graphical models lend themselves to analyze and design computer vision algorithms because of their modularity that allows to design complex models built on simpler modules. This modularity and decomposability enables a better understanding of the domain of interest that in turn enables the design of models with increased reliability. In this dissertation we study discriminative, undirected graphical models, namely conditional random fields (CRFs), and propose extensions to standard CRFs in order to address object detection in challenging scenes. %The use of CRFs allows a fundamental understanding of the structure of the domain of interest that is crucial for reliably handling challenging scenes. %These challenging scenes require a fundamental understanding of the structure of the domain of interest. We discuss the advantages of discriminative models compared to generative variants in the presence of cluttered background, partial occlusion and viewpoint variation. While standard CRFs are restricted to fixed, local neighborhood dependencies we propose to learn arbitrary graph structures. Furthermore, we take advantage of the decomposability of graphical models and propose to interpret the random variables as object parts and develop a joint approach of part-based and monolithic object detection. This view on objects yields a better and intuitive understanding of the structure of objects, and in accordance with observations of related work we demonstrate an improved reliability of our joint system. A secondary focus of this work is the field of search and rescue robotics. Specifically, we are concerned with victim detection in search and rescue scenarios, which requires additional demands besides reliability. In this setting we require real-time capable models, hence, we need efficient algorithms without sacrificing performance.

Several modules work together in CIM, including memory, neural networks, and a binding set. Its main task is to perform the inference generation, which produces new knowledge from previous facts and given rules. This high-level inferencing model is capable not only of rule application but also variable binding. Furthermore, CIM deals with belief maintenance for propositions and inferential association in the system.

Therefore, it is vital to predict the potential hERG inhibitors in early stages of drug discovery. This work explored the identifying of hERG inhibitors by different machine learning methods including C4.5 Decision Tree (C4.5 DT), multilayer perceptron, Radial Basis Function Network (RBFNetwork), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), a feature selection method, was used to select molecular descriptors appropriate for distinguishing hERG inhibitors and noninhibitors.

Such instance-correspondences are assumed to be representative in the source domain and the target domain, respectively. However, in many real-world scenarios, this assumption may not hold. As a result, the constructed feature mapping may not be precise, and thus the transformed source-domain labeled data using the feature mapping are not useful to build an accurate classifier for the target domain. In this paper, we offer a new heterogeneous transfer learning framework named Hybrid Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (HHTL), which allows the selection of corresponding instances across domains to be biased to the source or target domain. Our basic idea is that though the corresponding instances are biased in the original feature space, there may exist other feature spaces, projected onto which, the corresponding instances may become unbiased or representative to the source domain and the target domain, respectively. With such a representation, a more precise feature mapping across heterogeneous feature spaces can be learned for knowledge transfer. We design several deep-learning-based architectures and algorithms that enable learning aligned representations. Extensive experiments on two multilingual classification datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed HHTL framework and algorithms compared with some state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.artint.2019.06.001", "venue": "Artif.

The approach aims to process synchrophasor data from Wide-area Monitoring System (WAMS) to effectively recognize power system disturbances, such as generation loss, load change, and line trip, and discover knowledge about power system performance and WAMS based on recognition results. ::: Signature extraction and pattern recognition are two key steps in DMKD. In this dissertation, the approaches for signature extraction and pattern recognition are studied in detail. Compared with time-domain analysis, wavelet analysis, as a mature and promising tool of time-frequency-domain analysis, is proposed to extract disturbance signature from synchronous data. The criterion for selections of wavelet function and optimal decomposition scale is determined by maximum wavelet energy. Wavelet coefficients (WCs) at scale 5 obtained by order 2 Daubechies Wavelet are considered as disturbance signature. The WCs from measuring locations are combined to be a signature vector, an ordered number series, to reflect the penetration of disturbances in the entire power system. The signature vector is further compressed by Differential Box-Counting (DBC) method of Fractal Analysis (FA) to form a simplified signature for pattern recognition. Random Forest\u2122 (RF) is chosen to be the classifier for pattern recognition. To achieve best recognition results, the parameter (number of trees) of RF\u2122 and the training method for RF\u2122 are investigated, respectively. Ten trees are generated to create an RF\u2122 and ten-fold cross-validation technique is used to train RF\u2122 and test the recognition accuracy. The recognition results achieve an overall 92% correction rate. ::: Based on extracted signatures and recognition results, some points of knowledge are discovered and discussed in this dissertation, including the correlation between WCs and load power variation, recognition for cascading line trip, signature characteristics in different generation and load levels and the influence of information redundancy of WAMS to recognition accuracy.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2232363833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["115372011", "1239518", "15420384", "26660145", "37319012"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110457510"}

Many traditional detection methods utilize the discriminative information within all the single-band images to distinguish the target and the background.

The multitask learning (MTL) technique has the potential to solve the aforementioned challenge, since it can further explore the inherent spectral similarity between the adjacent single-band images. This letter proposes an independent encoding joint sparse representation and an MTL method. This approach has the following capabilities: 1) explores the inherent spectral similarity to construct multiple sub-HSIs in order to reduce spectral redundancy for each sub-HSI; 2) takes full advantage of the prior class label information to construct reasonable joint sparse representation and MTL models for the target and the background; 3) explores the great difference between the target dictionary and background dictionary with different regularization strategies in order to better encode the task relatedness for two joint sparse representation and MTL models; and 4) makes the detection decision by comparing the reconstruction residuals under different prior class labels.

In the marine environment, invertebrates often depend on metabolic cooperation with their endosymbionts. Coral reefs, one of the most important marine ecosystems, are based on the symbiosis between a broad diversity of dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium and a wide phyletic diversity of hosts (i.e., cnidarian, molluscan, poriferan). This diversity is reflected in the ecology and physiology of the symbionts, yet the underlying biochemical mechanisms are still poorly understood. We examined metabolite profiles of four cultured species of Symbiodinium known to form viable symbioses with reef-building corals, S. microadriaticum (cp-type A194), S. minutum (cp-type B184), S. psygmophilum (cp-type B224) and S. trenchii (cp-type D206). Metabolite profiles were shown to differ among Symbiodinium species and were found to be affected by their physiological response to growth in different temperatures and light regimes. A combined Random Forests and Bayesian analysis revealed that the four Symbiodinium species examined primarily differed in their production of sterols and sugars, including a C29 stanol and the two sterols C28\u03945 and C28\u03945,22, as well as differences in metabolite abundances of a hexose and inositol. Inositol levels were also strongly affected by changes in temperature across all Symbiodinium species. Our results offer a detailed view of the metabolite profile characteristic of marine symbiotic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, and identify patterns of metabolites related to several growth conditions.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4381291", "pubmed_id": "25693143", "doi": "10.3390/metabo5010074", "venue": "Metabolites", "journal": "Metabolites", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2047846948", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["21646003", "82599446", "36133573", "17682301", "12607336", "635300", "30842252", "45465642", "86412181", "7870306", "22666866", "25750029", "84281971", "54737875", "4004814", "16602332", "39362873", "56294230", "19618780", "54745611", "21514424", "18417566", "32415809", "12501396", "84614385", "84640756", "80674496", "86589313", "85427046", "84211635", "10079976", "83364307", "771658", "4368434", "35278104", "82379082", "7807190", "207265915", "21615756", "25660902", "95833890", "52103980", "4033582", "11180421", "28394084", "24650215", "24194655", "7921038", "84675726", "28605470", "34202181", "20410939", "16598710", "89141", "18863003", "7534212", "5610231", "9993179", "28106667", "6620978", "4095117", "6733171", "85222330", "14317965", "11067931", "15557470", "3883084", "18682692", "41622655", "14107927", "85604462", "6015086", "2650301", "9507240", "20090572", "84534180", "16966386", "84583136", "4208350", "11841344", "2335127", "84680077", "1096992", "33825811", "26101910", "3093707"], "inbound_citations": ["54094331", "115769082", "25460961", "4586052", "49192037", "215667188"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4479496"}

Fleet managers use telematic data to monitor the performance of their fleets and take decisions regarding maintenance of the vehicles and training of their drivers. The data, which include fuel consumption, are collected by standard sensors (SAE J1939) for modern vehicles. Data regarding the characteristics of the road come from the Highways Agency Pavement Management System (HAPMS) of Highways England, the manager of the strategic road network in the UK. Together, these data can be used to develop a new fuel consumption model, which may help fleet managers in reviewing the existing vehicle routing decisions, based on road geometry. The model would also be useful for road managers to better understand the fuel consumption of road vehicles and the influence of road geometry. Ten-fold cross-validation has been performed to train the SVM, RF, and ANN models. Results of the study shows the feasibility of using telematic data together with the information in HAPMS for the purpose of modelling fuel consumption.

A key advantage of CRFs is their great flexibility to include a wide variety of arbitrary, non-independent features of the input. Faced with this freedom, however, an important question remains: what features should be used? This paper presents an efficient feature induction method for CRFs. The method is founded on the principle of iteratively constructing feature conjunctions that would significantly increase conditional log-likelihood if added to the model. Automated feature induction enables not only improved accuracy and dramatic reduction in parameter count, but also the use of larger cliques, and more freedom to liberally hypothesize atomic input variables that may be relevant to a task. The method applies to linear-chain CRFs, as well as to more arbitrary CRF structures, such as Relational Markov Networks, where it corresponds to learning clique templates, and can also be understood as supervised structure learning.

Aiming at the data classification in data mining, we have proposed CI-SVM (Condensed Information-Support Vector Machine) algorithm to achieve safe and efficient data classification. In this paper, the RCI-SVM (Random Linear Transformation with Condensed Information-Support Vector Machine) algorithm is proposed to use random linear transformation to convert the condensed information to another random vector space. The compressed information in CI-SVM are obtained by clustering the original data, although it is possible to ensure that the accurate original information will not be exposed, to some extent they may still carry some characteristics of the original datasets. Unlike most of the existing data perturbations, due to the early information enrichment processing, RCI-SVM will not preserve the dot product and Euclidean distance relationship between the original datasets and the transformed datasets, which means it's stronger than existing methods in security.

In this paper, a new multi-class fault diagnosis algorithm based on H-SVM is proposed and applied to aero-engine. Before SVM training, the training data are first clustered according to their class-center Euclid distances in some feature spaces. The samples which have close distances are divided into the same sub-classes for training, and this makes the H-SVM have reasonable hierarchical construction and good generalization performance. Instead of the common C-SVM, the v-SVM is selected as the binary classifier, in which the parameter v varies only from 0 to 1 and can be determined more easily. The simulation results show that the designed H-SVMs can fast diagnose the multi-class single faults and combination faults for the gas path components of an aero-engine.

Detecting pathological cells is a quite challenging task due to large variations in cell appearance and indistinguishable changes in pathological cells. In addition, the high resolution of scanned cell images poses a further demand for efficient detection algorithm. Therefore, we propose a multi-task learning network aims at keeping a good balance between performance and computational efficiency. First we transfer knowledge from pre-trained VGG16 network to extract low level features, which alleviate the problem caused by small training data. Then, the potential regions of interest are generated by our proposed task oriented anchor network. Finally, a fully convolutional network is applied to accurately estimate the positions of the cells and classify its corresponding labels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a dataset which is cross verified by two pathologists. In the test, we compare our method to the state-of-the-art detection algorithms, i.e. YOLO [1], and Faster-rcnn [2], which were both re-trained using our dataset.

In the process of predicting floods, the water level is the most important hydrological research aspect.

SVM is the interest in this study for its good classification accuracy reported in many text classification tasks. We propose a taxonomy to organize all proposed strategies following the training and the test phases in text classification tasks. Based on the taxonomy, we survey the methods proposed to address the imbalanced classification. Among them, 10 commonly-used methods were evaluated in our experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, and WebKB. Using the area under the Precision-Recall Curve as the performance measure, our experimental results showed that the best decision surface was often learned by the standard SVM, not coupled with any of the proposed strategies.
