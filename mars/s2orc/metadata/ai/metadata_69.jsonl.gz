This paper introduces a new method of sequential learning for handling the effects of multicollinearity.

However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30% overall samples) at three depths, 0\u201310 cm, 10\u201330 cm, 30\u201350 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 0\u201310 cm and 10\u201330 cm depths, whereas for the 30\u201350 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 0\u201310 cm, 10\u201330 cm and 30\u201350 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m\u22121, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m\u22121 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m\u22121. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 0\u201310 cm, 10\u201330 cm and 30\u201350 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally.

The abundance of tree species were collected from 64 plots (each 1250 m(2) in size) within a Sierra Leonean national park, and Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated. An airborne spectrometer measured reflectances of 186 bands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range at 1 m(2) resolution. The standard deviations of these reflectance values and their first-order derivatives were calculated for each plot from the c. 1250 pixels of hyperspectral information within them. Shannon-Wiener indices were then predicted from these plot-based reflectance statistics using a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The regression model fitted the data well (pseudo-R-2 = 84.9%), and we show that standard deviations of green-band reflectances and infra-red region derivatives had the strongest explanatory powers.

The key idea of our approach is to treat the summarization task as a sequence labeling problem. In this view, each document is a sequence of sentences and the summarization procedure labels the sentences by 1 and 0. The label of a sentence depends on the assignment of labels of others. We compared our proposed approach with eight existing methods on an open benchmark data set.

We here avoid discretization; then, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) involves (i) many learning tasks, performed here by Support Vector Machines, for Bellman-function-regression (ii) many non-linearoptimization tasks for action-selection, for which we compare many algorithms. We include discretizations of the domain as particular non-linear-programming-tools in our experiments, so that by the way we compare optimization approaches and discretization methods. We conclude that robustness is strongly required in the non-linear-optimizations in ADP, and experimental results show that (i) discretization is sometimes inefficient, but some specific discretization is very efficient for \u201dbang-bang\u201d problems (ii) simple evolutionary tools outperform quasi-random in a stable manner (iii) gradient-based techniques are much less stable (iv) for most high-dimensional \u201dless unsmooth\u201d problems Covariance-Matrix-Adaptation is first ranked. 1 NON-LINEAR OPTIMIZATION IN STOCHASTIC DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (SDP) Some of the most traditional fields of stochastic dynamic programming, e.g. energy stockmanagement, which have a strong economic impact, have not been studied thoroughly in the reinforcement learning or approximate-dynamic-programming (ADP) community. This is damageable to reinforcement learning as it has been pointed out that there are not yet many industrial realizations of reinforcement learning. Energy stock-management leads to continuous problems that are usually handled by traditional linear approaches in which (i) convex value-functions are approximated by linear cuts (leading to piecewise linear approximations (PWLA)) (ii) decisions are solutions of a linear-problem. However, this approach does not work in large dimension, due to the curse of dimensionality which strongly affects PWLA. These problems should be handled by other learning tools. However, in this case, the action-selection, minimizing the expected cost-to-go, can\u2019t be anymore done using linear-programming, as the Bellman function is no more a convex PWLA. The action selection is therefore a nonlinear programming problem. There are not a lot of works dealing with continuous actions, and they often do not study the non-linear optimization step involved in action selection. In this paper, we focus on this part: we compare many non-linear optimization-tools, and we also compare these tools to discretization techniques to quantify the importance of the action-selection step. We here roughly introduce stochastic dynamic programming. The interested reader is referred to (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996) for more details. Consider a dynamical system that stochastically evolves in time depending upon your decisions. Assume that time is discrete and has finitely many time steps. Assume that the total cost of your decisions is the sum of instantaneous costs. Precisely: cost = c1 + c2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ cT ci = c(xi,di), xi = f (xi\u22121,di\u22121,\u03c9i) di\u22121 = strategy(xi\u22121,\u03c9i) where xi is the state at time step i, the \u03c9i are a random process, cost is to be minimized, and strategy is the decision function that has to be optimized. We are interested in a control problem: the element to be optimized is a function. Stochastic dynamic programming, a tool to solve this control problem, is based on Bellman\u2019s optimality principle that can be informally stated as follows: \u201dTake the decision at time step t such that the sum \u201dcost at time step t due to your decision\u201d plus \u201dexpected cost from time step t + 1 to \u221e\u201d is minimal.\u201d Bellman\u2019s optimality principle states that this strategy is optimal. Unfortunately, it can only be applied if the expected cost from time step t + 1 to \u221e can be guessed, depending on the current state of the system and the decision. Bellman\u2019s optimality principle reduces the control problem to the computation of this function. If xt can be computed from xt\u22121 and dt\u22121 (i.e., if f is known) then the control problem is reduced to the computation of a function V (t,xt) = E[c(xt ,dt)+ c(xt+1,dt+1)+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ c(xT ,dT )] Note that this function depends on the strategy (we omit for short dependencies on the random process). We consider this expectation for any optimal strategy (even if many strategies are optimal, V is uniquely determined as it is the same for any optimal strategy). Stochastic dynamic programming is the computation of V backwards in time, thanks to the following equation: V (t,xt) = inf dt c(xt ,dt)+ EV(t + 1,xt+1)", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5220/0001645800470054", "venue": "ICINCO-ICSO", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1550742618", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13285306", "125372221", "6398414", "29469626", "8952183", "14075960", "60075162", "16284906", "7078137", "10905054", "4474193", "38813370", "7500236", "11613670", "121347446", "18585775", "9166388", "117813035", "22726600", "6433442", "64988980"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18555646"}

In this paper, we investigate two popular large margin classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), under two contexts: the high-dimensional, low-sample size data and the imbalanced data. A unified family of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to identify the similarities and differences between SVM and DWD. It is well known that many classifiers overfit the data in the high-dimensional setting; and others are sensitive to the imbalanced data, that is, the class with a larger sample size overly influences the classifier and pushes the decision boundary towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to the imbalanced data issue, but it overfits high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling phenomena. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the high-dimensional setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to the imbalanced ratio of sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection between SVM and DWD, and improves both methods by providing a better trade-off between sensitivity to the imbalanced data and overfitting the high-dimensional data. Several asymptotic properties of the FLAME classifiers are studied. Simulations and real data applications are investigated to illustrate the usefulness of the FLAME classifiers.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": "1310.3004", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1934446750,2952270521", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121731789", "86730427", "8501064", "206787478", "5934464", "14727192", "119479891", "2315419", "62741559", "7066611", "120819441", "120386719", "17855837", "1356120", "10052495", "8926693", "2494379", "28637672", "15059183", "206605395"], "inbound_citations": ["3587727", "3094788", "67795096", "19001725", "88515113", "11211313", "12415639", "7125363", "199409292", "59222765"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16100160"}

We, therefore, propose a method called \u201cTransfer String Kernel\u201d (TSK) that achieves improved prediction of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) using knowledge transfer via cross-context sample adaptation. TSK maps sequence segments to a high-dimensional feature space using a discriminative mismatch string kernel framework.

We have experimentally verified TSK for TFBS identifications on 14 different TFs under a cross-organism setting. We find that TSK consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art TFBS tools, especially when working with TFs whose binding sequences are not conserved across contexts.

One clear example is face recognition. However, SVM cannot be applied when the feature vectors defining our samples have missing entries. This is clearly the case in face recognition when occlusions are present in the training and/or testing sets. When k features are missing in a sample vector of class 1, these define an affine subspace of k dimensions. The goal of the SVM is to maximize the margin between the vectors of class 1 and class 2 on those dimensions with no missing elements and, at the same time, maximize the margin between the vectors in class 2 and the affine subspace of class 1. This second term of the SVM criterion will minimize the overlap between the classification hyperplane and the subspace of solutions in class 1, because we do not know which values in this subspace a test vector can take. The hyperplane minimizing this overlap is obviously the one parallel to the missing dimensions. However, this condition is too restrictive, because its solution will generally contradict that obtained when maximizing the margin of the visible data. To resolve this problem, we define a criterion which minimizes the probability of overlap. The resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently and we show how the global minimum of the error term is guaranteed under mild conditions.

The structural and sequence features on pre-miRNA which can facilitate position and efficiency of cleavage are not well known. A precise cleavage by Dicer is crucial because an inaccurate processing can produce miRNA with different seed regions which can alter the repertoire of target genes.ResultsIn this study, a novel method has been developed to predict Dicer cleavage sites on pre-miRNAs using Support Vector Machine. We used the dataset of experimentally validated human miRNA hairpins from miRBase, and extracted fourteen nucleotides around Dicer cleavage sites. We developed number of models using various types of features and achieved maximum accuracy of 66% using binary profile of nucleotide sequence taken from 5p arm of hairpin. The prediction performance of Dicer cleavage site improved significantly from 66% to 86% when we integrated secondary structure information. This indicates that secondary structure plays an important role in the selection of cleavage site. All models were trained and tested on 555 experimentally validated cleavage sites and evaluated using 5-fold cross validation technique. In addition, the performance was also evaluated on an independent testing dataset that achieved an accuracy of ~82%.ConclusionBased on this study, we developed a webserver PHDcleav (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/phdcleav/) to predict Dicer cleavage sites in pre-miRNA.

Inaccuracy in this dataset implies 2 major adverse consequences; a) Regulatory penalties ranging from few thousand dollars to few million dollars and b) potential member attrition due to member dissatisfaction, triggered by increased waiting time, delay in accessing the medical service, efforts wasted on reaching out to incorrect provider etc. Many of the current solutions carry limitations such as lack of centralized storage, data latency issues and non-standardized questionnaire to capture provider update etc. This paper introduces an innovative approach that addresses these limitations using Predictive Analytics and Intake Scoring techniques.

The differentiated pharmacokinetic profile offers the potential of improved biological and clinical activity and safety over currently available HMAs. In the Phase 1 study, patients with r/r AML were treated at escalating doses of guadecitabine. In the phase 2 study, r/r AML patients were randomized to receive guadecitabine at 60 mg/m2 or 90 mg/m2 SC daily for 5 days (dailyx5). In a separate cohort, patients were treated with 60 mg/m2 SC daily for 10 days (dailyx10: days 1-5 and 8-12) for up to 4 cycles followed by subsequent cycles of the dailyx5 regimen. All regimens were dosed with a 28 day treatment cycle. We have reported the clinical efficacy and safety results from the Phase 1 dose-escalation study in AML and MDS (Issa et al, Lancet Oncology 2015) and the Phase 2 randomized dose-response study in r/r AML at 2 doses (60 and 90 mg/m2) in a 5-day regimen (Kantarjian et al, ASH 2013) and 60 mg/m2 in the 10-day regimen (Griffiths et al, ASCO 2014). Here, we report the associations between clinical responses and global DNA demethylation assessed by LINE1 assay, baseline expression of a panel of 7 genes (CDA, P15, P21, DNMT3B, DNMT3A, DNMT1 and CTCF) assessed by qRT-PCR, and FLT3-ITD/NMP1 mutations. Methods: Samples from 122 patients with r/r AML were analyzed (27 from phase 1 study treated at 36 m/m2/d or higher, 47 from the dailyx5 and 48 from the dailyx10 regimen of the phase 2). Global DNA methylation at baseline and after treatment, were estimated using bisulphite-pyrosequencing on the LINE-1 repetitive sequence for assessing guadecitabine pharmacodynamic (PD) effects. LINE-1 methylation time-course profiles were available in 117 out of 122 analyzed patients. Multivariate analysis was performed using nonlinear ensemble decision tree-based classification algorithms (Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Trees); the algorithms were applied to rank demographic features, treatment schedule features, baseline expression of 7 genes, FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations, LINE-1 methylation profiles and baseline hematological features as predictors of clinical response and to measure their directionality. All reported percentages are a measure of the average relative contribution of each feature in predicting response across boosted trees and are normalized across features. Results: In the 122 patients analyzed, the median age was 59.6 (range, 23-86), 75 were males (61.5%). Overall, peak LINE-1 demethylation generally occurred on day 8 after daily x 5 treatment or on day 8 or 15 after daily x 10 treatment. Overall, the maximum peak LINE-1 demethylation was -23.8 % \u00b1 1.24. In 122 r/r AML patients, 28 showed Complete Response (23%, 14 CR and 14 CRi/CRp). High baseline CDA gene expression in peripheral blood was consistently ranked the main predictor of clinical response (mean for responders~1.76 and non-responders~0.12) irrespective of patient gender, dose and dosing cycles, and contributed for 22% of the model accuracy in predicting responses to guadecitabine. Expression of the genes CTCF (11%), DNMT3B (7%) and P21 (6%) were other genes that contributed > 5% in predicting clinical response. Age (8%) was also a significant predictor of response. FLT3-ITD mutations and NPM1 mutations were not significant predictors of response. In an integrated analysis, where methylation levels and gene expression were ranked together on their power to predict clinical response, LINE-1 methylation percent change from baseline on days 8(6%) and 22(19%), age (16%), CTCF (9%), CDA(7%), P21(6.5%) gene expression at baseline had greater than 5% contribution in predicting clinical response. A similar analysis was then performed to rank features on their power to predict day 8 methylation; CDA (28%), DNMT1 (8.5%), P15 (7.5%), and CTCF (7%) gene expression at baseline and age (7%) had greater than 5% predictive power. Conclusions: In conclusion, in r/r AML patients, global DNA demethylation was strongly associated with clinical responses to guadecitabine and analysis of baseline gene expression can identify trends that might enrich for r/r AML patients more likely to respond to HMA therapy with guadecitabine.

The accurate prediction of the required propulsion power at various operating condition is essential to evaluate the energy-saving potential of a vessel. Currently, a new ship is expected to use the ISO15016 method in estimating added resistance induced by external environmental factors in power prediction. However, since ISO15016 usually assumes static water conditions, it may result in low accuracy when it is applied to various operating conditions. Moreover, it is time consuming to apply the ISO15016 method because it is computationally expensive and requires many input data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven approach to predict the propulsion power of a vessel. In this study, support vector regression (SVR) is used to learn from big data obtained from onboard measurement and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database.

Robots already provide their services e.g. in real home improvement markets and guide people to a desired product. In such a scenario many robot internal tasks would benefit from the knowledge of knowing the number and positions of people in the vicinity. The navigation for example could treat them as dynamical moving objects and also predict their next motion directions in order to compute a much safer path. Or the robot could specifically approach customers and offer its services. This requires to detect a person or even a group of people in a reasonable range in front of the robot. Challenges of such a real-world task are e.g. changing lightning conditions, a dynamic environment and different people shapes. In this thesis a 3D people detection approach based on point cloud data provided by the Microsoft Kinect is implemented and integrated on mobile service robot. A Top-Down/Bottom-Up segmentation is applied to increase the systems flexibility and provided the capability to the detect people even if they are partially occluded. A feature set is proposed to detect people in various pose configurations and motions using a machine learning technique. The system can detect people up to a distance of 5 meters. The experimental evaluation compared different machine learning techniques and showed that standing people can be detected with a rate of 87.29% and sitting people with 74.94% using a Random Forest classifier. Certain objects caused several false detections. To elimante those a verification is proposed which further evaluates the persons shape in the 2D space.

There are two main drawbacks to this approach: firstly, the feature engineering being manual is cumbersome and requires human knowledge; and secondly, the designed features might not be best for the objective at hand. This has motivated the adoption of a recent trend in speech community towards utilisation of representation learning techniques, which can learn an intermediate representation of the input signal automatically that better suits the task at hand and hence lead to improved performance. The significance of representation learning has increased with advances in deep learning (DL), where the representations are more useful and less dependent on human knowledge, making it very conducive for tasks like classification, prediction, etc. The main contribution of this paper is to present an up-to-date and comprehensive survey on different techniques of speech representation learning by bringing together the scattered research across three distinct research areas including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speaker Recognition (SR), and Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER). Recent reviews in speech have been conducted for ASR, SR, and SER, however, none of these has focused on the representation learning from speech---a gap that our survey aims to bridge.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.00378", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998249245", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["393948", "13642191", "11392154", "21955893", "4056300", "67866899", "1033682", "56487758", "58005587", "125037489", "202473", "123350066", "6674407", "7036341", "4428232", "17042039", "1536455", "14542261", "1879392", "16950524", "1658773", "819006", "9563026", "132199224", "12469750", "46937265", "53950448", "898670", "206742471", "18599847", "8142135", "6254678", "6348029", "39395448", "56738082", "9049364", "14522098", "14486649", "1862983", "1020152", "6842201", "61412708", "10349584", "13920681", "14143658", "206651806", "12148862", "2191379", "49211906", "18166631", "15440174", "11949160", "51865893", "2995377", "11820063", "15011148", "1424263", "7620529", "207178999", "62841734", "26131992", "29863872", "57662599", "23137465", "3639154", "193456352", "9059612", "12455403", "53592760", "208138154", "191396", "206491647", "54447715", "7167114", "20240", "6575523", "408872", "201918107", "60058376", "51629360", "8734319", "3366485", "52190519", "9928823", "62717276", "195908774", "6916627", "102350542", "1493342", "7961699", "5590763", "1915014", "18375389", "201667597", "2445072", "14850799", "2916298", "34386123", "207168299", "8141422", "2309950", "12174018", "9494295", "6688465", "13930403", "11758569", "84591", "5002792", "46798026", "34051459", "17306137", "54481607", "14989939", "24512955", "59291933", "12219023", "3810858", "31878360", "40438643", "2130362", "3536404", "19227724", "52189478", "966801", "145840591", "53585388", "12298221", "10522460", "15176234", "28480542", "131773", "41178485", "13268684", "17666758", "16251039", "479005", "24776130", "69789282", "195346843", "19865136", "54200945", "4426612", "196621624", "56895583", "6122620", "52890963", "147703902", "13741765", "2212886", "16548630", "18806400", "14976283", "204915917", "29136678", "8811996", "215540743", "3749415", "49190802", "49185225", "6517415", "53963748", "6828602", "8882939", "51879287", "46953994", "38852112", "4590127", "4559895", "4561931", "139106202", "44047773", "9474204", "52289144", "53226609", "18635500", "8637101", "53115818", "2617020", "13953660", "206770307", "599974", "2677491", "8763943", "11861159", "13051257", "198229728", "23534366", "30547896", "16119343", "52190593", "40167359", "77394253", "9931588", "6692382", "4231659", "51927826", "1932843", "4884302", "174800787", "3515736", "1329396", "3147007", "14560330", "4711951", "2754649", "14555004", "1635495", "12369624", "7129084", "63901524", "13040074", "3439025", "13708738", "6094670", "7787511", "6479197", "10473793", "13908978", "55213686", "2276942", "13051595", "18141431", "12016916", "10835319", "12219076", "14515778", "2404339", "2234476", "11641919", "12288829", "29879073", "28925860", "15824041", "46954166", "6873201", "274923", "32511564", "15410508", "18240111", "2260809", "52195299", "52290371", "8868753", "9963748", "11049683", "21676051", "24305681", "17315540", "14150226", "8381351", "2621746", "18649771", "9969117", "52190447", "52187175", "52190412", "17750556", "1845461", "49544779", "27194751", "751749", "145034679", "4587431", "33837774", "51892530", "52187936", "51892530", "52290675", "202724212", "6558003", "60299418", "102352749", "1353097", "28819623", "25742153", "35352656", "20282961", "52986403", "204915968", "52283616", "207780904", "52130789", "51891466", "20394084", "15906722", "195346401", "3622733", "5028194", "85459630", "12623890", "12535948", "2038308", "14873729", "206742498", "29510723", "17449592", "9798648", "5982975", "52186892", "10749277", "16119343", "27201559", "53092786", "88517536", "2224122", "19582900", "207870326", "2722012", "206592484", "17272965", "13740328", "8892137", "151231", "5808102", "3074264", "51952630", "13943041", "18828233", "23519254", "10914012", "6706414", "7004303", "12387176", "4475201", "16979536", "34941466", "52040758", "3536399", "3935906", "5828011", "10305401", "33504", "214894610", "8726667", "1774023", "1617469", "4556070", "46206282", "12826607", "2081569", "4202768", "67856213", "202777813", "158865631", "206770979", "204976547", "202707273", "3583464", "10053772", "198314623", "204950287", "38352604"], "inbound_citations": ["212737213", "211572738"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209531910"}

New method This work presents a classification strategy based on Random Forest feature selection and Deep Neural Network classification using a mixed cohort including the four classes of classification problem, that is HC, AD, MCI and cMCI, to train the model. Moreover, we compare this approach with a novel classification strategy based on fuzzy logic learned on a mixed cohort including only HC and AD. Experiments A training set of 240 subjects and a test set including mixed cohort of 500 real and simulated subjects were used. The data included AD patients, MCI subjects converting to AD (cMCI), MCI subjects and healthy controls (HC). This work ranked third for overall accuracy (38.8%) over 19 participating teams.

A regression tree-based model (Random Forest) produces good results (cross-validated R\u00b2 0.81, RMSE 13 T/ha) when trained with a sufficient number of field plots representative of the vegetation variability at national scale. The Random Forest model captures non-linear relationships between satellite data and biomass density, and is able to use categorical data (land cover) in the regression to improve the results. Biomass estimates were strongly correlated (r = 0.90 and r = 0.83) with independent LiDAR measurements. In this study, we demonstrate that in certain contexts Landsat data provide the capability to spatialize field biomass measurements and produce accurate and detailed estimates of biomass distribution at national scale. We also investigate limitations of this approach, which tend to provide conservative biomass estimates. Specific limitations are mainly related to saturation of the optical signal at high biomass density and cloud cover, which hinders the compilation of a radiometrically consistent multi-temporal dataset. As a result, a Landsat mosaic created for Uganda with images acquired in the dry season during 1999\u20132003 does not contain phenological information useful for discriminating some vegetation types, such as deciduous formations.

The main challenge in applying data mining techniques for financial fraud detection is an imbalanced dataset, where the proportion of fraud class is much smaller than non-fraud. This causes the model to produce unbalanced precision and recall, resulting in a low f1score. It means that the model can predict one class well, but not with another class. In this paper, the approach to fraud detection in financial transactions is carried out with classifier optimization based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). Optimization is performed by tuning the kernels and hyperparameters combined with the Random Under Sampling (RUS) technique. Specifically, RUS is used to handle imbalanced datasets and cut model training time.

Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to model the system behaviour and classify deviant behaviours as possible attacks. In this work, we proposed a novel Generative Adversarial Networks-based Anomaly Detection (GAN-AD) method for such complex networked CPSs. We used LSTM-RNN in our GAN to capture the distribution of the multivariate time series of the sensors and actuators under normal working conditions of a CPS. Instead of treating each sensor's and actuator's time series independently, we model the time series of multiple sensors and actuators in the CPS concurrently to take into account of potential latent interactions between them. To exploit both the generator and the discriminator of our GAN, we deployed the GAN-trained discriminator together with the residuals between generator-reconstructed data and the actual samples to detect possible anomalies in the complex CPS. We used our GAN-AD to distinguish abnormal attacked situations from normal working conditions for a complex six-stage Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system.

Secondly, we propose a pre-screening (simplified) point-of-care (POC) test to identify patients who are likely to benefit from a total cholesterol (TC) test, and subsequently when the LI model is preferential to HI model. Analysis was performed using cross-sectional data from rural Andhra Pradesh collected in 2005 with recorded blood cholesterol measurements (N = 1066). CVD risk was computed using both LI and HI models, and high risk individuals who needed treatment(THR) were subsequently identified based on clinical guidelines. Model development for the POC assessment of a TC test was performed through three machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Regularised Logistic Regression (RLR), and Random Forests (RF) along with a feature selection process. Disagreement in CVD risk predicted by LI and HI WHO/ISH models was 14.5% (n = 155; p<0.01) overall and comprised 36 clinically relevant THR patients (31% of patients identified as THR by using either model). Using two patient-specific parameters (age, systolic blood pressure), our POC assessment can pre-determine the benefit of TC testing and choose the appropriate risk model (out-of-sample AUCs:RF-0.85,SVM-0.84,RLR:0.82 and maximum sensitivity-98%). The identification of patients benefitting from a TC test for CVD risk stratification can aid planning for resource-allocation and save costs for large-scale screening programmes.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4545825", "pubmed_id": "26287807", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0133618", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1949754517", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15517790", "16847956", "25496466", "206764015", "52874011", "961425", "123476171", "16162039", "17166335", "9965121", "8836643", "605277", "1329602", "10675386"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4536732"}

Here Particle filter is modified through weight calculation using Gaussiandistribution to reduce the computational time. The modified particle filter consists of four main phases.

Forty-five designated implant sites were selected. In each site texture features were extracted using gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), Run length matrices, Histogram based ridgelet analysis, Minkowski dimensions (MDs). The operator subjectively rated the bone density during the osteotomy procedure. Then, Support Vector Machine, LDA networks are employed to build the mapping relationships between these features and quality of the bone respectively.

This motivates us to study the feature of emotion fluctuation, which we call Temporal Factor of Emotion (TFE). In this paper, a novel recommendation method based on the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is proposed to tackle this problem. GRA preserves the temporal factor of objects during analysis and is suitable for analyzing systems with unknown correlation (a set of independent videos). In our work, first, specific video features are extracted and mapped to the well-known Lovheim emotion-space, through the SVMs (Support Vector Machine). Then, GRA is applied to compute the quantitative relation among videos by using extracted emotions as factors. Finally, a pick-filter pattern and GRA-based recommendation method under the Fisher model are proposed. To evaluate the performance of our method, an online video recommendation system is developed.

A preliminary linear calibration was first applied to reduce the radiometric difference. The remaining nonlinear part of the radiometric and spatial resolution differences were then calibrated by downscaling the ETM+ data to ASTER data using a support vector regression (SVR)-based super-resolution method. Experiments were conducted on two subsets (representing rural and urban areas) of the ETM+ and ASTER scenes located in the central United States on top of atmospheric reflectance observed on August 13, 2001. It was found that the radiometric difference between the two sensors caused by their spectral band difference could be largely reduced by a linear transfer equation, and the reduction could be more than 60% for the green and NIR bands.

Credit scoring has been regarded as a critical topic, with its related departments striving to collect huge amounts of data to avoid making the wrong decision. Finding effective classificatory models is important because it will help managers make an objective decision instead of them having to rely merely on intuitive experience. This study proposes three approaches which combine two well-known classifiers, namely, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to find the best hybrid classifier combination. Features selection retains sufficient information for classification purposes. Different credit scoring combinations are constructed by selecting features with three approaches and two classifiers. Two credit data sets from University of California, Irvine (UCI) are chosen to evaluate the accuracy of various hybrid features selection models. KNN abd SVM classifiers combine with linear discriminate analysis (LDA), Rough sets (RST), and F-score approaches as a features preprocessing step to optimize features space by removing both irrelevant and redundant features. In this paper, the procedures of the proposed approaches are described and then evaluated by their performances. The results are compared and nonparametric test will be performed to show if there is any significant difference between these models. Performances of the F-score approach combined with effective classifiers are brilliant among the two data sets. The result of this study suggests that the hybrid credit scoring approach is mostly robust and effective in finding optimal subsets and is a promising method in the field of data mining.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IEEM.2011.6118017", "venue": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management", "journal": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2032453733", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10204914", "17090732", "961425", "14179309", "9461053", "153847808", "2443126", "18081491", "18364429", "6941193", "1441710", "17731008", "7995474", "117099173", "8717594", "7138354", "10536566", "1945918", "7580221"], "inbound_citations": ["3632447"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38738424"}

In this way, implicit relationships of user-item pairs can be better determined in the metric space and users\u2019 interests can be modeled more accurately.

Bi- and Multidimensional RNNs combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification allow for a direct recognition of raw stroke data or raw pixel data. In general, recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to assimilate context information, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing, or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This chapter describes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range, bidirectional or multidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two unconstrained handwriting databases, the new approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79,7% on on-line data and 74,1% on off-line data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system.

A major problem is the variation of signal distributions caused by multiple factors, which makes the old localization model inaccurate. Therefore, the transfer learning problem in a WILS aims to transfer the knowledge from an old model to a new one. In this paper, we study the characteristics of signal variation and conclude the chief factors as time and devices. An algorithm LuMA is proposed to handle the transfer learning problem caused by these two factors. LuMA is a dimensionality reduction method, which learns a mapping between a source data set and a target data set in a low-dimensional space.

{"paper_id": "37953315", "title": "Automatic Speech Emotion Recognition- Feature Space Dimensionality and Classification Challenges", "authors": [{"first": "Abdulbasit", "middle": [], "last": "Al-Talabani", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In the last decade, research in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has become a major endeavour in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and speech processing. Accurate SER is essential for many applications, like assessing customer satisfaction with quality of services, and detecting/assessing emotional state of children in care. The large number of studies published on SER reflects the demand for its use. The main concern of this thesis is the investigation of SER from a pattern recognition and machine learning points of view. In particular, we aim to identify appropriate mathematical models of SER and examine the process of designing automatic emotion recognition schemes. There are major challenges to automatic SER including ambiguity about the list/definition of emotions, the lack of agreement on a manageable set of uncorrelated speech-based emotion relevant features, and the difficulty of collected emotion-related datasets under natural circumstances. We shall initiate our work by dealing with the identification of appropriate sets of emotion related features/attributes extractible from speech signals as considered from psychological and computational points of views. We shall investigate the use of pattern-recognition approaches to remove redundancies and achieve compactification of digital representation of the extracted data with minimal loss of information. The thesis will include the design of new or complement existing SER schemes and conduct large sets of experiments to empirically test their performances on different databases, identify advantages, and shortcomings of using speech alone for emotion recognition. Existing SER studies seem to deal with the ambiguity/dis-agreement on a \u201climited\u201d number of emotion-related features by expanding the list from the same speech signal source/sites and apply various feature selection procedures as a mean of reducing redundancies. Attempts are made to discover more relevant features to emotion from speech. One of our investigations focuses on proposing a newly sets of features for SER, extracted from Linear Predictive (LP)-residual speech. We shall demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed relatively small set of features by testing the performance of an SER scheme that is based on fusing our set of features with the existing set of thousands of features using common machine learning schemes of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The challenge of growing dimensionality of SER feature space and its impact on increased model complexity is another major focus of our research project. By studying the pros and cons of the commonly used feature selection approaches, we argued in favour of meta-feature selection and developed various methods in this direction, not only to reduce dimension, but also to adapt and de-correlate emotional feature spaces for improved SER model recognition accuracy. We used rincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and proposed Data Independent PCA (DIPCA) by training on independent emotional and non-emotional datasets. The DIPCA projections, especially when extracted from speech data coloured with different emotions or from Neutral speech data, had comparable capability to the PCA in terms of SER performance. Another adopted approach in this thesis for dimension reduction is the Random Projection (RP) matrices, independent of training data. We have shown that some versions of RP with SVM classifier can offer an adaptation space for Speaker Independent SER that avoid over-fitting and hence improves recognition accuracy. Using PCA trained on a set of data, while testing on emotional data features, has significant implication for machine learning in general. ::: The thesis other major contribution focuses on the classification aspects of SER. We investigate the drawbacks of the well-known SVM classifier when applied to a preprocessed data by PCA and RP. We shall demonstrate the advantages of using the Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC) instead especially for PCA de-correlated metafeatures. ::: We initiated a variety of LDC-based ensembles classification, to test performance of scheme using a new form of bagging different subsets of metafeature subsets extracted by PCA with encouraging results. ::: The experiments conducted were applied on two benchmark datasets (Emo-Berlin and FAU-Aibo), and an in-house dataset in the Kurdish language. Recognition accuracy achieved by are significantly higher than the state of art results on all datasets. The results, however, revealed a difficult challenge in the form of persisting wide gap in accuracy over different datasets, which cannot be explained entirely by the differences between the natures of the datasets. We conducted various pilot studies that were based on various visualizations of the confusion matrices for the \u201cdifficult\u201d databases to build multi-level SER schemes. These studies provide initial evidences to the presence of more than one \u201cemotion\u201d in the same portion of speech. ::: A possible solution may be through presenting recognition accuracy in a score-based measurement like the spider chart. Such an approach may also reveal the presence of Doddington zoo phenomena in SER.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2414994497", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["125149620"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37953315"}

Imbalanced data sets consist of data where one class-label (minority) includes significantly fewer instances compared to other class labels. The misclassification of the minority class-label could be costly in some circumstances. Therefore, the extraction of valuable information from this kind of data poses a challenge to the scientific community. During the last decades, the researchers proposed a centroid-based classification algorithm using differential evolution (CDE) to solve data classification. However, CDE shows an inefficient performance especially when applied to imbalanced binary data sets. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive version of CDE based on a new objective function in order to overcome this drawback. We are using four cancer data sets that are imbalanced namely Breast, Lung, Uterus, and Stomach. Furthermore, we analyzed and investigated the performance of our proposed version of CDE for predicting the survivability of cancer patients compared to the performance of the current variants of CDE. Moreover, we compared the performance of our proposed version of CDE with the performance of five cost-sensitive machine learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed version of CDE improves the performance of CDE when applied to imbalanced binary data sets.

{"paper_id": "55908311", "title": "How to make the Semantic Web more semantic", "authors": [{"first": "Peter", "middle": [], "last": "G\u00e4rdenfors", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The Semantic Web is not semantic. It is good for syllogistic reasoning, but there is much more to semantics than syllogisms. I argue that the current Semantic Web is too dependent on symbolic representations of information structures, which limits its representational capacity. As a remedy, I propose conceptual spaces as a tool for expressing more of the semantics. Conceptual spaces are built up from quality dimensions that have geometric or topological structures. With the aid of the dimensions, similarities between objects can easily be represented and it is argued that similarity is a central aspect of semantic content. By sorting the dimensions into domains, I define properties and concepts and show how prototype effects of concepts can be treated with the aid of conceptual spaces. I present an outline of how one can reconstruct most of the taxonomies and other meta-data that are explicitly coded in the current Semantic Web and argue that inference engines on the symbolic level will become largely superfluous. As an example of the semantic power of conceptual spaces, I show how concept combinations can be analysed in a much richer and more accurate way than in the classical logical approach. 1 The dream of the Semantic Web Given the enormous amount of information on the Internet, it is becoming ever more important to find methods for information integration. The Semantic Web is the most well known recent attempt in this direction. In an introductory article, Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila [3] write that \u201cthe Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.\u201d The ambition of the Semantic Web is excellent, but, so far, most work has been devoted to developing languages such as RDF for representing information and OWL for expressing ontologies. In my opinion, to enable \u201ccomputers and people to work in cooperation\u201d one should, above all, take into consideration how humans process concepts. As I shall argue in this article, this will be necessary if we want to put real semantic content into the Semantic Web. The dream of the Semantic Web is to develop one ontology expressed in one language potentially covering everything that exists on the web. Berners-Lee [2] writes: \u201cThe Semantic Web is what we will get if we perform the same globalization process to Knowledge Representation that the Web initially did to Hypertext. We remove the centralized concepts of absolute truth, total knowledge, and total provability, and see what we can do with limited knowledge.\u201d As Noy and McGuinness [37] note, there are several excellent reasons for developing ontologies: to share a common understanding of the structure of information among people; to enable reuse of domain knowledge; to make domain assumptions explicit; to separate domain knowledge from the operational knowledge; and to analyse domain knowledge. The question is whether the ontologies as we know them from the current Semantic Web are the best tools to achieve these goals. In reality, the picture is not so beautiful: there are several ontologies in several languages covering partly overlapping subdomains of the web. And the formalisms encounter several kinds of integration problems, including structural heterogeneity, semantic heterogeneity, inconsistency and redundancy problems [47]. Shirky [42] summarizes the state of the art as follows: \u201cThe Semantic Web, with its neat ontologies and its syllogistic logic, is a nice vision. However, like many visions that project future benefits but ignore present costs, it requires too much coordination and too much energy to effect in the real world, where deductive logic is less effective and shared world view is harder to create than we often want to admit.\u201d One may even question whether we really need the meta-data provided by the Semantic Web. Uschold [46] points out that sometimes information integration works anyway, for example in web shopping agents. He writes that \u201c[s]hopping agents can work even if there is no automatic processing of semantics; they can work without any formal representations of semantics; they can even work with no explicit representations of semantics at all. The key to enabling shopping agents to automatically use web content is that the meaning of the web content that the agents are expected to encounter can be determined by the human programmers who hardwire it into the web application software.\u201d The reason this can be done is that the terminology involved in web shopping application is comparatively limited and free from ambiguities. 2 The Semantic Web is not semantic My main point of criticism is that the Semantic Web is not very semantic. At best, it is ontological. From a philosopher\u2019s point of view, it is not even ontological, since the formalisms exploited only provide a partial description of what a metaphysician would call an ontology. Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila [3] have the following comment: \u201cArtificialintelligence and Web researchers have co-opted the term for their own jargon, and for them an ontology is a document or file that formally defines the relations among terms. The most typical kind of ontology for the Web has a taxonomy and a set of inference rules.\u201d Even if we grant that the Semantic Web is ontological, it contains a number of competing ontologies that make information integration very problematic. Furthermore, the methodology of the Semantic Web puts too much emphasis on symbolic structures. This will be the topic of next section. Why do I say that the Semantic Web is not semantic? Let us consider what can be expressed in, for example OWL (as far as I understand, other tools for the Semantic Web have similar properties). McGuinness and Hamelen [28] write that on top of RDF descriptions \u201cOWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes: among others, relations between classes (for example disjointness), cardinality (for example \u201cexactly one\u201d), equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics of properties (for example symmetry and transitivity), and enumerated classes.\u201d These are admittedly important semantic notions. But they are exactly what is to be expected of a language that has the expressivity of first order logic and that defines all concepts (properties and relations) in terms of sets of objects. However, there is much more to the semantics of concepts. It is an unfortunate dogma of computer science in general, and the Semantic Web in particular, that all semantic contents are reducible to first order logic or to set theory. Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila [3] claim that \u201c[f]ortunately, a large majority of the information we want to express is along the lines of 'a hex-head bolt is a type of machine bolt'.\u201d Unfortunately, this is not true. If one considers how humans handle concepts, the class relation structures of the Semantic Web capture only a minute part of our information about concepts. For instance, we often categorize objects according to the similarity between the objects [11, 14]. And similarity is not a notion that can be expressed in a natural way in a web ontology language. Along the same lines, Shirky [42] declares that \u201cthe Semantic Web is a machine for creating syllogisms.\u201d He concludes that: \u201cThis is the promise of the Semantic Web \u2013 it will improve all the areas of your life where you currently use syllogisms. Which is to say, almost nowhere.\u201d He adds, somewhat sarcastically: \u201cThe people working on the Semantic Web greatly overestimate the value of deductive reasoning (a persistent theme in Artificial Intelligence projects generally.) The great popularizer of this error was Arthur Conan Doyle, whose Sherlock Holmes stories have done more damage to people's understanding of human intelligence than anyone other than Rene Descartes.\u201d In my book Conceptual Spaces [11], I contrast three basic methodologies within the cognitive sciences for representing information: the symbolic, the associationist and the conceptual. In the symbolic approach, cognition is seen as essentially being computation involving symbol manipulation. The second approach is associationism, where associations between different kinds of information elements carry the main burden of representation. Connectionism is a special case of associationism that models associations using artificial neuron networks. The Semantic Web builds almost entirely on the symbolic methodology. The core of this paper will be to outline the conceptual approach to representations (sections 4-9). I shall argue that if we want to build real content into a system, one should rely on the conceptual methodology. A remarkable feature of human thinking is our ability to combine concepts and, in particular, to understand new combinations of concepts [16]. Nobody has problems grasping the meaning of combinations like pink elephant, striped apple and cubic soapbubble, even if one never will encounter any object with these properties. In all kinds of web applications, for example query answering systems, inputs in form of combinations of concepts are ubiquitous. Consequently, an important criterion for a successful computational model of the semantics of concepts is that it should be able to handle combinations of concepts. In classical logic and in the Semantic Web, combinations of concepts are expressed by conjunctions of properties. This means that the reference of the combination of two concepts is taken to be the intersection of the classes representing of the two individual concepts. However, it turns out there are many everyday combinations of concepts that cannot be analysed in this simplistic manner. For example, tall squirrel, honey bee, stone lion, and white Zinfandel (which happens to be a rose wine) cannot be analysed in terms of intersections of classes. In general, current symbolic methods have serious problems handling concept combinations in the way humans do.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1798667612", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60724313", "8054340", "123151525", "17427587", "9320365", "15776581", "18383649", "9552655", "19548784", "17124799", "62066129", "1097618", "60902634", "142299281", "36232065", "177630548", "140978166", "43759520", "26725043", "143343378", "146252382", "117916036", "16498299", "144499513", "145428925", "500106", "117201421", "118953388", "144243674", "54151261", "144952337", "144574700", "145746009"], "inbound_citations": ["2715990", "15596590", "11530003", "15780681", "13876023", "1225261", "253860", "17497776", "16387247", "17288124", "14375286", "8246512", "1450676", "15172411", "7744737", "15111710", "54015761", "6339025", "11598289", "44178276", "15198691", "15011010", "2407914", "32644926", "18137384", "53723404", "16749286", "22041559", "14132714", "15795546", "10953992", "202592806", "2910329", "40755615", "16104704", "9899724", "7280272", "685293", "17895713", "17955949"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55908311"}

The main aim of the night vision systems is to avoid collision of vehicles with the pedestrians while driving on roads. It is very much important in night time, due to the varying light conditions it is very difficult to detect a pedestrian. With the presentation of night vision systems another sort of driver support is achieved, which can compensate the weaknesses of the human visual system after shutdown of sunlight. A NIR (Near Infrared) camera is used in this system to take images of a night scene. As there are large intra class variations in the pedestrian poses, a tree structured classifier is proposed here to handle the problem by training it with different subset of images and different sizes. This research work discusses about combination of Haar-Cascade and HOG-SVM (Histogram of Oriented Gradients-Support Vector Machine) for classification and validation. Haar-Cascade is trained such that to classify the full body of humans which eliminates most of the non-pedestrian regions. For refining the pedestrians after detection, a part based SVM classifier with HOG features is used. Upper and lower body part HOG features of the pedestrians are used for part based validation of detected bounding boxes. A full body validation scheme is also implemented using HOG-SVM when any one of the part based validation does not validate that particular part.

Lack of up to date information about the distribution of Aedes species hampers surveillance and control. Global databases have been compiled but these did not capture data in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), and any models built using these datasets fail to identify highly suitable areas where one or both species may occur. The first objective of this study was therefore to update the existing Ae. aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) and Ae. albopictus (Skuse, 1895) compendia and the second objective was to generate species distribution models targeted to the EMR. A final objective was to engage the WHO points of contacts within the region to provide feedback and hence validate all model outputs. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus compendia provided by Kraemer et al. (Sci Data 2:150035, 2015; Dryad Digit Repos, 2015) were used as starting points. These datasets were extended with more recent species and disease data. In the next step, these sets were filtered using the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification and the Mahalanobis distance. The occurrence data were supplemented with pseudo-absence data as input to Random Forests. The resulting suitability and maximum risk of establishment maps were combined into hard-classified maps per country for expert validation. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The EMR datasets consisted of 1995 presence locations for Ae. aegypti and 2868 presence locations for Ae. albopictus. The resulting suitability maps indicated that there exist areas with high suitability and/or maximum risk of establishment for these disease vectors in contrast with previous model output. Precipitation and host availability, expressed as population density and night-time lights, were the most important variables for Ae. aegypti. Host availability was the most important predictor in case of Ae. albopictus. Internal validation was assessed geographically. External validation showed high agreement between the predicted maps and the experts' extensive knowledge of the terrain. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Maps of distribution and maximum risk of establishment were created for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for the WHO EMR. These region-specific maps highlighted data gaps and these gaps will be filled using targeted monitoring and surveillance. This will increase the awareness and preparedness of the different countries for Aedes borne diseases.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5813415", "pubmed_id": "29444675", "doi": "10.1186/s12942-018-0125-0", "venue": "International Journal of Health Geographics", "journal": "International Journal of Health Geographics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2800113800", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["34977068", "3273987", "5487157", "41440418", "2777259", "126085139", "8667013", "83689386", "17952309", "53609562", "53649414", "8376937", "89141", "3626971", "11077516", "10687542", "6027028", "10051300", "27255747", "10108094", "6234985"], "inbound_citations": ["198193345", "52184571", "125376258", "49643365"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3333548"}

Benefited from the development of the Internet of things, large-scale noise monitoring systems have been developed and applied to monitor the airport noise, thus a large amount of real-time noise data has been collected, making it possible to train an airport noise prediction model using an appropriate machine learning algorithm. Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm and has been demonstrated to have better performance than many existing algorithms. Thus, we intend to adopt SVM as the base learning algorithm. However, in some cases, the monitored airport noise data contains many outliers, which degrades the prediction performance of the trained SVM. To enhance its outlier immunity, in this paper, we design a Local Outlier Factor based Fuzzy Support Vector Regression algorithm (LOF-FSVR) for airport noise prediction, in which we calculate the fuzzy membership of each sample based on a local outlier factor. In addition, ensemble learning has become a powerful paradigm to effectively improve the prediction performance of individual models, motivated by ensemble learning, we propose a LOF-FSVR based ensemble prediction model to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability of single LOF-FSVR airport noise prediction model.

During the biocuration process, a critical first step is to identify from all published literature the papers that contain results for a specific data type the curator is interested in annotating. This step normally requires curators to manually examine many papers to ascertain which few contain information of interest and thus, is usually time consuming. We developed an automatic method for identifying papers containing these curation data types among a large pool of published scientific papers based on the machine learning method Support Vector Machine (SVM). This classification system is completely automatic and can be readily applied to diverse experimental data types. It has been in use in production for automatic categorization of 10 different experimental datatypes in the biocuration process at WormBase for the past two years and it is in the process of being adopted in the biocuration process at FlyBase and the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). We anticipate that this method can be readily adopted by various databases in the biocuration community and thereby greatly reducing time spent on an otherwise laborious and demanding task. We also developed a simple, readily automated procedure to utilize training papers of similar data types from different bodies of literature such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster to identify papers with any of these data types for a single database. This approach has great significance because for some data types, especially those of low occurrence, a single corpus often does not have enough training papers to achieve satisfactory performance.ResultsWe successfully tested the method on ten data types from WormBase, fifteen data types from FlyBase and three data types from Mouse Genomics Informatics (MGI). It is being used in the curation work flow at WormBase for automatic association of newly published papers with ten data types including RNAi, antibody, phenotype, gene regulation, mutant allele sequence, gene expression, gene product interaction, overexpression phenotype, gene interaction, and gene structure correction.ConclusionsOur methods are applicable to a variety of data types with training set containing several hundreds to a few thousand documents. It is completely automatic and, thus can be readily incorporated to different workflow at different literature-based databases. We believe that the work presented here can contribute greatly to the tremendous task of automating the important yet labor-intensive biocuration effort.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3305665", "pubmed_id": "22280404", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-13-16", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2104544690", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3076467", "16102065", "5119495", "423509", "16216835", "8347804", "4139470", "16221327", "4068646", "10512019", "1493462", "3259472", "17503448", "2229104", "574041", "60532258", "2427083", "62932125", "14798917", "809191", "5083193", "42053998", "6688577", "961425", "8501064", "54597110", "207170363", "8934190", "6534012", "2100382", "1446941"], "inbound_citations": ["18602869", "19007897", "64473762", "204850863", "215169827", "1844658", "12145294", "96435550", "9996260", "52004329", "11464645", "139100190", "3809545", "1482030", "215375070", "199070305", "212750405", "7576891", "148563741", "7240293", "4560427"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4841941"}

Conventional reactionless motion planning and control methods require the precise knowledge of system dynamics with ideal path tracking performance, which are impossible to achieve in reality. To solve this problem, an adaptive reactionless path planning and control integrated strategy is proposed for free-floating space robots while manipulating unknown objects. For details, a SW-RLS (Slide-windowed Recursive Least Square) algorithm is employed to construct the adaptive reactionless path planning by identifying and compensating the unknown property in the form of a time-variable matrix for the momentum equation of the system. Simultaneously, a robust adaptive control strategy via the PSO-ELM (Particle Swarm Optimization-Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm is proposed to track the dynamic change in the planned path, based on the foundation of a designed PD controller for reducing the error. With computational efficiency, an adaptive controller via PSO-ELM aims at learning and compensating for the unknown property intelligently; then, a robust controller is used to reject the model uncertainties. The notable feature of the proposed strategy is that it requires neither an accurate system model nor any information about the unknown property. Most importantly, the design can dynamically realize reactionless path tracking performance. Finally, the simulations of a free-floating space robot capturing an unknown object and comparisons with existing methods are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11071-017-3947-6", "venue": null, "journal": "Nonlinear Dynamics", "mag_id": "2768351043", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198145473", "208835021"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125706375"}

In this paper, we propose a classification-based local vertex ranking architecture through dual generative adversarial networks in the semi-supervised setting, DQGAN, for analyzing sparse noisy graphs with rarely labeled data. First, we develop a quadruple generative adversarial ClassNet model to address the noisy data and data sparsity issues as well as to classify each vertex into K classes by automatically creating imaginary/real-looking supplementary labeled vertices with the quite different/similar distributions as real vertices, without the high cost of multi-step graph propagation, heterogeneous graph mining, and iterative weight learning. In addition, the vertex label vicinity is incorporated into the classification model to capture the pairwise vertex closeness based on the labeling and align the vertex label vicinity with the well-known vertex homophily for preserving the original structural semantics in the classification space. Second, we present a quintuple generative adversarial RankNet framework to locally rank each vertex on each of K classes by designing the game of multiple competitors utilizing the mix of real and noisy data to fight against each other, for improving the robustness of local vertex ranking to noisy data with few help from human efforts. The cycle ranking consistency strategy is designed to make the ranking quality verifiable through the bidirectional information-lossless translations between the original features and the ranking features. We propose to utilize the relaxed local PageRank property to produce high-quality local vertex ranking results in the context of information networks.

By effectively learning low-dimensional embeddings of graph nodes, they have shown state-of-the-art performance. However, most existing models learn node embeddings by exploring flat information propagation across the edges within the local neighborhood of each node. We argue that incorporating hierarchical node embeddings can capture the inherently hierarchical topological features of many realistic graphs such as social networks, biological network and World Wide Web. In this paper we propose GRAHIES, a general framework for graph neural networks to learn node representations that preserve hierarchical graph information at higher-orders. GRAHIES adaptively learns a multi-level hierarchical structure of the input graph, which consists of successively coarser (smaller) graphs that preserve the global structure of the original graphs at different levels. By combining the graph representations from different levels of the graph hierarchy, the final node representation captures the inherent global hierarchical structure of the original graph. Our experiments show that applying GRAHIES's hierarchical paradigm yields improved accuracy for existing graph neural networks on the node classification tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CogMI48466.2019.00011", "venue": "2019 IEEE First International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (CogMI)", "journal": "2019 IEEE First International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (CogMI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3008778157", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3144218", "4106658", "207557742", "195908774", "3016223", "4755450", "29155646", "3292002", "8393918", "50776464", "52895589", "39741524", "9665943", "47018956", "4770492", "49420315", "56507745", "14848918", "7735465", "2760873", "29728567", "6628106", "5575601", "3051291", "7008752", "4000470"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211227873"}

The potential applicability of SVR model is assessed with two different framework models (ANN-ELM, GPR) based on various statistical measures (r2, RMSE, MAE, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, objective function (OBJ), Scatter Index (SI) and BIAS). The model selection was based on lowest OBJ value for each station amongst three models (SVR, ANN-ELM, GPR). The SVR model was trained using the Radial Basis Function (RBF).

From results, among all the stations, the SVR outperformed GPR and ANN-ELM with lowest OBJ value for the three stations a (1.378, 1.202, 1.570).

Logic programs are used as a single representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. ILP is differentiated from most other forms of Machine Learning (ML) both by its use of an expressive representation language and its ability to make use of logically encoded background knowledge. This has allowed successful applications of ILP in areas such as molecular biology and natural language which both have rich sources of background knowledge and both benefit from the use of an expressive concept representation languages. For instance, the ILP system Progol has recently been used to generate comprehensible descriptions of the 23 most populated fold classes of proteins, where no such descriptions had previously been formulated manually. In the natural language area ILP has not only been shown to have higher accuracies than various other ML approaches in learning the past tense of English but also shown to be capable of learning accurate grammars which translate sentences into deductive database queries. The area of Learning Language in Logic (LLL) is producing a number of challenges to existing ILP theory and implementations. In particular, language applications of ILP require revision and extension of a hierarchically defined set of predicates in which the examples are typically only provided for predicates at the top of the hierarchy. New predicates often need to be invented, and complex recursion is usually involved. Advances in ILP theory and implementation related to the challenges of LLL are already producing beneficial advances in other sequence-oriented applications of ILP.

In this paper, a pruning ensemble model of ELM with L 1/2 regularizer (PE-ELMR) is proposed to solve above problems. It involves two stages. First, we replace the original solving method of the output parameter in ELM to a minimum squared-error problem with sparse solution by combining ELM with L 1/2 regularizer.

In order to achieve this goal, accessible high-quality data and proper modeling process are critically required. The main purpose of the study focuses on developing and validating different modelling approach for analysis and forecasting of Caspian Sea level anomalies based on Topex/Poseidon and Jason-1 altimetry data generally covering 1993-2008-2013, which are originally developed and optimized for open oceans but have the considerable capability to monitor inland water level changes. Since these altimetric measurements comprise of a large datasets and then are complicated to be used for our purposes, for the first stage of the study, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is adopted to reduce the complexity of large time series data analysis. Furthermore, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is applied for further analyzing and forecasting the time series. According to our analysis, ARIMA (1,1,0)(0,1,1) model has been found as an optimal representative model capable of predicting pattern of Caspian Sea level anomalies reasonably. Due to presence of temporal and spatial data gaps, least squares polynomial interpolation is thus performed to fill the gaps of along-track sea surface heights used for the next stage of study. The data were then adapted to Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HWES) for investigating the capability of another linear approach for predicting the Caspian Sea level behavior. Although the modeling results agree well with the observed time series, but due to stochastic and nonlinearity nature of most water resources time series, these methods may not always perform well when applied in modeling hydrological time series. Therefore, in order to provide more applicable modelling approach, different artificial intelligent techniques were used for the short term Caspian Sea level forecasting. The forecast is performed by Multi-layer Perceptron network (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gene Expression Programming (GEP). The overall results show that comparing with a routine Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model, different neural network methodologies perform satisfactorily as a powerful tool in providing reliable results for predicting the short term Caspian Sea level anomalies. While all artificial intelligent approaches showed superior performance compare with conventional linear methods, the inter-comparison analysis verified that SVM has the best performance in predicting Caspian Sea-level anomalies, given the minimum Root Mean Square Error (RMSE=0.035) and maximum coefficient of determination (R2=0.96).

That is, if some proportion of units and/or connections are removed from a network, performance on a task is typically only partially impaired rather than completely abolished. Most demonstrations of graceful degradation in networks have used only very general measures of performance, such as total error on a task.

Two machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), were implemented to downscale the yearly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B43 V7 (TRMM 3B43 V7) precipitation data from 25 km to 1 km over the Tibetan Plateau area, and the downscaled results were validated on the basis of observations from meteorological stations and comparisons with previous downscaling algorithms.

The downscaled results also had higher accuracy than the original TRMM 3B43 V7 dataset. Moreover, models including land surface temperature variables (LSTs) performed better than those without LSTs, indicating the significance of considering precipitation\u2013land surface temperature when downscaling TRMM 3B43 V7 precipitation data. The RF model with only NDVI and DEM produced much worse accuracy than the SVM model with the same variables. This indicates that the Random Forests algorithm is more sensitive to LSTs than the SVM when downscaling yearly TRMM 3B43 V7 precipitation data over Tibetan Plateau.

Recently, Sparse Modeling Representative Selection (SMRS) was proposed as a powerful filter method for selecting the most relevant examples/instances in subspaces. The selection is achieved by ranking the examples using the L2 norm of the associated row in a coding matrix. This coding matrix is computed using data self-representativeness (the dictionary is given by the examples themselves) adopting block sparsity regularization. In this paper, we propose a decremental Sparse Modeling Representative Selection (D-SMRS) in which the selection of the representatives is broken down into several nested processes. The key contribution is a new scheme of sparse modeling that proceeds by progressive coding and pruning. It proceeds by eliminating outlier and noisy samples in the first stages so that the final stage (coding and selection) is performed on clean data. Thus, the final instance selection will not be heavily affected by the presence of outliers and aberrant samples. The proposed method was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. The qualitative evaluation concerned image selection and video summarization. The quantitative evaluation was performed on six benchmark image datasets using several state-of-the art selection methods with four different classifiers: 1-Nearest Neighbor (NN), Nearest Subspace (NS), Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The outlier rejection ability of the proposed method is also studied on real images. In all cases the selection computed by our algorithm achieved or outperformed existing state-of-the-art results.

The distracted driving epidemic has long been under research to identify its impact on driving behavior. There have been a few attempts to detect drivers\u2019 engagement in secondary tasks from observed driving behavior. Yet, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, not much effort has been directed to identify the types of secondary tasks from driving behavior parameters. This study proposes a bi-level hierarchical classification methodology using machine learning to identify the different types of secondary tasks drivers are engaged in using their driving behavior parameters. At the first level, drivers\u2019 engagement in secondary tasks is detected, while at the second level, the distinct types of secondary tasks are identified. Comparative evaluation is performed between nine ensemble tree classification methods to identify three types of secondary tasks (hand-held cellphone calling, cellphone texting, and interaction with an adjacent passenger). The inputs to the models are five driving behavior parameters (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, pedal position, and yaw rate) along with their standard deviations. The results showed that the overall secondary task detection accuracy ranged from 66% to 96%, except for the Decision Tree that was able to detect engagement in secondary tasks with a high accuracy of 99.8%. For the identification of secondary tasks types, the overall accuracy ranged from 55% to 79%, with the highest accuracy of 82.2% achieved by the Random Forest method. The findings of the paper show the proposed methodology promising to (1) characterize drivers\u2019 engagement in unlawful secondary tasks (such as texting) as a counter measure to prevent crashes, and (2) alert drivers to pay attention back to the main driving task when risky changes to their driving behavior take place.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30554059", "doi": "10.1016/j.aap.2018.12.005", "venue": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "journal": "Accident; analysis and prevention", "mag_id": "2905239410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203598665", "199379527"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56477374"}

Traditionally, fault identification uses either hardware redundancy or software redundancy for trouble-shooting the source of faults in a system. Unfortunately, this imposes a data redundancy cost on such systems. Instead of performing model inversion that requires an accurate model, in transduction estimates of the values of a function at specified points are required, instead of learning a general rule on the entire input domain. Transductive learning is motivated from similar arguments underlying state-of-the-art classification and regression methods such as support vector machines. However, transduction is more fundamental as it is a step used in proving learning error bounds in classical statistical learning theory. Use of transduction allows a flexible ordering of the classes of functions from which a model is selected and, therefore, the error bounds are provably tight. The potential of the proposed framework is assessed using data from metallurgical process systems. It is shown that for higher dimensional and large multiclass systems, the proposed framework gives better performances with respect to classification error minimization.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3182/20100802-3-ZA-2014.00016", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC Proceedings Volumes", "mag_id": "2074541706", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62195213"}

However, the model can become redundant if it is intended for a specific task. For example, assume we have a vast unlabelled audio dataset, and we want to learn a representation from this dataset so that it can be used to improve the emotion recognition performance of a small labelled audio dataset. During the representation learning training, if the model does not know the post emotion recognition task, it can completely ignore emotion-related characteristics in the learnt representation.

The formulation enables information sharing and discriminative learning of parameters. Secondly, a hierarchical HMM with an unbounded number of actions and poses is used to represent activities. The construction produces a simplified model for activity classification by using logistic regression to capture the relationship between action states and activity labels. Finally, the action classes are modelled by a Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF) with the number of intermediate hidden states learned from data.

This study also pursues the following specific objectives: a) using different clustering methods and comparing them for customer classification, b) finding the effective variables in determining the customer loyalty, and c) using different collective classification methods to increase the modeling accuracy and comparing the results with the basic methods. Since loyal customers generate more profit, this study aims at introducing a two-step model for classification of customers and their loyalty. For this purpose, various methods of clustering such as K-medoids, X-means and K-means were used, the last of which outperformed the other two through comparing with Davis-Bouldin index. Customers were clustered by using K-means and members of these four clusters were analyzed and labeled.

The identification of areas affected by torrential phenomena represents the first step performed in the present research. These areas with a total surface of 260 km 2 were divided into training areas (70%) and validating areas (30%). By the mean of Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) model, 10 flash-flood conditioning factors were selected and further used for the Flash-Flood Potential assessment. Based on the spatial relationship between areas affected by torrential phenomena and flash-floods conditioning factors characteristics, the FR and WoE coefficients were calculated. In order to be integrated into Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (RBF) analysis, these values were standardized. According to the results of the 4 hybrid models used for FFPI calculation, the high and very high Flash-Flood Potential are spread over 33% of the study area.

However, the majority of individuals will prove to be resilient and go on to experience remission of their symptoms and function well. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using structural MRI measures collected in UHR adolescents at baseline to quantitatively predict their long-term clinical outcome and level of functioning. We included 64 UHR individuals and 62 typically developing adolescents (12\u201318 years old at recruitment). At six-year follow-up, we determined resilience for 43 UHR individuals. Support Vector Regression analyses were performed to predict long-term functional and clinical outcome from baseline MRI measures on a continuous scale, instead of the more typical binary classification. This led to predictive correlations of baseline MR measures with level of functioning, and negative and disorganization symptoms. The highest correlation (r = 0.42) was found between baseline subcortical volumes and long-term level of functioning. In conclusion, our results show that structural MRI data can be used to quantitatively predict long-term functional and clinical outcome in UHR individuals with medium effect size, suggesting that there may be scope for predicting outcome at the individual level. Moreover, we recommend classifying individual outcome on a continuous scale, enabling the assessment of different functional and clinical scales separately without the need to set a threshold.

Over the decades, this learning process has attracted thousands of researchers and has been widely used in the speech, visual, and text recognition fields. One deep network multi-layer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) achieves a good performance in representation learning while inheriting the advantages of faster learning and the approximating capability of the extreme learning machine (ELM). However, as with most deep networks, the ML-ELM\u2019s algorithmic performance largely depends on the probability distribution of the training data. In this paper, we propose an improved ML-ELM made via using the local significant regions at the input end to enhance the contributions of these regions according to the idea of the selective attention mechanism. To avoid involving and exploring the complex principle of the attention system and to focus on the clarification of our local regional enhancement idea, the paper only selects two typical attention regions. One is the geometric central region, which is normally the important region to attract human attention due to the focal attention mechanism. The other is the task-driven interest region, with facial recognition as an example. The comprehensive experiments are done on the three public datasets of MNIST, NORB, and ORL. The comparison experiment results demonstrate that our proposed region-enhanced ML-ELM (RE-ML-ELM) achieves performance increases in important feature learning by utilizing the apriori knowledge of attention and has a higher recognition rate than that of the normal ML-ELM and the basic ELM. Moreover, it benefits from the non-iterative parameter training method of other ELMs, and our proposed algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art deep networks such as deep belief network(DBN), in the aspects of training efficiency. Furthermore, because of the deep structure with fewer hidden nodes at each layer, our proposed RE-ML-ELM achieves a comparable training efficiency to that of the ML-ELM but has a higher training speed with the basic ELM, which is normally the width single network that has more hidden nodes to obtain the similar recognition accuracy with the deep networks. Based on our idea of combining the apriori knowledge of the human selective attention system with the data learning, our proposed region-enhanced ML-ELM increases the image classification performance.

Statistical analyses of individual base classifiers are carried out to prune the ensemble model without compromising the classification accuracy of the model.

The presented feature extraction algorithm is composed of two layers, and the bases of these two layers are uniformly learned by a plain $K$-means clustering algorithm. Coincidentally, the feature extraction performance of the aforementioned two layers is consistent with visual processing of human visual cortex. More specifically, the first layer can generate edgelike bases, which are analogous to the neuron responses of primary visual cortex (V1), and the second layer can produce cornerlike bases, which resemble the neuron responses of visual extrastriate cortical area two (V2). The proposed feature extraction approach can automatically extract not only simple structure features (e.g., edges) but also complex structure features (e.g., corners and junctions). The learned feature is further discriminated by the linear support vector machine classifier for scene classification.

This limitation arises from the crew's inability to determine the location of obstacles in the environment by sight. In order to assist the crew in these circumstances a range of equipment and sensors may be installed in the helicopter. However, with multiple sensors on board, the problem of efficiently assimilating the large amount of imagery and data available generates a significant workload. A reduction of the workload may be achieved by the automation of this assimilation (sensor fusion) and the design of a system to guide the pilot along obstacle free paths. In order to provide the guidance to avoid obstacles a system must have knowledge about the obstacles' possible positions and likely future positions relative the system's own aircraft. Since the information being provided by the sensors will not be perfect, (i.e. it will have some uncertainty associated with it), and since the process model, which must be used to predict any future positions, will also be uncertain, the required positions must be estimated. As the dynamics of moving obstacles will be a priori unknown, it will be necessary to learn process models for them. The dynamics of the obstacles cannot be guaranteed to be linear, therefore these process models must be capable of reflecting this non-linear behaviour. The uncertain information produced by the various sensors will be related to required knowledge about the obstacles by a sensor model, however this relationship need not be linear, and may even have to be learned. Currently used estimation techniques (e.g. the ordinary extended Kalman filter) are inadequate for estimating the uncertainty involved in the obstacles' positions for the highly non-linear processes under consideration. Neural network approaches to non-linear estimation have recently allowed process and sensor models to be learned (sometimes implicitly), however these approaches have been quite ad hoc in their implementation and have been even more negligent in the estimation of uncertainty.

However, analyzing sentiments on tweets is still difficult because tweets are very short and contain slang, informal expressions, emoticons, mistyping and many words not found in a dictionary. In addition, more than 90 percent of the words in public sentiment lexicons, such as SentiWordNet, are objective words, which are often considered less important in a classification module. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that incorporates sentiment lexicons into a machine learning approach to improve sentiment classification in tweets. We automatically construct an Add-on lexicon that compiles the polarity scores of objective words and out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words from tweet corpora.

It is typically achieved via machine learning, where a model is built on the basis of a typically large collection of document features. Feature selection is critical in this process, since there are typically several thousand potential features (distinct words or terms). In text classi cation, feature selection aims to improve the computational e ciency and classi cation accuracy by removing irrelevant and redundant terms (features), while retaining features (words) that contain su cient information that help with the classi cation task. This thesis proposes binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) hybridized with either K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for feature selection in Arabic text classi cation tasks. Comparison between feature selection approaches is done on the basis of using the selected features in conjunction with SVM, Decision Trees (C4.5), and Naive Bayes (NB), to classify a hold out test set. Using publically available Arabic datasets, results show that BPSO/KNN and BPSO/SVM techniques are promising in this domain. The sets of selected features (words) are also analyzed to consider the di erences between the types of features that BPSO/KNN and BPSO/SVM tend to choose. This leads to speculation concerning the appropriate feature selection strategy, based on the relationship between the classes in the document categorization task at hand. The thesis also investigates the use of statistically extracted phrases of length two as terms in Arabic text classi cation. In comparison with Bag of Words text representation, results show that using phrases alone as terms in Arabic TC task decreases the classi cation accuracy of Arabic TC classi ers signi cantly while combining bag of words and phrase based representations may increase the classi cation accuracy of the SVM classi er slightly.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "596975609", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199372792"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41103346"}

We calculated gene pathogenicity prediction (GPP) score by a machine learning approach (random forest algorithm) to evaluate the pathogenicity of genes. When we applied the GPP score to the testing gene set, we obtained accuracy of 80%, recall of 93% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87. Our results estimated that a total of 10,399 protein-coding genes were Mendelian disease genes. Furthermore, we found the GPP score was positively correlated with the severity of disease. Our results indicate that GPP score may provide a robust and reliable guideline to predict the pathogenicity of protein-coding genes. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to estimate the total number of Mendelian disease genes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/553362", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952944899", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["850194", "26752366", "16533700", "6651786", "27930174", "2593453", "1135530", "34369235", "205355668", "13294219", "4592941", "215573165", "2655652", "3553441", "19382079", "4472956", "18837723", "18261644", "25086219"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196689622"}

The existing super-resolution methods attempt to resolve this issue, but there are still shortcomings, such as hallucinate details after super-resolution, low precision after reconstruction, etc. To dispose these problems, we propose the Laplacian Pyramid Generation Adversarial Network (LSRGAN) in order to generate visually better cardiovascular ultrasound images so as to aid physician diagnosis and treatment. Methods and results In order to address the problem of low image resolution, we used the Laplacian Pyramid to analyze the high-frequency detail features of super-resolution (SR) reconstruction of images with different pixel sizes. To eliminate gradient disappearance, we implemented the least squares loss function as the discriminator, we introduce the residual-dense block (RDB) as the basic network building unit is used to generate higher quality images. The experimental results show that the LSRGAN can effectively avoid the illusion details after super-resolution and has the best reconstruction quality. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed algorithm generates higher quality super-resolution images that comes with higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity (SSIM) scores. Conclusion We implemented a novel LSRGAN network model, which solves reduces insufficient resolution and hallucinate details of MRI after super-resolution.

In the set of experiments tested on a sepsis therapy dataset, ECM was able to surpass the standard threshold-based method and the state-of-the-art method for early classification of multivariate time series.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26336666", "doi": "10.1504/IJDMB.2015.067955", "venue": "International journal of data mining and bioinformatics", "journal": "International journal of data mining and bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2141541629", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14121525", "28817", "207165665", "194951", "961425", "9515661", "58129309", "8343565", "1818942", "16277345", "18859116", "741498", "6119067", "59750584", "11358505", "8016052", "5839507", "18077597", "2365841", "17089577"], "inbound_citations": ["5699176", "12423333"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14862021"}

Although many prediction methods have been developed, it remains a significant challenge to predict enzyme functions at the fourth-digit level of the Enzyme Commission numbers. Functional specificity of enzymes often changes drastically by mutations of a small number of residues and therefore, information about these critical residues can potentially help discriminate detailed functions. However, because these residues must be identified by mutagenesis experiments, the available information is limited, and the lack of experimentally verified specificity determining residues (SDRs) has hindered the development of detailed function prediction methods and computational identification of SDRs. Here we present a novel method for predicting enzyme functions by random forests, EFPrf, along with a set of putative SDRs, the random forests derived SDRs (rf-SDRs). EFPrf consists of a set of binary predictors for enzymes in each CATH superfamily and the rf-SDRs are the residue positions corresponding to the most highly contributing attributes obtained from each predictor. EFPrf showed a precision of 0.98 and a recall of 0.89 in a cross-validated benchmark assessment. The rf-SDRs included many residues, whose importance for specificity had been validated experimentally. The analysis of the rf-SDRs revealed both a general tendency that functionally diverged superfamilies tend to include more active site residues in their rf-SDRs than in less diverged superfamilies, and superfamily-specific conservation patterns of each functional residue. EFPrf and the rf-SDRs will be an effective tool for annotating enzyme functions and for understanding how enzyme functions have diverged within each superfamily.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3885575", "pubmed_id": "24416252", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0084623", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2040500459", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["83964422", "8290781", "13987353", "6392162", "14633921", "1574076", "31202361", "21516635", "5719990", "11721238", "14041511", "14058", "14441902", "16790579", "2766008", "8800506", "2315660", "27454059", "495870", "1391689", "24695944", "9098506", "17535050", "11415703", "6890499", "13992957", "41426766", "89141", "15245447", "23369575", "18025374", "17924311", "2126217", "6143930", "11983482", "13389189", "42106557", "34175341", "7170581", "28648866", "13493762", "10867953", "456037", "22878843", "12309063", "8598912", "36523543", "5304293", "19790414", "41105045", "33159177", "20382603", "12267874", "19764616", "532177", "16948052", "9700576", "5879733", "1673582", "40970905", "12138269", "28833513", "22289162", "16205046", "23318135", "10175399", "7719782", "12389351", "2616817", "1782931", "41608467", "14074658", "7260461", "5262555", "13861754"], "inbound_citations": ["215611957", "203175607", "214076075", "207815538", "14340163", "215221362", "195064638", "3790226", "12586618", "52315011", "5919637", "54210878"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14866346"}

In this paper, we introduce the S-transform into modulation classification and propose a novel method of modulation classification under underwater acoustic channel. Firstly, we set up a model of underwater acoustic channel based on Bellhop and the multipath Rayleigh fading channel model. Next, we extract features of energy entropy of S-transform time-frequency spectrum of signals, and then input them into the classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM). Meanwhile, different signal sets are considered, which have different number of signal schemes. Finally, Matlab simulating experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for each signal set under AWGN channel, and results show that the proposed method reaches higher probability of correct classification than convention methods.

QoL, subjective well-being and psychosocial functioning are important determinants of patient satisfaction and patient-physician relationship and improvement in these domains is often more important for the patients than the reduction of clinical symptoms. With the growing emphasis on personalized care in everyday clinical practice, there is an increasing need for tools that can provide individual predictions on the future course of these patient-centered domains and thus help clinicians in providing individually tailored interventions. Therefore, we used machine learning to predict general and psychological QoL 6-months after an initial assessment in individuals diagnosed with SCZ, BD and SCZA using a combination of clinical, demographic and genetic variables. Methods In an ongoing longitudinal naturalistic study (www.kfo241.de, www.PsyCourse.de), patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for BD, SCZ and SCZA were recruited at multiple sites across Germany and Austria. Information on their sociodemographic background, family history, current psychiatric symptoms, functioning and QoL (WHOQoL-BREF) was obtained with a battery of rating scales in 6-month intervals. For the current analysis results of T1 (N=764) and T2 (N=428) were used. Participants were genotyped on the PsychChip (Illumina) whole-genome SNP array and their SCZ polygenic risk scores (PRS) at 11 different p-value thresholds (pTs) (pT1=0.00000005, pT11=1) were calculated using data from SCZ PGC2 (excluding German participants) as training data set. The importance of the clinical and demographic features and the cumulative SCZ polygenic risk in predicting 6-month (T2) general and psychological QoL was tested using linear Support Vector Machines. The prediction algorithm was wrapped into a repeated-nested cross-validation setting to ensure good generalizability. Results Higher baseline scores on the negative symptoms subscale of the PANSS, higher levels of baseline depression (BDI), lower level of functioning (GAF) and being unemployed or having a part-time job were the most important determinants of impaired T2 general or psychological QoL (test-fold balanced accuracy 61.2% and 71.3%, respectively). The PANSS negative symptoms subscale items were more important in the prediction of general QoL, whereas items of the BDI depression scale had higher weight in predicting psychological QoL. Though having higher SCZ-PRS were associated with lower T2 general QoL, compared to the clinical variables, the SCZ polygenic risk seemed to play a less important role in determining future QoL and thus was not included in the final prediction model. Discussion Our results indicate that prognostic tools using clinical data can potentially be used to indicate future general and psychological QoL of SCZ, BD and SCZA patients. However, the predictive accuracy requires improvement to be clinically useful. Further research will investigate the association found here between SCZ-PRS and lower general QoL with more sensitive biological markers.

Thus, it is necessary to diminish the redundant information from the original EEG signal selecting appropriate channels and also to reduce computational cost. Addressing this problem, we intend to develop a methodology based on channel selection for classification of MI tasks in the BCI applications. In this study, we introduce a new way of channel selection considering anatomical and functional structural of the human brain and also investigate its impact in the classification performance.

The challenge is to developed a drowsiness detection system that is at once adapt to an embedded implementation and easy to use by the driver. In this respect, we propose to evaluate the performance of thise two classifiers used for EEG classification in order to select the most appropriate one which can provide higher classification accuracy. The validation process is conducted on EEG signals of the polysomnography database where EEG signals of 10 persons have been recorded from C3-O1 region. The signal read from the dataset mentioned above is segmented into 30 second windows then features are extracted from these segments using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

Isospectral manifold learning stems from the conclusions that if only the spectrums of manifold are the same, so are their internal structures. However, the difficult task about the calculation of the spectrum is how to select the optimal neighborhood size and construct reasonable neighboring weights. In this paper, a supervised technique called isospectral manifold learning algorithm (IMLA) is proposed. By modifying directly sparse reconstruction weight, IMLA takes into account the within-neighboring information and between-neighboring information. Thus, it not only preserves the sparse reconstructive relationship, but also sufficiently utilizes discriminant information. Compared with PCA and other algorithms, IMLA has obvious advantages.

Nevertheless, the ability of conventional ultrasound techniques is limited by the fact that different biological tissues are sometimes represented with the same image brightness, thus hindering visual \u2014 as well as automatic \u2014 identification. Especially valuable for tissue differentiation is the pressure wave velocity, which can be measured with ultrasound. Deep-learning-based methods carry a possibility to overcome such limitations and enable robust signal-based tissue identification. Such methods have been successfully applied to tackle various challenges of medical imaging research. The aim of the present work is to propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) pipeline towards pixel-wise speed of sound (SoS) reconstruction from plane-wave ultrasound raw channel signals corresponding to three firing angles. The network is trained on a novel synthetic dataset focusing on complex geometry, generated with K-Wave. Results demonstrate a promising performance, with average (\u00b1 STD) absolute SoS reconstruction errors of 38 \u00b154 m/s in real time at 114 fps.

Looking at the recent developments in facial expression recognition techniques, the focus is on artificial neural networks and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in emotion classification. The technique first analyses the information conveyed by the facial regions of the eye and mouth into a merged new image and using it as an input to a feed forward neural network trained by back propagation. The second method showcases the use of Oriented Fast and Rotated (ORB) on a single frame of imagery to extract texture information, and the classification is completed using SVM.

Presently, we do not have effective and reliable solution to this problem without using additional data.

Secondly the fundamentals of two-shaft aero-engine vibration fault diagnosis are described and gotten the standard fault samples (training samples) and simulation samples (testing samples). Third, two AI methods are applied to the vibration fault diagnosis and obtained the diagnostic results. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are compared such as the computing speed, accuracy of diagnosis and complexity of algorithm, and given a suggestion of selecting the diagnostic methods.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.347.323", "venue": null, "journal": "Key Engineering Materials", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2050411352", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["14727192"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110588353"}

Among the several abnormalities observable on mammograms, architecture distortion is one of the most difficult to detect due to its subtlety. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) technology has been widely used for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. In this paper, a new automatic architectural distortion detection method for breast cancer in mammographic images is proposed. Firstly, Gabor filters and phase portrait analysis are used to locate the suspicious regions based on the image characteristic of architectural distortion. Twin bounded Support Vector Machine (TBSVM) is employed to reduce the large amounts of false positives. TBSVM is a kind of binary classifier, which has advantages in both computation efficiency and generalization when dealing with binary classification. For each suspicious region, several features are extracted. However, not every extracted feature contributes to the classification accuracy. We proposed a novel feature selection method for TBSVM and utilized it for the architectural distortion detection in mammograms, named Multiple Twin Bound Support Vector Machines Recursive Feature Elimination (MTBSVM-RFE).

Also, these techniques are not well adaptable at the client-side due to their computation and space complexity. Thus there is a need for light weight visual similarity-based technique detecting phishing sites targeting non-whitelisted legitimate resources. Unlike traditional visual similarity-based techniques using whitelists, in this paper, we employed a light-weight visual similarity based blacklist approach as a first level filter for the detection of near duplicate phishing sites. For the non-blacklisted phishing sites, we have incorporated a heuristic mechanism as a second level filter. We used two fuzzy similarity measures, Simhash and Perceptual hash for calculating the similarity score between the suspicious site and existing blacklisted phishing sites. Each similarity measure generates a unique fingerprint for a given website and also differs with less number of bits with a similar website. All three fingerprints together represent a website which undergoes blacklist filtering for the identification of the target website. The phishing sites which bypassed from the first level filter undergo second level heuristic filtering. We used comprehensive heuristic features including URL and source code based features for the detection of non-blacklisted phishing sites. The experimental results demonstrate that the blacklist filter alone is able to detect 55.58% of phishing sites which are either replicas or near duplicates of existing phishing sites. We also proposed an ensemble model with Random Forest (RF), Extra-Tree and XGBoost to evaluate the contribution of both blacklist and heuristic filters together as an entity and the model achieved a significant accuracy of 98.72% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 97.39%.

With the successful use of Neural Networks on various classification applications, in this paper, we propose FakeGAN a system that for the first time augments and adopts Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for a text classification task, in particular, detecting deceptive reviews. Unlike standard GAN models which have a single Generator and Discriminator model, FakeGAN uses two discriminator models and one generative model. The generator is modeled as a stochastic policy agent in reinforcement learning (RL), and the discriminators use Monte Carlo search algorithm to estimate and pass the intermediate action-value as the RL reward to the generator. Providing the generator model with two discriminator models avoids the mod collapse issue by learning from both distributions of truthful and deceptive reviews. Indeed, our experiments show that using two discriminators provides FakeGAN high stability, which is a known issue for GAN architectures. While FakeGAN is built upon a semi-supervised classifier, known for less accuracy, our evaluation results on a dataset of TripAdvisor hotel reviews show the same performance in terms of accuracy as of the state-of-the-art approaches that apply supervised machine learning.

The idea of embedding is to map hyperspectral pixels in a local neighborhood into a single point in the RKHS that can uniquely represent those pixels collectively. Previously, the authors have employed an HSE called empirical mean map to build the contextual SVM. In this work, a weighted empirical mean map is utilized to exploit the similarities and variation in the local spatial information. For every pixel, a small set of the neighboring pixels in a hyperspectral image are mapped into an RKHS induced by a certain kernel (Eg. Gaussian RBF kernel) and then, the embedded point of these group of pixels is obtained by calculating the weighted empirical mean of these mapped points. The weights are determined based on the distance between the pixel in consideration and its neighbors. An SVM separating hyperplane is built to maximize the margin between classes formed by weighted empirical means.

Here, we first briefly review the literature on graph kernels and then introduce three new kernels (Tanimoto, MinMax, Hybrid) based on the idea of molecular fingerprints and counting labeled paths of depth up to d using depth-first search from each possible vertex. The kernels are applied to three classification problems to predict mutagenicity, toxicity, and anti-cancer activity on three publicly available data sets. The kernels achieve performances at least comparable, and most often superior, to those previously reported in the literature reaching accuracies of 91.5% on the Mutag dataset, 65-67% on the PTC (Predictive Toxicology Challenge) dataset, and 72% on the NCI (National Cancer Institute) dataset.

The classifier thus extracts additional information from strain data to discriminate inspiral signals from noise transients. We evaluate a Random Forest classifier on a set of single-detector events obtained from realistic simulated advanced LIGO data, using simulated NS-BH signals added to the data. The new classifier detects a factor of 1.5 -- 2 more signals at low false positive rates as compared to the standard 're-weighted SNR' statistic, and does not require the chi-squared test to be computed.

Traditionally, researchers investigated the neuro-signal patterns by asking users to perform various imaginary, visual or calculative tasks. In this work, we have analyzed this neuro-signal pattern using audio as stimuli. The EEG signals are recorded simultaneously while user is listening to music. Four different genres of music are considered as users have their own preference and accordingly they respond with different emotions and interests. The users are also asked to provide music preference which acts as a personal identification mechanism. The framework offers the benefit of uniqueness in neuro-signal pattern even with the same music preference by different users. We used two different classifiers i.e. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based temporal classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for user identification system. A dataset of 2400 EEG signals while listening to music was collected from 60 users. User identification performance of 97.50 % and 93.83 % have been recorded with HMM and SVM classifiers, respectively.

Basic understanding of a working principle in reservoir computing can be expected to shed light on how information is stored and processed in nonlinear dynamical systems, potentially leading to progress in a broad range of nonlinear sciences. As a first step toward this goal, from the viewpoint of nonlinear physics and information theory, we study the memory-nonlinearity trade-off uncovered by Dambre et al. (2012). Focusing on a variational equation, we clarify a dynamical mechanism behind the trade-off, which illustrates why nonlinear dynamics degrades memory stored in dynamical system in general. Moreover, based on the trade-off, we propose a mixture reservoir endowed with both linear and nonlinear dynamics and show that it improves the performance of information processing.

Here, comparative analysis of several popular algorithms revealed complementarity in their classification accuracies, which is supported by their divergent scoring strategies.

Traditionally, maps have been created using field-based approaches which, due to limitations in costs and time, restrict the size of the area for which they can be created and frequency at which they can be updated. With the increasing availability of satellite sensors providing multi-spectral imagery with high temporal frequency, new methods for efficient and accurate vegetation mapping have been developed. The objective of this study was to investigate to what extent multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery can assist in mapping complex compositional classifications at fine spatial scales. We deliberately chose a challenging case study, namely a visually and structurally homogenous scrub vegetation (known as kwongan) of Western Australia. The classification scheme consists of 24 target classes and a random 60/40 split was used for model building and validation. We compared several multi-temporal (seasonal) feature sets, consisting of numerous combinations of spectral bands, vegetation indices as well as principal component and tasselled cap transformations, as input to four machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines; SVM, Nearest Neighbour; NN, Random Forests; RF, and Classification Trees; CT) to separate target classes. The results show that a multi-temporal feature set combining autumn and spring images sufficiently captured the phenological differences between the classes and produced the best results, with SVM (74%) and NN (72%) classifiers returning statistically superior results compared to RF (65%) and CT (50%). The SWIR spectral bands captured during spring, the greenness indices captured during spring and the tasselled cap transformations derived from the autumn image emerged as most informative, which suggests that ecological factors (e.g. shared species, patch dynamics) occurring at a sub-pixel level likely had the biggest impact on class confusion. However, despite these challenges, the results are auspicious and suggest that seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery has the potential to predict compositional vegetation classes with high accuracy. Further work is needed to determine whether these results are replicable in other vegetation types and regions.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2019.101980", "venue": "Int.

Traditional approaches use pairwise or higher order handcrafted geometric features to get robust matching; this requires solving NP-hard assignment problems.

Particularly, for data sets with all nonnegative entries, matrix factorization often requires that factor matrices be nonnegative, leading to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). One important application of NMF is for clustering with reduced dimensions of the data represented in the new feature space. In this paper, we propose a new graph regularized NMF method capable of feature learning and apply it to clustering. Unlike existing NMF methods that treat all features in the original feature space equally, our method distinguishes features by incorporating a feature-wise sparse approximation error matrix in the formulation. It enables important features to be more closely approximated by the factor matrices. Meanwhile, the graph of the data is constructed using cleaner features in the feature learning process, which integrates feature learning and manifold learning procedures into a unified NMF model. This distinctly differs from applying the existing graph-based NMF models after feature selection in that, when these two procedures are independently used, they often fail to align themselves toward obtaining a compact and most expressive data representation.

The random forest (RF) is used to effectively analyze the problems of large-p and small-n. Therefore, RF can be used to select and rank the genes for the diagnosis and effective treatment of cancer. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: The microarray gene expression data of colon, leukemia, and prostate cancers were collected from public databases. Primary preprocessing was done on them using limma package, and then, the RF classification method was implemented on datasets separately in R software. Finally, the selected genes in each of the cancers were evaluated and compared with those of previous experimental studies and their functionalities were assessed in molecular cancer processes. ::: ::: ::: Result ::: The RF method extracted very small sets of genes while it retained its predictive performance.

The method first uses human head width as a reference to separate the foreground into multiple levels of blocks. Then it adopts the first-level SVR model to roughly predict the three features extracted from image blocks, including D-SIFT, ULBP, and GIST, and the prediction results are used as new features for the second-level SVR model for fine prediction. The prediction results of all image blocks are added for density estimation according to the crowd levels predefined for different scenes of scenic spots.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network operators benefit from knowing what type of traffic that propagates over their network in order to correctly treat different applications. Today Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and port based classification are two of the more commonly used methods in order to classify Internet traffic. However, both of these techniques fail when the traffic is encrypted. This study explores a third method, classifying Internet traffic by machine learning in which the classification is realized by looking at Internet traffic flow characteristics instead of actual payloads. Machine learning can solve the inherent limitations that DPI and port based classification suffers from. In this study the Internet traffic is divided into two classes of interest: Video and Other. There exist several machine learning methods for classification, and this study focuses on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify traffic. Several traffic characteristics are extracted, such as individual payload sizes and the longest consecutive run of payload packets in the downward direction.

It is based on a conference that was held in 1990, which was sponsored by the Cognitive Science Program and Linguistics Department of Simon Fraser University. Over the last decade, there has emerged a paradigm of cognitive modeling that has been hailed by many researchers as a radically new and promising approach to cognitive science. This new paradigm has come to be known by a number of names, including \"connectionism\", \"neural networks\", and \"parallel distributed processing\", (or PDP). This method of computation attempts to model the neural processes that are thought to underlie cognitive functions in human beings. Unlike the digital computation methods used by AI researchers, connectionist models claim to approximate the kind of spontaneous, creative and somewhat unpredicatable behavior of human agents.

In order to build a better distribution-level peak load prediction reference model for the local utility in Albuquerque, a new nonparametric method, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), is introduced. First, a detailed analysis of peak load and local weather information from 2012 and 2013 are used. Strong linear relationship is displayed between the peak load and various weather factors during the winter and spring months and nonlinear relationship dominates in the summer and fall months. Next, the BART method is applied with a principled permutation-based inferential variable selection approach. The BART method's prediction accuracy is then compared with the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), the result we developed when we cooperated with the local utility company, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). After thoroughly analyzing and testing the methods based on different parameters, the methods are compared with Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) indexes. The BART displays the best prediction accuracy for every index in our case and its uncertain estimate further provides the confidence interval for the peak load prediction, which also has very high accuracy. Thus, the BART provides the local utility with a better reference peak load forecasting model.

This information can be used for several purposes, such as to understand consumers and their preferences. In this direction, the sentiment analysis can be used as a feedback mechanism. This analysis corresponds to classifying a text according to the sentiment that the writer intended to transmit. A basic sentiment classifier determines the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral or positive) of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level. Advanced types may consider other elements like the emotional state (e.g. angry, sad, happy), affective states (e.g. pleasure and pain), motivational states (e.g. hunger and curiosity), temperaments, among others. In general, there are two main approaches to attribute sentiment to tweets: based on knowledge; or based on machine learning algorithms. In the latter case, the learning algorithm requires a pre-classified data sample to determine the class of new data. Typically, the sample is pre-classified manually, making the process time consuming and reducing its real time applicability for big data. This paper proposes a polarity analysis framework for Twitter messages, which combines both approaches and an automatic contextual module. To assess the performance of the proposed framework, four text datasets from the literature are used. Five different types of classifiers were considered: Naive Bayes (NB); Support Vector Machines (SVM); Decision Trees (J48); and Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

The problem of unsupervised feature learning from a time-series dataset poses two challenges.

In this paper, we show that principal component analysis, sparse coding, and non-negative matrix factorization are also meaningless for the same task, and that the systematic approach to learning meaningful features from time-series is by using the shift-invariant versions of these algorithms. Second, by comparing their shift-invariant versions on different kinds of time-series for reconstruction, prediction and classification, we show that no one algorithm is best suited for all time-series. This comparison leads to a method for automatically selecting the suitable feature learning algorithm for a given time-series dataset based on its structural properties.

The conventional feature based identification schemes suffer from the problem of unknown models, that is, some images are captured by the camera models previously unknown to the identification system. To address this problem, we propose a new scheme: Source Camera Identification with Unknown models (SCIU). It has the capability of identifying images of the unknown models as well as distinguishing images of the known models. The new SCIU scheme consists of three stages: 1) unknown detection; 2) unknown expansion; and 3) ( $K+1$ )-class classification. Unknown detection applies a $k$ -nearest neighbours method to recognize a few sample images of unknown models from the unlabeled images. Unknown expansion further extends the set of unknown sample images using a self-training strategy. Then, we address a specific ( $K+1$ )-class classification, in which the sample images of unknown (1-class) and known models ( $K$ -class) are combined to train a classifier. In addition, we develop a parameter optimization method for unknown detection, and investigate the stopping criterion for unknown expansion. The experiments carried out on the Dresden image collection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SCIU scheme.

Traditional classifier may have the drawback of low effectiveness for image representations. In this paper, an improved eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) based on weighted column (feature) subsampling is proposed to classify image representations for object classification. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pre-trained on large-scale image database ILSVRC and fine-tuned on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset is used to extract features from object images. Besides, we concatenate multiple layers of learned features to obtain more information of image contents for determining their categories. Second, due to the high dimensional of extracted features, feature redundancy will unavoidably be incurred, so a weighted column subsampling method is proposed to applied to XGBoost algorithm, in order to draw the features by the importance during growing each tree. Futhermore, our proposed method is general, which can be easily extended to other methods which need column subsampling, when the feature of data is high dimensional and redundant. Finally, we validate performance of proposed method on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.

However, in this paper, we argue that tracking and segmentation are actually closely related and solving one should help the other. On one hand, the object track, which is a set of bounding boxes with one bounding box in every frame, would provide strong high-level guidance for the target/background segmentation task. On the other hand, the object segmentation would separate object from other objects and background, which will be useful for determining track locations in every frame. We propose a novel framework which combines online multiple target tracking and segmentation in a video. In our approach, the tracking and segmentation problems are coupled by Lagrange dual decomposition, which leads to more accurate segmentation results and also \\emph{helps resolve typical difficulties in multiple target tracking, such as occlusion handling, ID-switch and track drifting}. To track targets, an individual appearance model is learned for each target via structured learning and network flow is employed to generate tracks from densely sampled candidates. For segmentation, multi-label Conditional Random Field (CRF) is applied to a superpixel based spatio-temporal graph in a segment of video to assign background or target labels to every superpixel.

This paper presents a novel methodology for real-time assessment of short-term voltage stability (STVS) under large disturbances with an approach based on data mining and machine learning. This methodology classifies off-line the power system stability in multiple operating states through the calculation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and dynamic voltage indices. This allows identifying not only fast voltage collapses (FVC) but also fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) events. The multivariate time series data of the power system dynamic response are processed and transformed with a symbolic representation technique. This together with the operating state classification are used to train an intelligent machine based on Random Forest proposed for applying in real time to classify the post-disturbance operating state. This methodology is tested in the New England 39-bus system. The performance of the methodology to classify the STVS in real time was verified, obtaining a classification error less than 2% using a post-contingency data window of 0.58 s and less than one-third of all the bus voltage measurements.

During this process, volatile compounds are liberated giving rise to the formation of a variety of char particles. Char particles morphology can be classified into groups reflecting different coal reactivity levels which may be used to evaluate the effect of coal on the performance of burner. Char particles morphological classification may be automatically done with benefits in terms of speed, consistency and accuracy. However, the classification performance relies on correct identification of char particles. Moreover, broken walls, created during char generation process, blurriness and low contrast are factors that make the classification task a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a system for particle detection and particle classification into two reactive groups. Initially, a set of candidate regions, that may contain particles, is selected by combining regions and edges. Then, regions containing particles are detected using texture features and a Support Vector Machine classifier. The particle classification is done based on the International Commission for Coal Petrology criteria. Experiments using coals from two Colombian regions\u2014Valle and Antioquia\u2014showed that the proposed system, in most cases, correctly detect char particles. Regarding the classification of detected particles, analysed char samples were automatically classified similarly as manual classification did. Consequently, the system is found to be a successful first approach for char combustion reactivity characterisation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compind.2018.12.014", "venue": "Comput.

In this study, we assessed the relations between mammal diversity and current climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation), altitudinal range as well as mammal's food diversity in Inner Mongolia. Our results showed that the species richness for the three feeding guilds of mammals consistently increased with their food diversity, that is, species richness of plants, insects, and rodents. Mammal diversity also significantly decreased with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Random Forest models indicated that climate and food diversity were always included in the combinations of variables most associated with mammal diversity.

In this paper, a new framework for face gender recognition to reach fast face gender recognition is proposed, which is based on Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). LTP is a generalization of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) that is in the presence of monotonic illumination variations on a face image, and has high discriminative power for texture classification. It is also more discriminate and less sensitive to noise in uniform regions. On the other hand, ELM is a new learning algorithm for generalizing single hidden layer feed forward networks without tuning parameters.

The dataset used is publicly available and has a recording of three kinds of EEG signals: pre-ictal, inter-ictal (seizure-free epileptic) and ictal (epileptic with seizure). The proposed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier classifies these three kinds of signals with up to 95% accuracy.

However, organ detection in such an abnormal dataset may have many promising potential real-world applications, such as automatic diagnosis, automated radiotherapy planning, and medical image retrieval, where new multimodal medical images provide more information about the imaged tissues for diagnosis. Here, we test the application of deep learning methods to organ identification in magnetic resonance medical images, with visual and temporal hierarchical features learned to categorize object classes from an unlabeled multimodal DCE-MRI dataset so that only a weakly supervised training is required for a classifier.

In spite of the sophistication of recently developed double-density discrete wavelet transforms (double-density DWTs), it still produces artifacts or destroys fine structures by blurring the data. Inspired by recent manifold learning methods, especially the locally linear embedding (LLE), we discover the underlying fact that image patches in noisy and denoised images construct manifolds with similar local geometry in these two distinct spaces. Therefore, we characterize local geometry by measuring how an image patch represented by a feature vector can be reconstructed by its nearest neighbors in feature space. Besides using the training image patches to construct the embedding, we also propose to overlap the target denoised image patches to satisfy local compatibility and smoothness constraints. In our method, double-density DWTs is incorporated with LLE for the purpose of denoising.

In final step, a robust face recognition algorithm identifies the driver by comparing the face image with face images in a database. On successful identification of the driver face, vehicle is allowed to enter in parking area. To detect vehicle and face(s), we use Adaptive Boosting algorithm and Haar-like features, while driver face identification algorithm uses Eigenfaces for feature selection and Euclidian distance for classification. To test the face identification, we simulate a challenging situation where only a single facial image of a driver is available in the database and four face images in different poses are used for testing.

The LMP operator applied on a pixel, finds the monotonic intensity transition of neighboring pixels at different radii.

They are static gestures that one can perform in a very complex environment containing variations in rotation and scale without using voice. The gestures may be produced in different illumination conditions or occluding background scenarios. Any hand gesture recognition system should find enough discriminative features, such as hand-finger contextual information. However, in existing approaches, depth information of hand fingers that represents finger shapes is utilized in limited capacity to extract discriminative features of fingers. Nevertheless, if we consider finger bending information (i.e., a finger that overlaps palm), extracted from depth map, and use them as local features, static gestures varying ever so slightly can become distinguishable. Our work here corroborated this idea and we have generated depth silhouettes with variation in contrast to achieve more discriminative keypoints. This approach, in turn, improved the recognition accuracy up to 96.84%. We have applied Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm which takes the generated depth silhouettes as input and produces robust feature descriptors as output. These features (after converting into unified dimensional feature vectors) are fed into a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to measure the accuracy. We have tested our results with a standard dataset containing 10 symbolic gesture representing 10 numeric symbols (0-9). After that we have verified and compared our results among depth images, binary images, and images consisting of the hand-finger edge information generated from the same dataset.

With the rapid increase in computing speeds, complex neural network algorithms can be implemented in an acceptable amount of time. In this paper, an optimized face-aging method based on a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is proposed. In this method, an original face image is initially mapped to a personal latent vector by an encoder, and then the personal potential vector is combined with the age condition vector and the gender condition vector through a connector.

Textural features derived from a Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and vegetation features derived from multi-temporal GF-1 and GF-2 satellites were introduced and combined into three different groups. The rotation forest method was then adopted based on a Support Vector Machine (RoF-SVM), which offers the advantage of using an SVM algorithm and that boosts the diversity of individual base classifiers by a rotation forest. The combined spectral-textural-multitemporal features achieved the best classification result. The results were compared with those of the maximum likelihood classifier, support vector machine and random forest method. It is shown that the RoF-SVM algorithm for the combined spectral-textural-multitemporal features can effectively classify an intercropping area (overall accuracy of 86.87% and kappa coefficient of 0.78), and the classification result effectively eliminated salt and pepper noise.

The boost in performance can be attributed to the presence of residual or dense connections within the intermediate layers of these networks.

In this paper, we propose a scale recurrent SR architecture built upon units containing series of dense connections within a residual block (Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs)) that allow extraction of abundant local features from the image. Our scale recurrent design delivers competitive performance for higher scale factors while being parametrically more efficient as compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. To further improve the performance of our network, we employ multiple residual connections in intermediate layers (referred to as Multi-Residual Dense Blocks), which improves gradient propagation in existing layers. Recent works have discovered that conventional loss functions can guide a network to produce results which have high PSNRs but are perceptually inferior. We mitigate this issue by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based framework and deep feature (VGG) losses to train our network.

Much of this landscape is managed by rotational burning to create suitable habitat for gamebirds and there is concern over whether this is driving long-term changes in upland vegetation communities. However, the inaccessibility and scale of uplands means that a practical way to monitor changes in vegetation and burning practices is through the use of remotely sensed data. We develop methods to classify aerial imagery into high-resolution vegetation maps, including the distribution of burns on managed grouse moors. Using the maps, we test for effects of environmental gradients on vegetation cover and its management. ::: Location: Peak District National Park, UK. ::: Methods: We classified colour and infra-red aerial photographs into eight dominant cover classes using the Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm. In addition, heather (Calluna vulgaris) was further differentiated into growth phases, including sites that were newly burnt. We then analysed the distributions of vegetation classes using detrended correspondence analysis and managed burning using generalised additive models. ::: Results: Classification accuracy was ~95% and produced a 5 m resolution vegetation map for 514 km2 of moorland. Cover was highly aggregated and strong nonlinear effects of elevation and slope and weaker effects of aspect and bedrock type were evident in structuring moorland vegetation communities. The classification revealed the spatial distribution of managed burning and suggested that relatively steep areas may be disproportionately burnt. ::: Main conclusions: Random Forest classification of aerial imagery is an efficient method for producing high-resolution maps of upland vegetation.

Our method provides a novel patient classification measure that is grounded in the cancer evolution paradigm, and which reveals repeated evolution during tumorigenesis, with implications for our ability to anticipate malignant evolution.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/156729", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2727339156", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["857338", "205227486", "161079584", "37376008", "3682701", "475237", "205348208", "29992385", "1099689", "3240610", "740063", "214724514", "214727256", "196646943", "15522828", "205308531", "25294711", "20632336", "8737503", "3767412"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89728561"}

In such interfaces, imaginary movements are widely used. Imaginary movement it is the mental process, during which a person imagines a certain movement, as a result of which the neural activity in the motor regions of the cerebral cortex is modulated. These oscillations can be observed in electroencephalograms. Imaginary movements are used to train neurocomputer interfaces, and it is often impossible to evaluate the quality of the subject's performance of the task. The process of performing imaginary movement is not an easy task and requires prior training. Therefore, the accuracy of classification for some subjects can be higher than for other. All methods for imagine movement classification could be improved if there would be a methodology for assessing the quality of subject performance of imaginary movements. Then the data of the experiments could be filtered, and only valid data for training could be used. The paper presents the application of machine learning to detect anomalies (outliers) in data and improve the accuracy of the imaginary movement classification for brain-computer interfaces. The database with electroencephalogram signals of 29 subjects that performed right and left hand imaginary movements (NIRx GmbH, Berlin) was used. The signals from the eight channels corresponding to the motor zones of the cerebral cortex are filtered in alpha and beta frequency ranges. For feature extraction was used parameter event related synchronization and desynchronization which was obtained from different frequency bands after filter the raw EEG. Using this index, the decreasing and increasing of oscillations in alpha and beta rhythms that occur in the localized areas of the motor cortex of the brain can be seen. Support Vector Machine with linear kernel used for classification. An approach is presented on the basis of unsupervised machine learning methods for anomaly detection. As a result, the outlier fraction is obtained. This parameter shows the percentage of saturation data with anomalies. This parameter is actually an indicator of the quality of the input data and is used to clear data before training the brain computer interface. As a result of proposed approach application, the accuracy of the imaginary movement classification increased by 14.9% for 8 subjects. For other subjects, the accuracy remained unchanged, or decreased. This approach is subject-specific and requires customization for a specific user and improvement before further wide usage, but now it is already possible to significantly improve the accuracy of imaginary movement classification for individual subjects. Perspective use of anomaly detection for estimation of imaginary movement quality established.

Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis.

Constraint-based grammar formalisms have been widely used for deep language understanding. Yet, one serious obstacle for their use in real world applications is that these formalisms have overlooked an important requirement: learnability. Currently, there is a poor match between these grammar formalisms and existing learning methods. ::: This dissertation defines a new type of constraint-based grammars, Lexicalized Well-Founded Grammars (LWFGs), which allow deep language understanding and are learnable. These grammars model both syntax and semantics and have constraints at the rule level for semantic composition and semantic interpretation: The interpretation constraints allow access to meaning during language processing. They establish links between linguistic expressions and the entities they refer to in the real world. We use an ontology-based interpretation, proposing a semantic representation that can be conceived as an ontology query language. This representation is sufficiently expressive to represent many aspects of language and yet sufficiently restrictive to support learning and tractable inferences. ::: In this thesis, we propose a new relational learning model for LWFG induction. The learner is presented with a small set of positive representative examples, which consist of utterances paired with their semantic representations. We have proved that the search space for grammar induction is a complete grammar lattice, which allows the construction and generalization of the hypotheses and guarantees the uniqueness of the solution, regardless of the order of learning. We have proved a learnability theorem and leave provided polynomial algorithms for LWFG induction, proving their soundness. The learnability theorem extends significantly the class of problems learnable by Inductive Logic Programming methods. ::: In this dissertation; we have implemented a system that represents an experimental platform for all the theoretical algorithms. The system has the practical advantage of implementing sound grammar revision and grammar merging, which allow an incremental coverage of natural language fragments. We have provided qualitative evaluations that cover the following issues: coverage of diverse and complex linguistic phenomena; terminological knowledge acquisition from natural language definitions; and handling of both precise and vague questions with precise answers at the concept level.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2347745425", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10372442", "12732474", "18749818"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63053245"}

In this paper, we propose new update rule and label propagation criterion in LPA to improve both its computational efficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is optimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm. This change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks) the number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our generalization of the LPA update rule that takes into account, with varying strength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label. Experiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks show that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities compared to those found by the original LPA.

The result achieved by the traditional Gaussian kernel is often unsatisfactory, because it cannot simultaneously avoid underfltting and overfltting.

Rules are assumed to be conjunctions of basic propositions concerning the values taken by the input features. From the perspectives of interpretability as well as generalization, it is highly desirable to construct rule ensembles with low training error, having rules that are i) simple, i.e., involve few conjunctions and ii) few in number. We propose to explore the (exponentially) large feature space of all possible conjunctions optimally and efficiently by employing the recently introduced Hierarchical Kernel Learning (HKL) framework. The regularizer employed in the HKL formulation can be interpreted as a potential for discouraging selection of rules involving large number of conjunctions \u2013 justifying its suitability for constructing rule ensembles. Simulation results show that, in case of many benchmark datasets, the proposed approach improves over state-of-the-art REL algorithms in terms of generalization and indeed learns simple rules. Unfortunately, HKL selects a conjunction only if all its subsets are selected. We propose a novel convex formulation which alleviates this problem and generalizes the HKL framework.

The proposed image descriptor addresses the problem of real-time scene context classification on devices with limited memory and low computational resources (e.g., mobile and other single sensor devices such as wearable cameras). Images are holistically represented starting from the statistics collected in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain. Since the DCT coefficients are usually computed within the digital signal processor for the JPEG conversion/storage, the proposed solution allows to obtain an instant and \"free of charge\" image signature. The novel image representation exploits the DCT coefficients of natural images by modelling them as Laplacian distributions which are summarized by the scale parameter in order to capture the context of the scene. Only discriminative DCT frequencies corresponding to edges and textures are retained to build the descriptor of the image. A spatial hierarchy approach allows to collect the DCT statistics on image sub-regions to better encode the spatial envelope of the scene. The proposed image descriptor is coupled with a Support Vector Machine classifier for context recognition purpose. Experiments on the well-known 8 Scene Context Dataset as well as on the MIT-67 Indoor Scene dataset demonstrate that the proposed representation technique achieves better results with respect to the popular GIST descriptor, outperforming this last representation also in terms of computational costs. Moreover, the experiments pointed out that the proposed representation model closely matches other state-of-the-art methods based on bag of Textons collected on spatial hierarchy.

Our study is focussed on selecting suitable classification algorithm and appropriate input features for better discrimination of psychrophilic protein sequences from mesophilic protein sequences. We have used amino acid composition and hydrophobic residue patterns as input features and found Random Forest algorithm, a recently developed ensemble machine learning technique for better discriminating between mesophilic and psychrophilic proteins. A balanced dataset with 6000 mesophilic and 6000 psychrophilic sequences for training, and with 8432 psychrophilic and 3169 mesophilic sequences for testing was created and used for experiments. Discrimination using only the statistically significant amino acids taken from previous literature was also experimented. For the first time 70.3% testing accuracy is being reported with 71.3 % correctly predicted psychrophilic and 67.7 % correctly predicted mesophilic proteins.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/iCBEB.2012.151", "venue": "2012 International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology", "journal": "2012 International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1968512230", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["20416387", "95498211", "30135224", "95373591", "6388264", "11650978", "424936", "874281", "44313233", "38950909", "206340350", "206560797", "21863916", "89141", "58800505"], "inbound_citations": ["209695604", "17566423", "10502124", "33670654"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28342200"}

In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.", "year": 2015,

With the widespread of multimedia capable devices with accessible media streams, several reciters became more popular than others for their distinct reciting style. It is quite common to find people who recite Quran in mimicry tone for popular reciters. Towards the achievement of a practical classifier system, a representative dataset of audio clips were constructed for seven popular reciters from Saudi Arabia. Key features were extracted from the audio clips, and different perceptual features such as pitch and tempo based features, short time energy were chosen. A combination of perceptual features were also completed in order to achieve better classification. The dataset was split into training and testing sets (\\(80\\%\\) and \\(20\\%\\), respectively). The classifier is implemented using several classifiers (SVM, SVM-Linear SVM-RBF, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ensemble AdaBoost, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. A cross comparative results for all acoustic features and top six subset are discussed for the selected classifiers, followed by fine-tuned parameters from classifiers defaults to optimize results.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Domain Adversarial Cross-Domain Recommendation (DACDR), to learn the implicit transitive semantic features among various information relevant domains. The framework automatically retrieves semantic features from both the source and the target domains, and adaptively learns the transitive latent factors to connect the two domains.

One of the most popular methods for process monitoring is the Hotelling's T 2 distance but a large amount of data makes the process monitoring a dicult task. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for the data reduction which means the extraction of few numbers representing the most variance of the analyzed data.

Independent component analysis (ICA) has been used in no-normal mul- tivariate processes. In this paper a monitoring and fault diagnosis system for complex multivariate processes is presented.

The study area is the Duursche Waarden floodplain in the Netherlands. The airborne LiDAR dataset was acquired by the FLI-MAP 400 system during the leaf-off season with point density between 50 and 100 points per m2 . The LiDAR data was used to generate several statistical features from the height and intensity data and so-called multispectral images from the spectral data. The methodology is divided into three main parts; 1) data pre-processing and derivation of several features from airborne LiDAR data for landcover classification, 2) landcover classification, and 3) evaluation of results. In the first part, the ground points are extracted from the LiDAR data to generate the DTM of the study area. The elevation value of each laser return is then normalized to the DTM by subtracting the DTM from the elevation value. After that, all the components of the dataset (height, Intensity, Red, Green, and Blue) are converted to a raster form at the same spatial resolution. In this step, several features are created for height, intensity, Red, Green, and Blue. The landcover classification process is divided into two major parts which deal with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. Each classifier is used on three different datasets: 1) FLI-MAP 400-generated multispectral images, 2) LiDAR-derived features, and 3) a combination of the multispectral images and the LiDARderived features. The results show that the SVM method produces better classification results than the ML method. In addition, the landcover classification based on the combination of LiDAR-derived features and multispectral images produces better results than classification based on either dataset only. By employing all the input features, good classification accuracy can be achieved even with a relatively low polynomial order of SVM. Generally, both classification methods agree that the LiDAR-derived features require the multispectral images to improve the classification results, especially for grassland, tilled land, and paved road. The landcover classification using only the LiDAR-derived data tends to produce lower overall classification accuracy than the classification based on just the multispectral images.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "977465792", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126599225"}

However, the intrusions are largely fewer than normal connections, which limits the capability of these methods. Anomaly detection methods such as Isolation Forest can handle the imbalanced data. Nevertheless, when the features of data increase, these methods lack enough ability to learn the distribution. Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been proposed to solve the above issues. With its strong generative ability, it only needs to learn the distribution of normal status, and identify the abnormal status when intrusion occurs. But existing models are not suitable to process discrete values, leading to immense degradation of detection performance.

In particular for lung cancer, it is not well understood which types of techniques would yield more predictive information, and which data attributes should be used in order to determine this information. In this study, a number of supervised learning techniques is applied to the SEER database to classify lung cancer patients in terms of survival, including linear regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and a custom ensemble. Key data attributes in applying these methods include tumor grade, tumor size, gender, age, stage, and number of primaries, with the goal to enable comparison of predictive power between the various methods The prediction is treated like a continuous target, rather than a classification into categories, as a first step towards improving survival prediction. The results show that the predicted values agree with actual values for low to moderate survival times, which constitute the majority of the data. The best performing technique was the custom ensemble with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 15.05. The most influential model within the custom ensemble was GBM, while Decision Trees may be inapplicable as it had too few discrete outputs. The results further show that among the five individual models generated, the most accurate was GBM with an RMSE value of 15.32. Although SVM underperformed with an RMSE value of 15.82, statistical analysis singles the SVM as the only model that generated a distinctive output. The results of the models are consistent with a classical Cox proportional hazards model used as a reference technique.

Here we address the underlying evolutionary mechanisms of opportunistic pathogenicity by combining pangenome-wide association studies and laboratory microbiology to compare S. epidermidis from bloodstream and wound infections and asymptomatic carriage. We identify 61 genes containing infection-associated genetic elements (k-mers) that correlate with in vitro variation in known pathogenicity traits (biofilm formation, cell toxicity, interleukin-8 production, methicillin resistance). Horizontal gene transfer spreads these elements, allowing divergent clones to cause infection. Finally, Random Forest model prediction of disease status (carriage vs. infection) identifies pathogenicity elements in 415 S. epidermidis isolates with 80% accuracy, demonstrating the potential for identifying risk genotypes pre-operatively.Staphylococcus epidermidis is carried asymptomatically by virtually all humans but is also a major cause of nosocomial infection.

In mobile network environments, the abnormal QoS data are likely to result in inferior prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, these problems have not attracted enough attention, especially in a mixed mobile network environment with different network configurations, generations, or types. An ensemble learning method for predicting missing QoS in 5G network environments is proposed in this paper.

For example, there are several viable but highly varied strategies for using time series of Landsat imagery to detect changes in forest cover. Performance among algorithms varies across complex natural systems, and it is reasonable to ask if aggregating the strengths of an ensemble of classifiers might result in increased overall accuracy. Relatively simple rules have been used in the past to aggregate classifications among remotely sensed maps (e.g. using majority predictions), and in other fields, empirical models have been used to create situationally specific algorithm weights. The latter process, called \u201cstacked generalization\u201d (or \u201cstacking\u201d), typically uses a parametric model for the fusion of algorithm outputs. We tested the performance of several leading forest disturbance detection algorithms against ensembles of the outputs of those same algorithms based upon stacking using both parametric and Random Forests-based fusion rules. Stacking using a Random Forests model cut omission and commission error rates in half in many cases in relation to individual change detection algorithms, and cut error rates by one quarter compared to more conventional parametric stacking. Stacking also offers two auxiliary benefits: alignment of outputs to the precise definitions built into a particular set of empirical calibration data; and, outputs which may be adjusted such that map class totals match independent estimates of change in each year. In general, ensemble predictions improve when new inputs are added that are both informative and uncorrelated with existing ensemble components. As increased use of cloud-based computing makes ensemble mapping methods more accessible, the most useful new algorithms may be those that specialize in providing spectral, temporal, or thematic information not already available through members of existing ensembles.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.09.029", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2758210752", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215260710", "208224571", "209187423", "52977759", "59316731", "51685894", "53523543", "133861551", "159078413", "199109747", "195657154", "134722096", "207949465", "211016993", "204887306", "92740461", "214618573", "73533634", "51965636", "4824456", "173189014", "145994590"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67363387"}

By iteratively training and then removing easy examples from training data, we evolve the random forest to focus on hard examples dynamically so as to learn decision boundaries better. Data can be cascaded through these random forests learned in each iteration in sequence to generate predictions, thus making RF deep. We also propose to use evolution mechanism and smart iteration mechanism to improve the performance of the model.

Two approaches were tested and compared : i) a classical remote sensing method (RS) using image object-based analysis, expert rules and supervised classification, and ii) a data mining (DM) approach consisting of the extraction of frequent patterns from the database and the use of these patterns in different algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine) to build classification rules. Both methods used SPOT images and a ground data set of 324 GPS waypoints collected during the 2012-2013 cropping season. The remote sensing and data mining approaches showed equivalent overall accuracies (82% vs 84% for RS and DM methods respectively). However, the DM approach showed its ability to handle a large volume of data and to do so in a time manner. This approach has also the advantage to extract all the information at its disposal, even temporal behaviors, unlike the object-based RS approach which requires significant participation of the expert. Data mining tools are thus recommended for their considerable potential for the classification without a priori of remotely sensed data, mixing multisource information and consequent time series, especially for the upcoming Sentinel-2 images that are expected to generate a large volume of data to store and process.

Seed points on the original test image were automatically selected and further used in the random walk (RW) algorithm to achieve comparable results to previous segmentation methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5112808", "pubmed_id": "27846217", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0164098", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2552368010", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25329158", "20693131", "122550329", "111243669", "22992682", "15059205", "16635890", "12183868", "122952704", "9349325", "57656384", "9203273", "206590483", "206786900", "13719636", "42281583", "11554984", "206590483", "5763461", "6644398", "28637672", "14723701", "489789", "6203338", "54432685", "10435139"], "inbound_citations": ["125742927", "204030573", "202774972", "204833519", "4847037", "54448676", "3075136", "4945057", "58004589"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5713050"}

However, manual counting of these images is both tiring and unreliable and ultimately very time-consuming for biomedical researchers. Not only does this slow down the overall research process, it also introduces counting errors due to a lack of objectivity and consistency inherent to the researchers own human nature. ::: This thesis addresses this issue by automatically determining infection indexes of macrophages parasite by Leishmania in microscopy images using computer vision and pattern recognition methodologies. Initially images are submitted to a pre-processing stage that consists in a normalization of illumination conditions. Three algorithms are then applied in parallel to each image. Algorithm A intends to detect macrophage nuclei and consists of segmentation via adaptive multi-threshold, and classification of resulting regions using a set of collected features. Algorithm B intends to detect parasites and is similar to Algorithm A but the adaptive multi-threshold is parameterized with a different constraints vector. Algorithm C intends to detect the macrophages and parasites cytoplasm and consists of a cut-off version of the previous two algorithms, where the classification step is skipped. Regions with multiple nuclei or parasites are processed by a voting system that employs both a Support Vector Machine and a set of region features for determining the number of objects present in each region. The previous vote is then taken into account as the number of mixtures to be used in a Gaussian Mixture Model to decluster the said region. Finally each parasite is assigned to, at most, a single macrophage using minimum Euclidean distance to a cell nucleus, thus quantifying Leishmania infection levels.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": "1311.2621", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "1511783652", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14050206", "35660466"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9775962"}

This paper suggests a novel method based on tracking the connectivity of suspicious ASes, which are received from a program tracing IP prefix hijacking signature. The paper uses Full Cross-Validation test to investigate the accuracy of the invented method and studies the similarity and differences between malicious and benign observations before they are classified. Classification might not be the appropriate technique to deal with IP prefix hijack detection on its own; therefore we propose to combine the two methods (signature and classification-based) in order to cover the limitations of both techniques. From a processing perspective, the outputs from signature-based method are used as inputs for the classification-based. The main features are extracted from the ASpath attributes of potentially suspicious ASes. The features are considered a mixture of the behavioural characteristics of connectivity among routers.

The deterministic and stochastic finite element (FE) model is used to develop the approximate relationship between input and output parameters with a high level of accuracy. Based on the simulated data from an FE model, a meta-model is constructed by a built Particle Swarm Optimization-Least Square Support Vector Machine (PSO-LSSVM) model. In this research, 10,000 groups of data are generated by the built PSO-LSSVM model, which provides data support for the global sensitivity analysis through Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST). The input variables with a high global sensitivity are identified as crucial variables which should be well controlled and managed during tunnel operation. A Hankou-Fanhu (H-F) tunnel section in the Wuhan metro system is utilized as a case study to verify the applicability of the proposed approach. Global sensitivity analysis enables the reduction of the epistemic uncertainty in tunnel structural safety management, providing insight into a better understanding of (1) the input-output causal relationships of the structural safety risk in operational tunnels, (2) the reduction of the epistemic uncertainty in project safety management of operational tunnels.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.autcon.2018.06.008", "venue": null, "journal": "Automation in Construction", "mag_id": "2810067445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52972474", "208345902", "56297591"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115195117"}

Early diagnosis gives patients with diabetes the opportunity to improve their dietary habits and lifestyle and manage the disease successfully. Several studies have explored the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict and diagnose this disease. In this study, we conducted experiments to predict diabetes in Pima Indian females with particular ML classifiers. (2) Method: A Pima Indian diabetes dataset (PIDD) with 768 female patients was considered for this study. Different data mining operations were performed to a conduct comparative analysis of four different ML classifiers: Naive Bayes (NB), J48, Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). These models were analyzed by different cross-validation (K = 5, 10, 15, and 20) values, and the performance measurements of accuracy, precision, F-score, recall, and AUC were calculated for each model. (3) Results: LR was found to have the highest accuracy (0.77) for all \u2018k\u2019 values. When k = 5, the accuracy of J48, NB, and RF was found to be 0.71, 0.76, and 0.75.

An efficient trie-lexicon directed, breadth-first beam search algorithm is employed in a combined segmentation-and-recognition framework to accomplish real-time recognition of online handwritten cursive English words. This framework is developed by building a candidate lattice of primitive segments obtained through over segmentation of the word pattern.

This study attempts to reconcile two different methodological and theoretical approaches (proposed by Lambon Ralph & Ehsan, 2006 and Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002) to age-limited learning effects. The current simulations extend the findings reported by Zevin and Seidenberg (2002) that have shown that frequency trajectories (FTs) have limited and specific effects on word-reading tasks. Using the methodological framework proposed by Lambon Ralph and Ehsan (2006), which makes it possible to compare word-reading and picture-naming tasks in connectionist networks, we were able to show that FT has a considerable influence on age-limited learning effects in a picture naming task. The findings show that when the input\u2013output mappings are arbitrary (simulating picture naming tasks), the links formed by the network become entrenched as a result of early experience and that subsequent variations in frequency of exposure of the items have only a minor impact. In contrast, when the mappings between input-output are quasi-systematic or systematic (simulating word-reading tasks), the training of new items was generalized and resulted in the suppression of age-limited learning effects. At a theoretical level, we suggest that FT, which simultaneously takes account of time and the level of exposure across time, represents a more precise and modulated measure compared with the order of introduction of the items and may lead to innovative hypotheses in the field of age-limited learning effects.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22985438", "doi": "10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01266.x", "venue": "Cognitive science", "journal": "Cognitive science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2096040077", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["144939791", "14609254", "42616184", "11374819", "143627795", "39271585", "44774390", "6667873", "2691726", "59727383", "202927997", "146129046", "144486939", "11754544", "53633875", "152230066", "2832081", "9663146", "4127569", "197659265", "14470408", "145631393", "557347", "30165868", "15210789", "27685391", "8236527", "59786205", "8030958", "14426294", "17399765"], "inbound_citations": ["51749109", "4834687", "37265324", "13880677", "28511339", "34255870", "37746514", "8262392", "14331", "17914908", "31349070"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18877407"}

The SISR task has been a very attractive research topic over the last two decades. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have achieved great performance on SISR task. Despite the breakthroughs achieved by using CNN models, there are still some problems remaining unsolved, such as how to recover high frequency details of high resolution images. Previous CNN based models always use a pixel wise loss, such as l2 loss. Although the high resolution images constructed by these models have high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), they often tend to be blurry and lack high-frequency details, especially at a large scaling factor. In this paper, we build a super resolution perceptual generative adversarial network (SRPGAN) framework for SISR tasks. In the framework, we propose a robust perceptual loss based on the discriminator of the built SRPGAN model. We use the Charbonnier loss function to build the content loss and combine it with the proposed perceptual loss and the adversarial loss. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our method has demonstrated great ability to construct images with sharp edges and rich details.

In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in many visual recognition problems. Currently, there are a few CNN-based approaches on ethnicity classification [1], [2]. However, the approaches suffer from the following limitations: (i) most face datasets do not include ethnicity information, and those with ethnicity information are typically small to medium in size, thereby they do not provide sufficient samples for training of CNNs from the scratch, and (ii) the CNN methods often treat ethnicity classification as a multi-class classification where the likelihood of each class label is generated. However, it does not utilize the intermediate activation functions of CNNs which provide rich hierarchical features to assist in ethnicity classification. In view of this, this paper proposes a new hybrid supervised learning method to perform ethnicity classification that uses both the strength of CNN as well as the rich features obtained from the network.

For example, we do not use any ground truth 3D or 2D annotations, stereo video, and ego-motion during the training. Our approach follows the general strategy of Generative Adversarial Networks, where an image generator network learns to create image samples that are realistic enough to fool a discriminator network into believing that they are natural images. In contrast, in our approach the image generation is split into 2 stages. In the first stage a generator network outputs 3D objects. In the second, a differentiable renderer produces an image of the 3D objects from random viewpoints. The key observation is that a realistic 3D object should yield a realistic rendering from any plausible viewpoint. Thus, by randomizing the choice of the viewpoint our proposed training forces the generator network to learn an interpretable 3D representation disentangled from the viewpoint. In this work, a 3D representation consists of a triangle mesh and a texture map that is used to color the triangle surface by using the UV-mapping technique. We provide analysis of our learning approach, expose its ambiguities and show how to overcome them.

This embedding generates a multi-channel output image by superimposing an original input image on its segmentation map. Then, the method learns to translate the input image to this embedded output image using a conditional generative adversarial network, which is known to be quite effective for image-to-image translations. This proposal is different than the existing approach that uses image reconstruction for the same regularization purpose. The existing approach considers segmentation and image reconstruction as two separate tasks in a multi-task network, defines their losses independently, and then combines these losses in a joint loss function. However, the definition of such a function requires externally determining the right contribution amounts of the supervised and unsupervised losses that yield balanced learning between the segmentation and image reconstruction tasks.

The basic purpose of 3-D surface reconstruction is to analyze the brain images precisely in order to effectively diagnose and examine the diseases for surgical planning and tumor localization. Reconstruction of tumor images is the goal in dealing with these images. In this paper, a brief overview is given on the advantages and disadvantages of existing surface reconstruction methods in clinical applications. The traditional cube based algorithms extracts the surface by forming imaginary cube and then determines the polygons needed to represent the part of the isosurface that passes through this cube. But, it requires post processing and needs more Computational time for reconstruction. Also they cannot provide the proof of correctness. The vector machine based algorithms like Immune Sphere Shaped Support Vector Machine (ISSSVM) transforms the highly irregular object into the high dimensional feature space and construct the hyper-sphere as compact as possible which encloses almost all the target object.

Indeed, it has been shown that service designers and developers tend to pay little attention to their service interfaces design.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named WS3D, using machine learning techniques that combines Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Simulated Annealing (SA) to learn from real world examples of service design defects. WS3D has been empirically evaluated on a benchmark of Web services from 14 different application domains. We compared WS3D with the state-of-theart approaches which rely on traditional declarative techniques to detect service design defects by combining metrics and threshold values.

With the current smart systems composed of a great number of cognitive entities, amorphous computing offers useful tools and languages to emerge a coherent behavior relying on local communications and limited capabilities. In order to emphasize its capabilities, the problem of clustering microarray data has been solved within this new computing paradigm. Moreover, it is difficult and time consuming to deal with a large amount of noisy gene expression data. The core motivations of amorphous computing come from self-assembly property to emerge clusters of complex gene expressions. In particular, the process of clustering was applied with respect to the Growing Neural Gas algorithm (GNG), which is an incremental learning method and a visual technique. Although the GNG draws important features from the Self-Organizing map (SOM), it yields accurate results when no information about the initial distribution is available. This contribution considers a huge number of amorphous computing entities placed irregularly, each with a randomly selected reference vector. Using the GNG, the visualization of clusters of gene expressions is obtained by amorphous computing particles. The results obtained using the Netlogo platform are very encouraging and argue that self-organization by means of local interactions and irregularly placed particles will be qualified with performance in a real amorphous computing system.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11779568_87", "venue": "IEA/AIE", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1593633882", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37966492"}

These states are also identified as causal factors of critical situations that can lead to road accidents and vehicle crashes. These driver impairments need to be detected and predicted in order to reduce critical situations and road accidents. In the past years, physiological signals have become conven- tional measures in driver impairment research. Physiological signals have been applied in various studies to identify different levels of mental load, sleepiness, and stress during driving.This licentiate thesis work has investigated several artificial intelligence algorithms for developing an intelligent system to monitor driver mental state using physiological signals. The research aims to measure sleepiness and mental load using Electroencephalography (EEG). EEG signals, if pro- cessed correctly and efficiently, have potential to facilitate advanced moni- toring of sleepiness, mental load, fatigue, stress etc. However, EEG signals can be contaminated with unwanted signals, i.e., artifacts. These artifacts can lead to serious misinterpretation. Therefore, this work investigates EEG arti- fact handling methods and propose an automated approach for EEG artifact handling. Furthermore, this research has also investigated how several other physiological parameters (Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from the Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiration Rate, Finger Tem- perature (FT), and Skin Conductance (SC)) to quantify drivers\u2019 stress. Dif- ferent signal processing methods have been investigated to extract features from these physiological signals.

Its performance is influenced by noise, database size, and feature representation. This ::: thesis focusses on mitigating these challenges by efficiently characterising iris texture,developing multi-unit iris recognition, reducing the search space of large iris databases, and investigating if iris pattern change over time.To suitably characterise texture features of iris, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is combined with Fourier transform to develop a keypoint descriptor-F-SIFT. Proposed F-SIFT is invariant to transformation, illumination, and occlusion along with strong texture description property. For pairing the keypoints from gallery and probe iris images, Phase-Only Correlation (POC) function is used. The use of phase ::: information reduces the wrong matches generated using SIFT. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of F-SIFT over existing keypoint descriptors.To perform the multi-unit iris fusion, a novel classifier is proposed known ::: as Incremental Granular Relevance Vector Machine (iGRVM) that incorporates incremental and granular learning into RVM. The proposed classifier by design is ::: scalable and unbiased which is particularly suitable for biometrics. The match scores from individual units of iris are passed as an input to the corresponding iGRVM ::: classifier, and the posterior probabilities are combined using weighted sum rule.

It is particularly useful for initialization of automatic image analysis tools (e.g. segmentation and registration) and detection of scan planes for automated image acquisition. Landmark localization has been commonly performed using learning based approaches, such as classifier and/or regressor models. However, trained models may not generalize well in heterogeneous datasets when the images contain large differences due to size, pose and shape variations of organs. To learn more data-adaptive and patient specific models, we propose a novel stratification based training model, and demonstrate its use in a decision forest. The proposed approach does not require any additional training information compared to the standard model training procedure and can be easily integrated into any decision tree framework. The proposed method is evaluated on 1080 3D high-resolution and 90 multi-stack 2D cardiac cine MR images. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art landmark localization accuracy and outperforms standard regression and classification based approaches.

In recent years, due to the rise of big data, machine learning methods have been applied to Image Identification, and the accuracy of the result has surpassed that of traditional methods. With the fully convolutional neural network proposed, image segmentation and target detection have also achieved excellent results.

In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons.

The results obtained show that the increase in cost parameter for linear kernel gives much better results whereas for Hellinger kernel the performance decreases as cost parameter is increased. In the other hand, two classes of images are taken and they are tested by increasing the number of positive images gradually and the results show that the addition of positive class of images to a database can increase the performance of the system employed. 1 INTRODUCTION he growth of the World Wide Web have led to the huge online digital images and videos, so there is a strong demand for developing an efficient technique for image retrieval to exploit maximum benefit from this huge amount of digital information. With the advancement in technology, a large amount of information in the form of images is being generated daily in various fields like architecture engineering designs biometrics satellite imagery. Also with the increasing capacity of the storage devices, the database of the image information is expanding allowing a huge amount of database images to be stored quite easily. Even though storing these images is now easier, accessing or retrieving these images as per the requirement is a tedious job. Image retrieval has been an active topic for research for the past three decades. The goal of an image retrieval system is to retrieve a set of images from a collection of images such that this set meets the user\"s requirements. The user\"s requirements can be specified in terms of similarity to some other image or a sketch, or in terms of keywords. An image retrieval system provides the user with a way to access, browse and retrieve efficiently and possibly in real time, from these databases. Well-developed and popular international standards, on image coding have also long been available and widely used in many applications. The challenge to image indexing is studied in the context of image database, which has also been researched by researchers from a wide range of disciplines including those from computer vision, image processing, and traditional database areas for over a decade. This paper analyses the most important parameter i.e. the cost parameter of the support vector machine for various classes of images. The cost parameter is significant in a SVM classifier and has to be studied very carefully to train and test the dataset and obtain satisfactory results.

MALP is a branch of segmentation approaches with attractive properties, which is currently applicable only in correspondence-based regimes such as brain labeling, which assume correspondence between atlases and test image. This precludes its use for the large class of tasks without this property, such as tumor segmentation. In this work, we propose a method which circumvents the correspondence assumption by using a classifier-based atlas representation in the spirit of the recently proposed Atlas Forests (AF). To counteract the negative effects of the over-training property of AF for applications with highly heterogeneous examples, we employ test-specific atlas weighting by the STAPLE approach. The main idea is that over-training ceases to be a problem if the prediction is based only on training atlases which are \u201csimilar\u201d to the test image. Here, the \u201csimilarity\u201d is based on the estimated ability of an atlas-based classifier to perform a correct labeling.

Based on these features, Wii realizes stranger recognition through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and identity identification through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. It is implemented using commercial WiFi devices and evaluated on a dataset with more than 1500 gait instances collected from eight subjects walking in a room.

To solve this problem a novel fall detection algorithm based on pattern recognition and human posture analysis is presented in this paper.

Dental radiographs are often the only means of identifying victims, but manually comparing dental radiographs is inefficient and subject to errors due to fatigue in human experts. This thesis has designed and developed an automatic system for identifying human victims based on dental radiographs. There are three stages in the proposed automatic dental identification system: (1) Feature extraction. Salient features in the dental radiograph are identified, such as the contours of the tooth and the contours of crowns or fillings. (2) Registration. Each tooth is labeled according to its location within the mouth, and missing teeth are detected. (3) Matching. Each unidentified radiograph (post-mortem or PM) is compared to a database of known individuals (ante-mortem or AM). ::: In the first stage, namely feature extraction, contours of teeth and dental work are extracted from dental radiographs. The radiographs are first segmented into regions such that each region contains only a single tooth. Contours of individual teeth are then extracted from each region of the radiograph using active shape models (ASMs). Dental work such as crowns, fillings, and root canal treatment is composed of radio-opaque material that appears as bright regions in the radiographs. An anisotropic diffusion-based technique is used to enhance the images, and regions of dental work are segmented using image thresholding. ::: The second step in dental radiograph-based identification is to determine which teeth are (or are not) present in the radiograph. This step is important because the matching algorithm cannot properly align AM and PM radiographs if they do not contain the same number of teeth. Thus, the second step is to label each tooth in the radiograph based on the human dental atlas, which is a descriptive model of the shapes and relative positions of teeth. A hybrid model involving Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is developed for representing the dental atlas and classifying individual teeth in dental radiograph images. ::: The final stage of the proposed automatic identification system is to match dental radiographs of unidentified subjects against dental radiographs of known subjects in the database. The extracted tooth contours are matched for every pair of teeth with the same index in the two radiographs. When both teeth in the pair to be matched contain dental work, then the shapes of dental work are also matched. An overall matching distance for each pair of teeth is computed by combining the matching distances for the tooth contours and for the dental work. Finally, the distances between the unidentified subject and all the subjects in the database are computed based on the distances between all pairs of teeth. The database subjects are then sorted in ascending order of the matching distances and the results are provided to forensic experts. ::: Due to poor quality of dental radiographs and complexity of the matching problem, fully automatic methods may sometimes produce errors. Monitoring schemes are designed to evaluate the image quality and correctness of the automatic results at each processing stage. User interaction is requested when errors in intermediate processing steps are encountered. ::: Experiments on retrieving PM radiographs of 29 subjects from a database of radiographs of 33 subjects show an accuracy of 72% for top-1 retrieval and 93% for top-2 retrievals. Experiments on retrieving PM radiographs of 29 subjects from a larger database of relatively poor quality radiographs of 133 subjects show a lower accuracy of 66% for top-1 retrieval and 90% for top-13 retrievals.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2189432322", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21658359", "16093864", "27992159", "13170817", "33360256", "209897931", "8709399", "30370835", "7277824"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110867096"}

This promotes the creation of pervasive environments improving the quality of life of the occupants and enhancing the human experience. ::: AmI stems from the convergence of three key technologies: ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous communication and natural interfaces. ::: Ambient intelligent systems are heterogeneous and require an excellent cooperation between several hardware/software technologies and disciplines, including signal processing, networking and protocols, embedded systems, information ::: management, and distributed algorithms. ::: Since a large amount of fixed and mobile sensors embedded is deployed into the environment, the Wireless Sensor Networks is one of the most relevant enabling technologies for AmI. WSN are complex systems made up of a number of sensor nodes which can be deployed in a target area to sense physical phenomena and communicate with other nodes and base stations. These simple devices typically embed a low power computational unit (microcontrollers, FPGAs etc.), a wireless communication unit, one or more sensors and a some form of energy supply (either batteries or energy scavenger modules). ::: WNS promises of revolutionizing the interactions between the real physical worlds and human beings. Low-cost, low-computational power, low energy consumption and small size are characteristics that must be taken into consideration when designing and dealing with WSNs. ::: To fully exploit the potential of distributed sensing approaches, a set of challengesmust be addressed. Sensor nodes are inherently resource-constrained systems with very low power consumption and small size requirements which ::: enables than to reduce the interference on the physical phenomena sensed and to allow easy and low-cost deployment.

This topic holds strong interest for a wide range of contexts such as military, security, robotics and most recently consumer applications.

In real-time, these approaches are a recently opened field of research. ::: In this thesis we pay attention to the realities of hardware/software technologies and the design needed to realize systems for distributed monitoring, attempting to propose solutions on open issues and filling the gap between ::: AmI scenarios and hardware reality. The physical implementation of an individual wireless node is constrained by three important metrics which are outlined below. ::: Despite that the design of the sensor network and its sensor nodes is strictly application dependent, a number of constraints should almost always be considered. Among them: ::: \u2022 Small form factor to reduce nodes intrusiveness. ::: \u2022 Low power consumption to reduce battery size and to extend nodes lifetime. ::: \u2022 Low cost for a widespread diffusion. ::: These limitations typically result in the adoption of low power, low cost devices such as low powermicrocontrollers with few kilobytes of RAMand tenth of kilobytes of program memory with whomonly simple data processing algorithms can be implemented. However the overall computational power of the WNS can be very large since the network presents a high degree of parallelism that can be exploited through the adoption of ad-hoc techniques. Furthermore through the fusion of information from the dense mesh of sensors even complex phenomena can be monitored. ::: In this dissertation we present our results in building several AmI applications suitable for a WSN implementation. The work can be divided into two main areas:Low Power Video Sensor Node and Video Processing Alghoritm and Multimodal ::: Surveillance . ::: Low Power Video Sensor Nodes and Video Processing Alghoritms ::: In comparison to scalar sensors, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, velocity, and acceleration sensors, vision sensors generate much higher bandwidth data due to the two-dimensional nature of their pixel array. ::: We have tackled all the constraints listed above and have proposed solutions to overcome the current WSNlimits for Video sensor node.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of LiDAR point clouds to produce indicators of riparian zone status. We used 3D bispectral LiDAR data to produce several indicators of a riparian zone of a dammed river in Normandy (France). The indicators were produced either directly from the 3D point clouds (e.g., biomass overhanging the channel, variation in canopy height) or indirectly, by applying the Random Forest classification algorithm to the point clouds. Results highlight the potential of 3D LiDAR point clouds to produce indicators with sufficient accuracy (ca. 80% for the number of trunks and 68% for species composition).

These methods often relegate such features to raster or metric-based (two-dimensional) representations based on Digital Surface Models (DSM) or Digital Elevation Models (DEM), and thus are not suitable for resolving morphological and intensity features for fine-scale land cover mapping. Small-footprint LiDAR provides an ideal way for capturing these 3D features. This research develops a novel method of integrating airborne LiDAR derived features and multi-temporal Landsat images to classify land cover types. We tested our approach in Williamson County, Illinois, which has diverse and mixed landscape features. Specifically, our method applied a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to extract features from LiDAR point clouds by (1) creating an occupancy grid, an intensity grid at 1-meter resolution, and then (2) normalizing and incorporating data into the 3D CNN. The extracted features (e.g., morphological and intensity features) from the 3D CNN were finally combined with multi-temporal spectral data to enhance the performance of land cover classification based on a Support Vector Machine classifier. Visual interpretation from both hyper-resolution photos and point clouds was used for training and preparation of testing data. The classification results show that our method outperforms a traditional method by 2.65% (from 81.52% to 84.17%) when solely using LiDAR and 2.19% (from 90.20% to 92.57%) when combining all available imageries.

Typical learning algorithms used in training SSVMs result in model parameters which are vectors residing in a large-dimensional feature space. Such a high-dimensional model parameter vector contains many non-zero components which often lead to slow prediction and storage issues. Hence there is a need for sparse parameter vectors which contain a very small number of non-zero components. L1-regularizer and elastic net regularizer have been traditionally used to get sparse model parameters. Though L1-regularized structural SVMs have been studied in the past, the use of elastic net regularizer for structural SVMs has not been explored yet. In this work, we formulate the elastic net SSVM and propose a sequential alternating proximal algorithm to solve the dual formulation. We compare the proposed method with existing methods for L1-regularized Structural SVMs. Experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed dual elastic net SSVM trained using the sequential alternating proximal algorithm scales well and results in highly sparse model parameters while achieving a comparable generalization performance. Hence the proposed sequential alternating proximal algorithm is a competitive method to achieve sparse model parameters and a comparable generalization performance when elastic net regularized Structural SVMs are used on very large datasets.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2012.81", "venue": "2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": "2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2014395529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["124169901", "1745618", "115963355", "5885974", "1226433", "14211670", "15941927", "58153557", "17671150", "118799867", "16061388", "1463535", "1605187", "14134075"], "inbound_citations": ["2062389", "2765845", "30555303", "14749459"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15178639"}

Specifically, the work deals with a Medical Entity Recognition (MER) on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Developing a MER system entailed heavy data preprocessing and feature engineering until Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) emerged. However, the quality of the word representations in terms of embedded layers is still an important issue for the inference of the DNNs. Goal The main goal of this work is to develop a robust MER system adapting general-purpose DNNs to cope with the high lexical variability shown in EHRs. In addition, given that EHRs tend to be scarce when there are out-domain corpora available, the aim is to assess the impact of the word representations on the performance of the MER as we move to other domains. In this line, exhaustive experimentation varying information generation methods and network parameters are crucial. Methods We adapted a general purpose sequential tagger based on Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory cells and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in order to make it tolerant to high lexical variability and a limited amount of corpora. To this end, we incorporated part of speech (POS) and semantic-tag embedding layers to the word representations. Results One of the strengths of this work is the exhaustive evaluation of dense word representations obtained varying not only the domain and genre but also the learning algorithms and their parameter settings. With the proposed method, we attained an error reduction of 1.71 (5.7%) compared to the state-of-the-art even that no preprocessing or feature engineering was used. Conclusions Our results indicate that dense representations built taking word order into account leverage the entity extraction system. Besides, we found that using a medical corpus (not necessarily EHRs) to infer the representations improves the performance, even if it does not correspond to the same genre.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31445243", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.05.022", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2948105016", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4986699", "28564704", "215412300", "267898", "7856261", "12303291", "9828734", "26857244", "53212932", "11664683", "10262770", "17389993", "6042994", "16386838", "11715509", "16447573", "14700403", "10201625", "5527031", "17311194", "9564958", "116253527", "14139064", "21035582", "12006054", "1915014", "1957433", "1144632", "3932029"], "inbound_citations": ["208263649"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195434894"}

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to detect phishing attacks and to discover the entity/organization that the attackers impersonate during phishing attacks. The proposed multi-stage methodology employs natural language processing and machine learning. The methodology first discovers (i) named entities, which includes names of people, organizations, and locations; and (ii) hidden topics, using (a) Conditional Random Field (CRF) and (b) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) operating on both phishing and non-phishing data. Utilizing topics and named entities as features, the next stage classifies each message as phishing or non-phishing using AdaBoost. For messages classified as phishing, the final stage discovers the impersonated entity using CRF. Experimental results show that the phishing classifier detects phishing attacks with no misclassification when the proportion of phishing emails is less than 20%. The F-measure obtained was 100%. Our approach also discovers the impersonated entity from messages that are classified as phishing, with a discovery rate of 88.1%. The automatic discovery of impersonated entity from phishing helps the legitimate organization to take down the offending phishing site.

Feature Extraction for the imaging of the head was extracted using sub-region and Haar wavelet transform. Sub-region represents the local characteristics of the head, Haar wavelet transform can indicate the frequency characteristics of face. Therefore, if we use them to extract the features of face, effective modeling is possible. In the proposed method to track down the man's head from the input video in real time, we ues the results after learning Harr-wavelet characteristics of the three types using AdaBoosting algorithm. Originally the AdaBoosting algorithm, there is a very long learning time, if learning data was changes, and then it is need to be performed learning again. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this research propose efficient method using cascade AdaBoosting. This method reduces the learning time for the imaging of the head, and can respond effectively to changes in the learning data.

However, the decentralized architecture of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for network intrusion detection and prevention. In the past, ZigBee device authentication reliability was enhanced by Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting using a Fisher-based Multiple Discriminant Analysis and Maximum Likelihood (MDA-ML) classification process to distinguish between devices in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. However, MDA-ML performance inherently degrades when RF-DNA features do not satisfy Gaussian normality conditions, which often occurs in real-world scenarios where radio frequency (RF) multipath and interference from other devices is present. We introduce non-parametric Random Forest (RndF) and Multi-Class AdaBoost (MCA) ensemble classifiers into the RF-DNA fingerprinting arena, and demonstrate improved ZigBee device authentication. Results are compared with parametric MDA-ML and Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) classifier results using identical input feature sets. Fingerprint dimensional reduction is examined using three methods, namely a pre-classification Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Test (KS-Test), a post-classification RndF feature relevance ranking, and a GRLVQI feature relevance ranking. Using the ensemble methods, an ${\\rm SNR}=18.0$ dB improvement over MDA-ML processing is realized at an arbitrary correct classification rate $(\\hbox{\\%}C)$ benchmark of $\\hbox{\\%}C=90\\hbox{\\%}$ ; for all ${\\rm SNR}\\in [0, 30]$ dB considered, $\\hbox{\\%}C$ improvement over MDA-ML ranged from 9% to 24%. Relative to GRLVQI processing, ensemble methods again provided improvement for all SNR, with a best improvement of $\\hbox{\\%}C=10\\hbox{\\%}$ achieved at the lowest tested ${\\rm SNR}=0.0$ dB. Network penetration, measured using rogue ZigBee devices, show that at the ${\\rm SNR}=12.0$ dB $(\\hbox{\\%}C=90\\hbox{\\%})$ the ensemble methods correctly reject 31 of 36 rogue access attempts based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and an arbitrary Rogue Accept Rate of ${\\rm RAR} .

The classifier can be constructed by using this working set. In general, the number of the elements in the working set is much smaller than that in the training set. Therefore the proposed algorithm can be used not only to train the data sets quickly but also to test them effectively with losing little accuracy.

The study of plants is also essential for environmental protection and helping farmers increase the production of food. As a fundamental task in botanical study, plant leaf recognition has been a hot research topic in these years. In this paper, we propose a new method based on contourlet transform and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for leaf recognition. Contourlet Transform is a promising multi-resolution analysis technique, which provides image with a flexible anisotropy and directional expansion. By basing its constructive principle on a non-subsampled pyramid structure and related directional filter banks, contourlet transform decomposes input images into multi-scale factors which also enjoys additional advantages such as shift invariance and computational efficiency. Compared with one-dimensional transforms, such as the Fourier and wavelet transforms, Contourlet Transform can capture the intrinsic geometrical structure. In order to ameliorate the influence of unwanted artefacts such as illumination and translation variations, in this paper, the contourlet transform was firstly applied to extract feature with high discriminative power. Then the extracted features are classified by SVM. The experimental results show that the proposed method has high sensitivity of directionality and can better capture the rich features of natural images such as edges, curves and contours.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-22186-1_14", "venue": "ICIC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1930637499", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["44061773"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33001404"}

This paper describes use of a cascade of machine learners to automatically extract mentions of named entities about disorders from clinical notes. Tasks: A Conditional Random Field (CRF) machine learner has been used for named entity recognition and to capture more complex (multiple word) named entities we have used Support Vector Machines (SVM). Firstly, the training data was converted to the CRF format. Different feature sets were ap- plied using 10-fold cross validation to find the best feature set for the machine learning model. Secondly, the identified named entities were passed to the SVM to find any relation among the identified disorder mentions to decide whether they are a part of a complex disorder. Approach: Our approach was based on a novel supervised learning model which incorporates two machine learning algorithms (CRF and SVM). Evalua- tion of each step included precision, recall and F-score metrics.

In this work, boar spermatozoa present in gray scale images acquired with a phase-contrast microscope have been classified as acrosome-intact or acrosome-damaged, after using fluorescent images for creating the ground truth. Based on shape prior criteria combined with Otsu's thresholding, regional minima and watershed transform, the spermatozoa heads were segmented and registered. One of the main novelties of this proposal is that, unlike what previous works stated, the obtained results show that the contour information of the spermatozoon head is important for improving description and classification. Other of this work novelties is that it confirms that combining different texture descriptors and contour descriptors yield the best classification rates for this problem up to date. The classification was performed with a Support Vector Machine backed by a Least Squares training algorithm and a linear kernel.

Some existing approaches focus on minimizing the pixel-wise reconstruction error which results in a high peak signal-to-noise ratio. The enhanced images fail to provide high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying, i.e., they fail to match the quality expected in a photo-realistic image. In this paper, we present Image Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network (IEGAN), a versatile framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for both artifact removal and super-resolution simultaneously. Moreover, we propose a new loss function consisting of a combination of reconstruction loss, feature loss and an edge loss counterpart. The feature loss helps to push the output image to the natural image manifold and the edge loss preserves the sharpness of the output image. The reconstruction loss provides low-level semantic information to the generator regarding the quality of the generated images compared to the original.

This paper proposed a heterogeneous defect prediction method considering class extreme imbalance problem in real software datasets. In the first stage, Sampling with the Majority method (SWIM) based on Mahalanobis Distance is used to balance the dataset to reduce the influence of minority samples in defect data. Due to the negative impact of uncorrelated features on the classification algorithm, the second stage uses ensemble learning and joint similarity measurement to select the most relevant and representative features between the source project and the target project. The third phase realizes the transfer learning from the source project to the target project in the Grassmann manifold space.

Lebanon, a part of Middle East, is losing its green forests dramatically mainly due to severe fires. This dissertation studies the phenomenon of forest fires. It proposes new models and methodologies to tackle the crisis of forest fires particularly in Lebanon and Mediterranean. It is divided into two main parts: New Approaches in Forest Fire Prediction and Forest Fire modeling. The first part is sub-divided into 3 chapters. First chapter presents an analytical study of the most widely used metrological models that can predict forest fires. In the second chapter we apply five data mining techniques methods: Neural Networks, Decision Tree, Fuzzy Logic, Linear Discriminate Analysis and Support Vector Machine. We aim to find the most accurate technique in forecasting forest fires. In the third chapter, we use different correlative data analysis techniques (Regression, Pearson, Spearman and Kendall-tau) to evaluate the correlation between fire occurrence and meteorological data (Temperature, Dew point, Soil temperature, Humidity, Precipitation and Wind speed). This allows to find the most influential parameters that affect the occurrence of fire, which lead us to develop a new Lebanese fire danger Index (LI). The proposed index is then validated using meteorological data for the years 2015-2016. The second part is sub-divided into 3 chapters. The first chapter reviews the fire behavior characteristics and its morphology; and focuses on the validity of mathematical and computer fire behavior models. The second chapter manifests the importance of cellular automata, explains the main types of cellular automata and reviews some applications in various domains. In the third chapter, we use cellular automata to develop a new behavior model for predicting the spread of fire, on elliptical basis, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes .The proposed methodology incorporates the parameters of wind speed, fuel and topography. The developed model is then used to simulate the wildfire that swept through the forest of Aandqet village, North Lebanon. Obtained simulation results are compared with reported results of the real incident and with simulations done on Karafyllidis model and Gazmeh-Modified Karafyllidis model.

It is therefore complex to isolate the effect of these actions in this multifocal context. To address this problem we chose to specifically identify the effect of hamstrings lengthening (HL) in CP children with crouch gait. The aims of this study were to describe the specific parameters influenced by HL and to classify the positive or not-positive effect of HL in SEMLS. Patients/materials andmethods: 42 CP children (12\u00b13 years) were divided into two groups: 31 (G1=60 lower limbs (LL)) and 11 (G2=20 LL), respectively having followed and not-followed HL among all the associated surgeries. All patients had clinical gait analysis before and 1.9\u00b10.8 years after surgery. The GDI is calculated [1]. All kinematic data (angles, velocities) were doublenormalized and conditioned in two vectors. A homogeneity test (G1 vs G2) selected the kinematic parameters influenced by HL (t-test, p<0.005). Principal component analysis identified theminimumdescriptors characterizing the effect of HL. Several classifiers (Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA) and linear or nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVM)) were supervised by 6 experts\u2019 opinions. Experts\u2019 opinions were based on video and kinematic curves comparison between pre and post-surgery conditions. The classifiers performances in learning, validation (leave one out) and generalization were compared. Results: GDI results showed that 83% of the subjects of G1 were globally improved by SEMLS. Among all the kinematic data, 16 sub-vectors, significantly influenced by HL were selected. Their dimensionality was reduced by principal component analysis. The 6 experts have classified the effect of HL for 37 LL: 24 were positive and 13 not-positive. The classification method with the best performance was the linear SVMwith error rate 0% in learning, 5.4% in validation and 6.5% in generalization. In view of the classification system 1/3 of G1 LL were not improved by HL. Discussion and conclusions: This supervised classification and data conditioning techniques are able to categorize the specific effect of HL among all the associated performed procedures in two classes \u201cpositive effect\u201d and \u201cnot-positive effect\u201d. While 83% of patients were improved by SEMLS, HL had positively contributed to this improvement in only 70% of these cases.

Since the compounds that are known to have some activities of a biological class of the target are rare in the drug discovery process, the accuracy of the prediction should be increased as the activity decreases or the false positive rate should be maintained in databases that have a large number of un-annotated compounds and a small number of annotated compounds of the biological activity. In this paper, we propose a new similarity scoring method composed of a combination of the Tanimoto coefficient and the proximity measure of random forest. The score contains two properties that are derived from unsupervised and supervised methods of partial dependence for compounds. Thus, the proposed method is expected to indicate compounds that have accurate activities. By evaluating the performance of the prediction compared with the two scores of the Tanimoto coefficient and the proximity measure, we demonstrate that the prediction result of the proposed scoring method is better than those of the two methods by using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method. We estimate the prediction accuracy of compound datasets extracted from MDDR using the proposed method. It is also shown that the proposed method can identify active compounds in datasets including several un-annotated compounds.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2197/ipsjdc.4.238", "venue": null, "journal": "Ipsj Digital Courier", "mag_id": "2108230655", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195703938"}

The most commonly used taxonomy to describe facial behaviors is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). FACS segments the visible effects of facial muscle activation into 30+ action units (AUs). So, we introduce a method to recognize AUs by extracting information of the expressive component through a de-expression learning procedure, called De-expression Residue Learning (DeRL). Firstly, we train a Generative Adversarial Network named cGAN to filter out the expressive information and generate the corresponding neutral face image. Then, we use the intermediate layers, which contains the action unit information, to recognition AUs. Our work alleviates problems of AUs recognition based on the pixel level difference, which is unreliable due to the variation between images i.e., rotation, translation and lighting condition changes, or the feature level difference, which is also unstable as the expression information may vary according to the identity information.

To resolve this problem, we propose a feature extraction method based on simple longest matching of Eojeol (a Korean spacing unit) and phoneme patterns. The two kinds of patterns are automatically constructed from a large amount of POS (part-of-speech) tagged corpus. Eojeol patterns consist of Eojeols including content words such as nouns and verbs. Phoneme patterns consist of leading consonant and vowel pairs of predicate words such as verbs and adjectives because spelling errors seldom occur in leading consonants and vowels.

Since even humans can be induced in error due to the complex biological processes involved, finding a robust method remains a research challenge today. In this paper, we propose a new framework for the integration of Active Appearance Models (AAM), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor wavelets (GW) and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) in order to obtain a highly discriminative feature representation which is able to model shape, appearance, wrinkles and skin spots. In addition, this paper proposes a novel flexible hierarchical age estimation approach consisting of a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify a subject into an age group followed by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) to estimate a specific age. The errors that may happen in the classification step, caused by the hard boundaries between age classes, are compensated in the specific age estimation by a flexible overlapping of the age ranges. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated on FG-NET Aging and MORPH Album 2 datasets and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.50 and 5.86 years was achieved respectively. The robustness of the proposed approach was also evaluated on a merge of both datasets and a MAE of 5.20 years was achieved.

Innovations in vision, haptics, and accurate movements of robot arms have enabled surgeons to perform precise minimally invasive surgeries. Real-time semantic segmentation of the robotic instruments and tissues is a crucial step in robot-assisted surgery. Accurate and efficient segmentation of the surgical scene not only aids in the identification and tracking of instruments but also provides contextual information about the different tissues and instruments being operated with. For this purpose, we have developed a light-weight cascaded convolutional neural network to segment the surgical instruments from high-resolution videos obtained from a commercial robotic system. We propose a multi-resolution feature fusion module to fuse the feature maps of different dimensions and channels from the auxiliary and main branch. We also introduce a novel way of combining auxiliary loss and adversarial loss to regularize the segmentation model. Auxiliary loss helps the model to learn low-resolution features, and adversarial loss improves the segmentation prediction by learning higher order structural information. The model also consists of a light-weight spatial pyramid pooling unit to aggregate rich contextual information in the intermediate stage.

First, using common method of segmentation, the iris region is localized and transformed to rectangular form. Then, we apply the moving average on the image to reduce random noise. At this stage, an amendment will be imposed to produce uniform gray levels distribution. After that, histogram equalization method will be applied to produce equalized contrast and more embellish iris pattern. Finally, this enhanced image is used to produce one dimensional real value as iris signature. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to classify the iris images and the results are promising.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCSCE.2013.6719966", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2014963918", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["42820346", "41631125", "111830480", "46229720", "985690", "5563509", "119685424", "1960618"], "inbound_citations": ["174819610"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9154175"}

Reliable earth observation data are key information for tracking biodiversity change on various scales. Regarding the establishment of standardized environmental observation systems, a key question is: What can be observed on each scale and how can land cover information be transferred? In this study, a land cover map from a dry semi-arid savanna ecosystem in Namibia was obtained based on the UN LCCS, in-situ data, and MODIS and Landsat satellite imagery. In situ botanical releve samples were used as baseline data for the definition of a standardized LCCS legend. A standard LCCS code for savanna vegetation types is introduced. An object-oriented segmentation of Landsat imagery was used as intermediate stage for downscaling in-situ training data on a coarse MODIS resolution. MODIS time series metrics of the growing season 2004/2005 were used to classify Kalahari vegetation types using a tree-based ensemble classifier (Random Forest). The prevailing Kalahari vegetation types based on LCCS was open broadleaved deciduous shrubland with an herbaceous layer which differs from the class assignments of the global and regional land-cover maps. The separability analysis based on Bhattacharya distance measurements applied on two LCCS levels indicated a relationship of spectral mapping dependencies of annual MODIS time series features due to the thematic detail of the classification scheme. The analysis of LCCS classifiers showed an increased significance of life-form composition and soil conditions to the mapping accuracy. An overall accuracy of 92.48% was achieved. Woody plant associations proved to be most stable due to small omission and commission errors.

It attracts a great deal of attention during the past years and has been extensively studied in many fields including image annotation and text categorization. Although many efforts have been made for multilabel learning, there are two challenging issues remaining, i.e., how to exploit the correlations and how to tackle the high-dimensional problems of multilabel data. In this paper, an effective algorithm is developed for multilabel classification with utilizing those data that are relevant to the targets. The key is the construction of a coefficient-based mapping between training and test instances, where the mapping relationship exploits the correlations among the instances, rather than the explicit relationship between the variables and the class labels of data. Further, a constraint, l\u00b9-norm penalty, is performed on the mapping relationship to make the model sparse, weakening the impacts of noisy data.

ALS data showed to be appropriate for the characterization of structural forest attributes (height, volume, DBH) (Montaghi et al., 2013; NA\u00a6sset & A\u02dckland, 2002), while hyperspectral data are useful for the characterization of tree species distribution (Dalponte et al., 2014). These two data can be considered complementary and their fusion allows estimating all the forest attributes needed for forest inventories. In this paper the attention is focused on ITC level forest inventories, that require the estimation of forest attributes for each individual tree. This means that for each tree in the analyzed area, all the attributes (height, DBH, volume, species) will be estimated. ::: ::: The goals of this study were mainly two: i) to fuse hyperspectral and ALS data for ITC level forest inventory; and ii) to compare the results obtained at ITC level with the ones obtained with a normal inventory at stand level. In this way we want to understand advantages and disadvantages of using these methods, and their real applicability in a practical forest inventory context. ::: ::: The study area of Pellizzano (32 km2) is located in the Italian Alps. The forest is dominated by Norway spruce, with the presence of also other coniferous species (e.g., Silver fir, European Larch, Swiss pine) and broadleaves species (e.g., Aspen, Birch). ALS data were acquired between 7th to 9th of September 2012 with a Riegl LMS-Q680i sensor. The scan frequency was 400kHz and up to 4 returns were recorded. The point density was of at least 10 points per square meter. Hyperspectral data were acquired between 400 nm and 990 nm (65 bands) on 13th of June 2013 with an AISA Eagle II sensor. The spatial resolution was of 1 m. Field measurements were carried out in 52 sample plots. Species, DBH, volume and height were measured for some trees inside each plot. In this way we obtained 3776 trees for which the species information was recorded. Among these trees for 1401 the DBH, and volume were measured, and for 121 also the height was measured. ::: ::: Two processing chains were developed for the two data sources. Regarding ALS data, first of all the rasterized CHM was generated, and it was used as input to the Individual Tree Crowns (ITC) delineation. The ITC delineation was carried out using the algorithm of Ene et al. (Ene et al., 2012). From each ITC 70 variables (e.g. height percentiles, coverage variables, coefficient of variation, etc.) were extracted from the ALS point cloud from all the available returns (from 1 to 4). The most informative variables for the estimation of the stem volume and of the DBH were selected using a stepwise model selection by exact AIC. These variables were used as input to a generalized linear regression model. The stem volume was estimated in two ways: i) directly from the ALS variables; and ii) using dendrometric equations having in input the DBHs estimated from ALS data and the species predicted from hyperspectral data. ::: Regarding the hyperspectral data, first of all the acquired images were mosaicked and radiometrically normalized. A selection of the most informative pixels inside each ITC was carried out according to the findings of Dalponte et al. (Dalponte et al., 2014). The hyperspectral bands, fused with the mean tree height derived from ALS data were used as input to a Support Vector Machine classifier. The pixel level map obtained in this way was aggregated at ITC level according to a majority rule inside each ITC. ::: ::: A mean class accuracy (the average of the producer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accuracies) of 85.1% was obtained considering the classification of 10 classes. The kappa accuracy was of 76.3% and the overall accuracy of 82.4%. The producer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accuracies (PA) ranged from a maximum of 100% for Scots Pine to a minimum of 73.2% for Swiss Pine. These results are at ITC level for an independent validation dataset. The mean tree height derived from ALS data was very important for the detection of Green Alder (91.1% PA) that is characterized by a mean height very different from the other broadleaves species. ::: Regarding the DBH estimation, among all the variables extracted from each ITC the variable selection process selected 21 variables. These variables were used to estimate the DBH. The DBH estimation results were as follows: Adjusted-R2=0.83; Mean Absolute Error = 5.8 cm; Normalized Root Means Square Error % = 6.0. ::: The results for the stem volume estimation using the first approach (stem volume estimation from ALS variables) were as follows: Adjusted-R2=0.89; Mean Absolute Error = 0.48 m3; Normalized Root Means Square Error % = 6.9. Considering the second approach (stem volume estimation using dendrometric equations having in input the DBHs estimated from ALS data and the species predicted from hyperspectral data) were as follows: Mean Absolute Error = 0.49 m3; Normalized Root Means Square Error % = 7.0. ::: ::: Starting from the results obtained at ITC level we plan to extrapolate estimations of forest attributes at stand level and to compare them with the ones of a standard forest inventory in order to understand its applicability in real forest inventories.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2286669441", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55314302", "16353593", "198975594"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130732806"}

In an era in which genome-wide scans have become relatively common, new powerful methods are required to handle the huge amount of feasible gene-gene interactions and to weed out false positives and negatives from these results. One solution to the dimensionality problem is to reduce data by preliminary screening of markers to select the best candidates for further analysis. Ideally, this screening step is statistically independent of the testing phase. Initially developed for small numbers of markers, the Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method is a nonparametric, model-free data reduction technique to associate sets of markers with optimal predictive properties to disease. In this study, we examine the power of MDR in larger data sets and compare it with other approaches that are able to identify gene-gene interactions.

In DeSTIN the spatiotemporal dependencies that exist within the observations are modeled inherently in an unguided manner. Each node models the inputs by means of clustering and simple dynamics modeling while it constructs a belief state over the distribution of sequences using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that information from the different layers of this hierarchical system can be extracted and utilized for the purpose of pattern classification. Earlier simulation results indicated that the framework is highly promising, consequently in this work we expand DeSTIN to a popular problem, the MNIST data set of handwritten digits.

For evaluating the image quality, we train LSGANs on several datasets including LSUN and a cat dataset, and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs. Furthermore, we evaluate the stability of LSGANs in two groups. One is to compare between LSGANs and regular GANs without gradient penalty. We conduct three experiments, including Gaussian mixture distribution, difficult architectures, and a new proposed method --- datasets with small variance, to illustrate the stability of LSGANs. The other one is to compare between LSGANs with gradient penalty and WGANs with gradient penalty (WGANs-GP).

To counter such attacks, an automated spoof detector is used to distinguish images of fake fingerprints from those of real live fingerprints. Most spoof detectors adopt a machine learning approach, where a classifier is trained to distinguish between \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201clive\u201d samples. Such approaches require training samples from both classes. However, there are two fundamental concerns. Firstly, the number of spoof samples available during the training stage is typically much less than the number of live samples, resulting in imbalanced training sets. Secondly, the spoof detector may encounter spoofs fabricated using materials that were not \u201cseen\u201d in the training set, thereby failing to detect them. In order to alleviate some of these concerns, we adopt a One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) approach that predominantly uses training samples from only a single class, i.e., the live class, to generate a hyper sphere that encompasses most of the live samples. The goal is to learn the concept of a \u201clive\u201d fingerprint. The boundary of the hyper sphere is refined using a small number of spoof samples. The proposed method uses an ensemble of such OC-SVMs based on different feature sets.

Firstly, we design signal-level features like amplitude, phase, spatial correlation, and range profile of radar echoes in order to construct a high-dimensional feature vector. Secondly, SOM-SMOTE is proposed by combining Self Organizing Map (SOM) and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to solve the imbalanced dataset problem in training Random Forest. Real data shows that SOM-SMOTE-RF suppresses 82% clutters with only 5% targets loss.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/RADAR.2019.8835836", "venue": "2019 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)", "journal": "2019 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2973889806", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["26383869", "46713627", "54889629", "115892930", "124557357", "89141", "207738357", "1554582", "62155475"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202686665"}

Recent research in the field of deep learning and development of competent processors for autonomous or self driving car have shown amplitude of prospect, but there are many complexities for hardware deployment because of limited resources such as memory, computational power, and energy. Deployment of several mentioned ADAS safety feature using multiple sensors and individual processors, increases the integration complexity and also results in the distribution of the system, which is very pivotal for autonomous vehicles.This thesis attempts to tackle two important adas safety feature: Forward collision Warning, and Object Detection using the machine learning and Deep Neural Networks and there deployment in the autonomous embedded platform.This thesis proposes the following: 1. A machine learning based approach for the forward collision warning system in an autonomous vehicle.2.3-D object detection using Lidar and Camera which is primarily based on Lidar Point Clouds. The proposed forward collision warning model is based on the forward facing automotive radar providing the sensed input values such as acceleration, velocity and separation distance to a classifier algorithm which on the basis of supervised learning model, alerts the driver of possible collision.

This is accomplished by iteratively fitting an elementary model to the negative gradient of a loss function with respect to the expansion\u2019s values at each training data-point evaluated at each iteration. For the case of squared-error loss function, the negative gradient takes the form of an ordinary residual for a given training data-point. Studies have demonstrated that running GB for hundreds of iterations can lead to overfitting, while a number of authors showed that by adding noise to the training data, generalisation is impaired even with relatively few basis-models. Regularisation is realised through the shrinkage of every newly-added basis-model to the expansion. This paper demonstrates that GB with shrinkage-based regularisation is still prone to overfitting in noisy datasets. We use a transformation based on a sigmoidal function for reducing the influence of extreme values in the residuals of a GB iteration without removing them from the training set. This extension is built on top of shrinkage-based regularisation. Simulations using synthetic, noisy data show that the proposed method slows-down overfitting and reduces the generalisation error of regularised GB. The proposed method is then applied to the inherently noisy domain of financial time-series modelling.

HARP works by finding a smaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input. This simplified graph is used to learn a set of initial representations, which serve as good initializations for learning representations in the original, detailed graph. We inductively extend this idea, by decomposing a graph in a series of levels, and then embed the hierarchy of graphs from the coarsest one to the original graph. HARP is a general meta-strategy to improve all of the state-of-the-art neural algorithms for embedding graphs, including DeepWalk, LINE, and Node2vec.

One of the challenges raised by a well-known financial entity is to reduce doubtful credit from the customers' transactions (face-to-face purchases). When transactions are unpaid by customers, the financial entity has to afford it and the corresponding amount of money is added to the doubtful credit. These transactions are accepted due to incorrect validation during the authorization. When the financial entity has connectivity problems and it is not able to validate a transaction, it allows a payment processor entity to validate the transaction. The payment processor entity does not have the legal permission to check if the customer has enough credit to assume the transaction. Therefore, the payment processor entity sometimes validates transactions that the customer will not pay. This project proposes to implement an algorithm able to predict which transactions will be paid by the customer and which not. This algorithm has to be executed by the payment processor entity.

One potential cause of the difficulty is the imbalanced dataset i.e. the interested positive class is minor while uninterested negative class is major. To alleviate the problem of imbalanced dataset and improve the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, this study proposes P-SMOTE, a new oversampling technique which focuses on the blank spaces along positive borderline of a SVM. The proposed technique was firstly investigated on Reuters-21578, which is a standard text classification dataset. Then, P-SMOTE was applied to a design patent document dataset.

Early diagnosis of AD is very important for AD patients to keep life quality. The resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) which precisely reflects the brain changes on the resting state of individuals provides a quantitative approach, which has been introduced to distinguish AD patients from normal population. In this study, we proposed a method to find the most distinctive features identifying AD patients from rs-fMRI images. The ALFF and ReHo parameters based on pre-processed rs-fMRI data were extracted, and some key parameters of the brain functional network based on graph theory were calculated. Then we tested the recognition performance of different classifiers, and the best classification algorithm, that is, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear-kernel are selected. Finally through a recursive feature selection procedure, we got the most distinctive feature set. Additionally, this study also implies that there may be several changes in some particular ROIs of the brain during the AD development.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29059923", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036875", "venue": "Conference proceedings : ...
