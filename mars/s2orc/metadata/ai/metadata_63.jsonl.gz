Sequence data from the well studied model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been commonly used to test and validate in silico prediction methods. DNA replication is a critical step in the cellular process and the sequence location where this process originates in the genomic landscape is generally referred as origin of replication. In this paper we investigate the application bidirectional Long Short Term (LSTM) Networks to predict origin of replication sequences. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks have recently been shown to yield state of the art performance in speech recognition, and music generation. These networks are capable of learning long term patterns via the use of multiplication gates. This paper utilizes Deep bidirectional LSTM for prediction of origin of replication sequences belonging to the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results demonstrate that LSTMs outperform the commonly used machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An important additional advantage of LSTMs is that they work directly on the sequences and obviate the need for hand coded features.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/DSAA.2015.7344871", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2188194556", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3072378", "46568566", "6263878", "2118350", "15429861", "11224628", "5455813", "5645703", "23933696", "190432", "11432136", "207165665", "89141", "2852254", "1915014", "474078", "12979634", "59794332", "18375389"], "inbound_citations": ["7626104", "211680186", "212703203"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18987498"}

This motivates using advanced data analytics to support data-driven pharmacovigilance.

To address this shortcoming, we propose our novel methodology called Tiered Ensemble Learning System with Diversity (TELS-D), an ensemble approach that integrates a rich variety of named entity recognizers to procure the final result. There are two specific challenges faced by biomedical NER: the classes are imbalanced and the lack of a single best performing method. The first challenge is addressed through a balanced, under-sampled bagging strategy that depends on the imbalance level to overcome this highly skewed data problem. To address the second challenge, we design an ensemble of heterogeneous entity recognizers that leverages a novel ensemble combiner. Our experimental results demonstrate that for biomedical text datasets: (i) a balanced learning environment combined with an ensemble of heterogeneous classifiers consistently improves the performance over individual base learners and (ii) stacking-based ensemble combiner methods outperform simple majority voting based solutions by 0.3 in F1-score.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-29196-9_22", "venue": "BIOSTEC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2967443383", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199661676"}

Naive Bayes, with its variations and Support Vector Machine are a commonly used baseline in the sentiment analysis task. However, their reported performance varies among researchers and has led to a divergence as to which is the best baseline classifier that can be used in the sentiment analysis task. In order to shed some light on this controversy, we have conducted a series of widely comparative experiments (including twelve various domains) to evaluate the performance of various machine learning classifiers (Naive Bayes with its variations, Support Vector Machine and J48 - an implementation of decision tree-based learning -) in the sentiment analysis task.

In the four algorithms, only MRA is a linear algorithm whereas the other three are nonlinear algorithms In general, when all these four algorithms are used to solve a real-world problem, they often produce different solution accuracies. Toward this issue, the solution accuracy is expressed with the total mean absolute relative residual for all samples, R(%).

The quantification of US is thus crucial for effective urban planning and environmental management. Like many megacities in fast growing developing countries, Chennai, the capital of Tamilnadu and one of the business hubs in India, has experienced extensive US triggered by the doubling of total population over the past three decades. However, the extent and level of US has not yet been quantified and a prediction for future extent of US is lacking. We employed the Random Forest (RF) classification on Landsat imageries from 1991, 2003, and 2016, and computed six landscape metrics to delineate the extent of urban areas within a 10 km suburban buffer of Chennai. The level of US was then quantified using Renyi\u2019s entropy. A land change model was subsequently used to project land cover for 2027. A 70.35% expansion in urban areas was observed mainly towards the suburban periphery of Chennai between 1991 and 2016. The Renyi\u2019s entropy value for year 2016 was 0.9, exhibiting a two-fold level of US when compared to 1991. The spatial metrics values indicate that the existing urban areas became denser and the suburban agricultural, forests and particularly barren lands were transformed into fragmented urban settlements. The forecasted land cover for 2027 indicates a conversion of 13,670.33 ha (16.57% of the total landscape) of existing forests and agricultural lands into urban areas with an associated increase in the entropy value to 1.7, indicating a tremendous level of US.

We trained both the models to classify the penguins' behavior at intervals as either 'prey handling' or 'swimming'.

In this paper, by employing the merits of deep metric learning, we propose a novel metric-based generative adversarial network (MBGAN), which uses the distance-criteria to distinguish between real and fake samples. Specifically, the discriminator of MBGAN adopts a triplet structure and learns a deep nonlinear transformation, which maps input samples into a new feature space. In the transformed space, the distance between real samples is minimized, while the distance between real sample and fake sample is maximized. Similar to the adversarial procedure of existing GANs, a generator is trained to produce synthesized examples, which are close to real examples, while a discriminator is trained to maximize the distance between real and fake samples to a large margin. Meanwhile, instead of using a fixed margin, we adopt a data-dependent margin [30], so that the generator could focus on improving the synthesized samples with poor quality, instead of wasting energy on well-produce samples.

A number of researchers appear to have converged on some defining characteristics of the problem, and on characteristics of practical approaches to solving it. RTE solutions have been shown to be of practical use in other NLP applications, and other grand Natural Language Understanding (NLU) challenges, such as Learning by Reading [27] and Machine Reading [43] have emerged that will require similar problems to be solved.

Our objective was to develop a repeatable method to map urban tree canopy cover for the state of Wisconsin. We compared two types of imagery (pan-sharpened 1.5 m SPOT-6 and 1 m NAIP aerial photography), three classification algorithms, seven segment sizes ranging from single pixels to 105 m2, three levels of compactness for each segment size, and sixteen subsets of features. NAIP outperformed SPOT. On average across classification algorithms there were no significant differences in map agreement. Pixel-based maps with convolution features performed as well as the best segment-based maps. The best segment size tested was 60 m2 on average, but there was also a local maximum around 15 m2, which suggests a large range of possible segment sizes must be tested to find the best. The model chosen for application to the whole state was a pixel-level Random Forest classifier with 160 features, and the final state-wide map has five classes: tree/woody vegetation, grass/herbaceous vegetation, impervious surfaces/bare soil, water, and non-forested wetland. Overall accuracy for our state-wide map at the pixel-scale was 79.3% (95% CI: 77.5\u201381%). Errors occurred due to meter-scale heterogeneity in the urban environment which increases the errors due to spatial misregistration and the number of difficult-to-classify mixed and edge pixels. At larger management level scales, mean absolute error (MAE) decreases to about 10% at the Landsat pixel scale and about 6% at the scale of a city block.

By using a multi-variate approach in energy performance prediction, we can characterize the building energy usage with a few available variables. However, very few studies have applied the variables related to building operation for energy consumption in buildings. Especially, the importance of the use factor, which affects the energy consumption, varies depending on the usage of tenants. However, there is a lack of sufficient research on the energy consumption based on energy use factors of each tenant in a building. Therefore, in this study we propose an energy consumption model using data on the energy use factors, such as occupant schedule, operation, and equipment, especially with a focus on the tenants in buildings. In this study, we analyzed the ranking of variable importance using the Random Forest algorithm and verified the energy consumption results of individual, office, and retail tenants in commercial buildings using a Gaussian process regression model. The main contribution of this study is the identification of the influence of energy use factors on the energy consumption of each tenant, both office and retail, thereby developing an energy model. This study established a method to identify the combination of variables that could estimate the energy consumption.

The Support Vector Machines (SVM) model can be used for classification recognition. However, the selection of penalty factor c and kernel parameter g in the model has a great influence on the correctness of clustering. To solve the problem of parameter optimization of the SVM model, a support vector machine algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM) based on adaptive mutation is proposed. Firstly, a large number of FCM data were used to carry out the experiment, and the kernel function adapted to the sample data was selected. Then the PSO algorithm of adaptive mutation was used to optimize the parameters of the SVM classifier. Finally, the cell clustering results were obtained. The method greatly improves the clustering correctness of traditional SVM. That also overcomes the shortcomings of PSO algorithm, which is easy to fall into local optimum in the iterative optimization process and has poor convergence effect in dealing with a large number of data. Compared with the traditional SVM algorithm, the experimental results show that, the correctness of the method is improved by 19.38%. Compared with the cross-validation algorithm and the PSO algorithm, the adaptive mutation PSO algorithm can also improve the correctness of FCM data clustering. The correctness of the algorithm can reach 99.79% and the time complexity is relatively lower.

This paper presents dropout training for linear SVMs. To deal with the intractable expectation of the nonsmooth hinge loss under corrupting distributions, we develop an iteratively re-weighted least square (IRLS) algorithm by exploring data augmentation techniques. Our algorithm iteratively minimizes the expectation of a reweighted least square problem, where the re-weights have closedform solutions. The similar ideas are applied to develop a new IRLS algorithm for the expected logistic loss under corrupting distributions.

Previous research into the cognitive processes involved in revision has shown that novices focus on local, sentence level revision while expert writers focus on global revision of ideas or restructuring of arguments. For better quality writing, students should focus more on global revision. The reviewer comments can either trigger more meaningful global revision (content-related comments) or local revision (non content-related comments). In this paper, a machine learning algorithm was applied to classify the comments in academic drafts in our laboratory as either content-related or not. Reviewer comments in academic article drafts are usually short. Therefore, this research applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for the classification, which is one of the most common machine learning algorithms for short texts. Performance evaluation was based on the measures of accuracy, precision and recall for the non content-related comments. Using cross validation, highest scores of 86%, 89% and 89% were achieved for accuracy, recall, and precision, respectively. The results demonstrate the success of the automatic classification, which can be applied to filter out non content-related comments so that the students focus first on revising the content-related comments.

In connectionist, neural network, or parallel distributed processing models, information processing takes the form of cooperative and competitive interactions among many simple, neuron-like processing units. These models provide new ways of thinking about the neural basis of cognitive processes, and how disorders of brain function lead to disorders of cognition. This monograph is an expanded version of a recent issue of the journal Cognitive Neuropsychology. It presents the most comprehensive existing \"case study\" of how the effects of damage in connectionist models can replicate the detailed and diverse patterns of cognitive impairments that can arise in humans as a result of brain damage. It begins with a review of the basic methodology of cognitive neuropsychology and of other attempts at modeling neuropsychological phenomena. It then focuses on a particular form of acquired reading disorder, \"deep dyslexia,\" in which previously literate adults with brain damage exhibit a wide range of symptoms in pronouncing written words, the most striking of which is the production of semantic errors (e.g. reading RIVER as \"ocean\"). A series of simulations investigate the effects of damage in connectionist models that pronounce written words via their meaning. The work systematically explores each main aspect of the design of the models, identifying the basic computational properties that are responsible for the occurrence of deep dyslexia when the models are damaged. Although the investigation concerns a specific form of reading impairment, the computational principles that emerge as critical are very general ones: representation of concepts as distributed patterns of activity, encoding of knowledge in terms of weights on connections between units, interactivity between units to form stable attractors for familiar activity patterns, and greater richness of concrete vs. abstract semantics. The fact that damage to models embodying these principles and damage to the brain can produce strikingly similar behaviour supports the view that the human cognitive system operates according to similar principles.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1496238771", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15506290", "55935543", "45967061", "16709443", "17998309", "15757187", "2934449"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:141956326"}

Without the accurate prediction of actual market demand, there will be a supply shortage or surplus, which influences the enterprise's inventory level and costs of operation. Product substitution is an important factor which affects the precision of demand forecasting. It could reduce the retailer's out-of-stock losses and raise the quality of services. However, it can also distort the genuine demand of the product by exaggerating the demand of substitute products. Product substitution presents a new challenge in demand forecasting. In this paper, an Estimation of Adjacent Substitution Rate based on Clustering Algorithm (EASR-CA) method is proposed according to a cornucopia of categories situation. First, all categories are divided into different clusters by weighted Clustering Algorithm. Then, in each cluster, the product adjacent substitution is calculated. According to the concept mentioned above, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) demand forecasting model, based on adjacent substitution rate estimation, is applied to PC product demand forecasting, which results in higher precision.

Moreover, the heartbeat data augmentation techniques are employed to increase the classification performance. We have utilized two-second ECG signals from the PTB database, which has been widely employed in MI detection studies.

Firstly, the opinion corpus in the source language with fine grained annotations are translated and projected to the target language to generate the training samples. Then, a classifier based on multi-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is developed to identify opinion holders in the target language, which uses a tree kernel based on syntactic features and a polynomial kernel based on semantic features, respectively. The two kernels are further improved by incorporating a pivot function based on word pair similarity. To reduce the noise of low quality translated samples, a Transfer learning algorithm is applied to select high quality translated samples iteratively for training the multi-kernel classifiers on the target language. Evaluations on transferring MPQA, an English opinion corpus (as the source language), to Chinese opinion analysis (as the target language) show that the opinion holder extraction performance on NTCIR-7 MOAT dataset is improved, which is higher than the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) based approach and most reported systems in NTCIR-7 MOAT evaluation.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11280-013-0246-0", "venue": "World Wide Web", "journal": "World Wide Web", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2033712093", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["154999", "250761", "15266179", "7506864", "52874011", "12211329", "14471969", "8346698", "7722577", "1263926", "10467115", "14845097", "17444346", "14869600", "37198649", "8358425", "8884550"], "inbound_citations": ["20834361", "6460059", "3429396", "3389655", "35723242", "17526511", "27166277", "7006436", "1158210", "3424403", "3419166", "12433268"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2891389"}

This paper proposes a parallel chaos search based incremental extreme learning machine (PC-ELM) with additional steps to obtain a more compact network architecture. At each learning step, optimal parameters of hidden node that are selected by parallel chaos optimization algorithm will be added to exist network in order to minimize the residual error between target function and network output.

Therefore, we redesign the learning objective and propose an efficient framework for training contextual representation models. Specifically, the proposed approach bypasses the softmax layer by performing language modeling with dimension reduction, and allows the models to leverage pre-trained word embeddings. Our framework reduces the time spent on the output layer to a negligible level, eliminates almost all the trainable parameters of the softmax layer and performs language modeling without truncating the vocabulary. When applied to ELMo, our method achieves a 4 times speedup and eliminates 80% trainable parameters while achieving competitive performance on downstream tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1902.11269", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2915685186", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8236317", "15022745", "207556454", "14604520", "14136307", "13747425", "351666", "3932228", "16119010", "52967399", "3994096", "13905106", "33626727", "51879191", "1915014", "7443908", "122725444", "260422", "686481", "57189558", "54472058", "1222212", "4891749", "52221821", "1190093", "9447219", "5959482", "19426100", "6633369", "1326925", "337425", "49306018", "52098907", "10361075", "14515377", "836219", "49313245", "160025533", "11816014", "16904319", "1114678", "990233", "13756489", "3603249", "26238954", "20425665"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67855695"}

The forecast time horizon ranges from 24-h ahead (one day) to 168-h ahead (seven days). The proposed OP-ELM model is compared to the standard multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with respect to their capabilities of forecasting DO in the Klamath River at Miller Island Boat Ramp, Oregon, USA. To demonstrate the forecasting capability of OP-ELM and MLPNN models, we used a long-term data set of hourly DO data for a ten-year period, from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2013, collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS Stations No: 420,853,121,505,500 [Top] and 420,853,121,505,501 [Bottom]). For developing the models, we split the data set into a training subset (from 2004 to 2010) that corresponded to 70 %, and a validation (from 2011 to 2013) that corresponded to 30 % of the total data set. We investigated the performance and accuracy of the proposed two models for three different horizons, i.e., short-term, medium-term and long-term forecasting; a total of six different models (FM1 to FM6), having the same data sets as inputs, were developed for short-term (24 h to 48 h), medium-term (72 h to 96 h) and long-term (120 h to 168 h) horizons. Input variables used in the six models were the six antecedent DO concentrations at (t-5), (t-4), (t-3), (t-2), (t-1) and (t). The performance of the OP-ELM and MLPNN models in training and validation sets were compared with the observed data. To get more accurate evaluation of the results of the two models, the following seven statistical performance indices were used: the coefficient of correlation (R), the Willmott index of agreement (d), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the bias error (Bias), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The study reveals that OP-ELM and MLPN provided good results and they were successful in forecasting DO at a high level of accuracy. The reliability of forecasting decreased with increasing the step ahead. The measures of model performance fell within the acceptable ranges for the two stations. Regarding the fact that researches on medium and long-term forecasting are relatively limited, the present work aims to build and provide a good early warning system capable of preventing DO depletion and the associated problems of anoxia and hypoxia in river. Furthermore, the proposed forecasting models, when implemented appropriately, could be reliably used in detecting future change in DO concentration in rivers.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s40710-016-0172-0", "venue": "Environmental Processes", "journal": "Environmental Processes", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2419464021", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["128092536", "98499428", "84987819", "206034742", "40691238", "129785241", "118495644", "85262164", "117550490", "25325054", "45788991", "18120180", "129575547", "140149142", "39731700", "17628627", "123118384", "129164173", "8298929", "107170983", "3761330", "1085600", "18896780", "13345353", "112095570", "121570279", "97595066", "121101828", "29060595", "13452331", "34439385", "129836292", "153950236", "18017528", "28570013", "111719", "124094269", "110201845", "26675491", "112111511", "7343126", "2757547", "13936498", "2891159", "5117817", "116858", "128610515", "113024722", "128417849", "7028394", "29044567", "30211248", "129020845", "5841230", "17565572", "94904975", "126867924", "15897183", "11124791", "112105449", "15969351", "11186951", "140164618", "128303384", "24086927", "96102118", "119847", "7117611", "84095525", "18476729", "62245742", "53485295", "275551", "8401078", "17876568", "126913264", "128225924", "127229201", "117623122", "5794648", "122167281", "120556606", "15373474", "8835269", "73571221"], "inbound_citations": ["114707897", "52210876", "71147899", "133914428", "201330805", "132172384", "132812320", "12012832", "17268080"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113839837"}

In this paper we propose an algorithm for detecting power lines from radar videos from an active millimeter-wave sensor. Hough Transform is employed to detect candidate lines. The major challenge is that the radar videos are very noisy due to ground return. The noise points could fall on the same line which results in signal peaks after Hough Transform similar to the actual cable lines. To differentiate the cable lines from the noise lines, we train a Support Vector Machine to perform the classification. We exploit the Bragg pattern, which is due to the diffraction of electromagnetic wave on the periodic surface of power lines. We propose a set of features to represent the Bragg pattern for the classifier.

The typical ranking strategy used by many CBIR systems is to employ image content descriptors, so that returned images that are most similar to the query image are placed higher in the rank. While this strategy is well accepted and widely used, improved results may be obtained by combining multiple image descriptors. In this paper we explore this idea, and introduce algorithms that learn to combine information coming from different descriptors. The proposed learning to rank algorithms are based on three diverse learning techniques: Support Vector Machines (CBIR-SVM), Genetic Programming (CBIR-GP), and Association Rules (CBIR-AR). Eighteen image content descriptors(color, texture, and shape information) are used as input and provided as training to the learning algorithms. We performed a systematic evaluation involving two complex and heterogeneous image databases (Corel e Caltech) and two evaluation measures (Precision and MAP). The empirical results show that all learning algorithms provide significant gains when compared to the typical ranking strategy in which descriptors are used in isolation. We concluded that, in general, CBIR-AR and CBIR-GP outperforms CBIR-SVM.

The idea to use the zigzag collarette area is that it is insensitive to the pupil dilation and usually not affected by eyelids or eyelashes. The deterministic feature sequence is extracted from iris images using Gabor wavelet technique and used to train SVM as iris classifiers. The traditional SVM is modified as asymmetrical SVM to treat False Accept and False Reject differently to satisfy several security requirements.

There is a wealth of information in this data and effective techniques for extracting and processing this information are vital. Previous work by ERIM on man-made object detection has demonstrated that there is a huge amount of discriminatory information in hyperspectral images. This work used the hypothesis that the spectral characteristics of natural backgrounds can be described by a multivariate Gaussian model. The Mahalanobis distance (derived from the covariance matrix) between the background and other objects in the spectral data is the key discriminant. Other work (by DERA and Pilkington Optronics Ltd) has confirmed these findings, but indicates that in order to obtain the lowest possible false alarm probability, a way of including higher order statistics is necessary. There are many ways in which this could be done ranging from neural networks to classical density estimation approaches. In this paper we report on a new method for extending the Gaussian approach to more complex spectral signatures. By using ideas from the theory of Support Vector Machines we are able to map the spectral data into a higher dimensional space. The co- ordinates of this space are derived from all possible multiplicative combinations of the original spectral line intensities, up to a given order d -- which is the main parameter of the method. The data in this higher dimensional space are then analyzed using a multivariate Gaussian approach. Thus when d equals 1 we recover the ERIM model -- in this case the mapping is the identity. In order for such an approach to be at all tractable we must solve the 'combinatorial explosion' problem implicit in this mapping for large numbers of spectral lines in the signature data. In order to do this we note that in the final analysis of this approach it is only the inner (dot) products between vectors in the higher dimensional space that need to be computed. This can be done by efficient computations in the original data space. Thus the computational complexity of the problem is determined by the amount of data -- rather than the dimensionality of the mapping. The novel combination of non- linear mapping and high dimensional multivariate Gaussian analysis, only possible by using techniques from SVM theory, allows the practical application to hyperspectral imagery. We note that this approach also generates the non-linear Principal Components of the data, which have applications in their own right. In this paper we give a mathematical derivation of the method from first principles. The method is illustrated on a synthetic data set where complete control over the true statistics is possible. Results on this data show that the method is very powerful. It naturally extends the Gaussian approach to a variety of more complex probability distributions, including multi-modal and other manifestly non- Gaussian examples. Having shown the potential of this approach it is then applied to real hyperspectral trials data. The relative improvement in performance over the Gaussian approach is demonstrated for the real data.\u00a9 (1999) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

There exist some attempts to introduce non-stationary kernels to account for possible non-regularities, although even the most efficient one called Manifold Learning Regression (MLR), which estimates the unknown function as well its Jacobian matrix, is too computationally expensive. The main problem is that the MLR is based on a computationally intensive manifold learning technique. In this paper we propose a modified version of the MLR with significantly less computational complexity while preserving its accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-99978-4_12", "venue": "ANNPR", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2889499611", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201070673", "167217612"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52134271"}

The diagnosis accuracy and the speed of traditional multi-classification methods are limited. To solve these problems, a fault detection and multi-fault diagnosis framework based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and directed acyclic graph support vector machine (DAG-SVM) is proposed. First, features are extracted from aluminum electrolytic cell voltage signals. Then, DAG-SVM is used to detect and diagnose abnormal states.

It results in a loss of state revenue that can undermine the effectiveness of government policies. One measure of tax evasion is the so-called tax gap: the difference between the income that should be reported to the tax authorities and the amount actually reported. However, economists lack a robust method for estimating the tax gap through a bottom-up approach based on fiscal audits. This is difficult because the declared tax base is available on the whole population but the income reported to the tax authorities is generally available only on a small, non-random sample of audited units. This induces a selection bias which invalidates standard statistical methods. Here, we use machine learning based on a 2-steps Gradient Boosting model, to correct for the selection bias without requiring any strong assumption on the distribution. We use our method to estimate the Italian VAT Gap related to individual firms based on information gathered from administrative sources. Our algorithm estimates the potential VAT turnover of Italian individual firms for the fiscal year 2011 and suggests that the tax gap is about 30% of the total potential tax base.

Previous efforts generally produce crop planting area maps after harvest and early season cropping information is rarely available. New opportunities emerge with rapid increase in satellite data acquisition and cloud computing platform such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) which can access and process a vast volume of multi-sensor images. Here we aimed to examine earliest identifiable timing (EIT) of major crops (rice, soybean, and corn) and generate early season crop maps independent of within-year field surveys in the Heilongjiang province, one most important province of grain production in China. The Random Forest classifiers were trained based on early season images and field samples in 2017, then were transferred (applied) to corresponding images in 2018 to obtain resultant maps. Six scenarios with different temporal intervals (10d, 15d, 20d, and 30d) and data integration (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1, a total of 16, 450 images) were compared to get the optimal crop maps. The results showed that the Sentinel-2 time series and 10-day composite outperformed in obtaining EITs and crop maps. We found various EITs for the three grain staples. Specifically, rice could be identified in the late transplanting stage (four months before harvest) with F1 score of 0.93, following by corn recognizable in the early heading stage (two months before harvest, with F1 score of 0.92) and soybean in the early pod setting stage (50 days before harvest, with F1 score of 0.91). The crop maps in the EITs based on the classifier transfer approach have comparable accuracies (overall accuracy = 0.91) comparing to the traditional post-season mapping approach based on current year\u2019s all available images and samples (overall accuracy = 0.95).

In this study, we show that, human actions can be simply represented by pose without dealing with the complex representation of dynamics. Based on this idea, we propose a novel pose descriptor which we name as Histogram-of-Oriented-Rectangles (HOR) for representing and recognizing human actions in videos. We represent each human pose in an action sequence by oriented rectangular patches extracted over the human silhouette. We then form spatial oriented histograms to represent the distribution of these rectangular patches. We make use of several matching strategies to carry the information from the spatial domain described by the HOR descriptor to temporal domain. These are (i) nearest neighbor classification, which recognizes the actions by matching the descriptors of each frame, (ii) global histogramming, which extends the idea of Motion Energy Image proposed by Bobick and Davis to rectangular patches, (iii) a classifier-based approach using Support Vector Machines, and (iv) adaptation of Dynamic Time Warping on the temporal representation of the HOR descriptor. For the cases when pose descriptor is not sufficiently strong alone, such as to differentiate actions ''jogging'' and ''running'', we also incorporate a simple velocity descriptor as a prior to the pose based classification step. We test our system with different configurations and experiment on two commonly used action datasets: the Weizmann dataset and the KTH dataset. Results show that our method is superior to other methods on Weizmann dataset with a perfect accuracy rate of 100%, and is comparable to the other methods on KTH dataset with a very high success rate close to 90%.

Our input catalogue contains 103 million objects from the DR2xAllWISE cross-match table. We classified each object into four main classes: YSOs, extragalactic objects, main-sequence stars and evolved stars. At a 90% probability threshold we identified 1,129,295 YSO candidates. To demonstrate the quality and potential of our YSO catalogue, here we present two applications of it. (1) We explore the 3D structure of the Orion A star forming complex and show that the spatial distribution of the YSOs classified by our procedure is in agreement with recent results from the literature. (2) We use our catalogue to classify published $Gaia$ Science Alerts. As $Gaia$ measures the sources at multiple epochs, it can efficiently discover transient events, including sudden brightness changes of YSOs caused by dynamic processes of their circumstellar disk. However, in many cases the physical nature of the published alert sources are not known. A cross-check with our new catalogue shows that about 30% more of the published $Gaia$ alerts can most likely be attributed to YSO activity.

The modeling methods covered in this study are support vector machines (SVMs; known as state-of-the-art modeling methods), partial least squares (PLS), and artificial neural networks (ANNs); the processes are styrene\u2013acrylonitrile (SAN) and polypropylene (PP) polymerizations currently operated for commercial purposes in Korea. Brief outlines of the modeling procedure are presented for each method, followed by the procedures for training and validating the models. The SVM models yield the best prediction performances for both the SAN and PP polymerization processes. However, the ANN models fail to accurately predict the melt index when sufficient data are not available for model training in the PP polymerization process. The PLS models are not effective either when applied to the SAN polymerization process, for which the melt index has strong nonlinear functionality with the process variables. The good prediction performance that the SVM models show despite the insufficient data or strong process nonlinearity suggests that SVMs can be effectively used as alternative to PLS or ANNs for modeling the melt indices in other polymerization processes as well. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Typically, financial time series are non-stationary and volatile in nature. Because of its good generalization power and the tractability of the problem, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) has been extensively applied in financial time series prediction. The standard SVR adopts the l p -norm (p = 1 or 2) to model the functional complexity of the whole data set and employs a fixed e-tube to tolerate noise. Although this approach has proved successful both theoretically and empirically, it considers data in a global fashion only. Therefore it may lack the flexibility to capture the local trend of data; this is a critical aspect of volatile data, especially financial time series data. Aiming to address this issue, we propose the Local Support Vector Regression (LSVR) model. This novel model is demonstrated to provide a systematic and automatic scheme to adapt the margin locally and flexibly; the margin is fixed globally in the standard SVR. Therefore, the LSVR can tolerate noise adaptively. We provide both theoretical justifications and empirical evaluations for this novel model.

I. INTRODUCTION Simulators are valuable tools in the development and testing of control algorithm for mobile robots , allowing developers to gain estimates of feasibility of methods and to examine the algorithm befo re starting the implementation process, with a significant impact on reducing the costs. Simulation helps to improve development time, avoid damages caused by method failure, and find errors that occurred during the implementation process (11). Simulations address a vast group of problems--from singular based to team/swarm based, and from humanoid to industrial robots, such as robotic arms. Robot teaming and robotic swarm is an active research domain, with a variety of organizations and researchers to invest in application such as search and rescue, threat detection, patrolling, and counter- terrorism. The high level of complexities in such areas increases the necessity of employing simulators with more realistic aspects that not only take in account aspects if the robots, but also the impacts of teamwork and human-to-robot interaction, in ad dition to addressing various complexities introduced by dynamic, uncertain, and time dependent nature of the real world problems.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2184195544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111251359"}

In this work, we applied a machine learning based approach to predict portal dosimetry based IMRT QA gamma passing rates. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: 182 IMRT plans for various treatment sites were planned and delivered with portal dosimetry on two TrueBeam and two Trilogy LINACs. A total of 1497 beams were collected and analyzed using gamma criteria of 2%/2mm with a 5% threshold. The datasets for building the machine learning models consisted of 1269 beams. Ten-fold cross-validation was utilized to tune the model and prevent \"overfitting\". A separate test set with the remaining 228 beams were used to evaluate model performance. Each beam was characterized by a set of 31 features including both plan complexity metrics and machine characteristics. Three tree-based machine learning algorithms (AdaBoost, Random Forest and XGBoost) were used to train the models and predict gamma passing rates. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Both AdaBoost and Random Forest had 98% of predictions within 3% of the measured 2%/2mm gamma passing rates with a maximum error less than 4% and a mean absolute error less than 1%. XGBoost showed a slightly worse prediction accuracy with 95% of the predictions within 3% of the measured gamma passing rates and a maximum error of 4.5%. The three models identified the same nine features in the top 10 most important ones that are related to plan complexity and maximum aperture displacement from the central axis or the maximum jaw size in a beam. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: We have demonstrated that portal dosimetry IMRT QA gamma passing rates can be accurately predicted using tree-based ensemble learning models. The machine learning based approach allows physicists to better identify the failures of IMRT QA measurements and to develop proactive QA approaches. This article is protected by copyright.

Originally proposed as artificial neural networks, they can be regarded as a type of Markov Random Field in which the connection weights between nodes are symmetric and learned from data. They are also closely related to recent models such as Markov logic networks and Conditional Random Fields. A major challenge for Boltzmann machines (as well as other graphical models) is speeding up learning for large-scale problems. The heart of the problem lies in efficiently and effectively approximating the partition function. In this paper, we propose a new efficient learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines that allows them to be applied to problems with large numbers of random variables. We introduce a new large-margin variational approximation to the partition function that allows Boltzmann machines to be trained using a support vector machine (SVM) style learning algorithm. For discriminative learning tasks, these large margin Boltzmann machines provide an alternative approach to structural SVMs. We show that these machines have low sample complexity and derive a generalization bound. Our results demonstrate that on multilabel classification problems, large margin Boltzmann machines achieve orders of magnitude faster performance than structural SVMs and also outperform structural SVMs on problems with large numbers of labels.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IJCAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "29747707", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["463216", "9404152", "10151608", "120489597", "10379672", "7880266", "277918", "15379808"], "inbound_citations": ["7124042", "16307265"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61229013"}

However, one-class video classification is challenging. Due to the unavailability of abnormal samples, it is a cumbersome task to train an end-to-end deep supervised learning model. Meanwhile, video data representation is challenging because of the unstructured scheme of video contents. To represent video data with temporal and spatial information, we propose multiple dynamic images in our task because dynamic image encodes the temporal evolution of video frames and represents video contents at the level of the image pixels. Multiple dynamic images are viewed as the input sequence with temporal and spatial information and achieve dimension reduction of original video data. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-autoencoder-based adversarial learning model for one-class video classification (VidAnomaly without abnormal samples in the training stage. Our architecture is composed of three sub-networks. LSTM-autoencoder network (R) learns the temporal dependence of the input sequence and reconstructs the input sequence for the discriminator network (D) to achieve adversarial learning. The novelty of the proposed model is that we add an additional LSTM-encoder network (A) to obtain the latent representation of the reconstructed sequence. Minimizing the distance between the two latent representations from R and A benefits the model to further capture the training data distribution because it forces the LSTM-autoencoder network to yield an essential representation of training samples in latent space. In the inference stage, for a given abnormal sample as the input, the model poorly reconstructs the input abnormal sample and the reconstruction error would be high because the proposed model is trained merely on normal samples and its parameters are only suitable for reconstructing normal samples. Based on this, we detect abnormal samples. The experimental results show that VidAnomaly learns the target class distribution effectively and is superior to other methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006260", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3007613960", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9339434", "15484646", "204895939", "3509717", "53953754", "206592218", "207763512", "474607", "206590483", "130535382", "162990", "4245530", "11797475", "1122604", "1035098", "16763044", "207160159", "205464529", "62446310", "795827", "162990", "195513473", "1033682", "206592218", "11699847", "21688963", "11788802", "6628106", "173548", "36663713", "17427022", "3305321", "1923924", "54169113", "14613395"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211297480"}

Recently, researchers presented a dataset of food images at different states where unfortunately no information regarding the food category was included. In practical food monitoring applications it is important to be able to recognize a peeled tomato instead of a generic peeled item. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new dataset containing 20 different food categories taken from fruits and vegetables at 11 different states ranging from solid, sliced to creamy paste. We experiment with most common Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures on three different recognition tasks: food categories, food states, and both food categories and states. Since lack of labeled data is a common situation in practical applications, here we exploits deep features extracted from CNNs combined with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as an alternative to the End-to-End classification. We also compare deep features with several hand-crafted features. These experiments confirm that deep features outperform hand-crafted features on all the three classification tasks and whatever is the food category or food state considered. Finally, we test the generalization capability of the most performing deep features by using another, publicly available, dataset of food states. This last experiment shows that the features extracted from a CNN trained on our proposed dataset achieve performance quite close to the one achieved by the state of the art method.

This paper focuses on a migratable urban land usage classification problem using remote sensing data (i.e., satellite images). Our goal is to accurately classify the land usage of locations in a target city where the ground truth land usage data is not available by leveraging a classification model from a source city where such data is available. This problem is motivated by the limitation of current solutions that primarily rely on a rich set of ground-truth data for accurate model training, which encounters high annotation costs. Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) the target and source cities often have different urban characteristics that prevent the direct application of a model learned from the source city to the target city; ii) the complex visual features in satellite images make it non-trivial to \u201ctranslate\u201d the images from the target city to the source city for an accurate classification. To address the above challenges, we develop TransLand, an adversarial transfer learning framework to translate the satellite images from the target city to the source city for accurate land usage classification.

This paper investigates the efficiency of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) algorithm at predicting Penman\u2013Monteith (P\u2013M) ET 0 for Mosul, Baghdad, and Basrah meteorological stations, located at the north, mid, and southern part of Iraq. Data of weather parameters containing maximum air temperature ( T max ), minimum air temperature ( T min ), sunshine hours ( R n ), relative humidity ( R h ), and wind speed ( U 2 ) for the period (2000\u20132013) are used as inputs to the ELM model by using four different input cases including complete and incomplete sets of meteorological data. The performance of ELM model is compared with the empirical P\u2013M equation and with feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) model. The evaluation criteria used for comparison are the root of mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination ( R 2 ). The statistical results of both models are found to be encouraging; particularly results of running the ELM model with incomplete sets of data, noticing that the sensitivity of the proposed model to missing data changes from one location to another, as well as along the year for certain study location. The R n is found to be the most effective parameter in Mosul Station, while U 2 and R h are found to act almost in parallel with R n in Baghdad Station, and for conditions of Basrah Station; U 2 and R h prove to be the dominant parameters. The minimum and maximum time intervals required for running ELM model for all stations, and in all applied conditions, are (4.64\u20136.19) seconds respectively, while the same order of timing required for running the FFBP model is (6.30\u201327.80) seconds. The maximum R 2 recorded for the ELM model is 0.991, while for the FFBP it is 0.985. The ELM proved to be efficient, simple in application, of high speed, and has very good generalization performance; therefore, this algorithm is highly recommended for locations similar to the geographical and meteorological conditions of Iraq that consists of both arid and semiarid regions.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.04.073", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "332085899", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202738347", "209932777", "116282604", "51890770", "132568739", "201319397", "124152565", "9189926", "64769629", "33176644", "52008532", "77395240", "56246766", "134202428", "28365184", "202917177", "201017930", "211542019", "126348825", "125319567", "210930581", "16899707", "125793123", "55958228", "211130406", "133869562", "53441547", "191152067", "210913831", "12012832", "182128770", "172137976", "49312515", "125348038"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127467091"}

This disease causes an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 deaths per year worldwide. Between 1940 and 1979, approximately 27.5 million people were occupationally exposed to asbestos in the United States. The incidence of pleural mesothelioma in the US is 3,000 new cases/year and will not peak for another 20 years. Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20-40 years from asbestos exposure, but once diagnosed this aggressive disease is often fatal within 14 months. Because diagnosis is difficult, most patients present at a clinically advanced stage where possibility of cure is minimal. Therefore, we have conducted a broad search for new serum biomarkers with our aptamer-based proteomic platform and defined a classifier for the detection of mesothelioma in asbestos exposed individuals. Secreted proteins and those released during apoptosis from tumor cells and surrounding tissues contain important biologic information that may enable early diagnosis and prognostic and therapeutic decisions in oncology. However, there is great difficulty in finding and quantifying such signals for large numbers of low abundance proteins. We therefore created a highly multiplexed proteomic assay that currently measures \u223c850 proteins simultaneously from 15ul blood, with throughput of 300 samples/day. The average dynamic range of each protein in the assay is >3 logs \u2013 with nearly seven logs of dynamic range achieved through multiple dilutions \u2013 and the median lower limit of quantification is below 1 pM. The median coefficient of variation for each protein is The objective of this study was to discover proteins which are involved in malignant mesothelioma and to develop algorithms and classifiers for detection of the disease. To this end, blood samples from three study centers were analyzed with the aptamer proteomics platform in a prospectively designed case:control study. We compared 170 serum samples from 90 patients diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma to 80 asbestos exposed controls. These samples were divided into 75% for training and 25% set aside as a blinded test set for classifier development and verification. Nineteen significant biomarkers were discovered by applying a backwards selection strategy. Classifiers were built with subsets of these biomarkers resulting in an AUC of 0.95 or better with an overall accuracy of 93%. Applying a 13-plex Random Forest classifier to the blinded test set resulted in a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 80% for distinction of asbestos exposed controls from mesothelioma, including detection of 15/19 Stage I/II cases. Refinement and confirmation of classifier performance will be established through ongoing validation studies. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

There are several occasions where it is required to distinguish between such real and fake 3D video sequences. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed which can distinguish the real 3D video from the fake one.

Specifically, multi-temporal L-band ALOS PALSAR-1, C-band RADARSAT-2, and X-band TerraSAR-X data were used to investigate the effect of SAR frequency and polarization, as well as temporal baselines on the coherence degree in the various wetland classes. SAR backscatter and coherence maps were also used as input features into an object-based Random Forest classification scheme to examine the contribution of these features to the overall classification accuracy. Our findings suggested that the temporal baseline was the most influential factor for coherence maintenance in herbaceous wetlands, especially for shorter wavelengths. In general, coherence was the highest in L-band and intermediate/low for both X- and C-band, depending on the wetland classes and temporal baseline.

Seagrasses are one of the most productive and widespread yet threatened coastal ecosystems on Earth. Despite their importance, they are declining due to various threats, which are mainly anthropogenic. Lack of data on their distribution hinders any effort to rectify this decline through effective detection, mapping and monitoring. Remote sensing can mitigate this data gap by allowing retrospective quantitative assessment of seagrass beds over large and remote areas. In this paper, we evaluate the quantitative application of Planet high resolution imagery for the detection of seagrasses in the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece. The low Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), which characterizes spectral bands at shorter wavelengths, prompts the application of the Unmixing-based denoising (UBD) as a pre-processing step for seagrass detection. A total of 15 spectral-temporal patterns is extracted from a Planet image time series to restore the corrupted blue and green band in the processed Planet image. Subsequently, we implement Lyzenga\u2019s empirical water column correction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to evaluate quantitative benefits of denoising. Denoising aids detection of Posidonia oceanica seagrass species by increasing its producer and user accuracy by 31.7 % and 10.4 %, correspondingly, with a respective increase in its Kappa value from 0.3 to 0.48. In the near future, our objective is to improve accuracies in seagrass detection by applying more sophisticated, analytical water column correction algorithms to Planet imagery, developing time- and cost-effective monitoring of seagrass distribution that will enable in turn the effective management and conservation of these highly valuable and productive ecosystems.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-1-W1-283-2017", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2620823684", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["54741771", "84607120", "5996537", "16029059", "17449190", "43993321", "961425", "4932709", "7893310", "129811946", "34488748", "215652474", "7138354", "128849511"], "inbound_citations": ["135350702", "210993003", "133605388", "53231557", "48353438", "73551845", "52277133"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37653156"}

Cervical cancer classification utilizing gene expression data depends upon conventional supervised learning methods, wherein only labeled data could be used for learning.

So, the entire performance of the cancer classification is decreased meaningfully. With the aim of overcoming the aforesaid problems, Enhanced Bat Optimization Algorithm with Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (EBO-HSIC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is presented in this research for identifying the specific genes from the gene expression dataset that belongs to cancer microarray. This proposed system contains phases of instance normalization, module detection, gene selection and classification. By Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm, the normalization is performed for eliminating the inappropriate features from the gene dataset. Meanwhile, for effective feature selection, the EBO algorithm is used for producing more appropriate features via improved objective function values. For determining a subset of the most informative genes utilizing a rapid as well as scalable bat algorithm, this proposed method focuses on measuring the dependence amid Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) as well as the gene significance. The algorithm is dependent upon the HSIC and was partially enthused by EBO. With the help of SVM classifier, these gene features are categorized very precisely. Experimentation outcomes demonstrate that the presented EBO with SVM algorithm confirms a clear-cut classification performance for the given gene expression datasets.

ILP uses the observed spatial relationships between pharmacophore types in pretested active and inactive compounds and learns human-readable rules describing the diverse structures of active compounds. The ILP-based scaffold hopping method is compared to two previous algorithms (chemically advanced template search, CATS, and CATS3D) on 10 data sets with diverse scaffolds. The comparison shows that the ILP-based method is significantly better than random selection while the other two algorithms are not. In addition, the ILP-based method retrieves new active scaffolds which were not found by CATS and CATS3D. The results show that the ILP-based method is at least as good as the other methods in this study. ILP produces human-readable rules, which makes it possible to identify the three-dimensional features that lead to scaffold hopping. A minor variant of a rule learnt by ILP for scaffold hopping was subsequently found to cover an inhibitor identified by an independent study. This provides a successful result in a blind trial of the effectiveness of ILP to generate rules for scaffold hopping.

Based on the print factory's current capacity and the order's properties and requirements, an order is refused if its acceptance is not profitable for the PSP. The order is accepted with the most appropriate due date in order to maximize the profit that can result from this order. We have developed an automated learning-based order admission framework that can be embedded into an enterprise environment to provide real-time admission decisions for new orders. The framework consists of three classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Bayesian Probabilistic Model (BPM). The classifiers are trained by history orders and used to predict completion status for new orders. A decision integration technique is implemented to combine the results of the classifiers and predict due dates. Experimental results derived using real factory data from a leading print service provider and Weka open-source software show that the order completion status prediction accuracy is significantly improved by the decision integration strategy.

This FKP authentication system involves all basic processes like pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. This feature extraction is done by Gabor filter for extracting the important features form the FKP dataset. The query FKP Gabor features are matched and compared with the enrolled template using Hamming distance [HD].

The main aim of this paper is to utilize the ability of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in pattern recognition and classifying with Hamming distance which helps to improve the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR).

This adaptive binding is mediated by structural diversity in the six complementary determining region (CDR) loops (H1, H2, H3, L1, L2 and L3), which also makes accurate structural modeling of CDRs challenging. Both homology and de novo modeling approaches have been used; to date, the former has achieved greater accuracy for the non-H3 loops. The homology modeling of non-H3 CDRs is more accurate because non-H3 CDR loops of the same length and type can be grouped into a few structural clusters. Most antibody-modeling suites utilize homology modeling for the non-H3 CDRs, differing only in the alignment algorithm and how/if they utilize structural clusters. While RosettaAntibody and SAbPred do not explicitly assign query CDR sequences to clusters, two other approaches, PIGS and Kotai Antibody Builder, utilize sequence-based rules to assign CDR sequences to clusters. While the manually curated sequence rules can identify better structural templates, because their curation requires extensive literature search and human effort, they lag behind the deposition of new antibody structures and are infrequently updated. In this study, we propose a machine learning approach (Gradient Boosting Machine [GBM]) to learn the structural clusters of non-H3 CDRs from sequence alone. The GBM method simplifies feature selection and can easily integrate new data, compared to manual sequence rule curation. We compare the classification results using the GBM method to that of RosettaAntibody in a 3-repeat 10-fold cross-validation (CV) scheme on the cluster-annotated antibody database PyIgClassify and we observe an improvement in the classification accuracy of the concerned loops from 84.5% \u00b1 0.24% to 88.16% \u00b1 0.056%. The GBM models reduce the errors in specific cluster membership misclassifications when the involved clusters have relatively abundant data.

The aims of this study were to catalog protein-coding sequence variations (CVs) occurring in genetic variation databases and to use bioinformatic programs to analyze CVs. In addition, we aim to provide insight into the functionality of the reference databases. ::: ::: ::: Methodology and Findings ::: To catalog CVs on a genome-wide scale with regard to protein function and disease, we investigated three representative databases; the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms database (dbSNP), and the Haplotype Map (HapMap). Using these three databases, we analyzed CVs at the protein function level with bioinformatic programs. We proposed a combinatorial approach using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to increase the performance of the prediction programs. By cataloging the coding sequence variations using these databases, we found that 4.36% of CVs from HGMD are concurrently registered in dbSNP (8.11% of CVs from dbSNP are concurrent in HGMD). The pattern of substitutions and functional consequences predicted by three bioinformatic programs was significantly different among concurrent CVs, and CVs occurring solely in HGMD or in dbSNP. The experimental results showed that the proposed SVM combination noticeably outperformed the individual prediction programs. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: This is the first study to compare human sequence variations in HGMD, dbSNP and HapMap at the genome-wide level. We found that a significant proportion of CVs in HGMD and dbSNP overlap, and we emphasize the need to use caution when interpreting the phenotypic relevance of these concurrent CVs. Combining bioinformatic programs can be helpful in predicting the functional consequences of CVs because it improved the performance of functional predictions.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2570488", "pubmed_id": "18974781", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0003575", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2059579975,2802455838", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10805017", "26486162", "19313549", "7970691", "518262", "22151499", "11343725", "10814562", "19822396", "24172241", "21928709", "32938090", "1172309", "322133", "33969646", "13209203", "18011632", "7621531", "30709628", "12508714", "35667211", "23077947", "44410674", "40833793", "32514582", "4426787", "57906523", "35388307", "5893241", "6397956", "22350533", "1800819", "30541833", "12907264", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["20096513", "4504395", "59467237", "14273197", "23087243", "1257650", "28205075"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16121672"}

It shifts the representation of a meaning of the texts from words that can be ambiguous to concepts with predefined semantics. With this new representation, the similarity function is derived from data using a modification of the dynamic rule-based similarity model, which is adjusted to the unsupervised case. The adjustment is based on a novel notion of an information bireduct having its origin in the theory of rough sets. This extension of classical information reducts is used in order to find diverse sets of reference documents described by diverse sets of reference concepts that determine different aspects of the similarity.

The proposed technique is able to recognize M-QAM, M-ASK, and M-PSK modulation scheme in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. As the constellation points form clusters in the I-Q plane, the order of the modulation can be obtained by estimating the correct number of clusters, which is calculated by OPTICS algorithm. The least square error has been calculated using linear regression from the obtained constellation points, to identify either ASK or PSK and QAM. The error is least for ASK which differentiates ASK from PSK and QAM. To identify between the PSK and QAM, k-means clustering is employed to find the number of centroids equal to order of modulation estimated by OPTICS. With the difference in maximum and minimum absolute value of the centroids, PSK or QAM is recognized. The proposed method shows an improvement in the classification accuracy which reaches 100% using 1024 symbols at 20dB compared to 98.89%, 98.05%, and 98% when using more complex classifiers like Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes Classifier, KNN respectively. The method used is unsupervised whereas most of the methods in the literature require training phase to set the thresholds or weights for final model to detect modulation type. This algorithm is also implemented in LabVIEW, and tested on real-time signals. An intelligent system is made which does not require any knowledge of symbol rate, carrier frequency, and any training phase to set thresholds, and detects the type of modulation blindly in real time. Modulated RF signals are generated by NI PXIe-5673 (RF transmitter). NI PXI 5600 is used to downconvert RF signal and NI PXI-5142 (100 MS/s OSP digitizer) is used to sample the downverted signal.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2017.07.053", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Our model adds cognitive mechanisms to the SRN, for which we had found evidence in the structured interviews given to subjects (2001a,c). Subjects had verbalized repetitions of circle flashes, symmetries within each sequence and that each sequence had the basic structure ABCBA. The interview also revealed that they made analogies between the sequences they had experienced in training, and we hypothesized that this may have helped them to generalize to the novel sequences on which they were tested. Each cognitive mechanism was implemented as an autonomous agent and was assigned a certain probability of being carried out, e.g. 14.29 percent of the subjects verbalized symmetries, hence p=.1429. The other probabilities can be found in (2001c).

Specifically, the center loss simultaneously learns a center for deep features of each class and penalizes the distances between the deep features and their corresponding class centers. More importantly, we prove that the proposed center loss function is trainable and easy to optimize in the CNNs. With the joint supervision of softmax loss and center loss, we can train a robust CNNs to obtain the deep features with the two key learning objectives, inter-class dispension and intra-class compactness as much as possible, which are very essential to face recognition.

This paper presents a framework using the Tree-Augmented Bayesian Networks (TAN) which performs multi-classification based on the theory of learning Bayesian Networks and using improved feature vector representation of (Ding et al., 2001).4 In order to enhance TAN's performance, pre-processing of data is done by feature discretization and post-processing is done by using Mean Probability Voting (MPV) scheme. The advantage of using Bayesian approach over other learning methods is that the network structure is intuitive. In addition, one can read off the TAN structure probabilities to determine the significance of each feature (say, hydrophobicity) for each class, which helps to further understand the complexity in protein structure. The experiments on the datasets used in three prominent recent works show that our approach is more accurate than other discriminative methods.

If a pixel is detected as a corrupted pixel, the noise-free reduction median filter will be triggered to replace it. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. Then, to improve the quality of the restored image, a decision impulse filter is put to work in the second-pass filtering procedure. As for the noise suppressing both fixed-valued and random-valued impulses without degrading the quality of the fine details, the results of our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms earlier median-based filters in the literature.

It allows us to learn a category transformation and an ELM classifier with random projection by minimizing the l_(2,1)-norm of the network output weights and the learning error simultaneously. The unlabeled target data, as useful knowledge, is also integrated as a fidelity term to guarantee the stability during cross domain learning. It minimizes the matching error between the learned classifier and a base classifier, such that many existing classifiers can be readily incorporated as base classifiers. The network output weights cannot only be analytically determined, but also transferrable. Additionally, a manifold regularization with Laplacian graph is incorporated, such that it is beneficial to semi-supervised learning.

This is the usefulness of defect prediction; defect prediction streamline testing efforts and reduce the development cost of software when as stated above it is detected at the early stages. An important step to building effective predictive models is to apply one or more sampling techniques. A model is claimed to be effective if it is able to correctly classify defective and non-defective modules as accurately as possible. In this paper we considered the outcome of data preprocessing by filtering and compared the performance with non-pre-processing original dataset. We compared the performance of the four different K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN-LWL, Kstar, IBK, IB1 classifiers) with Non Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE), Random Tree and Random Forest. We observed that our Multi-level data pre-processing; which includes double attribute selection and tripartite instance filtering enhanced the defect prediction results. We also observed that these two filtering methods improved performance of the prediction results independently; by using attribute selection only and resampling filtering. The excellent performance achieved could be attributed to the removal of irrelevant attributes by dimension reduction and Resampling also handled the problem of class imbalanced. These together led to the improved performance competences of the classifiers considered. NNGE as its name implies avoided generalization of some of the datasets; those with instances above 2,000; (JM1=10,885 and KC1=2,109) using pre-processing, this may be due to conflicting instances.

On language and image classification tasks, Transfer Neural AutoML reduces convergence time over single-task training by over an order of magnitude on many tasks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.02780", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NeurIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2892366900,2951587765", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["15700257", "11688126", "3356163", "632197", "743641", "1740355", "12713052", "195346727", "12227989", "40430109", "3638969", "16447573", "5259564", "119190", "7044373", "29535948", "24994970", "5044808", "91185674", "6383532", "641039", "6719686", "3503426", "8791227", "319311", "19115634", "16046818", "3625614", "28695052", "12392038", "2407601", "11209971", "25940328", "1428702", "196158220", "60972899", "206594692", "12670695", "207155218", "5808102", "17797070", "1428702", "7105713", "990233", "206593880"], "inbound_citations": ["214743411", "201695095", "208211219", "204734219", "201646121", "59599816", "126180710", "208016466", "199405568", "62903267", "208268598", "53109768", "210925919", "204402527", "58014197", "197935394", "195068872", "162183747"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52192622"}

We first label a few positive and negative samples, train the classifier by the online SSSM Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine learning and these labelled samples, and then locate the position of the object from the next frame according to the trained classifier. In order to adapt more of the new samples, we need to update the classifier by finding new samples with high confident value obtained by the trained classifier and add them into the online SSSM. Finally we also update the object model by the online incremental PCA Principal Component Analysis because of background clutter, heavy occlusion and complicated object appearance changes. Compared with the basic mean shift tracking and the ensemble tracking method, experimental results show that our tracking method is able to effectively handle heavy occlusion and background clutter in some challenge videos including some thermal videos.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/cait-2016-0030", "venue": null, "journal": "Cybernetics and Information Technologies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2462104633", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1592336", "60977545", "10342219", "12873582", "122842678", "62154763"], "inbound_citations": ["65185950"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52222018"}

The complexity of Arabic poses special challenges to researchers of Arabic NER, which is essential for both monolingual and multilingual applications. We used the hybrid approach to develop an Arabic NER system that is capable of recognizing 11 types of Arabic named entities: Person, Location, Organization, Date, Time, Price, Measurement, Percent, Phone Number, ISBN and File Name. Extensive experiments were conducted using decision trees, Support Vector Machines and logistic regression classifiers to evaluate the system performance. The empirical results indicate that the hybrid approach outperforms both the rule-based and the ML-based approaches when they are processed independently.

Rather than abstracting from the biological substrate as was sought by the \u201cinformation processing\u201d paradigms of the 1970s, connectionism, as it has come to be called, embraced it. An immediate appeal of the connectionist agenda was its aim: to construct at the algorithmic level models of cognition that were compatible with their implementation in the biological substrate. ::: ::: The PDP group argued that this could be achieved by turning to networks of artificial neurons, originally introduced by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) which the group showed were able to provide insights into a wide range of psychological domains, from categorization, to perception, to memory, to language. This work built on an earlier formulation by Rosenblatt (1958) who introduced a simple type of feed-forward neural network called the perceptron. Perceptrons were limited to solving simple linearly-separable problems and although networks composed of perceptrons were known to be able to compute any Boolean function (including XOR, Minsky and Papert, 1969), there was no effective way of training such networks. In 1986, Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams introduced the back-propagation algorithm, providing an effective way of training multi-layered neural networks, which could easily learn non linearly-separable functions. In addition to providing the field with an effective learning algorithm, the PDP group published a series of demonstrations of how long standing questions in cognitive psychology could be elegantly solved using simple learning rules, distributed representations, and interactive processing. ::: ::: To take a classic example, consider the word-superiority effect, in which people can detect letters within a word faster than individual letters or letters within a non-word (Reicher, 1969). This result is difficult to square with serial \u201cinformation-processing\u201d theories of cognition that were dominant at the time (how could someone recognize \u201cR\u201d before \u201cFRIEND\u201d if recognizing the word required recognizing the letters?). Accounting for such findings demanded a framework which could naturally accommodate interactive processes within a bidirectional flow of information. The so-called \u201cInteractive-activation model\u201d (McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981) provided just such a framework. ::: ::: The connectionist paradigm was not without its critics. The principal critiques can be divided into three classes. First, some neuroscientists (Crick, 1989) questioned the biological plausibility of backpropagation, when they failed to observe experimentally complex and differentiated back-propagating signals that are required to learn in multi-layered neural networks. A second critique concerned stability-plasticity of the learned representations in these models. Some phenomena require the ability to rapidly learn new information, but sometimes newly learned knowledge overwrites previously learned information (catastrophic interference; McCloskey and Cohen, 1989). Third, representing spatial and temporal invariance\u2014something that apparently came easily to people\u2014was difficult for models, e.g., recognizing that the letter \u201cT\u201d in \u201cTOM\u201d was the \u201csame\u201d as the \u201cT\u201d in \u201cPOT.\u201d This invariance problem was typically solved by multiplying a large number of hard-wired units that were space- or time-locked (see e.g., McClelland and Elman, 1986). Finally, critics pointed out that the networks were incapable of learning true rules on which a number of human behavioral, namely language-learning was thought to depend (e.g., Marcus, 2003; cf. Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988; Seidenberg, 1999). ::: ::: The connectionist approach has embraced these challenges: Although some connectionist models continue to rely on backpropagation, others have moved to more biologically realistic learning rules (Giese and Poggio, 2003; Masquelier and Thorpe, 2007). Far from being a critical flaw of connectionism, the phenomenon of catastrophic interference (Mermillod et al., 2013) proved to be a feature that led to the development of complementary learning systems (McClelland et al., 1995). ::: ::: Progress has also been made on the invariance problem. For example, within the speech domain representing the similarity between similar speech sounds regardless of their location within a word has been addressed in the past by Grossberg and Myers (2000) and Norris (1994) and this issue presents a new more streamlined and computationally efficient model (Hannagan et al., 2013). An especially powerful approach to solving the location invariance problem in the visual domain is presented by Di Bono and Zorzi (2013), also in this issue. ::: ::: A key challenge for connectionism is to explain the learning of abstract structural representations. The use of recurrent networks (Elman, 1990; Dominey, 2013) and self-organizing maps, has captured important aspects of language learning (e.g., Mayor and Plunkett, 2010; Li and Zhao, 2013), while work on deep learning (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006) has made it possible to model the emergence of structured and abstract representations within multi-layered hierarchical networks (Zorzi et al., 2013). The work on verbal analogies by Kollias and McClelland (2013) continues to address the challenges of modeling more abstract representations, but truly understanding how neural architectures give rise to symbolic cognition is a gap that remains. Although learning and representing formal language rules may not be completely outside of the abilities of neural networks (e.g., Chang, 2009), it seems clear that understanding human cognition requires understanding how we solve these symbolic problems (Clark and Karmiloff-Smith, 1993; Lupyan, 2013). Future generations of connectionist modelers may wish to fill this gap and in so doing provide a fuller picture of how neural networks give rise to intelligence of the sort enables us to ponder the very workings of our cognition.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3941029", "pubmed_id": "24624113", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00187", "venue": "Front.

Computational models of the underlying physical processes, such as classical N-body simulations, are extremely resource intensive, as they track the action of gravity in an expanding universe using billions of particles as tracers of the cosmic matter distribution. Therefore, upcoming cosmology experiments will face a computational bottleneck that may limit the exploitation of their full scientific potential. To address this challenge, we demonstrate the application of a machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn models that can efficiently generate new, physically realistic realizations of the cosmic web. Our training set is a small, representative sample of 2D image snapshots from N-body simulations of size 500 and 100 Mpc. We show that the GAN-generated samples are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to the originals. For the larger boxes of size 500 Mpc, it is very difficult to distinguish them visually. The agreement of the power spectrum $P_k$ is 1-2\\% for most of the range, between $k=0.06$ and $k=0.4$. An important advantage of generating cosmic web realizations with a GAN is the considerable gains in terms of computation time. Each new sample generated by a GAN takes a fraction of a second, compared to the many hours needed by traditional N-body techniques. We anticipate that the use of generative models such as GANs will therefore play an important role in providing extremely fast and precise simulations of cosmic web in the era of large cosmological surveys, such as Euclid and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1801.09070", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/s40668-018-0026-4", "venue": "Rodriguez, A.C., Kacprzak, T., Lucchi, A. et al.

It is also important in several scenarios including human disease and drug discovery. In this age of rapid and affordable biological sequencing, the number of sequences accumulating in databases is rising with an increasing rate. This presents many challenges for biologists and computer scientists alike. In order to make sense of this huge quantity of data, these sequences should be annotated with functional properties. UniProtKB consists of two components: i) the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database containing protein sequences with reliable information manually reviewed by expert bio-curators and ii) the UniProtKB/TrEMBL database that is used for storing and processing the unknown sequences. Hence, for all proteins we have available the sequence along with few more information such as the taxon and some structural domains. Pairwise similarity can be defined and computed on proteins based on such attributes. Other important attributes, while present for proteins in Swiss-Prot, are often missing for proteins in TrEMBL, such as their function and cellular localization. The enormous number of protein sequences now in TrEMBL calls for rapid procedures to annotate them automatically. In this work, we present DistNBLP, a novel Distributed Neighborhood-Based Label Propagation approach for large-scale annotation of proteins. To do this, the functional annotations of reviewed proteins are used to predict those of non-reviewed proteins using label propagation on a graph representation of the protein database.

This situation becomes a challenge when huge amounts of data are processed to extract knowledge because the data mining techniques are not adapted to the new space and time requirements. Furthermore, real-world data applications usually present a class distribution where the samples that belong to one class, which is precisely the main interest, are hugely outnumbered by the samples of the other classes. This circumstance, known as the class imbalance problem, complicates the learning process as the standard learning techniques do not correctly address this situation.In this work, we analyse the performance of several techniques used to deal with imbalanced datasets in the big data scenario using the Random Forest classifier. Specifically, oversampling, undersampling and cost-sensitive learning have been adapted to big data using MapReduce so that these techniques are able to manage datasets as large as needed providing the necessary support to correctly identify the underrepresented class. The Random Forest classifier provides a solid basis for the comparison because of its performance, robustness and versatility.An experimental study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the diverse algorithms considered. The results obtained show that there is not an approach to imbalanced big data classification that outperforms the others for all the data considered when using Random Forest. Moreover, even for the same type of problem, the best performing method is dependent on the number of mappers selected to run the experiments. In most of the cases, when the number of splits is increased, an improvement in the running times can be observed, however, this progress in times is obtained at the expense of a slight drop in the accuracy performance obtained. This decrement in the performance is related to the lack of density problem, which is evaluated in this work from the imbalanced data point of view, as this issue degrades the performance of classifiers in the imbalanced scenario more severely than in standard learning.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2014.03.043", "venue": "Inf.

In offline stage, the principal curve was introduced to construct the confidence region, where over-sampling was achieved for minor class to construct the equilibrium sample set which was consistent with the sample distribution trend, and then the initial model was established.

This method is based on Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) and Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO).

An important problem is, in a given social media message, detecting which word can be POI. This process of retrieving points of interest from a text is called POI extraction. In this work, we propose methods to extract POIs from microblogs. We explore both machine learning and artificial neural network based approaches.

The first model is the Neural Associative Memory (NAM) model [1] and the second the Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) model [2]. The latter is embedded in a commercial product. Both models provide iterative training procedures that select prototypes from the initial training set. Both models allow supervised learning of pattern categories separated by arbitrary complex boundaries. NAM generates a piecewise linear approximation of the class boundaries, RCE a pieceswise approximation with hyperspherical surfaces. Training is an incremental process, as prototypes are iteratively inserted or deleted from the network. Thus, the training process is much faster than for other comparable interpolative neural approaches, e.g. LVQ. No a priori knowledge of data distribution is necessary, as the correct amount of prototypes for each class is determined by the training procedures of NAM and RCE. Dynamic LVQ techniques also generate a sufficient number of prototypes for each class, but they do not optimize the number. All these vector quantizing approaches are very transparent and allow the easy interpretation of the weight vectors. RCE and NAM model both provide rapid training and recall, which makes them excellent candidates as classifiers in a generic inspection system for visual industrial quality control. In the context of the research project SIOB such a system is developed and implementations of NAM and RCE are tested as modules here. To assess the superior model qualitative and quantitative comparison is undertaken. Both models start with an initial empty set of prototypes. Driven by the objective to correctly classify the training patterns, prototypes are iteratively selected from these patterns. If the existing prototypes give correct classification no insertion takes place, else a new prototype is stored. There are two main differences between the models. The NAM conducts an unrestricted competition, whereas the RCE has an radius of influence for each prototype. The NAM eliminates redundant prototypes, whereas RCE only adjusts the respective radii of influence. In the case of misclassification both models store a new prototype, RCE adjusts the according radii of influence. The unrestricted competition of the NAM can cause an overfitting to the training set. Thus, in this work the NAM model was extended introducing thresholds of similarity for training and recall. This approach was validated with data from the SIOB project. Based on this qualitative comparison the authors will in future work elaborate a quantitative comparison using SIOB feature data obtained from an inspection line.

In particular, the top-N Relative Ranges of Joint Relative Distances (RRJRD) are proposed to determine which joints should be connected in the resulting graph because these measures indicate the normalized activity levels among the joint pairs. Different motion segments may thus result in different graph structures so the construction of the graphs is made adaptively to the characteristics of these segments and is able to represent a meaningful spatial structure. Second, combining with proposed joint covariance descriptor with temporal pyramid, we give the Active Joint Relationship Graph Kernel (AJRGK) to measure the spatio-temporal consistency between two consecutive motion segments.

Efforts in this domain are mainly oriented to the development of prediction models featuring with ever-growing levels of performances and/or computational efficiency. After the swerve towards Artificial Intelligence that gradually took place in the modeling sphere of traffic forecasting, predictive schemes have ever since adopted all the benefits of applied machine learning, but have also incurred some caveats. The adoption of highly complex, black-box models has subtracted comprehensibility to forecasts: even though they perform better, they are more obscure to ITS practitioners, which hinders their practicality. In this paper we propose the adoption of explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) tools that are currently being used in other domains, in order to extract further knowledge from black-box traffic forecasting models. In particular we showcase the utility of xAI to unveil the knowledge extracted by Random Forests and Recurrent Neural Networks when predicting real traffic.

Encryption has laid itself as the traditional method to transmit information in secrecy. Although strong encryption is a very secure approach for transmitting information, it can be easily identified that transmitted information is encrypted. Once the information is identified as encrypted, an intruder can block the encrypted transmission. In contrast, Steganography is a viable option to hide information in transmission without being identified. It provides a blanket that hides encrypted information. Thus, it becomes essential to develop mechanisms that reveal if the communicated information has any embedded data. ::: Steganalysis is the art of detecting invisible communication and is a very challenging field due to different types of media and embedding techniques involved. Existing research in Steganalysis has focused on developing individual stego detection algorithms for a particular media type or for a particular embedding technique. In this dissertation we are proposing to develop a unified Steganalyzer that can not only work with different media types such as images and audio, but further is capable of providing improved accuracy in stego detection through the use of multiple algorithms. Our proposed system integrates different steganalysis techniques in a reliable Steganalyzer by using a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA). The SOA architecture not only allows for concurrent processing to speed up the system, but also provides higher reliability than those reported in the existing literature because multiple stego detection algorithms are incorporated simultaneously. Furthermore, the extendable nature of the SOA implementation allows for easy addition of new Steganalysis algorithms to the system in terms of services. ::: The universal steganalysis technique proposed in this dissertation involves two processes; feature extraction and feature classification. An improved 2D Mel-Cepstrum implementation is used for wav files feature extraction. Intra-blocks technique is used for jpeg images feature extraction. The feature classification process is implemented using three different classifiers; neural network classifier, Support Vector Machines classifier, and AdaBoost classifier. The unified steganalyzer is tested for jpeg images and wav audio files. The accuracy of classification ranges from 90.0% to 99.9% depending on the object type and the feature extraction method. In particular, an enhancement of 2D Mel-Cepstrum implementation is introduced that achieves an accuracy of 99.9%. This is significantly better result than the average detection accuracy of 89.9% to 96.7% reported by Liu [1]. Finally, an extensible classifier is introduced that allows adding detection of new embedding techniques to the currently supported embedding techniques, so that the framework will maintain its reliability even if new embedding techniques are introduced.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5120/3297-4503", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2121898573", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5875811", "29664844", "9653620", "1106572", "59768602", "8657249", "43436689", "12027819", "15125280", "14295442", "10164784", "7935805", "6051454", "14768300", "15334578", "167117358", "13181200", "14077454", "6644398"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12513750"}

Thus, unlike a ligand-based approach, this form of drug design does not require prior knowledge of inhibitors. In this paper, the three-dimensional structure of a receptor is used indirectly, in the form of molecular interaction fields of the receptor and small molecules (or probes). In addition, we also use domain-specific constraints encoding basic geometric and pharmacological requirements imposed by the target. Interaction energies of one or more targets with a set of probes are used to identify three-dimensional constraints that occur in many--preferably all--targets. In a graph-theoretic sense, the constraints are (small, fixed-size) cliques in graphs with labelled vertices representing probe-specific points of high interaction energy, and edges between a pair of vertices are labelled by the three-dimensional distance between the corresponding points of interaction. Our interest is in the discovery of frequent cliques that satisfy domain-specific constraints. In the paper, the discovery of such patterns is done using an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) engine. The case for the use of ILP stems primarily from the explicit ways of incorporating domain-constraints, but any other technique capable of discovering frequent cliques from data can be used with some additional effort. The frequent cliques discovered are used to hypothesize pharmacophore-like structures on potential ligands. We test the utility of this approach by conducting a case study on the discovery of anti-malarials. Specifically, we test the approach on proteins belonging to the class of aspartic proteases. We are particularly interested in plasmepsin II, which is an enzyme in the haemoglobin degradation pathway of Plasmodium falciparum. We assess the pharmacophore-like constraints using: (a) a database of known inhibitors and non-inhibitors of aspartic proteases; and (b) a database of decoys that are physico-chemically similar to the aspartic proteases. Our results suggest that the approach could be used to obtain pharmacophores with good precision and recall for aspartic proteases.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-016-5556-x", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2334846969", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3131928", "22896416", "83610811", "94999655", "53361", "21070600", "1193179", "92965202", "4049612", "215200271", "22194699", "1268789", "42346461", "16681789", "197135922", "18628984", "9141928", "3646491", "4017453", "607255", "41497345", "196932434", "672579", "11184802", "119870011", "12643399", "4857085", "16712566", "40611808", "3490719", "17897953", "12826032", "14613585", "42195256"], "inbound_citations": ["60441719", "2181958"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5797039"}

In the case of Brazil, one of the greatest factors that favours rapid mosquito reproduction is the presence of stagnated water in the environment. This could be in the form of non-flowing water filled in tanks, barrels, discarded tires, and many other containers situated in human dwellings. After the ZIKV outbreak from 2015, the environmental agency in Brazil have intensively been engaged with routine surveillance of water bodies present in households and the environment to destroy mosquito breeding hotspots as public health measure to prevent vector-to-human transmission of ZIKV.

The ophthalmologists have become overloaded, so that there is a need for an automated diagnostic/referral system. In this paper a referral system for the hard exudates in the eye-fundus images has been presented. The proposed referral system works by combining different techniques like Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), K-means Clustering, Visual Dictionaries and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system was also tested with Back Propagation Neural Network as a classifier. To test the performance of the system four fundus image databases were used. One publicly available image database was used to compare the performance of the system to the existing systems. To test the general performance of the system when the images are taken under different conditions and come from different sources, three other fundus image databases were mixed. The evaluation of the system was also performed on different sizes of the visual dictionaries. When using only one fundus image database the area under the curve (AUC) of maximum 0.9702 (97.02%) was achieved with accuracy of 95.02%.

Court players are detected in the images broadcasted via television stations. In them, at any point of time, the view is from only one camera. This makes the detection process much more difficult. The player detection is based on the mixture of non-oriented pictorial structures. The detection of body parts is performed by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The results of these detections are combined together with constraints on their locations, which specify the position of one body part with respect to the parent body part. In order to train the whole model, we used a latent form of SVM called the latent SVM (LSVM). Such approach generated the statistical accuracy of about 82 %, which represents one of the best results in basketball player detection framework. Beside players, the algorithm detected a certain number of false positive objects. These are mostly people from the audience and the referees as well. This paper contains a simple and robust solution to remove them all, based on the play court boundaries and the histogram comparison. Separating players in different teams is done by k-means clustering. The inputs to this algorithm are saturation histograms calculated on the jerseys. A spatial transformation is determined by the detected play court boundaries and the actual court measures. Using this transformation, points representing the location of detected players in TV images are mapped to the actual location of players on the court, which was the main goal of our research. The proposed solution is sound and efficient. In addition, it is backed up by the experimental results obtained using the model of the actual footage of basketball games.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-013-1580-z", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2007345100", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10672930", "8371404", "14177182", "4473240", "14846263", "9320620", "6525026", "33520001", "2424804", "11200035", "14834952", "15229206", "3198903", "2277383", "5745749", "14904115", "1351024", "288876", "14144539", "17348423", "8614721", "15296463", "11382178", "9425053", "17415939", "13298437", "10627743", "108974614", "27350524", "18889376", "42281583", "7564408", "17239864", "17342342", "3813357"], "inbound_citations": ["8593765", "29298672"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3192155"}

However, manual assessment is costly and inefficient. Novel approaches using machine learning and text mining to assess the adequacy of radiology order information could reduce the costs and improve efficiency. We aimed to test the application of machine learning algorithms to identify radiology orders with adequate/inadequate information. Methods: We extracted 1,967 electronic chest computed tomography (CT) orders at an academic tertiary hospital during January 2014, and manually classified them into containing adequate or inadequate information based on the American College of Radiology guidelines. We used text mining (text parsing and vectorization) and machine learning (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree classifiers) to automate order adequacy classification, and evaluated the system performance against the manual review. Results: Surprisingly, only 30.6% of orders had adequate information when evaluated manually. Non-resident physicians provided the least number of adequate order information (26.7%). Classifiers achieved high classification accuracy. Naive Bayes classifier performed slightly better overall (Accuracy= .9) than Support Vector Machines (Accuracy= .89) and Decision Trees (J48, Accuracy= .85).

We propose in this paper an approach for selecting, integrating, and mining LOD with the goal of discovering genes responsible for a disease. The selection step relies on a set of choices made by a domain expert to isolate relevant pieces of LOD. Because these pieces are potentially not linked, an integration step is required to connect unlinked pieces. The resulting graph is subsequently mined using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that presents two main advantages. First, the input format compliant with ILP is close to the format of LOD. Second, domain knowledge can be added to this input and considered by ILP. We have implemented and applied this approach to the characterization of genes responsible for intellectual disability.

Underestimating the capital cost in mining projects may postpone the construction and accordingly the production phases. In addition, overestimating the capital cost may decrease value of the project. Currently available capital cost estimation models cannot predict mining CAPEX in a reliable range of error. Since, current models are not considering all effective parameters other than capacity, annual ore production and waste stripping, they cannot turn out to a reliable result, although they can be used for a rough estimation of CAPEX. In this paper, to estimate the capital cost of mining projects, a model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is developed. To establish this model the technical and economic data of 52 open pit porphyry copper mines were collected. Robust design of this model led to negligible error of estimation of CAPEX anticipation procedure.

Applications such as financial transactions, law enforcement or network management security are already benefitting from this technology. Among the different biometric modalities, speaker verification represents an accurate and efficient way of authenticating a person's identity by analyzing his/her voice. This identification method is especially suitable in real-life scenarios or when a remote recognition over the phone is required. The processing of a signal of voice, in order to extract its unique features, that allows distinguishing an individual to confirm or deny his/her identity is, usually, a process characterized by a high computational cost. This complexity imposes that many systems, based on microprocessor clocked at hundreds of MHz, are unable to process samples of voice in real-time. This drawback has an important effect, since in general, the response time needed by the biometric system affects its acceptability by users. The design based on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) is a suited way to implement systems that require a high computational capability and the resolution of algorithms in real-time. Besides, these devices allow the design of complex digital systems with outstanding performance in terms of execution time. This paper presents the implementation of a MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients)--SVM (Support Vector Machine) speaker verification system based on a low-cost FPGA.

Loadability limits are critical points of particular interest in voltage stability assessment, indicating how much a system can be stressed from a given state before reaching instability. Thus estimating the loadability margin of a power system is essential in the real time voltage stability assessment. A new methodology is developed based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) which is the most common application form of Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed SVR methodology can successfully estimate the loadability margin under normal operating conditions and different loading directions. SVR has the feature of minimizing the generalization error in achieving the generalized network over the other mapping methods. In this paper, the SVR input vector is in the form of real and reactive power load, while the target vector is lambda (loading margin). To reduce both mean square error and prediction time in SVR, the kernel type and SVR parameters are chosen determined by using grid search based on 10-fold cross-validation method for the best SVR network. The results of SVRs (nu-SVR and epsilon-SVR) are compared with RBF neural networks and validated in the IEEE 30 bus system and IEEE 118 bus system at different operating scenarios.

To cope with the imperfection of user-captured models such as model noise and occlusion, we propose a cross-domain shape retrieval framework, which minimizes the potential function of a Conditional Random Field to efficiently generate the retrieval scores. In particular, the potential function consists of two critical components: one unary potential term provides robust cross-domain partial matching and the other pairwise potential term embeds spatial structures to alleviate the instability from model noise. Both potential components are efficiently estimated using random forests with 3D local features, forming a Regression Tree Field framework.

Real-time processing is achieved by combining Histogram of Gradients descriptors with linear kernel Support Vector Machines. Following this method, AU intensity detection models are built and validated through the DISFA database, outperforming previous approaches without real-time capabilities. An in-depth evaluation through three different databases (DISFA, BP4D and UNBC Shoulder-Pain) further demonstrates that the proposed method generalizes well across datasets.

It is more reasonable to assume each class lies on a separate manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction for multi-manifold learning. To address the issue of label insufficiency under mulit-manifold assumption, we propose to solve three challenging problems: cluster unlabeled samples into different manifolds by sparse manifold clustering even when they are close to each other; predict the label of image sets instead of a single sample by calculating manifold to manifold distance; construct three kinds of graphs for each manifold to exploit more information from unlabeled samples. During the investigation, we are able to demonstrate that most existing dimension reduction methods based on manifold learning can be viewed as special cases of the proposed.

When using these systems, it is typically assumed that sufficient human expertise is at hand to rule out irrelevant background information. Such irrelevant information can, and typically does, hinder an ILP system's search for good models. Here, we provide evidence that if expertise is available that can provide a partial-ordering on sets of background predicates in terms of relevance to the analysis task, then this can be used to good effect by an ILP system. In particular, using data from biochemical domains, we investigate an incremental strategy of including sets of predicates in decreasing order of relevance. Results obtained suggest that: (a) the incremental approach identifies, in substantially less time, a model that is comparable in predictive accuracy to that obtained with all background information in place; and (b) the incremental approach using the relevance ordering performs better than one that does not (that is, one that adds sets of predicates randomly). For a practitioner concerned with use of ILP, the implication of these findings are two-fold: (1) when not all background information can be used at once (either due to limitations of the ILP system, or the nature of the domain) expert assessment of the relevance of background predicates can assist substantially in the construction of good models; and (2) good \"first-cut\" results can be obtained quickly by a simple exclusion of information known to be less relevant.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2116908954", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45058654", "26736242", "60993494", "15956928", "19990980", "52866062", "118927641", "16848815", "16875156", "607255", "119870011", "12643399", "16721087", "9081115", "16914350", "39666367", "16455032", "9220714", "15982740", "2075186", "8863872", "57100530", "5899434"], "inbound_citations": ["53285062", "27331537", "5927433", "6106858", "14001646", "1081090", "49557240", "15796374", "2624560"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15126143"}

Implementing commonly used local contrast normalization and spatial pooling, we gradually enhance our network to be resilient to local variance resulting in a robust image representation for RGB-D image classification.

A computational approach to recover missing values in metabolomics and proteomics datasets is important. Most existing methods are designed under a particular assumption, either missing at random or under the detection limit. If the missing pattern deviates from the assumption, it may lead to biased results. Hence, we investigate the missing patterns in MS data and develop an omnibus approach GMSimpute, to allow effective imputation accommodating different missing patterns. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Three proteomics datasets and one metabolomics dataset indicate missing values could be a mixture of abundance-dependent and abundance-independent missingness. We assess the performance of GMSimpute using simulated data (with a wide range of 80 missing patterns) and metabolomics data from the TCGA breast cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma studies. Using Pearson correlation and normalized root mean square errors between the true and imputed abundance, we compare its performance to K-nearest neighbors (KNN) type approaches, Random Forest, GSimp, a model-based method implemented in DanteR and minimum values. The results indicate GMSimpute provides higher accuracy in imputation and exhibits stable performance across different missing patterns.

The wavelet coefficients were known to be located in high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N or SNR) scales and were obtained by the Wavelet Transform Correlation Filter Method (WTCFM). This method was applied to address the whole-body vibration signals. The WCFSE method was derived from the integration of the information entropy theory and WTCFM, and was applied to extract the WCFSE values of the vibration signals. Among the WCFSE values, the WFSE1 and WCFSE2 values on the scale 1 and 2 from the high band of vibration signal were believed to acceptably reflect the vibration feature and were selected to construct the eigenvectors of vibration signals as fault samples to establish the WCFSE-FSVM model. This model was applied to aeroengine whole-body vibration fault diagnosis. Through the diagnoses of four vibration fault modes and the comparison of the analysis results by four methods (SVM, FSVM, WESE-SVM, WCFSE-FSVM), it is shown that the WCFSE-FSVM method is characterized by higher learning ability, higher generalization ability and higher anti-noise ability than other methods in aeroengine whole-vibration fault analysis.

The difficulty in fully collecting the required information related to student\u2019s financial status and the imbalanced-data classification problem caused by the small proportion of poverty-stricken students among total students makes it a challenging problem. This problem results in a heavy workload for the college staff to identify poverty-stricken students, determine the amount of corresponding subsidy, and execute the supporting polices in an efficient way. Therefore, this paper attempts to address the above-mentioned challenges by proposing a smart campus system, which makes use of campus big data to identify poverty-stricken students and support the decision-making on the subsidy for them. The proposed system can also alert the counselors to provide psychological support for students in trouble. The major contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, in addition to the features of students\u2019 amount of consumption on campus and its statistical characteristics used in existing researches, this paper proposes new features that describe diversity of consumable commodities, preference of consumption location and price, and characteristics of students\u2019 campus activities. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of dataset imbalance, four imbalanced data processing methods (Subsampling, Resampling, Cost-sensitive learning and SMOTE) have been applied to produce four different experimental datasets, and five classification algorithms (Random Forest, J48, Naive Bayes, SMO, Logistic regression) have been used to train the classification model on each dataset. The experimental results indicate that the model based on Resampling and Random Forest achieves the best performance in F1-measure of poverty-stricken students, among the combinations of four imbalanced processing methods and five classification algorithms. In addition, a method of quantization of subsidies, and strategies of early warning and counseling for students are also described in this paper. A system was developed based on the above-mentioned methods, which meets the needs of individualized and diversified support for poverty-stricken students. The methods and the proposed system have been put into practice, and it is serving more than 17,000 students.

VIMs assisted by Pearson correlation through proximate, ultimate, and petrographic analyses indicated that volatile matter, carbon, vitrinite, and R max (coal rank parameters) are the most effective variables for the prediction of FSI. These important predictors have been used as inputs of RF model for the FSI prediction.

The method achieves an prediction with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values greater than 0.9 on three different datasets, and AUC of 0.892 by an independent test on the recently released Zika virus RNA dataset. These AUCs represent a consistent increase of >6% than the recently developed method CROSS trained by a shallow neural network. A further analysis on the 1000-Genome Project data showed that our predicted unpaired probability at mutations sites are highly correlated with the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of synonymous, non-synonymous mutations, and mutations in 3\u2019 and 5\u2019UTR with Pearson Correlation Coefficients all above 0.8. These PCCs are consistently higher than those generated by RNAplfold method. Moreover, an investigation over all human mRNA indicated a periodic distribution of the predicted unpaired probability on codons, and a decrease of paired probability in the boundary with 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions. These results highlighted TH-GRASP is effective to remove experimental noises and to have ability to make predictions on nucleotides with low or no coverage by fitting high-throughput genomic data for RNA secondary structure profiles, and also suggested that building model on high throughput experimental data might be a future direction to substitute analytical methods.

Many ensemble classifiers have been proposed [1,2] and two strategies exist to construct an ensemble: (1) a combination of different classifier algorithms and (2) a combination of variants of the same classifier. Benediktsson and Kanellopoulos [3], for example, used a neural network and a statistical classifier for combining synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral data. The two data sets undergo a separate classification and the individual outputs are combined by decision fusion, which can be defined as a strategy for combining information from different data sources. Waske and Benediktsson [4] use a decision fusion strategy that is based on support vector machines (SVMs) for the classification of multitemporal SAR data and multispectral imagery. However, most applications combine a set of independent variants of the same classifier, the so-called base classifier.

However, soil salinization deficiency, which is also a factor of grassland degradation, is rarely used in grassland degradation assessment in semiarid regions. We assessed grassland degradation by its quality, quantity, and spatial pattern over semiarid west Jilin, China. Considering soil salinization in west Jilin, electrical conductivity (EC) is used as an index with ANPP to assess grassland degradation. First, the spatial distribution of the grassland was measured with information mined from multi-temporal remote sensing images using an object-based image analysis combined with classification and decision tree methods. Second, with 166 field samples, we utilized the random forest (RF) algorithm as the variable selection and regression method for predicting EC and ANPP. Finally, we created a new grassland degradation model (GDM) based on ANPP and EC. The results showed the R2 (0.91) and RMSE (0.057 mS/cm) of the EC model were generally highest and lowest when the ntree was 400; the ANPP model was optimal (R2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 15.81 gC/m2) when the ntree was 600. Grassland area of west Jilin was 609.67 \u00d7 103 ha in 2017, there were 373.79 \u00d7 103 ha of degraded grassland, with 210.47 \u00d7 103 ha being intensively degraded. This paper surpasses past limitations of excessive reliance on vegetation index to construct a grassland degradation model which considers the characteristics of the study area and soil salinity.

In this paper, we propose the Style Separation and Synthesis Generative Adversarial Network (S3-GAN) to simultaneously implement style separation and style synthesis on object photographs of specific categories. Based on the assumption that the object photographs lie on a manifold, and the contents and styles are independent, we employ S3-GAN to build mappings between the manifold and a latent vector space for separating and synthesizing the contents and styles. The S3-GAN consists of an encoder network, a generator network, and an adversarial network. The encoder network performs style separation by mapping an object photograph to a latent vector. Two halves of the latent vector represent the content and style, respectively. The generator network performs style synthesis by taking a concatenated vector as input. The concatenated vector contains the style half vector of the style target image and the content half vector of the content target image. Once obtaining the images from the generator network, an adversarial network is imposed to generate more photo-realistic images. Experiments on CelebA and UT Zappos 50K datasets demonstrate that the S3-GAN has the capacity of style separation and synthesis simultaneously, and could capture various styles in a single model.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.02740", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3240508.3240524", "venue": "The 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia (ACM MM), 2018, pp. 183-191", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2895984841", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["712416", "51607084", "206597351", "5687613", "9334387", "54970", "8643626", "206593710", "5942", "5575601", "1033682", "10894094", "2201072", "6576859", "5808102", "980236", "8239952", "6628106", "207763512", "211227", "6635779", "18781152", "3327460", "34869018", "459456", "30484693", "12803511", "2202933", "35563", "11758569", "1563370", "12275803", "14124313", "3556146", "16728483", "1541706", "206595891", "27654042", "7698906", "19153102", "10585115", "5093704", "810708", "15876696", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["202719049", "195261309", "208075908", "204836982", "165163815", "202770906"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53035018"}

However, existing feature extractors are either stripe-based or dense-block-based, the fine details and coarse appearance are not well integrated. What is more, the metrics are generally learned independently from distance view or bilinear similarity view. Few works have exploited the mutual complementary effects of their combination. To address these issues, we propose a new feature representation termed enhanced Local Maximal Occurrence (eLOMO) which fuses a new overlapping-stripe-based descriptor with the Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO) extracted from dense blocks. Such integration makes eLOMO resemble the coarse-to-fine recognition mechanism of human vision system, thus it can provide a more discriminative descriptor for re-identification. Besides, we show the advantages of learning generalized similarity by combining the Mahalanobis distance and bilinear similarity together. Specifically, we derive a logistic metric learning method to jointly learn a distance metric and a bilinear similarity metric, which exploits both the distance and angle information from training data. Taking advantage of learning in the intra-class subspace, the proposed method can be solved efficiently by coordinate descent optimization.

Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is a highly contagious disease that is increasing in both geographic distribution and incidence, causing unusual mortality events (UME) and killing tens of thousands of individuals across multiple cetacean species worldwide since the late 1980s. The largest CeMV outbreak in the Southern Hemisphere reported to date occurred in Australia in 2013, where it was a major factor in a UME, killing mainly young Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus). Using cases (nonsurvivors) and controls (putative survivors) from the most affected population, we carried out a genome-wide association study to identify candidate genes for resistance and susceptibility to CeMV. The genomic data set consisted of 278,147,988 sequence reads and 35,493 high-quality SNPs genotyped across 38 individuals. Association analyses found highly significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies among cases and controls at 65 SNPs, and Random Forests conservatively identified eight as candidates. Annotation of these SNPs identified five candidate genes (MAPK8, FBXW11, INADL, ANK3 and ACOX3) with functions associated with stress, pain and immune responses. Our findings provide the first insights into the genetic basis of host defence to this highly contagious disease, enabling the development of an applied evolutionary framework to monitor CeMV resistance across cetacean species. Biomarkers could now be established to assess potential risk factors associated with these genes in other CeMV-affected cetacean populations and species.

Although multiple functional connectivity (FC) features such as low-order functional connectivity (LOFC) and high-order functional connectivity (HOFC) provide complementary knowledge to each other, it is still challenging to find interpretable LOFC and HOFC features for multi-center ASD diagnosis. To this end, we develop a novel interpretable feature learning method based on multi-output TSK fuzzy system (MO-TSK-FS) for multi-center ASD diagnosis. Specifically, both the LOFC and HOFC features are first mapped to a high-dimensional space using the premise part of MO-TSK-FS, which shares the common knowledge across multiple centers. Then, the mapped features are transformed to a low-dimensional feature space using a transformation matrix. A novel unsupervised learning problem is formulated to find the optimal transformation matrix. Finally, a multi-modality support vector classifier (M2SVC) is constructed for classification. The experimental results show that the proposed interpretable feature learning method for multi-center ASD classification can effectively extract important features from the original LOFC and HOFC features, resulting in an efficient M2SVC for multi-center ASD classification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32248-9_88", "venue": "MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2979952555", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204028292"}

Most computational methods for predicting protein antigenicity rely on sequence similarity between a query protein sequence and at least one known antigen. Such methods limit our ability to predict novel antigens (i.e., antigens that are not homologous to any known antigen). Therefore, there is an urgent need for alignment-free computational methods for reliable prediction of protective antigens. We evaluated the discriminative power of four different amino acid composition derived feature representations using three classification methods (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest) on a cross validation data set of 193 protective bacterial antigens and 193 non-antigenic bacterial proteins. Our results show that, with all four data representations, Random Forest classifiers consistently outperform other classifiers. We compared HRF50, one of the best performing Random Forest classifiers with VaxiJen and SignalP on independent test sets derived from the Chlamydia trachomatis and Bartonella proteomes. Our results show that our HRF50 predictor outperforms VaxiJen and is competitive with SignalP and ANTIGENpro in predicting protective antigens. We further showed that when we combine SignalP with HRF50, the resulting method, which we call BacGen, yields performance that is comparable to or better than that of ANTIGENpro in predicting antigens in bacterial sequences. We conclude that amino acid sequence composition derived features can be effectively used to design alignment-free methods for predicting protein antigenicity using Random Forest classifiers.

This is necessary to avoid extrapolating beyond the original data, particularly when designers use predictive models in concert with optimizers or other computational routines that search a model\u2019s input space automatically. The general problem of domain description is complicated by the characteristics of observational data sets, which can contain small numbers of samples, can have nonlinear associations among the variables, can be nonconvex, and can occur in disjoint clusters. Support vector machine (SVM) techniques, developed originally in the machine learning community, offer a solution to this problem. This paper is a description of a kernel-based SVM approach that yields a formal mathematical description of the valid input domain of a predictive model. The approach also provides for cluster analysis, which can lead to improved model accuracy through the decomposition of a data set into multiple subsets that designers can model independently.

In this paper, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification System (FRBCS) is presented in which a novel approach for fuzzy rule generation is proposed. The proposed algorithm makes the use of data mining principles, which are used by frequent pattern mining algorithms. Employing these principles enables us to well generate rules for subsequent classification purposes. Finally, a rule-weighting mechanism is investigated to tune the rule-base to have better classification ability.

Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) is currently the dominant algorithm in computer Go. It has been shown that the inclusion of domain knowledge in MCTS is able to vastly improve the strength of MCTS engines. A successful approach to representing domain knowledge in computer Go is the use of appropriately weighted tactical features and pattern features, which are comprised of a number of hand-crafted heuristics and a collection of patterns respectively. However, tactical features are hand-crafted specifically for Go, and pattern features are Go-specific, making it unclear how they can be easily transferred to other domains. As such, this work proposes a new approach to representing domain knowledge, decision tree features. These features evaluate a state-action pair by descending a decision tree, with queries recursively partitioning the state-action pair input space, and returning a weight corresponding to the partition element represented by the resultant leaf node. In this work, decision tree features are applied to computer Go, in order to determine their feasibility in comparison to state-of-the-art use of tactical and pattern features. In this application of decision tree features, each query in the decision tree descent path refines information about the board position surrounding a candidate move. The results of this work showed that a feature instance with decision tree features is a feasible alternative to the state-of-the-art use of tactical and pattern features in computer Go, in terms of move prediction and playing strength, even though computer Go is a relatively well-developed research area. A move prediction rate of 35.9% was achieved with tactical and decision tree features, and they showed comparable performance to the state of the art when integrated into an MCTS engine with progressive widening. We conclude that the decision tree feature approach shows potential as a method for automatically extracting domain knowledge in new domains. These features can be used to evaluate state-action pairs for guiding searchbased techniques, such as MCTS, or for action-prediction tasks. i Stellenbosch University http://scholar.sun.ac.za", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2167280010", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61832259"}

Ice disasters on transmission lines can cause gap discharge and icing flashover electrical failures, which can lead to mechanical failure of the tower, conductor, and insulators, causing significant harm to people\u2019s daily life and work. To address this challenge, an intelligent combinational model is proposed based on improved empirical mode decomposition and support vector machine for short-term forecasting of ice cover thickness. Firstly, in light of the characteristics of ice cover thickness data, fast independent component analysis (FICA) is implemented to smooth the abnormal situation on the curve trend of the original data for prediction. Secondly, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) decomposes data after denoising it into different components from high frequency to low frequency, and support vector machine (SVM) is introduced to predict the sequence of different components. Then, some modifications are performed on the standard SVM algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed. Combined with the advantages of genetic algorithm and tabu search, the combination algorithm is introduced to optimize the parameters of support vector machine. To improve the prediction accuracy, the kernel function of the support vector machine is adaptively adopted according to the complexity of different sequences. Finally, prediction results for each component series are added to obtain the overall ice cover thickness. A 220 kV DC transmission line in the Hunan Region is taken as the case study to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Image classification techniques are being used in object recognition, quality control and OCR systems. Many of the machine vision systems used in industrial applications employ well known image processing algorithms to discriminate between good and bad parts. Algorithms such as thresholding, blob analysis and edge detection, for example, can be found in every machine vision software vendor\u2019s toolbox since they can be used in numerous applications to solve a relatively large number of imaging tasks. Image classification may be performed using supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning techniques. In supervised learning, the system is presented with numerous examples of images that must be manually labeled. Using this training data, a learned model is then generated and used to predict the features of unknown images. Such traditional supervised learning techniques can use either generative or discriminative models to perform this task. In this dissertation, UID techniques are used in an optimized manner to represent an image in the form of a vector in finite dimensions. The distance between this representation and that of a prototype image is computed to find the similarity score between the images. This mating score can be used to train any machine learning system under supervised or unsupervised environment. In this dissertation, an SVM based classifier is trained using feature vectors to train a classifier in a supervised environment. The precision and accuracy of the machine is computed over the benchmark techniques of image classification. The overall performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using R simulator in terms of precision, recall and kappa measure.

Based on analysis of spectrum characteristics of current signals in single-phase earthed fault feeder, this paper proposed an earthed fault location method based on support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, the zero sequence current signal was sampled, and its spectrum was gotten by discrete Fourier transform. Secondly, the three dimensional feature vector that constituted by fundament, harmonic, inter harmonic component, had been extracted as the input of SVM. Furthermore, the SVM was trained with the samples obtained by simulation under different fault distance, different fault resistance and different fault close angle. Finally, the earthed fault feeder is selected using the trained SVM. The simulation results indicate that the fault location by the presented method is more precise.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.737.226", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Mechanics and Materials", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2070936152", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["11511752", "110792522", "38013217", "14978377", "111990749"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111318770"}

For better understanding of their functional mechanisms, it is fundamentally important to identify 4mC modification.

Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a computational method to more accurately identify m4C sites. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this study, we propose a machine learning based predictor, namely 4mcPred-SVM, for the genome-wide detection of DNA 4mC sites. In this predictor, we present a new feature representation algorithm that sufficiently exploits sequence-based information. To improve the feature representation ability, we use a two-step feature optimization strategy, thereby obtaining the most representative features. Using the resulting features and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we adaptively train the optimal models for different species. Comparative results on benchmark datasets from six species indicate that our predictor is able to achieve generally better performance in predicting 4mC sites as compared to the state-of-the-art predictors.

We applied a systems biology approach to analyze clinical, demographic and biomarker measurements (n = 29) collected from 157 hematuric patients: 80 urothelial cancer (UC) and 77 controls with confounding pathologies. On the basis of biomarkers, we conducted agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify patient and biomarker clusters. We then explored the relationship between the patient clusters and clinical characteristics using Chi-square analyses. We determined classification errors and areas under the receiver operating curve of Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) for patient subpopulations using the biomarker clusters to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Agglomerative clustering identified five patient clusters and seven biomarker clusters. Final diagnoses categories were non-randomly distributed across the five patient clusters. In addition, two of the patient clusters were enriched with patients with 'low cancer-risk' characteristics. The biomarkers which contributed to the diagnostic classifiers for these two patient clusters were similar. In contrast, three of the patient clusters were significantly enriched with patients harboring 'high cancer-risk\" characteristics including proteinuria, aggressive pathological stage and grade, and malignant cytology. Patients in these three clusters included controls, that is, patients with other serious disease and patients with cancers other than UC. Biomarkers which contributed to the diagnostic classifiers for the largest 'high cancer- risk' cluster were different than those contributing to the classifiers for the 'low cancer-risk' clusters. Biomarkers which contributed to subpopulations that were split according to smoking status, gender and medication were different. The systems biology approach applied in this study allowed the hematuric patients to cluster naturally on the basis of the heterogeneity within their biomarker data, into five distinct risk subpopulations. Our findings highlight an approach with the promise to unlock the potential of biomarkers. This will be especially valuable in the field of diagnostic bladder cancer where biomarkers are urgently required.

Generating realistic network traffic is essential for development and testing of techniques in Cyber and network security related tasks such as anomaly or intrusion detection. The effectiveness of such network monitoring techniques depends directly on the traffic data. Despite this, traffic generation is often considered low priority because it is difficult. Using GANs, we prototype and prove feasibility in the generation of real traffic flows such as ICMP Pings, DNS queries, and HTTP web requests. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) GANs, we propose an alternative encoding of network traffic data into the CNN model.

We employ a machine learning framework to compare the accuracies of Random Forest models derived using metrics calculated from different seasons. We compare these results to those from fused Landsat-PALSAR data to establish if seasonal metrics can compensate for structural information from the PALSAR signal. Furthermore, we test the applicability of a statistical variable selection method, the recursive feature elimination (RFE), in the automation of the model building process in order to reduce model complexity and processing time. All of our tests were repeated at four scales (30, 60, 90, and 120 m-pixels) to investigate the role of spatial resolution on modelled accuracies. Our results show that multi-seasonal composites combining imagery from both the dry and wet seasons produced the highest accuracies (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 9.4, at the 120 m scale). When using a single season of observations, dry season imagery performed best (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 9.9, at the 120 m resolution).

The system is based on two stages, the first is to extract the roots from text and the second is to classify the text according to predefined categories. The linguistic root extraction stage is composed of two main phases. The first phase is to handle removal of affixes including prefixes, suffixes and infixes. Prefixes and suffixes are removed depending on the length of the word, while checking its morphological pattern after each deduction to remove infixes. In the second phase, the root extraction algorithm is formulated to handle weak, defined, eliminated-long-vowel and two-letter geminated words, as there is a substantial great amount of irregular Arabic words in texts. Once the roots are extracted, they are checked against a predefined list of 3800 triliteral and 900 quad literal roots. Series of experiments has been conducted to improve and test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The obtained results revealed that the developed algorithm has better accuracy than the existing stemming algorithm. The second stage is the document classification stage. In this stage two nonparametric classifiers are tested, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system is trained on 6 categories: culture, economy, international, local, religion and sports. The system is trained on 80% of the available data. From each category, the 10 top frequent terms are selected as features. Testing the classification algorithms has been done on the remaining 20% of the documents. The results of ANN and SVM are compared to the standard method used for text classification, the terms frequency-based method. Results show that ANN and SVM have better accuracy (80-90%) compared to the standard method (60-70%). The proposed method proves the ability to categorize the Arabic text documents into the appropriate categories with a high precision rate.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2556582302", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21663358"}

It is obvious that in-depth investigation of correlations between microbes and diseases will benefit the prevention, early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases greatly. Hence, in this paper, based on known microbe-disease associations, a prediction model called NBLPIHMDA was proposed to infer potential microbe-disease associations. Specifically, two kinds of networks including the disease similarity network and the microbe similarity network were first constructed based on the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity. The bidirectional label propagation was then applied on these two kinds of networks to predict potential microbe-disease associations. We applied NBLPIHMDA on Human Microbe-Disease Association database (HMDAD), and compared it with 3 other recent published methods including LRLSHMDA, BiRWMP and KATZHMDA based on the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation and 5-fold Cross Validation respectively.

With the fact that GAN is the analogy of a minimax game, the proposed architecture is as follows. The generator G aims to produce realistic-looking samples to fool both of two discriminators. The first discriminator D1 rewards high scores for the samples from the data distribution, while the second one D2 favors the samples from the generator conversely. Specifically, the minibatch discrimination and Spectral Normalization (SN) are first adopted in D1. Then, based on the ResBlock architecture, Spectral Normalization (SN) and Scaled Exponential Linear Units (SELU) are adopted in the first and last half layers of D2 respectively. In particular, a novel loss function is designed to optimize the STDGAN by minimizing the KL divergence.

Seamounts, however, host vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), which means that spatial management is needed to address potential conflicts between mineral extraction and the conservation of deep-sea biodiversity. Exploration of the Tropic Seamount, located in an Area Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) in the subtropical North Atlantic, revealed large amounts of rare earth elements, as well as numerous VMEs, including high-density octocoral gardens, Solenosmilia variabilis patch reefs, xenophyophores, crinoid fields and deep-sea sponge grounds. This study focuses on the extensive monospecific grounds of the hexactinellid sponge Poliopogon amadou Thomson, 1878. Deep-sea sponge grounds provide structurally complex habitat, augmenting local biodiversity. To understand the potential extent of these sponge grounds and inform spatial management, we produced the first ensemble species distribution model and local habitat suitability maps for P. amadou in the Atlantic employing Maximum Entropy (Maxent), General Additive Models (GAMs), and Random Forest (RF). The main factors driving the distribution of the sponge were depth and maximum current speed. The sponge grounds occurred in a marked bathymetric belt (2,500 \u2013 3,000 m) within the upper North Atlantic Deep Water mass (2.5\u00b0C, 34.7 psu, O2 6.7-7 \uf06dg ml-1), with a preference for areas bathed by moderately strong currents (0.2 - 0.4 ms-1). GAMs, Maxent and RF showed similar performance in terms of evaluation statistics but a different prediction, with RF showing the highest differences. This algorithm only retained depth and maximum currents whereas GAM and Maxent included bathymetric position index, slope, aspect and backscatter. In these latter two models, P. amadou showed a preference for high backscatter values and areas slightly elevated, flat or with gentle slopes and with a NE orientation. The lack of significant differences in model performance permitted to merge all predictions using an ensemble model approach. Our results contribute towards understanding the environmental drivers and biogeography of the species in the Atlantic.

Using linguistic analysis methods, this paper aims to build computational models for detecting stigma expressions in Chinese social media posts (Sina Weibo). Methods A total of 15,879 Weibo posts with keywords were collected and analyzed. First, a content analysis was conducted on all 15,879 posts to determine whether each of them reflected depression stigma or not. Second, using four algorithms (Simple Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest), two groups of classification models were built based on selected linguistic features; one for differentiating between posts with and without depression stigma, and one for differentiating among posts with three specific types of depression stigma. Results First, 967 of 15,879 posts (6.09%) indicated depression stigma. 39.30%, 15.82%, and 14.99% of them endorsed the stigmatizing view that \u201cPeople with depression are unpredictable\u201d, \u201cDepression is a sign of personal weakness\u201d, and \u201cDepression is not a real medical illness\u201d, respectively. Second, the highest F-Measure value for differentiating between stigma and non-stigma reached 75.2%.

The goal of the focused crawling is to seek out and collect the pages that are relevant to a predefined set of topics.

However, when training the classifiers, one can often encounter some difficulties in selecting negative samples. Such difficulties come from the fact that collecting a set of pages relevant to a specific topic is not a classification process by nature. ::: ::: In this paper, we propose a novel focused crawling method using only positive samples to represent a given topic as a form of hyperplane, where we can obtain such representation from a modified Proximal Support Vector Machines. The distance from a page to the hyperplane is used to prioritize the visit order of the page. We demonstrated the performance of the proposed method over the WebKB data set and the Web.

Methods and Results --This work was designed as a retrospective, single-center study of a hospital-based cohort. The 5060 CHD patients (2365 men and 2695 women) were 1 to 97 years old at baseline with 8 years (2009-2017) of medical records, 5051 health check-ups and 5075 cases of other diseases. We developed a two-layer Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT) model based on routine blood data to predict the risk of coronary heart disease, which could identify 86% of people with coronary heart disease. We built a dataset with 15,000 routine blood tests results. Using this dataset, we trained the two-layer GBDT model to classify healthy status, coronary heart disease and other diseases. As a result of the classification after machine learning, we found that the sensitivity of detecting the health data was approximately 93% for all data, and the sensitivity of detecting CHD was 93% for disease data that included coronary heart disease. On this basis, we further visualized the correlation between routine blood results and related data items, and there was an obvious pattern in health and coronary heart disease in all data presentations, which can be used for clinical reference. Finally, we briefly analyzed the results above from the perspective of pathophysiology. Conclusions --Routine blood data provides more information about CHD than what we already know through the correlation between test results and related data items. A simple coronary disease prediction model was developed using a GBDT algorithm, which will allow physicians to predict CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1809.09553", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Medical Physics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2893932382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["151840", "7955044", "16190154", "62602873", "206787478", "151840"], "inbound_citations": ["210930297"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52824816"}

We obtained duplicate proteomic (SELDI) profiles from 227 subjects (118 TCC, 77 healthy controls and 32 controls with benign urological conditions) and used linear mixed effects models to identify peaks that are differentially expressed between TCC and controls and within TCC subgroups. A Random Forest classifier was trained on 130 profiles to develop an algorithm to predict the presence of TCC in a randomly selected initial test set (n = 54) and an independent validation set (n = 43) several months later. Twenty two peaks were differentially expressed between all TCC and controls (p < 10\u22127). However potential confounding effects of age, sex and analytical run were identified. In an age-matched sub-set, 23 peaks were differentially expressed between TCC and combined benign and healthy controls at the 0.005 significance level. Using the Random Forest classifier, TCC was predicted with 71.7% sensitivity and 62.5% specificity in the initial set and with 78.3% sensitivity and 65.0% specificity in the validation set after 6 months, compared with controls. Several peaks of importance were also identified in the linear mixed effects model. We conclude that SELDI profiling of urine samples can identify patients with TCC with comparable sensitivities and specificities to current tumor marker tests. This is the first time that reproducibility has been demonstrated on an independent test set analyzed several months later. Identification of the relevant peaks may facilitate multiplex marker assay development for detection of recurrent disease. \u00a9 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "16991122", "doi": "10.1002/ijc.22238", "venue": "International journal of cancer", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "mag_id": "2078769511", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2941284", "39015154", "207319598", "7295457", "2744522", "18996115", "7183094", "30870940", "27992651", "22649492", "24360613", "6862958", "23722156", "43397574", "23983558", "42928106", "33634863", "11301194", "36854852", "37374138", "7161110", "506069"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43200134"}

Food recognition is an emerging topic in computer vision. The problem is being addressed especially in health-oriented systems where it is used as a support for food diary applications. The goal is to improve current food diaries, where the users have to manually insert their daily food intake, with an automatic recognition of the food type, quantity and consequent calories intake estimation. In addition to the classical recognition challenges, the food recognition problem is characterized by the absence of a rigid structure of the food and by large intra-class variations. To tackle such challenges, a food recognition system based on a committee classification is proposed. The aim is to provide a system capable of automatically choosing the optimal features for food recognition out of the existing plethora of available ones (e.g., color, texture, etc.). Following this idea, each committee member, i.e., an Extreme Learning Machine, is trained to specialize on a single feature type. Then, a Structural Support Vector Machine is exploited to produce the final ranking of possible matches by filtering out the irrelevant features and thus merging only the relevant ones.

Monitoring large crowds using video cameras is a challenging task. Detecting humans in video is becoming essential for monitoring crowd behavior. However, occlusion and low resolution in the region of interest hinders accurate crowd segmentation. In such scenarios, it is likely that only the head is visible, and often very small. Most existing people-detection systems rely on low-level visual appearance features such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and these are unsuitable for detecting human heads at low resolutions. In this paper, a novel head detector is presented using motion histogram features. The shape and the motion information, including crowd direction and magnitude, is learned and used to detect humans in occluded crowds. We introduce novel features based on a multi level pyramid architecture for Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH) and Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF), derived from the TV-L1 optical flow. In addition, a new feature, called Relative Motion Distance (RMD) is proposed to efficiently capture correlation statistics. For classification distinguishing human head from similar features, a two-stage Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used, and an explicit kernel mapping on our motion histogram features is performed using Bhattacharyya-distance kernels.

Although recent convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for finger vein verification have shown powerful capacity for feature representation and promising perspective in this area, they still have two critical issues to address. First, these CNN-based methods unexceptionally utilize fully connected layers, which restrict the size of finger vein images to process and increase the processing time. Second, the capacity of CNN for feature representation generally suffers from the low quality of finger vein ground-truth pattern maps for training, particularly due to outliers and vessel breaks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel approach termed FV-GAN to finger vein extraction and verification, based on generative adversarial network (GAN), as the first attempt in this area. Unlike the CNN-based methods, FV-GAN learns from the joint distribution of finger vein images and pattern maps rather than the direct mapping between them, with the aim at achieving stronger robustness against outliers and vessel breaks. Moreover, FV-GAN adopts fully convolutional networks as the basic architecture and discards fully connected layers, which relaxes the constraint on the input image size and reduces the computational expenditure for feature extraction. Furthermore, we design an adversarial training strategy and propose a hybrid loss function for FV-GAN. The experimental results on two public databases show significant improvement by FV-GAN in finger vein verification in terms of both verification accuracy and equal error rate.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIFS.2019.2902819", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2919938126", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16193920", "195860455", "16210072", "6311330", "423677", "13148068", "16384087", "10080068", "14264310", "14210818", "122747756", "34958844", "45187299", "44338550", "40872241", "43939435", "9234393", "56507745", "206770979", "3248075", "211227", "1033682", "1282515", "12803511", "11758569", "206771128", "13943041", "8239952", "3719281", "206771220", "14554538", "623137", "13740328", "6200260", "1957008", "18480472", "7638752", "51924253", "16991836", "13688414"], "inbound_citations": ["202749975"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86443541"}

However, information is only useful when it can be retrieved. Search engines are used for this retrieval, but they are losing precision because of the ongoing expansion of the web. In order for search engines to regain precision they can be enhanced with category filters. However the web is too big to be classified by hand. In this article the possibility is explored to classify web pages in basic categories using the machine learning tool Support Vector Machines. Machine learning tools require a pre-classified training set in order to function, and manually classifying web pages for the training set can take up a lot of time. To tackle this problem, already classified home pages from a web directory are used as training set. Even though the training set is not verified the classifier scores very well. This is evidence that enhancing search engines with a category filter is not a difficult task. Because users of search engines unintentionally give feedback about the accuracy of the category filter, they help to improve it by simply using the search engine.

Integrated photonic reservoir computing, particularly on the silicon-on-insulator platform, presents a CMOS-compatible, wide bandwidth, parallel platform for implementation of optical reservoirs. A number of demonstrations of the applicability of this platform for processing optical telecommunication signals have been made in the recent past. In this work, we take it a stage further by performing an architectural search for designs that yield the best performance while maintaining power efficiency. We present numerical simulations for an optical circuit model of a 16-node integrated photonic reservoir with the input signal injected in combinations of 2, 4, and 8 nodes, or into all 16 nodes. The reservoir is composed of a network of passive photonic integrated circuit components with the required nonlinearity introduced at the readout point with a photodetector. The resulting error performance on the temporal XOR task for these multiple input cases is compared with that of the typical case of input to a single node. We additionally introduce for the first time in our simulations a realistic model of a photodetector. Based on this, we carry out a full power-level exploration for each of the above input strategies. Multiple-input reservoirs achieve better performance and power efficiency than single-input reservoirs. For the same input power level, multiple-input reservoirs yield lower error rates. The best multiple-input reservoir designs can achieve the error rates of single-input ones with at least two orders of magnitude less total input power. These results can be generally attributed to the increase in richness of the reservoir dynamics and the fact that signals stay longer within the reservoir. If we account for all loss and noise contributions, the minimum input power for error-free performance for the optimal design is found to be in the \u22481 mW range.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-017-9465-5", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2607617453", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1045112", "2184251", "16538082", "13207182", "43505773", "14350758", "113054590", "11843403", "14114724", "7571855", "24244845", "1871766", "43661025", "207324095", "207329181", "39478267", "12922586", "106525508", "123465731", "205324293", "13683411", "13709161", "9631491", "10659969", "7092724"], "inbound_citations": ["201893967", "208616279", "212415629", "115291100", "202700359", "52938888", "10014526", "199472762", "115810584", "46975775", "13845390", "199541604"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1384022"}

Because of regulatory and privacy issues associated with medicine, and the generally proprietary nature of data in medical domains, obtaining large datasets to train DNNs is a challenge, particularly in the ophthalmology domain. ::: Transfer learning is a technique developed to address the issue of applying DNNs for domains with limited data. Prior reports on transfer learning have examined custom networks to fully train or used a particular DNN for transfer learning. However, to the best of my knowledge, no work has systematically examined a suite of DNNs for transfer learning for classification of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and two key features of age-related macular degeneration. This work attempts to investigate transfer learning for classification of these ophthalmic conditions. Part I gives a condensed overview of neural networks and the DNNs under evaluation. Part II gives the reader the necessary background concerning diabetic retinopathy and prior work on classification using retinal fundus photographs. The methodology and results of transfer learning for diabetic retinopathy classification are presented, showing that transfer learning towards this domain is feasible, with promising accuracy.

Moreover, other agents' actions are often not directly observable, and the actions taken by the learning agent can strongly bias which range of behaviors are encountered. We define the concept of a conjectural equilibrium, where all agents' expectations are realized, and each agent responds optimally to its expectations. We present a generic multiagent exchange situation, in which competitive behavior constitutes a conjectural equilibrium. We then introduce an agent that executes a more sophisticated strategic learning strategy, building a model of the response of other agents.

The climate modelling community has trialled a large number metrics to evaluate the temporal performance of the Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for the selection of GCMs, while very little attention has been given to spatial performance of GCMs which is equally important.

The multi-model ensemble (MME) precipitation was generated through intelligent merging of simulated precipitation of selected GCMs employing Random Forest (RF) regression and Simple Mean (SM). The results indicated some differences in the ranks of GCMs for different metrics. The overall ranks indicated NorESM1-M, CESM1-CAM5, GFDL-CM3 and GFDL-ESM2G as the best GCMs in simulating the spatial patterns of mean annual, monsoon and winter precipitation over Pakistan. MME precipitation generated based on the best performing GCMs showed more similarities with observed precipitation compared to precipitation simulated by individual GCMs. The MME developed using RF displayed better performance than the MME-based on SM. Multiple spatial metrics have been used for the first time for selecting GCMs based on their capability to mimic the spatial patterns of annual and seasonal precipitation.

Although many efforts have been made in this regard, further effort is needed to enhance the prediction power. By incorporating the features into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition that were extracted from protein sequences via the \"grey model\" and by adopting the random forest operation engine, we proposed a new predictor, called iDNA-Prot, for identifying uncharacterized proteins as DNA-binding proteins or non-DNA binding proteins based on their amino acid sequences information alone. The overall success rate by iDNA-Prot was 83.96% that was obtained via jackknife tests on a newly constructed stringent benchmark dataset in which none of the proteins included has \u226525% pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset. In addition to achieving high success rate, the computational time for iDNA-Prot is remarkably shorter in comparison with the relevant existing predictors. Hence it is anticipated that iDNA-Prot may become a useful high throughput tool for large-scale analysis of DNA-binding proteins. As a user-friendly web-server, iDNA-Prot is freely accessible to the public at the web-site on http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/iDNA-Prot or http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iDNA-Prot.

To overcome this problem, we present another approach to create ensembles that combines the existing ensemble methods with the kernel machine philosophy. In this approach, kernel features are created and concatenated with the original features. The classifiers of an ensemble are trained on these extended feature spaces.

In this work, we formulate higher-order network representation learning and describe a general framework called HONE for learning such structural node embeddings from networks via the subgraph patterns (network motifs, graphlet orbits/positions) in a nodes neighborhood. A general diffusion mechanism is introduced in HONE along with a space-efficient approach that avoids explicit construction of the k-step motif-based matrices using a k-step linear operator. Furthermore, HONE is shown to be fast and efficient with a worst-case time complexity that is nearly-linear in the number of edges.

The SGWT provides the time domain interpretation which is an opposition to the frequency domain analysis of DWT. Further, the selected features are extracted from the detail coefficient of the variants of WT and given as inputs to the classifiers in order to characterize the signals. Moreover, a comparative assessment of the PQ signal carried out with different classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) have been presented along with aforementioned detection techniques. The RF is an ensemble decision tree and used for the classification of large number of data set.

Unfortunately, the space required to store these many networks, and the time required to execute them at test-time, prohibits their use in applications where test sets are large (e.g., ImageNet). In this paper, we present a method for compressing large, complex trained ensembles into a single network, where knowledge from a variety of trained deep neural networks (DNNs) is distilled and transferred to a single DNN. In order to distill diverse knowledge from different trained (teacher) models, we propose to use adversarial-based learning strategy where we define a block-wise training loss to guide and optimize the predefined student network to recover the knowledge in teacher models, and to promote the discriminator network to distinguish teacher vs. student features simultaneously. The proposed ensemble method (MEAL) of transferring distilled knowledge with adversarial learning exhibits three important advantages: (1) the student network that learns the distilled knowledge with discriminators is optimized better than the original model; (2) fast inference is realized by a single forward pass, while the performance is even better than traditional ensembles from multi-original models; (3) the student network can learn the distilled knowledge from a teacher model that has arbitrary structures.

Manipuri uses two scripts; the first one is purely of its own origins while another one is a borrowed Bengali script. In the present task, the processing has been done on the Bengali script. Manipuri is a Tibeto-Burman (TB) language which is highly agglutinative in nature, mono-syllabic, influenced and enriched by the Indo-Aryan languages of Sanskrit origin and English. The affixes play the most important role in the structure of the language. A clear-cut demarcation between morphology and syntax is not possible in this language. In Manipuri, words are formed in three processes called affixation, derivation and compounding as mentioned in Thoudam P.C. The majority of the roots found in the language are bound and the affixes are the determining factor", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2741626685", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116269769"}

In this master\u2019s report, we describe an automatic system for scoring shape characters of monocot leaves. This system uses computer vision to speed up the current manual scoring process. Each leaf is processed using following computational steps: Segmentation, Orientation Alignment and Scoring. We developed two main frameworks for shape character scoring.

Unlike digital images represented by grids of pixels, the geometrical structure of the sensor array limits the capability of straightforward application of well-established approaches for image patterns. This paper introduces a novel histogram-based classification algorithm, transforming tactile data into histograms of local features termed as codebook. Tactile pattern can be invariant at periodical locations, allowing tactile pattern classification using a smaller number of training data, instead of using training data from everywhere on the large scale skin sensors. To generate the codebook, this method uses a two-layer approach, namely local neighbourhood structures and encodings of pressure distribution of the local neighbourhood. Classification is performed based on the constructed features using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the intersection kernel. Real experimental data are used for experiment to classify different patterns and have shown promising accuracy.

This paper presents a fully automatic method for segmenting hip CT images using random forest (RF) regression-based atlas selection and optimal graph search-based surface detection. The two fundamental contributions of our method are: (1) An efficient RF regression framework is developed for a fast and accurate landmark detection from the hip CT images. The detected landmarks allow for not only a robust and accurate initialization of the atlases within the target image space but also an effective selection of a subset of atlases for a fast atlas-based segmentation; and (2) 3-D graph theory-based optimal surface detection is used to refine the extraction of the surfaces of the acetabulum and the femoral head with the ultimate goal to preserve hip joint structure and to avoid penetration between the two extracted surfaces.

Results show channel state information is accurate for single participants (F1-score of 0.90), but sensitive to different participants and fluctuating WiFi signals over days (F1-score of 0.25-0.35).

Additionally, data redundance may incur performance degradation on transfer learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel semi-supervised representation learning framework for transfer learning. To obtain this framework, manifold regularization is integrated for the parameters optimization, and the label information is encoded using a softmax regression model in auto-encoders.

This introduces sparsity in the model along with ability to scale for large datasets. But there exists no formal method for selection of the right value of M. In this paper, we investigate the sparsity-error trade-off by introducing a second level of sparsity after performing one iteration of FS-LSSVM. This helps to overcome the problem of selecting a right number of initial PVs as the final model is highly sparse and dependent on only a few appropriately selected prototype vectors (SV) is a subset of the PVs. The first proposed method performs an iterative approximation of L 0-norm which acts as a regularizer. The second method belongs to the category of threshold methods, where we set a window and select the SV set from correctly classified PVs closer and farther from the decision boundaries in the case of classification. For regression, we obtain the SV set by selecting the PVs with least minimum squared error (mse).

While deep metric learning has yielded impressive performance gains by extracting high level abstractions from image data, a proper objective loss function becomes the central issue to boost the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel angular loss, which takes angle relationship into account, for learning better similarity metric. Whereas previous metric learning methods focus on optimizing the similarity (contrastive loss) or relative similarity (triplet loss) of image pairs, our proposed method aims at constraining the angle at the negative point of triplet triangles. Several favorable properties are observed when compared with conventional methods. First, scale invariance is introduced, improving the robustness of objective against feature variance. Second, a third-order geometric constraint is inherently imposed, capturing additional local structure of triplet triangles than contrastive loss or triplet loss.

High dimensionality of feature space is one of the challenges in text classification that can be decreased by many techniques. In stemming, high dimensionality of feature space is decreased by grouping those words that they have same grammatical forms and then getting their root. This work is dedicated to build an approach for Kurdish language classification using Reber Stemmer. Thus, an innovative approach is investigated to get the stem of words in Kurdish language by removing longest suffix and prefixes of words. This approach has a strong capability and meets the requirements in responding to the process of deleting as many of the required affixes as possible to get the stem of words in Kurdish language. The advantage of this stemmer is that it ignores the ordering list of affixes that receives correct stem for more than one words that have the same format. The stemming technique is implemented on KDC-4007 dataset that consists of eight classes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT or C 4.5) are used for the classification. This stemmer has been successfully compared with the Longest-Match stemmer technique. According to results, the F-measure of Reber stemmer and Longest-Match method in SVM is higher than DT. Reber stemmer in SVM for classes (religion, sport, health and education) obtained higher F-measure, while the rest of classes are lower in Longest-Match.

However, existing methods rely heavily on fully connected layers, which introduce a significant amount of parameters, making the network harder to train and prone to overfitting problems. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for point set feature learning by leveraging a nonlinear activation layer encoded by Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels. Unlike PointNet variants, that fail to recognize local point patterns, our approach explicitly models the spatial distribution of point clouds by aggregating features from sparsely distributed RBF kernels. A typical RBF kernel, e.g. Gaussian function, naturally penalizes long-distance response and is only activated by neighboring points. Such localized response generates highly discriminative features given different point distributions.

A very recent trend in Reservoir Computing is the use of real physical dynamical systems as implementation platforms, rather than the customary digital emulations. Physical systems operate in continuous time, creating a fundamental difference with the classic discrete time definitions of Reservoir Computing. The specific goal of this paper is to study the memory properties of such systems, where we will limit ourselves to linear dynamics. We develop an analytical model which allows the calculation of the memory function for continuous time linear dynamical systems, which can be considered as networks of linear leaky integrator neurons. We then use this model to research memory properties for different types of reservoir. We start with random connection matrices with a shifted eigenvalue spectrum, which perform very poorly. Next, we transform two specific reservoir types, which are known to give good performance in discrete time, to the continuous time domain. Reservoirs based on uniform spreading of connection matrix eigenvalues on the unit disk in discrete time give much better memory properties than reservoirs with random connection matrices, where reservoirs based on orthogonal connection matrices in discrete time are very robust against noise and their memory properties can be tuned.

The signal processing circuit connected to the photodiode was designed so that the signal obtained by the photodiode was amplified and the pulse width was broadened. The amplified signal was acquired by a data acquisition card and stored in the computer for subsequent data processing. The peak of the pulse signal is used to characterize the single pulse energy of ArF excimer laser.

Then, by using the data acquired, a model characterizing the functional relationship between the energy value and the peak value of the pulse was trained based on an algorithm of machine learning, Support Vector Regression (SVR).

We demonstrate an application of visualisation techniques at different stages of corporate default analysis based on Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The mapping of scores into PDs is done as a non-parametric regression with monotonisation.

These two defects are distinct especially when images with human-object interactions are retagged. To tackle these defects, in this paper we propose a Bayesian approach to jointly consider the human and object in an image and retag it properly. In our approach, human and objects in images are detected and their interrelationships are taken into account. Tags which represent the mutual context of human and objects are then mapped to those interrelationships by a probabilistic graphical model. For a new image which lacks the tag representing the interaction between human and object, our model can correctly retag it for the interaction.

In order to overcome the difficulty in developing detailed mechanistic models, extreme learning machine (ELM) based data driven models are developed. In building an ELM model, the hidden layer weights are randomly assigned and the output layer weights are obtained in a one step regression type of learning. This feature makes the development of ELM very fast. A single ELM model can lack of robustness due the randomly assigned hidden layer weights. To overcome this problem, multiple ELM models are developed from bootstrap re-sampling replications of the original training data and are then combined. In addition to enhanced model accuracy, bootstrap aggregated ELM can also give model prediction confidence bounds. A reliable optimal control policy is achieved by means of the inclusion of model prediction confidence bounds within the optimization objective function to penalize wide model prediction confidence bounds which are associated with uncertain predictions as a consequence of plant model-mismatch. Finally, in order to deal with unknown process disturbances, an on-line re-optimization control strategy is developed in that on-line optimization is carried out while the batch process is progression.

Mental fatigue can easily lead to poor performance of construction equipment operations and accidents in the worst case scenario. Hence, it is necessary to propose an objective method that can accurately detect multiple levels of mental fatigue of construction equipment operators. To address such issue, this paper develops a novel method to identify and classify operator's multi-level mental fatigue using wearable eye-tracking technology. For the purpose, six participants were recruited to perform a simulated excavator operation experiment to obtain relevant data. First, a Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (TICC) method was used to determine the number of levels of mental fatigue using relevant subjective and objective data collected during the experiments. The results revealed the number of mental fatigue levels to be 3 using TICC-based method. Second, four eye movement feature-sets suitable for different construction scenarios were extracted and supervised learning algorithms were used to classify multi-level mental fatigue of the operator. The classification performance analysis of the supervised learning algorithms showed Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most suitable algorithm to classify mental fatigue in the face of various construction scenarios and subject bias (accuracy between 79.5% and 85.0%).

TCO-Spectrum, which is the pretreatment method for SAE, is the order spectrum of the signal after Teager energy operator demodulation. Two other pretreatment methods, Computed Order Spectrum and Hilbert Computed Order Spectrum, are also explored as comparisons to verify the effectiveness of TCO-Spectrum. In order to prove the powerful feature extraction ability of SAE, four traditional intelligent methods (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Hidden Markov Model and BP Network) are used as comparisons. The effectiveness of all methods is validated by the dataset composed of 56 training bearings and 8 testing bearings which involve 4 different health conditions. The speed range of each signal sample is controlled between 200 and 2000 rpm and the load is set from 7.7 kg to 48.1 kg. The diagnosis results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable to learn features adaptively from vibration signal of rolling bearings in spite of changing of speed and load.

The XGB tree-based ensemble prediction model is evaluated against common tree-based ensemble algorithms and the evaluations are performed at five-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon.

Nearly two billion messages were processed for providing travel time estimates for the entire freeway network. A Combination of grid search and five-fold cross-validation techniques using the travel time estimates were used for developing the prediction models and tuning their parameters. About 9.6 km freeway stretch was used for evaluating the XGB together with the most common tree-based ensemble algorithms. The results show that XGB is superior to all other algorithms, followed by the Gradient Boosting. XGB travel time predictions were accurate and consistent with variations during peak periods, with mean absolute percentage error in prediction about 5.9% and 7.8% for 5-minute and 30-minute horizons, respectively.

Since the availability of high-resolution Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, substantial progress in geomorphological research, especially in landslide analysis, has been carried out. First and second order derivatives of Digital Terrain Model (DTM) have become a popular and powerful tool in landslide inventory mapping. Nevertheless, an automatic landslide mapping based on sophisticated classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network or Random Forests is often computationally time consuming. The objective of this research is to deeply explore topographic information provided by ALS data and overcome computational time limitation. For this reason, an extended set of topographic features and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to reduce redundant information. The proposed novel approach was tested on a susceptible area affected by more than 50 landslides located on Roznow Lake in Carpathian Mountains, Poland. The initial seven PCA components with 90% of the total variability in the original topographic attributes were used for SVM classification. Comparing results with landslide inventory map, the average user\u2019s accuracy (UA), producer\u2019s accuracy (PA), and overall accuracy (OA) were calculated for two models according to the classification results. Thereby, for the PCA-feature-reduced model UA, PA, and OA were found to be 72%, 76%, and 72%, respectively. Similarly, UA, PA, and OA in the non-reduced original topographic model, was 74%, 77% and 74%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised music style transfer method without the need for parallel data. Besides, to characterize the multi-modal distribution of music pieces, we employ the Multi-modal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (MUNIT) framework in the proposed system. This allows one to generate diverse outputs from the learned latent distributions representing contents and styles. Moreover, to better capture the granularity of sound, such as the perceptual dimensions of timbre and the nuance in instrument-specific performance, cognitively plausible features including mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), spectral difference, and spectral envelope, are combined with the widely-used mel-spectrogram into a timbreenhanced multi-channel input representation. The Relativistic average Generative Adversarial Networks (RaGAN) is also utilized to achieve fast convergence and high stability.

A reliable identification of DNA-binding sites in DNA-binding proteins is important for functional annotation, site-directed mutagenesis, and modeling protein-DNA interactions. We apply Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised pattern recognition method, to predict DNA-binding sites in DNA-binding proteins using the following features: amino acid sequence, profile of evolutionary conservation of sequence positions, and low-resolution structural information. We use a rigorous statistical approach to study the performance of predictors that utilize different combinations of features and how this performance is affected by structural and sequence properties of proteins. Our results indicate that an SVM predictor based on a properly scaled profile of evolutionary conservation in the form of a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) significantly outperforms a PSSM-based neural network predictor. The highest accuracy is achieved by SVM predictor that combines the profile of evolutionary conservation with low-resolution structural information.

With the rapid improvement of general hardware architectures and growing popularity of multi-core multi-threaded processors, software-based packet classification algorithms are attracting considerable attention, owing to their high flexibility in satisfying various industrial requirements for security and network systems. For high classification speed, these algorithms internally use large tables, whose size increases exponentially with the ruleset size; consequently, they cannot be used with a large rulesets. To overcome this problem, we propose a new software-based packet classification algorithm that simultaneously supports high scalability and fast classification performance by merging partition decision trees in a search table. While most partitioning-based packet classification algorithms show good scalability at the cost of low classification speed, our algorithm shows very high classification speed, irrespective of the number of rules, with small tables and short table building time.

Universal steganalysis is a two class optimization problem and the detecting efficiency depends on the feature set chosen from the stego and clean images. Though extracting all possible features of an image may lead to more efficiency the classification suffers due to large dimension of feature set. To overcome the problem of dimensionality appropriate feature reduction techniques need to be employed. This paper presents a blind universal image steganalysis technique that extracts the noise models of adjacent pixels of an image. The exact model construction involves the formation of four dimensional co-occurrence matrices of the quantised and truncated noise residues. From the 106 sub models 34,671 features have been extracted and further reduced by a novel unsupervised optimization technique to identify the most appropriate features for classification. The classifiers implemented include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and three fusion classifiers based on Bayes, Decision Template and Dempster Schafer fusion schemes. It has been identified that MLP performs better than SVM but is not superior to fusion classifiers.

It is known that all kernel parameters may be used for classification more-or-less precisely (giving rise to vagueness) and also for the same classification problem, there are a number of kernel parameters which give the best accuracy (giving rise to uncertainty). Hence, an appropriate scheme of representing best suited kernel parameters for a given classification problem requires an Interval-type 2 approach. In this work the authors introduce a fuzzy rule-based kernel parameter selection technique which is based on the variability (inter-class and intra-class scatter) of the dataset to be classified. A significant advantage of using the proposed fuzzy kernel parameter selection technique is that one can identify the kernel parameter which has least curvature and hence avoid over fitting. The introduced method of kernel parameter selection is tested in an emotion recognition problem by brain network analysis.

More recently, with the advances of deep learning models especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the performance of remote sensing image scene classification has been significantly improved due to the powerful feature representations learnt through CNNs. Although great success has been obtained so far, the problems of within-class diversity and between-class similarity are still two big challenges. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to learn discriminative CNNs (D-CNNs) to boost the performance of remote sensing image scene classification. Different from the traditional CNN models that minimize only the cross entropy loss, our proposed D-CNN models are trained by optimizing a new discriminative objective function. To this end, apart from minimizing the classification error, we also explicitly impose a metric learning regularization term on the CNN features. The metric learning regularization enforces the D-CNN models to be more discriminative so that, in the new D-CNN feature spaces, the images from the same scene class are mapped closely to each other and the images of different classes are mapped as farther apart as possible. In the experiments, we comprehensively evaluate the proposed method on three publicly available benchmark data sets using three off-the-shelf CNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed D-CNN methods outperform the existing baseline methods and achieve state-of-the-art results on all three data sets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2017.2783902", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2783165089", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["3046524", "15298934", "3110415", "15257375", "85513130", "207763512", "2206412", "24501682", "10397600", "38814373", "9125483", "22538752", "678821", "14124313", "206592484", "22975757", "1307414", "15842150", "33411660", "5797377", "119563947", "1279297", "19963944", "9943634", "1424412", "206691461", "123074928", "16087592", "32417047", "25069492", "13904304", "9510200", "5810692", "22270920", "1752482", "16069989", "21027625", "13079847", "63196847", "2575184", "7172528", "7666160", "4864803", "35444958", "62524197", "25443499", "39043600", "18850741", "123387741", "4858208", "6491060", "206771624", "6693806", "206726841", "4270461", "206670557", "5771724", "1123933", "5726681", "7443404", "195667790", "53082787", "3217198", "993769"], "inbound_citations": ["52941665", "207958993", "210472810", "208039817", "126888647", "52878014", "53528167", "201266654", "128204524", "139346744", "207895256", "115199185", "53093188", "58013835", "53086494", "211057309", "203993915", "195534227", "69723750", "166227895", "80628428", "49302358", "127221845", "204230017", "174819202", "84181095", "204754455", "201069060", "173987225", "215478588", "198953966", "214808419", "214783115", "215492879", "145883535", "208039248", "56178241", "49418934", "50769275", "58577134", "57024396", "215725010", "86569230", "174800486", "210695405", "203566877", "3744747", "211206529", "53286210", "213318154", "211208384", "195877094", "214691735", "125896773", "51965390", "204939435", "67873809", "208037261", "52152731", "164296828", "207828090", "209853885", "191159989", "199011468", "208034123", "204208840", "53092917", "210931518", "199452895", "127214191", "211689637", "132971097", "52164997", "211226982", "53045766", "85452394", "52909346", "127950011", "58951342", "208015604", "215342943", "198366230", "53086080", "127092627", "53046399", "59236939", "208034787", "199670699", "119314554", "67874021", "202542876", "204949442", "204028464", "56175575", "203093801", "203093801", "203705348", "51868886", "203586536", "67870638", "51904853", "47016867", "208879074", "149822779", "51876501", "52960238", "203101609", "57425487", "211227280", "208038437", "81991330", "195357122", "149728579", "49545927", "208034835", "195698056", "53099248", "204913522", "208138097", "14922911", "150061610", "199020478", "212702949", "209957178", "212640060", "203139762", "214591611", "51965457", "52284215", "54450011", "85464220", "204823266", "208038692", "51715566", "195218386", "182542276", "52984863", "5008835", "52299225", "211207616", "119418562", "199102603", "208041189", "126896479", "197580096", "67788435", "57376871", "59232477", "3622968", "181328914", "44154838", "210041161", "53528470", "126105548", "59616369", "213828989", "202541171", "69947164", "13686857", "208229835", "67875280", "23620457"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5085777"}

In this work, we address the problem of joint demographic estimation and investigate the correlation through the morphological differences in 3D facial shapes. To this end, a set of facial features are extracted to capture the 3D shape differences among the demographic groups. Then, a correlation-based feature selection is applied to highlight salient features and remove redundancy.

Extensive experiments conducted on FRGCv2 dataset, under Expression-Dependent and Expression-Independent settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for the three traits, and also show the accuracy improvement when considering their correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the correlations of these facial soft-biometric traits using 3D faces.

This is useful for digital pathology, where text-based descriptors alone might be inadequate to accurately describe image content. By representing images via a set of quantitative image descriptors, the similarity between a query image with respect to archived, annotated images in a database can be computed and the most similar images retrieved. Recently, non-linear dimensionality reduction methods have become popular for embedding high-dimensional data into a reduced-dimensional space while preserving local object adjacencies, thereby allowing for object similarity to be determined more accurately in the reduced-dimensional space. However, most dimensionality reduction methods implicitly assume, in computing the reduced-dimensional representation, that all features are equally important. Aims : In this paper we present boosted spectral embedding (BoSE), which utilizes a boosted distance metric to selectively weight individual features (based on training data) to subsequently map the data into a reduced-dimensional space. Settings and Design : BoSE is evaluated against spectral embedding (SE) (which employs equal feature weighting) in the context of CBIR of digitized prostate and breast cancer histopathology images. Materials and Methods : The following datasets, which were comprised of a total of 154 hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology images, were used: (1) Prostate cancer histopathology (benign vs. malignant), (2) estrogen receptor (ER) + breast cancer histopathology (low vs. high grade), and (3) HER2+ breast cancer histopathology (low vs. high levels of lymphocytic infiltration). Statistical Analysis Used : We plotted and calculated the area under precision-recall curves (AUPRC) and calculated classification accuracy using the Random Forest classifier. Results : BoSE outperformed SE both in terms of CBIR-based (area under the precision-recall curve) and classifier-based (classification accuracy) on average across all of the dimensions tested for all three datasets: (1) Prostate cancer histopathology (AUPRC: BoSE = 0.79, SE = 0.63; Accuracy: BoSE = 0.93, SE = 0.80), (2) ER + breast cancer histopathology (AUPRC: BoSE = 0.79, SE = 0.68; Accuracy: BoSE = 0.96, SE = 0.96), and (3) HER2+ breast cancer histopathology (AUPRC: BoSE = 0.54, SE = 0.44; Accuracy: BoSE = 0.93, SE = 0.91).

Extensive evaluation of chemical products for potential adverse effects is a challenging task, due to the large number of chemicals and the possible hazardous effects on human health. Safety regulatory agencies around the world are dealing with two major challenges. First, the growth of chemicals introduced every year in household products and medicines that need to be tested, and second the need to protect public welfare. Hence, alternative and more efficient toxicological risk assessment methods are in high demand. The Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) consortium a collaborative effort was formed to develop and investigate alternative assessment methods. A collection of 10,000 compounds composed of environmental chemicals and approved drugs were screened for interference in biochemical pathways and released for crowdsourcing data analysis. The physicochemical space covered by Tox21 library was explored, measured by Molecular Weight (MW) and the octanol/water partition coefficient (cLogP). It was found that on average chemical structures had MW of 272.6 Daltons. In case of cLogP the average value was 2.476. Next relationships between assays were examined based on compounds activity profiles across the assays utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient r. A cluster was observed between the Androgen and Estrogen Receptors and their ligand bind domains accordingly indicating presence of cross talks among the receptors. The highest correlations observed were between NR.AR and NR.AR_LBD, where it was r=0.66 and between NR.ER and NR.ER_LBD, where it was r=0.5. Our approach to model the Tox21 data consisted of utilizing circular molecular fingerprints combined with Random Forest and Support Vector Machine by modeling each assay independently. In all of the 12 sub-challenges our modeling approach achieved performance equal to or higher than 0.7 ROC-AUC showing strong overall performance. Best performance was achieved in sub-challenges NR.AR_LBD, NR.ER_LDB and NR.PPAR_gamma, where ROC-AUC of 0.756, 0.790 and 0.803 was achieved accordingly.

Its open source nature makes it more prone to attacks creating a need for malware analysis. Main approaches for detecting malware intents of mobile applications are based on either static analysis or dynamic analysis. In static analysis, apps are inspected for suspicious patterns of code to identify malicious segments. However, several obfuscation techniques are available to provide a guard against such analysis. The dynamic analysis on the other hand is a behavior-based detection method that involves investigating the run-time behavior of the suspicious app to uncover malware. The present study extracts the system call behavior of 216 malicious apps and 278 normal apps to construct a feature vector for training a classifier. Seven data classification techniques including decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting trees, k-NN, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and deep learning were applied on this dataset. Three feature ranking techniques were usedto select appropriate features from the set of 337 attributes (system calls). These techniques of feature ranking included information gain, Chi-square statistic and correlation analysis by determining weights of the features. After discarding select features with low ranks the performances of the classifiers were measured using accuracy and recall. Experiments show that Support Vector Machines (SVM) after selecting features through correlation analysis outperformed other techniques where an accuracy of 97.16% is achieved with recall 99.54% (for malicious apps).

However, due to the bottleneck on data transmission and the limitation of energy storage, it is hard to conduct large seismic data acquisition in a real-time way. So, in this paper, an efficient seismic data acquisition method, namely, compressed sensing architecture with generative adversarial networks (CSA-GAN), is proposed to tackle the two restrictions of collecting large scale seismic data. In the CSA-GAN, a data collection architecture based on compressed sensing theory is applied to reduce data traffic load of the whole system, as well as balance the data transmission. To make the compressed sensing procedure perform well in both data quality and compression ratio, a kind of generative adversarial networks is designed to learn the recovering map.

The presented model explains 78% of the variance in the data and we estimate that approximately 250 Mt of POC are stored in surficial sediments of the study area (633,000 km2).

We demonstrate that the largest POC stocks are associated with coarse-grained sediments due to their wide-spread occurrence and high dry bulk densities. Our results also highlight the importance of coastal sediments for carbon storage and sequestration. Important predictors for POC include mud content in surficial sediments, annual average bottom temperature and distance to shoreline, with the latter possibly a proxy for terrestrial inputs.

The participants included two independent cohorts (Training set: 121 AD patients and 120 normal controls (NC); Testing set: 20 NC converters and 20 NC non-converters) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The multimodal results showed that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classification between NC converters and NC non-converters were 67.5% , 73.33% , and 64% , respectively. Furthermore, the classification results with feature selection increased to 70% accuracy, 75% sensitivity, and 66.67% specificity. The classification results using multimodal data are markedly superior to that using a single modality when we identified the conversion from NC to MCI or AD.

Particularly, MMOG clients share data with the server during game play. Game developers leverage this data to detect cheating. However, detecting cheats is challenging mainly due to the limited client-side information, along with unknown and complex cheating techniques. In this paper, we aim to leverage machine learning based models to predict cheats over encrypted game traffic during game play. Concretely, network game traffic during game play from each player can be used to determine whether a cheat is employed. A major challenge in developing such a prediction model is the availability of sufficient training data, which is sparingly available in practice. Game traffic obtained from a few known players can be easily labeled. However, if such players are not a good representation of the population (i.e., other players), then a supervised model trained on labeled game traffic from these set of players may not generalize well for the population.

In plant hosts, the viral proteins have several basic science implications and biotechnology applications. However in silico identification of these proteins is limited by their high sequence diversity. In this study we developed supervised learning based classification models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins in plant viruses. We developed four classifiers based on supervised learning algorithms: J48, Random Forest, LibSVM and Na\u00efve Bayes algorithms, with enriched model learning by correlation based feature selection. Structural and physicochemical features calculated for experimentally verified primary protein sequences were used to train the classifiers. The training features include amino acid composition; auto correlation coefficients; composition, transition, and distribution of various physicochemical properties; and pseudo amino acid composition. Performance analysis of predictive models based on 10 fold cross-validation and independent data testing revealed that the Random Forest based model was the best and achieved 86.11% overall accuracy and 86.22% balanced accuracy with a remarkably high area under the Receivers Operating Characteristic curve of 0.95 to predict viral RNA silencing suppressor proteins. The prediction models for plant viral RNA silencing suppressors can potentially aid identification of novel viral RNA silencing suppressors, which will provide valuable insights into the mechanism of RNA silencing and could be further explored as potential targets for designing novel antiviral therapeutics. Also, the key subset of identified optimal features may help in determining compositional patterns in the viral proteins which are important determinants for RNA silencing suppressor activities.

In the classical graph theory and some applications, graphs are generally provided in advance, or can at least be defined clearly. Thus, the main focus is to measure/analyze the graphs for mining informative patterns. However, for many real-world scenarios, the graph is often uncertain due to the fact that data associated with the vertices in the graph are high-dimensional, noisy, differently distributed, and even no clear definition. As a result, one needs to design or learn graphs from data prior to any analysis, which in turn affects the subsequent tasks. Therefore, constructing a high-quality graph has become an increasingly hot research problem, which inspired many graph construction methods being proposed in the past years. Since there has been no systematic summary on this topic, in this paper, we review the main-stream graph construction/learning methods involved in both general machine learning algorithms (including semi-supervised learning, clustering, manifold learning, and spectral kernel learning, etc.) and some specific applications (especially, the modeling and analysis of functional brain connectivity).

In general, for a given learning task, a set of parameters has to be chosen, each parameter corresponds to a different degree of \"complexity''. In this situation, the model selection procedure becomes a search for the optimal \"complexity'', allowing us to estimate a model that assures a good generalization. This model selection problem can be summarized as the calculation of one or more hyperparameters defining the model complexity in contrast to the parameters that allow to specify a model in the chosen complexity class. The usual approach to determine these parameters is to use a \"grid search''. Given a set of possible values, the generalization error for the best model is estimated for each of these values. This thesis is focused in an alternative approach consisting in calculating the complete set of possible solution for all hyperparameter values. This is what is called the regularization path. It can be shown that for the problems we are interested in, parametric quadratic programming (PQP), the corresponding regularization path is piecewise linear. Moreover, its calculation is no more complex than calculating a single PQP solution. This thesis is organized in three chapters, the first one introduces the general setting of a learning problem under the Support Vector Machines' (SVM) framework together with the theory and algorithms that allow us to find a solution. The second part deals with supervised learning problems for classification and ranking using the SVM framework. It is shown that the regularization path of these problems is piecewise linear and alternative proofs to the one of Rosset (2004) are given via the subdifferential. These results lead to the corresponding algorithms to solve the mentioned supervised problems. The third part deals with semi-supervised learning problems followed by unsupervised learning problems. For the semi-supervised learning a sparsity constraint is introduced along with the corresponding regularization path algorithm. Graph-based dimensionality reduction methods are used for unsupervised learning problems.

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a fast method to characterize fuels.

In this work, discrimination of fuel types and classification of flash point, freezing point, boiling point (10%, v/v), boiling point (50%, v/v), and boiling point (90%, v/v) of jet fuels (JP-5, JP-8, Jet A, and Jet A1) were investigated.

The class boundaries function as the threshold to alarm when the fuel properties change. Optimal partial least squares discriminant analysis (oPLS-DA), fuzzy rule-building expert system (FuRES), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to build the calibration models between the NIR spectra and classes of physical property of jet fuels. OPLS-DA, FuRES, and SVM were compared with respect to prediction accuracy. The validation of the calibration model was conducted by applying bootstrap Latin partition (BLP), which gives a measure of precision.

Studies have also shown some parameters to be dependent on the stage of the disease. We wanted to investigate the differences in high-resolution QEEG measures between groups of PD patients and healthy individuals, and come up with a small subset of features that could accurately distinguish between the two groups. Methods: High-resolution 256-channel EEG were recorded in 50 PD patients (age 68.8\u00b17.0y; female/male 17/33) and 41 healthy controls (age 71.1\u00b17.7y; female/male 20/22). Data was processed to calculate the relative power in alpha, theta, delta, beta frequency bands across the different regions of the brain. Median, peak frequencies were also obtained and alpha1/theta ratios were calculated. Machine learning methods were applied to the data and compared. Additionally, penalized Logistic regression using LASSO was applied to the data in R and a subset of best-performing features was obtained. Results: Random Forest and LASSO were found to be optimal methods for feature selection.

In this paper, we propose an incremental learning method, namely, heterogeneous incremental Nearest Class Mean Random Forest (hi-RF), to handle this issue. It is a heterogeneous method that either replaces trees or updates trees leaves in the random forest adaptively, to reduce the computational time in comparable performance, when data of new classes arrive. Specifically, to keep the accuracy, one proportion of trees are replaced by new NCM decision trees; to reduce the computational load, the rest trees are updated their leaves probabilities only. Most of all, out-of-bag estimation and out-of-bag boosting are proposed to balance the accuracy and the computational efficiency.

This work presents a study of several heuristic optimization methods for static security.

In addition to studying the performance of various optimization techniques, this work is concerned about viewing the SSE problem as a 2-class, a 3-class, or a 4-class classification problem, where each class is associated with a particular level of security. The performance of each method is presented in terms of classification accuracy and execution speed. It is shown that most optimization methods exhibit a similar performance.

From the result, fused feature by the parallel fusion; known as Euclidean distance (ed) demonstrated the highest performance with 80.0% accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity and 78.3% specificity.

However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difficult to fully capture the users' preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Specifically, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only review-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The final rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that CARL achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1712.02342", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3298988", "venue": "TOIS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951737079,2782111139", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61556494", "15067034", "3177797", "9932413", "4901952", "20970043", "351666", "9540398", "14163772", "6273876", "1964279", "13907106", "2896685", "4497054", "1306065", "207239982", "207168823", "12577605", "2095855", "207216684", "4895198", "6440341", "882396", "467086", "7285098", "22201036", "6844431", "18276949", "6157828", "17804904", "86850346", "17464854", "96163", "4833213", "3346047", "5535381", "18678433", "5180076"], "inbound_citations": ["53036120", "215722119", "54454024", "211526208", "215415783", "196204237", "195657811", "197928119"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37633629"}

However, it is not considered an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia, possibly because previous studies did not assess the contribution of individual thalamic nuclei and employed univariate statistics. Here, we hypothesized that multivariate statistics would reveal an association of GMV in different thalamic nuclei with familial risk for schizophrenia. We also hypothesized that accounting for the heterogeneity of thalamic GMV in healthy controls would improve the detection of subjects at familial risk for the disorder. We acquired MRI scans for 96 clinically stable SCZ, 55 non-affected siblings of patients with schizophrenia (SIB), and 249 HC. The thalamus was parceled into seven regions of interest (ROIs). After a canonical univariate analysis, we used GMV estimates of thalamic ROIs, together with total thalamic GMV and premorbid intelligence, as features in Random Forests to classify HC, SIB, and SCZ. Then, we computed a Misclassification Index for each individual and tested the improvement in SIB detection after excluding a subsample of HC misclassified as patients. Random Forests discriminated SCZ from HC (accuracy = 81%) and SIB from HC (accuracy = 75%).

Focusing on discriminative tasks, MKL has been used successfully for feature selection and finding the significant modalities of the data. In such applications, each base kernel represents one dimension of the data or is derived from one specific descriptor. Therefore, MKL finds an optimal weighting scheme for the given kernels to increase the classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the majority of the works in this area focus on only binary classification problems or aim for linear separation of the classes in the kernel space, which are not realistic assumptions for many real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-class MKL framework which improves the state-of-the-art by enhancing the local separation of the classes in the feature space. Besides, by using a sparsity term, our large-margin multiple kernel algorithm (LMMK) performs discriminative feature selection by aiming to employ a small subset of the base kernels. Based on our empirical evaluations on different real-world datasets, LMMK provides a competitive classification accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in MKL.

For a specific pattern classification problem, a classifier is computer software. It is developed so that objects ( x ) are classified correctly with reasonably good accuracy. Through training using input-output pairs, classifiers acquire decision functions that classify an input datum into one of the given classes ( i \uf077 ). In pattern recognition applications we rarely if ever have the prior probability ) ( i P \uf077 or the class-conditional density ) | ( i x p \uf077 . of complete knowledge about the probabilistic structure of the problem. In a typical case we merely have some vague, general knowledge about the situation, together with a number of design samples or training data\u2014particular representatives of the patterns we want to training classify. The problem, then, is to find some way to use this information to design or data train the classifier. The organization of this chapter is to address those cases where a great deal of information about the models is known and to move toward problems where the form of the distributions are unknown and even the category membership of training patterns is unknown. We begin in Bayes decision theory(Sec.2) by considering the ideal case in which the probability structure underlying the categories is known perfectly. In Sec.3(Maximum Likelihood) we address the case when the full probability structure underlying the categories is not known, but the general forms of their distributions are the models. Thus the uncertainty about a probability distribution is represented by the values of some unknown parameters, and we seek to determine these parameters to attain the best categorization. In Sec.4(Nonparametric techniques)we move yet further from the Bayesian ideal,and assume that we have no prior parameterized knowledge about the underlying probability structure;in essence our classification will be based on information provided by training samples alone. Classic techniques such as the nearest-neighbor algorithm and potential functions play an important role here. We then in Sec.5(Support Vector Machine) Next, in Sec.6(Nonlinear Discriminants and Neural Networks)we see how some of the ideas from such linear discriminants can be extended to a class of very powerful algorithms such as backpropagation and others for multilayer neural networks; these neural techniques have a range of useful properties that have made them a mainstay in contemporary pattern recognition research. In Sec.7(Stochastic Methods)we discuss simulated annealing by the Boltzmann learning algorithm and other stochastic methods. We explore the behaviour of such algorithms with regard to the matter of local minima that can plague other neural methods.

Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (>20 m3 ha\u22121). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rond\u00f4nia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (< 15 m3 ha\u22121). We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Par\u00e1, northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/451856", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949582991", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["153487984", "36681865", "85896854", "13717806", "43636862", "9542121", "205658048", "206656453", "40864243", "4392377", "2963560", "214846450", "89141", "45959431", "15361636", "129255276", "40373829", "144565557", "18532582", "45498720", "90566180", "3563731", "42885833", "28662431", "23541992", "206786900", "154670144", "4641707", "129559211", "4670952", "3093707", "85831627", "130525017", "6984570", "204992349", "9555747", "128818929", "52074310", "84511933", "85085779", "4001003", "22571556", "129022625", "109926873", "55236409", "85951043", "57790935", "119923525", "37633535", "129360174", "140591798", "9193083", "15360641", "13188611", "14766564"], "inbound_citations": ["203691843"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196656109"}

A number of previous studies have explored the relationships between air pollution and related factors. However, the methods currently used either cannot well address the multicollinearity problem or fail to explain the importance of the influential factors. Moreover, most of the existing literature limited their studied area in a city or a small region and studied factors in one aspect. There is a lack of studies that analyze the influential factors from the perspective of a country or take into consideration multiple variables. To fill the research gap, this paper proposes a multivariate analysis in the national scale to investigate the most important factors of air quality. In order to study as much influential factors as possible, 171 features ranging from environmental, demographical, economic, meteorological, and energy, were collected and analyzed. To tackle such a \u201cbig data\u201d problem, a non-linear machine learning algorithm namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is utilized to model the relationship and measure the variable importance. Geographical Information System (GIS) is employed to preprocess the diversified variables and visualize the results. Performance of XGBoost is compared with other models and its parameters are tuned using Bayesian Optimization.

The SVM extracts implicitly these rules from properly preprocessed features and obtains generalization performance founded upon a robust mathematical basis. The potentiality of obtaining generalization potential even in feature spaces of high dimensionality bypasses the problems due to overtraining of the conventional machine learning architectures. The paper considers the optimization of the generalization performance of the SVM.

There are two challenges in the traditional supervised machine learning. One is that the test data distribution always differs largely from the training data distribution in the real world, while another is that there is usually very few labeled data to train a machine learning model. In such cases, transfer learning, which emphasizes the transfer of the previous knowledge from different but related domains and tasks, is recommended to deal with these problems. Traditional transfer learning methods care more about the data itself rather than the task. In fact, there is no one universal feature representation can perfectly benefit the model training work. But different feature representations can discover some independent latent knowledge from the original data. In this paper, we propose an instance-based transfer learning method, which is a weighted ensemble transfer learning framework with multiple feature representations. In our work, mutual information is applied as the smart weighting schema to measure the weight of each feature representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three facial expression recognition data sets: JAFFE, KDEF and FERG-DB.

The focus has been on devising ways of identifying individuals at risk of sustaining such falls. The main aim of this work is to explore the effectiveness of models based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the automated recognition of gait patterns that exhibit falling behavior. Minimum toe clearance (MTC) during continuous walking on a treadmill was recorded on 10 healthy elderly and 10 elderly with balance problems and with a history of tripping falls. Statistical features obtained from MTC histograms were used as inputs to the SVM model to classify between the healthy and balance-impaired subjects. The leave-one-out technique was utilized for training the SVM model in order to find the optimal model parameters. Tests were conducted with various kernels (linear, Gaussian and polynomial) and with a change in the regularization parameter, C, in an effort to identify the optimum model for this gait data. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots of sensitivity and specificity were further used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the model. The maximum accuracy was found to be 90% using a Gaussian kernel with \u03c32 = 10 and the maximum ROC area 0.98 (80% sensitivity and 100% specificity), when all statistical features were used by the SVM models to diagnose gait patterns of healthy and balance-impaired individuals. This accuracy was further improved by using a feature selection method in order to reduce the effect of redundant features. It was found that two features (standard deviation and maximum value) were adequate to give an improved accuracy of 95% (90% sensitivity and 100% specificity) using a polynomial kernel of degree 2.

However, due to their lower reliability and noisy nature, it is challenging to automatically identify social media images that genuinely contain evidence of natural disasters. Visual features have been popular for classifying these images while the associated metadata are often ignored or exploited only to a limited extent. To test their potential, we employed them separately to identify social media images with flooding evidence. For visual feature extraction, we utilized three advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) pre-trained on two different types of datasets and used a simple neural network for the classification. The results demonstrate that the combination of two types of visual features have a positive impact on distinguishing natural disaster images. From metadata, we considered only the textual metadata. Here, we combined all textual metadata and extracted bi-gram features. Then we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification task. The results show that the combination of the textual metadata can improve the classification accuracy compared to their individual counterparts.

This is a particularly common though threatened agroforestry system in Central America, the main reasons being intensive production and specific disease spread. The objective is to find an efficient methodology for identification of coffee-banana agroforestry in the context of land use and cover (LUC) classification.

Hyperspectral visible-near and short wave infrared MASTER and spaceborne high spatial resolution GeoEye-1 data will be used as basis for image processing and analysis.

With the high-speed development of the internet and information systems, some performance issues are certain to arise when the traditional CRFs deals with such massive data. This paper proposes SCRFs, which is a parallel optimization of CRFs based on the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) in the Spark computing framework. SCRFs optimizes the traditional CRFs from these stages: First, with all features are generated in parallel, the intermediate data which will be used frequently are all cached into the memory to speed up the iteration efficiency. By removing the low-frequency features of the model, SCRFs can also prevent the overfitting of the model to improve the prediction effect. Second, some specific features are dynamically added in parallel to correct the model in the training process. And for implementing the efficient prediction, a max-sum algorithm is proposed to infer the most likely state sequence by extending the belief propagation algorithm. Finally, we implement SCRFs base on the version of Spark 1.6.0, and evaluate its performance using two widely used benchmarks: Named Entity Recognition and Chinese Word Segmentation. Compared with the traditional CRFs models running on the Hadoop and Spark platforms respectively, the experimental results illustrate that SCRFs has obvious advantages in terms of the model accuracy and the iteration performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10723-017-9404-4", "venue": "Journal of Grid Computing", "journal": "Journal of Grid Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2724250519", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["43202911", "3643047", "277918", "15356774", "122598442", "42670095", "15846038", "62363148", "13936575", "11358505", "775373", "6293794", "12943282", "6398414", "1978101", "115963355", "6945869", "5681609", "14936636", "120489597", "24284126", "290841", "11522524", "3782176", "124055292", "2440527", "13055354", "214797870", "12151269", "17875096", "17810195", "8715689", "7382248", "7575614", "1089413", "10181055", "13938040", "16202552", "7582283"], "inbound_citations": ["52049564", "52274886", "214692521"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33033916"}

Most of existing machine learning models for CPI prediction often represent compounds and proteins in one-dimensional strings, or use the descriptor-based methods. These models might ignore the fact that molecules are essentially structured by the chemical bond of atoms. However, in real-world scenarios, the topological structure information usually provides an overview of how the atoms are connected, and the local chemical context reveals the functionality of the protein sequence in CPI. These two types of information are complementary to each other and they are both important for modeling compounds and proteins. Motivated by this, this paper suggests an end-to-end deep learning framework called GraphCPI, which captures the structural information of compounds and leverages the chemical context of protein sequences for solving the CPI prediction task. Our framework can integrate any popular graph nerual networks for learning compounds, and it combines with a convolutional neural network for embedding sequences.

A novel feature extraction technique based on the CTZM algorithm is developed. The contourlet transform provides the multiscale decomposition for flame radical images and the selected operator based on Zernike moments is designed to provide the well-defined structure for the images. The resulted image features are a variable structure, which is originated from the CTZM. Finally, the variable features of the images of four flame radicals (OH*, CN*, CH*, and $\\text{C}^{\\ast }_{2}$ ) are defined. The relationship between the variable features of radical images and NO x emissions is established through radial basis function network modeling, SVR modeling, and the LS-SVR modeling. A comparison between the three modeling approaches shows that the LS-SVR model outperforms the other two methods in terms of root-mean-square error and mean relative error criteria. In addition, the structure of the image features has a significant impact on the performance of the prediction models.

An extension of these ideas to massively parallel, connectianist models appears to offer a number of advantages. After a preliminary discussion, this paper introduces a general connectionist model and considers how it might be used in cognitive science. Among the issues addressed are: stability and noise-sensitivity, distributed decisionmaking, time and sequence problems, and the representation of complex concepts. Much of the progress in the fields constituting cognitive science has been based upon the use of concrete information processing models (IPM), almost exclusively patterned after conventional sequential computers. There are several reasons for trying to extend IPM to cases where the computations are carried out by a parallel computational engine with perhaps billions of active units. As an introduction, we will attempt to motivate the current interest in massively parallel models from four different perspectives: anatomy, computational complexity, technology, and the role of formal languages in science. It is the last of these which is of primary concern here. We will focus upon a particular formalism, connectionist models (CM), which is based explicitly on an abstraction of our current understanding of the information processing properties of neurons. Animal brains do not compute like a conventional computer. Comparatively slow (millisecond) neural computing elements with complex, parallel connections form a structure which is dramatically different from a high-speed, predominantly serial machine. Much of current research in the neurosciences is concerned with tracing out these connections and with discovering how they transfer information. One purpose of this paper is to suggest how connectionist theories of the brain can be used to produce", "year": 1982, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/s0364-0213(82)80001-3", "venue": "Cognitive Science", "journal": "Cognitive Science", "mag_id": "2112325651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62225923"}

No need for very high sampling frequency is another advantage of the proposed approach.

The prediction of the shape of the spine from the first visit could guide the management of AIS and provide the right treatment to prevent curve progression. Method In this work, we propose a novel approach based on a statistical generative model to predict the shape variation of the spinal curve from the first visit. A spinal curve progression approach is learned using 3D spine models generated from retrospective biplanar X-rays. The prediction is performed every three months from the first visit, for a time lapse of one year and a half. An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was computed to obtain Independent Components (ICs), which are used to describe the main directions of shape variations. A dataset of 3D shapes of 150 patients with AIS was employed to extract the ICs, which were used to train our approach. Results The approach generated an estimation of the shape of the spine through time. The estimated shape differs from the real curvature by 1.83, 5.18, and 4.79\u00b0 of Cobb angles in the proximal thoracic, main thoracic, and thoraco-lumbar lumbar sections, respectively. Conclusions The results obtained from our approach indicate that predictions based on ICs are very promising. ICA offers the means to identify the variation in the 3D space of the evolution of the shape of the spine. Another advantage of using ICs is that they can be visualized for interpretation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30336363", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.09.029", "venue": "Computers in biology and medicine", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "mag_id": "2895777734", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201041121"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53011890"}

As the number of agents increases, nonstationarity gets more serious in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which brings great difficulties to the learning process. Besides, current mainstream algorithms configure each agent an independent network,so that the memory usage increases linearly with the number of agents which greatly slows down the interaction with the environment. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), this paper proposes an iterative update method (IU) to stabilize the nonstationary environment. Further, we add first-person perspective and represent all agents by only one network which can change agents' policies from sequential compute to batch compute. Similar to continual lifelong learning, we realize the iterative update method in this unified representative network (IUUR). In this method, iterative update can greatly alleviate the nonstationarity of the environment, unified representation can speed up the interaction with environment and avoid the linear growth of memory usage. Besides, this method does not bother decentralized execution and distributed deployment.

The night-time light (NTL) imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\u2019s Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) provides one of the most important ways to evaluate an economy with low cost and high efficiency. However, little research has addressed the transferability of the estimation across years. Based on the entire DN series from 0 to 63 of NTL data and GDP data in 31 provinces of mainland China from 2000 to 2012, this paper aims to study the transferability of economy estimation across years, with four linear and non-linear data mining methods, including the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Local Weighted Regression (LWR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR).

Generally, most protein fractions determined in Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS), especially the neutral detergent insoluble protein (NDFCP) and acid detergent insoluble protein (ADFCP), could not be accurately predicted by the commonly used partial least squares (PLS) method. A recently developed chemometric method, SVM, was applied in NIRS prediction of alfalfa protein fractions in this study. Two hundred thirty alfalfa samples were scanned on a near infrared reflectance spectrophotometer, and analyzed for crude protein (CP), true protein precipitated in tungstic acid (TCP), borate-phosphate buffer-insoluble protein (BICP), NDFCP, and ADFCP. These 5 laboratory proteins and the CNCPS protein fractions A, B1, B2, B3, and C were predicted by NIRS using the PLS and SVM methods. According to PLS-NIRS regression, CP, TCP, BICP, A, and B2 obtained the determination coefficient of prediction (R(p)(2)) of 0.96, 0.91, 0.94, 0.94, and 0.93, and the ratios of standard deviation of prediction samples: standard error of prediction samples (RPD) values were 5.07, 3.31, 3.98, 3.96, and 3.91. Neutral detergent insoluble protein, ADFCP (fraction C), B1, and B3 were predicted with R(p)(2) of 0.75, 0.83, 0.30, and 0.62, and RPD values of 1.98, 2.42, 1.20, and 1.62; Calibrated by the SVM-NIRS method, R(p)(2) values of CP, TCP, BICP, NDFCP, ADFCP(C), A, and B2 achieved 0.99, 0.97, 0.97, 0.90, 0.93, 0.97, and 0.97, respectively.

In this study, the chemical analysis results of B1 and B3 were also correlated with calculated results from TCP-BICP and NDFCP-ADFCP, which were predicted by SVM-NIRS models. The B1 protein fraction achieved R(p)(2) and RPD values of 0.87 and 3.61, whereas values for B2 were 0.75 and 2.00.

It is important to identify a method for efficient diagnosis at early stage. In the present study gene expression profile data, generated from microarray data, were pretreated according to the annotation files. The genes were mapped to pathways of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Dysregulated pathways and dysregulated pathway pairs were identified and constructed into individual networks, and a main network was constructed from individual networks with several edges.

Subsequently, 50 runs of Monte Carlo cross\u2011validation were used to screen the optimal main network. The results indicated that a total of 4,929 genes were identified in the pathways and gene expression profile. By combining dysregulated pathways with Z<0.05 and dysregulated pathway pairs with Z<0.2, individual networks were constructed. The optimal main network with the highest AUC value was identified. In the HCV group, the network was identified with an AUC value of 0.98, including 41 pairs of pathways, and in the HBV group, the network was identified with an AUC value of 0.94, including eight pairs of pathways.

We used backpropagation neural network (BNN) as a benchmark and obtained prediction accuracy around 80% for both BNN and SVM methods for the United States and Taiwan markets. However, only slight improvement of SVM was observed. Another direction of the research is to improve the interpretability of the AI-based models.

Big Data always involve massive data but they also often include online data and data heterogeneity. Recently some statistical methods have been adapted to process Big Data, like linear regression models, clustering methods and bootstrapping schemes. Based on decision trees combined with aggregation and bootstrap ideas, random forests were introduced by Breiman in 2001. They are a powerful nonparametric statistical method allowing to consider in a single and versatile framework regression problems, as well as two-class and multi-class classification problems. Focusing on classification problems, this paper proposes a selective review of available proposals that deal with scaling random forests to Big Data problems. These proposals rely on parallel environments or on online adaptations of random forests. We also describe how related quantities -- such as out-of-bag error and variable importance -- are addressed in these methods. Then, we formulate various remarks for random forests in the Big Data context. Finally, we experiment five variants on two massive datasets (15 and 120 millions of observations), a simulated one as well as real world data. One variant relies on subsampling while three others are related to parallel implementations of random forests and involve either various adaptations of bootstrap to Big Data or to ``divide-and-conquer'' approaches. The fifth variant relates on online learning of random forests. These numerical experiments lead to highlight the relative performance of the different variants, as well as some of their limitations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1511.08327", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bdr.2017.07.003", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "2174668940,2963100393,2953369645", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201833639", "53098643", "195847619", "202120284", "53304046", "211252615", "135388257", "204884357", "207758079", "57190952", "57427535", "155615343", "195064186", "210710459", "210961915", "86650001", "4080730", "209099047", "59527909", "3337304", "57760796", "59620125", "211244075", "53976846", "199473925", "53278172", "28355521"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1966558"}

Atotal of 39 musical features were extracted from the audio. Models were then constructed from theseto explain self-reports of valence and arousal, by using multiple andRandom Forest regression. The models were fully validated across the datasets, suggesting low generalizability between the genres for valence (16% variance was accounted for) and moderately good generalizability between the genres for arousal (43%).

The software development process is knowledge-intensive and under a dynamic development environment, which will increase the difficulty of software effort estimation. Therefore, software effort estimation is one of the most challenging activities in software development process. According to the idea of model integration and combination forecasting, the study puts forward the support vector regression based combination of multiple case-based reasoning to estimate software effort, in order to overcome the shortage of single estimation model and improve the estimation accuracy. The basic case-based reasoning(CBR) method for software effort estimation, including Similarity measure, Weight optimization, Number of most similar projects and project adaptation, Evaluation criterion, is introduced. Furthermore, six independent CBR methods, derived from Euclidean distance(Euc-CBR), Manhattan distance(Man-CBR), Minkowski distance(Min-CBR), Grey Relational Coefficient(Gre-CBR), Gaussian distance(Gau-CBR) and Mahalanobis distance(Mah-CBR) are constructed for software effort estimation based on the literature review. Moreover, particle swarm optimization(PSO) is adopted to determine suitable weights for each attribute due to its strong search capability.The CBR methods proposed in the study identify the estimation relationship between effort and other attribute from different aspects, and get a different estimation result, which will generates a gap between the estimation results. For this reason, the study applies the support vector regression(SVR)to combine the multiple CBR estimation results in order to integrate the estimated knowledge and improve estimation accuracy. Based on statistical learning theory, SVR have good generalization ability considering the structural risk minimization principle. The structure diagram of SVR based Combination estimation model is described detailedly. The experiment is carried out using Desharnais dataset. The study compares the results of different CBR methods from the MMRE, Md MRE and Pred(0.25) evaluation criterions at both training and testing stages. Experimental results indicate that there is not obvious difference between Euc-CBR, Min-CBR, Gau-CBR and Mah-CBR. However, the Gre-CBR and Man-CBR outperform the other independent methods slightly. The results from the comparison between combination estimation and single CBR estimation show that the SVR combination method outperforms the independent CBR methods. Moreover, the results also show that the SVR combination method can get more accurate estimation than other linear combination methods such as Mean Combination estimation model, Median Combination estimation model, Best Combination estimation model, WMC Combination estimation model.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IEEM 2015", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2389054413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63537269"}

To cope with these challenges, we design a cascaded network architecture that unrolls the proximal gradient iterations by permeating benefits from generative residual networks (ResNet) to modeling the proximal operator. A mixture of pixel-wise and perceptual costs is then deployed to train proximals. The overall architecture resembles back-and-forth projection onto the intersection of feasible and plausible images. Extensive computational experiments are examined for a global task of reconstructing MR images of pediatric patients, and a more local task of superresolving CelebA faces, that are insightful to design efficient architectures. Our observations indicate that for MRI reconstruction, a recurrent ResNet with a single residual block effectively learns the proximal.

In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and Support Vector Machine (SVM), an inductive machine learning technique, to develop and apply a predictive GPP model for the conterminous U.S. In the following four-step process, we first trained the SVM to predict flux-based GPP from 33 AmeriFlux sites between 2000 and 2003 using three remotely-sensed variables (land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover) and one ground-measured variable (incident shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated model performance by predicting GPP for 24 available AmeriFlux sites in 2004. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted GPP with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.87 gC/m(2)/day and an R-2 of 0.71. Based on annual total GPP at 15 AmeriFlux sites for which the number of 8-day averages in 2004 was no less than 67%(30 out of a possible 45), annual SVM GPP prediction error was 32.1% for non-forest ecosystems and 22.2% for forest ecosystems, while the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP product (MOD17) had an error of 50.3% for non-forest ecosystems and 21.5% for forest ecosystems, suggesting that the regionally tuned SVM performed better than the standard global MOD 17 GPP for non-forest ecosystems but had similar performance for forest ecosystems. The most important explanatory factor for GPP prediction was EVI, removal of which increased GPP RMSE by 0.85 gC/m2/day in a cross-validation experiment. Third, using the SVM driven by remote sensing data including incident shortwave radiation, we predicted 2004 conterminous U.S. GPP and found that results were consistent with expected spatial and temporal patterns. Finally, as an illustration of SVM GPP for ecological applications, we estimated maximum light use efficiency (e(max)), one of the most important factors for standard light use efficiency models, for the conterminous U.S. by integrating the 2004 SVM GPP with the MOD17 GPP algorithm. We found that emax varied from similar to 0.86 gC/MJ in grasslands to similar to 1.56 gC/MJ in deciduous forests, while MOD17 emax was 0.68 gC/MJ for grasslands and 1.16 gC/MJ for deciduous forests, suggesting that refinements of MOD17 emax may be beneficial. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Partly this diversity just reflects the breadth of the domain: language processing embraces everything from phoneme recognition to such areas as parsing, sentence disambiguation, story understanding, and speech generation. Human language processing is a vast complex of distinguishable capacities, and connectionism has been busily chipping away at any aspect that seems to lend itself to neural processing. However, the diversity of connectionist efforts also reflects some real theoretical differences over what kinds of mechanisms one needs, in principle, to be able to generate plausible models and hence adequate explanations. It is an increasingly common observation that, at one end of the connectionist spectrum, there are those who feel that no serious account of language processing can hope to avoid relying on explicit rules, some measure of serial processing, complexly structured representations, variable binding and so forth, and regard neural networks as a useful new way to implement such mechanisms; while at the other end there are those who regard connectionist methods as an excellent excuse to avoid all such baroque entanglements, and hope that self-generated, dynamic, distributed, gestalt-style representations will be the only necessary intermediaries between the ear and the vocal chords.

In this paper, we propose a framework to alleviate the accuracy decline when semantic segmentation is taken to adverse conditions by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To bridge the daytime and nighttime image domains, we made key observation that compared to datasets in adverse conditions, there are considerable amount of segmentation datasets in standard conditions such as BDD and our collected ZJU datasets. Our GAN-based nighttime semantic segmentation framework includes two methods. In the first method, GANs were used to translate nighttime images to the daytime, thus semantic segmentation can be performed using robust models already trained on daytime datasets. In another method, we use GANs to translate different ratio of daytime images in the dataset to the nighttime but still with their labels. In this sense, synthetic nighttime segmentation datasets can be generated to yield models prepared to operate at nighttime conditions robustly. In our experiment, the later method significantly boosts the performance at the nighttime evidenced by quantitative results using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Pixel Accuracy (Acc).

Second, a stacked autoencoder-based deep neural network is constructed to characterize the correlation among process variables. Considering that the time and batch directions may be dynamic, for each time-slice measurement, a constructed 2D measurement containing samples from previous time instants and batches is then obtained.

For the lexicon-based approach, it requires a sentiment lexicon to determine the opinion polarity. There are many existing benchmark sentiment lexicons, but they cannot cover all the domain-specific words meanings. Thus, automatic generation of a domain-specific sentiment lexicon becomes an important task. We propose a framework to automatically generate sentiment lexicon. First, we determine the semantic similarity between two words in the entire unlabeled corpus. We treat the words as nodes and similarities as weighted edges to construct word graphs.

{"paper_id": "119724625", "title": "AFFECT AFFECT RECOGNITION IN SPEECH?", "authors": [{"first": "Khiet", "middle": ["P."], "last": "Truong", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The automatic analysis of affect is a relatively new and challenging multidisciplinary research area that has gained a lot of interest over the past few years. The research ::: and development of affect recognition systems has opened many opportunities for improving the interaction between man and machine. Although affect can be expressed through multimodal means like hand gestures, facial expressions, and body postures, this dissertation has focused on speech (i.e., vocal expressions) as the main carrier of affect. Speech carries a lot of \u2018hidden\u2019 information. By hearing a voice only, humans can guess who is speaking, what language he/she is speaking (or accent or dialect), what age he/she is etc. The goal of automatic speech recognition (ASR) is ::: to recognize what is said. In automatic speech-based emotion recognition, the goal is to recognize how something is said. In this work, several experiments are described ::: which were carried out to investigate how affect can be automatically recognized in speech. ::: One of the first steps in developing speech-based affect recognizers involves finding a spontaneous speech corpus that is labeled with emotions. Machine learning techniques, that are often used to build these recognizers, require these data to learn how to associate specific speech features (e.g., pitch, energy) with certain emotions. ::: However, collecting and labeling real affective speech data has appeared to be difficult. Efforts to collecting affective speech data in the field have been described in this work. As an alternative, speech corpora that contain acted emotional speech (actors are asked to portray certain emotions) have often been used. Advantages of these corpora ::: are that the recording conditions can be controlled, the emotions portrayed can be clearly associated with an emotion label, the costs and effort required to collect ::: such corpora are relatively low, and the recordings are usually made available to the research community. In this work, an acted emotional speech corpus (containing basic, universal emotions like Anger, Boredom, Disgust, Fear, appiness, Neutral, and Sadness) was used to explore and apply recognition techniques and evaluation frameworks, adopted from similar research areas like automatic speaker and language recognition, to automatic emotion recognition. Recognizers were evaluated in a detection framework, and an evaluation for handling so-called \u2018out-of-set\u2019 emotions ::: (unknown emotions that were not present in the training data, but which can occur in real-life situations) was presented. Partly due to lack of standardization and shared ::: databases, the evaluation of affect recognizers remains somewhat problematic. While evaluation is an important aspect in development, it has been a relatively underexposed ::: topic of investigation in the emotion research community. ::: The main objections against the use of acted emotional speech corpora are that the expressions are not \u2018real\u2019 but rather portrayals of prototype emotions (and hence, ::: expressed rather exaggeratedly), and the emotions portrayed do not often occur in real life situations. Therefore, in this work, spontaneous data has also been used ::: and methods were developed to recognize spontaneous, vocal expressions of affect, like laughter. The task of the laughter detector was to recognize audible laughter ::: in meeting speech data. Using a combination of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and a combination of prosodic and spectral speech features, relatively low error rates between 3%\u201312% were achieved. Although the detector did not interpret the affective meaning of the laughter, the detection of laughter alone was informative enough. Part of these findings were used to build a so-called \u2018Affective Mirror\u2019 that successfully elicited and recognized laughter with different user groups. ::: Other speech phenomena related to vocal expressions of affect, also in the context of meeting speech data, are the expressions of opinions and sentiments. In this work, it was assumed that opinions are expressed differently from factual statements in terms of tone of voice, and the words used. Classification experiments were carried out to find the best combination of lexical and prosodic features for the discrimination between subjective and non-subjective clauses. As lexical features, word-level, phone-level, and character-level n-grams were used. The experiments showed that a combination of all features yields the best performances, and that the prosodic features were the weakest of all features investigated. In addition, a second task was formulated, namely the discrimination between positive subjective clauses and negative subjective clauses. Similar results for this task were found. The relatively high error rates for both tasks, Cdet = 26%\u201330%, indicat that these are more difficult recognition problems than that of laughter: the relation between prosodic and lexical features, and subjectivity and polarity (i.e., positive vs. negative), is not as clear as is in the case of laughter. As an intermediate between real affective expressions and acted expressions, elicited affective expressions were employed in this dissertation in several human perception and classification experiments. To this end, a multimodal corpus with elicited affect was recorded. Affective vocal and facial expressions were elicited via a multiplayer first-person shooter video game (Unreal Tournament) that was manipulated by the experimenter. These expressions were captured by close-talk microphones and high-quality webcams, and were afterwards rated by the players themselves on Arousal (active-passive) and Valence (positive-negative) scales. After post-processing the data, perception and classification experiments were carried out on this data. ::: The first experiment carried out with this unique kind of data tried to answer the question how the level of agreement between observers on the perceived emotion is ::: affected when audio-only, video-only, audiovisual, or audiovisual + context information clips containing affective expressions are shown. The observers were asked to ::: rate each clip on Arousal and Valence scales. The results showed that the agreement among human observers was highest when audiovisual clips were shown. Furthermore, the observers reached higher agreement on Valence judgments than Arousal judgments. Additionally, the results indicated that the \u2018self\u2019-ratings of the gamers themselves differed somewhat from the \u2018observed\u2019-ratings of the human observers. ::: This finding was further investigated in a second xperiment. Six raters re-annotated a substantial part of the corpus. The results confirmed that there is a discrepancy between what the \u2018self\u2019-raters (i.e., the gamers themselves) experienced/felt and what observers perceive based on the gamers\u2019 vocal and facial expressions. This finding has consequences for the development of automatic affect analyzers that use these ratings: the goal of affect analyzers can be to recognize \u2018felt\u2019 affect, or to recognize \u2018observed/perceived\u2019 affect. Two different types of speech-based affect recognizers were developed in parallel to recognize either \u2018felt\u2019 or \u2018perceived\u2019 affect on continuous Arousal and Valence scales. The results showed that \u2018felt\u2019 emotions are much harder to predict than \u2018perceived\u2019 emotions. Although these recognizers performed moderately from a classification perspective, the recognizers did not perform too bad in comparison to human performance. The recognizers developed depend much on how ::: the affect data is rated by humans; if this data reflects moderate human judgments of affect, then it can be difficult for the machine to perform well (in an absolute sense). ::: The work presented in this dissertation shows that the automatic recognition of affect in speech is complicated by the fact that real affect, as encountered in reallife ::: situations, is a very complex phenomenon that sometimes cannot be described straightforwardly in ways that can be useful for computer scientists (who would like to build affect recognizers). The use of real affect data has led to the development of recognizers that are more targeted toward affect-related expressions. Laughter and subjectivity are examples of such affect-related expressions.

As a result, each time a new clinical application of WCE appears, a new CAD system has to be designed from the scratch. This makes the design of new CAD systems very time consuming. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a system for small intestine motility characterization, based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, which circumvents the laborious step of designing specific features for individual motility events. Experimental results show the superiority of the learned features over alternative classifiers constructed using state-of-the-art handcrafted features.

This study aims to reduce the noise level in each DG bin using a generative adversarial network (GAN). We used the XCAT phantom to generate a Tc-99m-MIBI DG dataset with cardiac and respiratory motion. A 5-s respiratory and a 1-s cardiac cycle were divided into 24 and 48 frames respectively, and then grouped to 6 respiratory and 8 cardiac gates, i.e., a total of 48 gates.

Eighteen DG bins, i.e., a total of 2052 images (18\u00d7114 axial slices), were paired with the corresponding single cardiac gate for training. Six other DGs of the same cardiac gate were tested by the GAN, which consisted of a 16-layer generator and a 5-layer discriminator implemented on a NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU. The DG images w/ and w/o denoising were then registered to the end-expiration gate and summed to a cardiac image. The noise level, measured as the normalized standard deviation (NSD) on a 2D uniform region on the liver, was compared for a single cardiac gate (C8) and the registered cardiac image w/o (C8-REG) and w/ (C8-GAN) denoising. The NSD was 0.219, 0.229 and 0.093 for C8, C8-REG and C8-GAN respectively. The noise level substantially reduced for the DG images when GAN was applied, with minimal increase of motion blurring.

We focus on facial expression analysis since the face is one of the least occluded parts of the body and facial expressions are one of the most visible manifestations of affect. We explore the different psychological theories on affect and emotion, different ways to represent and classify emotions and the relationship between facial expressions and underlying emotions. We present the use of multiscale Gaussian derivatives as an image descriptor for head pose estimation, smile detection before using it for affect sensing. Principal Component Analysis is used for dimensionality reduction while Support Vector Machines are used for classification and regression. We are able to employ the same, simple and effective architecture for head pose estimation, smile detection and affect sensing. We also demonstrate that not only do multiscale Gaussian derivatives perform better than the popular Gabor Filters but are also computationally less expensive to compute. While performing these experiments we discovered that multiscale Gaussian derivatives do not provide an appropriately discriminative image description when the face is only partly illuminated. We overcome this problem by combining Gaussian derivatives with Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histograms. This combination helps us achieve state-of-the-art results for smile detection on the benchmark GENKI database which contains images of people in the \"wild\" collected from the internet. We use the same description method for face recognition on the CMU-PIE database and the challenging extended YaleB database and our results compare well with the state-of-the-art. In the case of face recognition we use metric learning for classification, adopting the Minkowski distance as the similarity measure. We find that L1 and L2 norms are not always the optimum distance metrics and the optimum is often an Lp norm where p is not an integer. Lastly we develop a multi-modal system for depression estimation with audio and video information as input. We use Local Binary Patterns -Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) features to capture intra-facial movements in the videos and dense trajectories for macro movements such as the movement of the head and shoulders. These video features along with Low Level Descriptor (LLD) audio features are encoded using Fisher Vectors and finally a Support Vector Machine is used for regression. We discover that the LBP-TOP features encoded with Fisher Vectors alone are enough to outperform the baseline method on the Audio Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2014 database.

As the biomass of a forest cannot be measured or observed directly models need to be employed to predict it. Allometric AGB models for single tree as a function of diameter at breast height (DBH) are commonly used within design-based forest inventories. However, in particular for forest areas that are difficult to access it is not always feasible to fully implement a design-based field survey. In such cases models that use remotely sensed information may support the biomass assessment if useful predictor variables are available and statistically sound estimators can be derived. In recent years LiDAR remote sensing has become a prominent technique for forest biomass assessments and is even considered the most promising technology for large-scale forest inventory, ABG and carbon estimation by many researchers. Most of these studies were conducted in temperate forests and resulted in relatively high model accuracies. In this study we integrated airborne LiDAR data into an inventory of a degraded (logged-over) tropical peat swamp forest in Cenral Kalimantan, Indonesia. ::: Our objective is two compare the precision of AGB estimates from two approaches: i) from a design-based field inventory only and, ii) from a model-assisted approach where LiDAR data and data from the field inventory are combined. We are particularly interested in analyzing whether the precision of estimation of AGB can be improved by integrating LiDAR data under the particular conditions in tropical peat swamp forests. ::: We use data from a high resolution full-waveform LiDAR sensor and combine it with information gathered from a forest inventory which we conducted in the same area. For the inventory we used a standard approach: A systematic square sample grid covered the study area with n=34 concentric sample plots installed at each of the grid points. When combining remotely sensed and field data the co-registration of both datasets is a critical point, especially for small inventory plots and when plot locations can be determined with high uncertainty only. We applied a semi-automatic approach for co-registration that is based on a specific comparison of tree positions measured on the plots and derived from the LiDAR data. For the modelling we used the non-parametric machine learning approach Random Forests (RF). ::: From the forest inventory data, the estimated mean AGB was 230.6 t/ha with a Standard Error (SE) of 9.66 t/ha (SE%=4.19%). Using the model-assisted framework with Lidar data, we the estimated mean AGB was 230.8 t/ha with a SE of 8.02 t/ha (SE%=3.47%) which is in the range of other studies conducted in the same area. Altogether, this is an improvement of precision of estimation even though the best RF-model we found explained only 31% of the variance with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 45.5 t/ha. ::: We conclude that LiDAR data can support the estimation of AGB in tropical peat swamp forests even if the model quality is relatively low, a fact that may be related to the specific forest structure of our study area where the vertical structure of the forest is quite homogeneous. Furthermore, the forest inventory results show already a relatively high precision of mean AGB estimation which may also be explained by the homogeneous forest structure. ::: A modest increase in precision of estimation (from 4.19% to 3.47%), as we found it in our particular study area, gives rise to a challenging economic question, namely whether the cost of the acquisition of LiDAR data is reasonable in light of the actual increase in precision. Nevertheless, it will be welcomed by all forest inventory planners as long as LiDAR data and analysis expertise are available at low or no cost. Further, we must also consider the potential of LiDAR technology to provide spatially-explicit maps and their importance to forest managers.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2288047970", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130741705"}

However, these methods generally employ classification algorithms to discriminate abnormal from normal images, which do not localize, recognize, or detect abnormal patterns in abnormal images. We sought to identify a better method for the WCE abnormal pattern detection. In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to implement detection function, and several methods are also adopted to boost the performance of WCE abnormality detection from aspects of the CNN architecture, region proposal, and transfer learning. First, we present a deep cascade network, namely, CascadeProposal, trained end-to-end to generate a small number of region proposals with high-recall by a region proposal rejection module and to simultaneously detect abnormal patterns using a detection module. Second, we use a multiregional combination (MRC) method to obtain good coverage of the regions of interest and employ the salient region segmentation (SRS) method to capture accurate region locations. Third, we use the dense region fusion (DRF) method for object boundary refinement. Fourth, we introduce negative category (Neg) and transfer learning (TL) strategies into our CNNs to obtain a better model performance. The extensive experiments are performed on our WCE image dataset of more than 7k annotated images. A final mean average precision (mAP) of 70.3% and a better mAP of 72.3% can be achieved via CascadeProposal with ZF and Fast R-CNN with VGG-16 networks, respectively, using MRC+Neg+TL method in the training stage and MRC+DRF+SRS method in the testing stage.

In this work we applied Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique to reduce the large feature space of questions to a much smaller and efficient feature space. We used two different classifiers: Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found that applying LSA on question classification can not only make the question classification more time efficient, but it also improves the classification accuracy by removing the redundant features. Furthermore, we discovered that when the original feature space is compact and efficient, its reduced space performs better than a large feature space with a rich set of features. In addition, we found that in the reduced feature space, BPNN performs better than SVMs which are widely used in question classification. Our result on the well known UIUC dataset is competitive with the state-of-the-art in this field, even though we used much smaller feature spaces.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ASRU.2011.6163971", "venue": "2011 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding", "journal": "2011 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2038488405", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2166921", "61894598", "206708673", "7860651", "10040267", "3331334", "17519578", "2875637", "206753930", "286248", "16137770", "16485951", "88516979", "961425", "70315688", "8805137", "59897992", "11892605", "11039301", "2540550", "59102601"], "inbound_citations": ["212764258", "58014211", "54647101"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:306768"}

In addition to the inherent ambiguity of the natural language, deep understanding of the linguistic structure is imperative. Usually, discriminatory discourse does not make use of typical expressions and often abuse of sarcasm. Good knowledge of world and assessment of context are thus highly demanded. Several approaches have been proposed for automating hate speech recognition task. Many of them consider a combination of strategies in order to achieve better results: character-based or word-based N-grams, lexical features such as the presence or absence of negative words, classes or expressions indicative of insult, punctuation marks, repetition of letters, the presence of emoji, etc. The solitary use of linguistic features such as POS tagging have shown itself inefficient. The recent usage of neural networks to create a distributed representation of the sentences within a hate speech corpus is a promising path. Unfortunately, providing such a corpus is hard. Except for the English language, hate speech corpora are rarely found. This work proposes a cross-lingual approach to automatically recognize hate speech in Portuguese language, leveraging the knowledge of English corpora. A deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model has been trained and many different experimentation scenarios were set to deal with embeddings, TFIDF, N-grams, GloVe vocabulary and so on. At the end, a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) was used to improve classification results. We achieved accuracy of up to 70% in the better scenarios.

Methods The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval.

However, tuning these hyperparameters can come at a high computational cost, especially on larger datasets, while the tuned settings do not always significantly outperform the default values. This paper proposes a recommender system based on meta-learning to identify exactly when it is better to use default values and when to tune hyperparameters for each new dataset. Besides, an in-depth analysis is performed to understand what they take into account for their decisions, providing useful insights. An extensive analysis of different categories of meta-features, meta-learners, and setups across 156 datasets is performed. Results show that it is possible to accurately predict when tuning will significantly improve the performance of the induced models. The proposed system reduces the time spent on optimization processes, without reducing the predictive performance of the induced models (when compared with the ones obtained using tuned hyperparameters). We also explain the decision-making process of the meta-learners in terms of linear separability-based hypotheses.

Unlike queries in traditional database systems, users in most cases cannot specify an ideal query to retrieve the desired results for either target search or category search in multimedia database systems, and have to rely on iterative feedback to refine their query. Efficient evaluation of such iterative queries can be a challenge, especially when the multimedia database contains a large number of entries, and the search needs many iterations, and when the underlying distance measure is computationally expensive. The overall processing costs, including CPU and disk I/O, are further emphasized if there are numerous concurrent accesses. To address these limitations involved in relevance feedback processing, we propose a generic framework, including a query model, index structures, and query optimization techniques. Specifically, this thesis has five main contributions as follows. ::: The first contribution is an efficient target search technique. We propose four target search methods: naive random scan (NRS), local neighboring movement (LNM), neighboring divide-and-conquer (NDC), and global divide-and-conquer (GDC) methods. All these methods are built around a common strategy: they do not retrieve checked images (i.e., shrink the search space). Furthermore, NDC and GDC exploit Voronoi diagrams to aggressively prune the search space and move towards target images. We theoretically and experimentally prove that the convergence speeds of GDC and NDC are much faster than those of NRS and recent methods. ::: The second contribution is a method to reduce the number of expensive distance computation when answering k-NN queries with non-metric distance measures. We propose an efficient distance mapping function that transfers non-metric measures into metric, and still preserves the original distance orderings. Then existing metric index structures (e.g., M-tree) can be used to reduce the computational cost by exploiting the triangular inequality property. ::: The third contribution is an incremental query processing technique for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs have been widely used in multimedia retrieval to learn a concept in order to find the best matches. SVMs, however, suffer from the scalability problem associated with larger database sizes. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient query evaluation technique by employing incremental update. The proposed technique also takes advantage of a tuned index structure to efficiently prune irrelevant data. As a result, only a small portion of the data set needs to be accessed for query processing. This index structure also provides an inexpensive means to process the set of candidates to evaluate the final query result. This technique can work with different kernel functions and kernel parameters. ::: The fourth contribution is a method to avoid local optimum traps. Existing CBIR systems, designed around query refinement based on relevance feedback, suffer from local optimum traps that may severely impair the overall retrieval performance. We therefore propose a simulated annealing-based approach to address this important issue. When a stuck-at-a-local-optimum occurs, we employ a neighborhood search technique (i.e., simulated annealing) to continue the search for additional matching images, thus escaping from the local optimum. We also propose an index structure to speed up such neighborhood search. ::: Finally, the fifth contribution is a generic framework to support concurrent accesses. We develop new storage and query processing techniques to exploit sequential access and leverage inter-query concurrency to share computation. Our experimental results, based on the Corel dataset, indicate that the proposed optimization can significantly reduce average response time while achieving better precision and recall, and is scalable to support a large user community. This latter performance characteristic is largely neglected in existing systems making them less suitable for large-scale deployment. With the growing interest in Internet-scale image search applications, our framework offers an effective solution to the scalability problem.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2285329326", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61708916"}

Our models learn a visual representation that can be used for objects seen in training, but also for never seen objects. Since object manipulation requires a full understanding of the geometry and appearance of the object, our IterGANs learn an implicit 3D model and a full appearance model of the object, which are both inferred from a single (test) image. Two advantages of IterGANs are that the intermediate generated images can be used for an additional supervision signal, even in an unsupervised fashion, and that the number of iterations can be used as a control signal to steer the transformation.

Spatiotemporal NEE information developed by combining ground-based flux tower observations and spatiotemporal remote sensing datasets are of potential value in benchmarking land models. We apply a machine learning approach (Random Forest (RF)) to develop spatiotemporally varying NEE estimates using observations from a flux tower and several variables that can potentially be retrieved from satellite data and are related to ecosystem dynamics.

The seizure detection has a great importance in the diagnosis and therapy of epileptic patients. Visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for detection of interictal, pre-ictal and ictal activities is a strenuous and time-consuming task due to the huge volumes of EEG segments that have to be studied. In this study, we proposed a novel automatic detection method based on the altered compressibility of EEG during the three states with compressive sensing. To evaluate the proposed method, segments of interictal, pre-ictal and ictal EEG segments (100 segments in each state) were used. Two entropies, namely the Sample Entropy (SE) and the permutation Entropy (PE), and Hurst Index (HI) were extracted respectively from the segments to compare with the proposed method. Significant features were selected using the ANOVA test. After evaluating the performance of the selected features by four classifiers (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine) respectively, the results show that the proposed method can achieve the highest accuracy of 76.7%, which is higher than HI (55.3%), sample entropy (71%), and permutation entropy (73%). Hence, the altered compressibility of EEG with CS can act as a good biomarker for distinguish seizure-free, per-seizure and seizure state.

M.", "middle": [], "last": "Nasira", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Background/Objective: Cervical Cancer is one among the most vulnerable and highly affected diseases among women around the World. Normally, cells grow and divide to produce more cells only when the body needs them. This orderly process helps to keep dividing when new cells are not needed. These cells may form a mass of extra tissue called a growth of tumor. Tumors can be classified as Benign or Malignant. First Benign Tumors are not cancer. They can usually be removed, and in most cases, they do not show up. Most important, the cells in benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Second, malignant tumors are cancer cells. These tumors can damage nearby tissues and organs. Malignant tumors are threat to life. In this research work, prediction of normal cervix or Cancer cervix is determined with the aid of Powerful Data Mining algorithms. Methods/Statistical Analysis: In this research work, prediction of normal cervix or Cancer cervix is determined with the aid of Powerful Data Mining algorithms. Data mining plays an indispensable role in prediction especially in medical field. Using this concept, Classification and Regression Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree algorithm and RFT with K-means learning for prediction of normal cervix or cancer cervix is introduced. Collection of data from NCBI (National center for Bio-technology Information) in our work, we used the data set that contains 500 records and 61 variables (i.e. Biopsy numerical value with gene identifier). The output has been presented in the form of prediction tree format. As stated, we selected a sample of 100 records with 61 biopsy features. Based on this biopsy data, an awareness program is conducted and survey is followed up to identify the changes of women during this transition period. To collect data efficiently, a Personal Interview program was conducted among rural women in various places. Collaboration with JIPMER hospital people were checked up for the test of cervical cancer. The results obtained through biopsy test were put through statistical analysis and was given through MATLAB for algorithm testing. To ascertain the results obtained are segregated and delivered in various heads with 100 test data and 60 training data. Findings: Comparison of the performance of various algorithms was used under the techniques in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy to determine the best predictor for the cervical cancer. At first, Regression tree algorithm methodology was used for prediction. The CART binary tree yields two results, either normal cervix or cancer cervix. A Splitting Criterion called GINI index is used to identify the diversity that exists in cervical data. RFT validated optimal accuracy, a new logic was applied i.e. \"combinations of two algorithms\" is used. It is also an ensemble supervised machine learning algorithm. The process of whitening is used as a pre-process in k-means clustering, to get the best prediction result. The result showed the 83.87% accuracy with CART TREE output. Random Forest Tree (RFT) is used to improve the prediction accuracy. With MATLAB Coding we achieved 93.54% of prediction accuracy. The K-Means algorithm is considered efficient for processing huge datasets and hence a high accuracy of 96.77% is achieved with RFT - K-MEAN LEARNING TREE output. The Randomization of Algorithm is presented in two ways: 1. Bagging for random bootstrap sampling and 2. Input attributes are selected at random for decision tree generation. This creates an unbiased estimate of generalization error as growing of tree into forest progressed and the derivation of time complexity of K-Means is achieved. Applications/Improvements: Cervical cancer diagnosis and prognosis are two medical applications which pose a great challenge to the researchers. The algorithms optimize a cost function defined on the Euclidean distance measure between the data points and means of cluster. Combination of RFT with K-means algorithm is the novelty of our research work, where we have achieved high accuracy result. Accurate prediction of occurrence of cervical cancer has been the most challenging and toughest task in medical data mining because of the non-availability of proper dataset. Many researchers have been done to develop different techniques that can solve problems and improve the prediction accuracy of cervical cancer through images. But in our research work, the prediction of cervical cancer is with Numerical Data. NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) data set has been used.

However, introduction of new food sources to the market requires a thorough risk assessment of nutritional, microbial and toxicological risks and potential allergic responses. Yet, the risk assessment of allergenic potential of novel proteins is challenging. Currently, guidance for genetically modified proteins relies on a weight-of-evidence approach. Current Codex (2009) and EFSA (2010; 2017) guidance indicates that sequence identity to known allergens is acceptable for predicting the cross-reactive potential of novel proteins and resistance to pepsin digestion and glycosylation status is used for evaluating de novo allergenicity potential. Other physicochemical and biochemical protein properties, however, are not used in the current weight-of-evidence approach. In this study, we have used the Random Forest algorithm for developing an in silico model that yields a prediction of the allergenic potential of a protein based on its physicochemical and biochemical properties. The final model contains twenty-nine variables, which were all calculated using the protein sequence by means of the ProtParam software and the PSIPred Protein Sequence Analysis program. Proteins were assigned as allergenic when present in the COMPARE database. Results show a robust model performance with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy each greater than ?85%. As the model only requires the protein sequence for calculations, it can be easily incorporated into the existing risk assessment approach. In conclusion, the model developed in this study improves the predictability of the allergenicity of new or modified food proteins, as demonstrated for insect proteins. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a comparative study of different segmentation techniques applied to this kind of images. A wide and representative image set has been collected to run experiments on the hippocampus, due to the importance of this anatomical district in learning, memory and spatial navigation.

They have been found useful for a number of tasks, including control of high dimensional, nonlinear, or poorly modeled systems. A number of approaches have been applied to this problem, such as modeling inverse dynamics, backpropagating error through time, reinforcement learning, and dynamic programming based algorithms. The question of integrating parial a priori knowledge into these systems has often been a peripheral issue. Control systems for nonlinear plants have been explored extensively, especially approaches based on gain scheduling or adaptive control. Gain scheduling is the most commonly used, but requires extensive modeling and manual tuning, and doesn't work well with high-dimensional, nonlinear plants, or disturbances. Adaptive control addresses these problems, but usually can't react to spatial dependencies quickly enough to compete with a well-designed gain scheduled system. This thesis explores a hybrid control approach which uses a connectionist learning system to remember spatial nonlinearities discovered by an adaptive controller. The connectionist system learns to anticipate the parameters found by an indirect adaptive controller, effectively becoming a gain scheduled controller. The combined system is then able to exhibit some of the advantages of gain scheduled and adaptive control, without the extensive manual tuning required by traditional methods.

As the interest in finding and sorting information from text documents is growing, text mining emerges as a technology which the purpose of extracting non-trivial and interesting knowledge from large collections of unstructured documents [43]. Many intelligent diagnostic systems have been employed to assist condition monitoring tasks, such as expert systems and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), support vector machines and fuzzy logic systems, with promising results of such techniques [16], [33], [35]. However, individual decision system can only acquire a limited classification capability that is only appropriate for special data and may not be enough for a particular application. The application of a decision fusion system (DFS) has received considerable interest in recent years, achieving considerable successes to solve complex pattern recognition tasks. DFS can be also called multiple classifiers fusion (MCF), combination of classifiers, multiple experts or hybrid method. Due to the integration of different decisions from multiple classifiers, the technique can boost the recognition accuracy of in may applications [29]. Several applications and experiments have been developed using textual information in order to classify documents according to certain criteria, and using classifiers is a common method to find patterns in such documents. A large number of case studies can be found in the literature comparing and combining different classifiers [3], [5], [7], [10], [17], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [31], [34], [41], [46].

To successfully achieve these tasks, it is essential to extract visual features that comprehensively represent cartoon characters and to construct an accurate distance metric to precisely measure the dissimilarities between cartoon characters. In this paper, we introduce three visual features, color histogram, shape context, and skeleton, to characterize the color, shape, and action, respectively, of a cartoon character. These three features are complementary to each other, and each feature set is regarded as a single view. However, it is improper to concatenate these three features into a long vector, because they have different physical properties, and simply concatenating them into a high-dimensional feature vector will suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality. Hence, we propose a semisupervised multiview distance metric learning (SSM-DML). SSM-DML learns the multiview distance metrics from multiple feature sets and from the labels of unlabeled cartoon characters simultaneously, under the umbrella of graph-based semisupervised learning. SSM-DML discovers complementary characteristics of different feature sets through an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm. Therefore, SSM-DML can simultaneously accomplish cartoon character classification and dissimilarity measurement. On the basis of SSM-DML, we develop a novel system that composes the modules of multiview cartoon character classification, multiview graph-based cartoon synthesis, and multiview retrieval-based cartoon synthesis. Experimental evaluations based on the three modules suggest the effectiveness of SSM-DML in cartoon applications.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22801511", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2012.2207395", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2152756885", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["33072875", "11443622", "9265476", "15191375", "1552055", "1536455", "1581305", "8429958", "15205125", "16112814", "7612710", "5851735", "7237292", "2371570", "129468", "9045760", "1711825", "10174367", "2686555", "17445560", "1052837", "6999272", "702083", "5197761", "8616518", "47325215", "1845522", "2754209", "2529521", "17986384", "508435", "29222216", "122811027", "5291293", "14965041", "8755408", "6894357", "42041158", "6801442", "34917506", "15275534"], "inbound_citations": ["15742929", "27487722", "2464277", "62126942", "1236392", "214876945", "18556324", "203598265", "32012283", "17127599", "4124869", "28297555", "14741297", "26208758", "1550061", "1213973", "209379222", "9547313", "11548109", "3626623", "27625363", "16729338", "6827766", "16777418", "26576235", "46809278", "18683831", "25292649", "11911291", "3429947", "27314497", "5900337", "2940315", "19467554", "203852342", "8356456", "972201", "12318703", "201810004", "17796619", "5445052", "116865280", "14142666", "8281621", "665239", "5005655", "6094471", "65026883", "3754543", "3094497", "16698023", "17528253", "19905802", "4644484", "211691991", "15352079", "13810399", "206663034", "6186652", "12002513", "206784543", "14063376", "8078899", "4707338", "13269543", "9681310", "2006062", "29458174", "10455027", "2329659", "52977078", "1935370", "14890545", "36690661", "2054489", "6672322", "53318692", "38744474", "29058780", "18571517", "31033481", "8586999", "2175462", "210889718", "16545285", "2832683", "6776346", "15686830", "12697402", "1424412", "38353482", "4335958", "51612804", "51612804", "16255946", "11276258", "32647755", "55798247", "2780643", "28960363", "18493040", "15780426", "38126712", "143422168", "37472456", "18509083", "8302888", "21203037", "59525291", "11363417", "4397310", "30127350", "17319575"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8960049"}

In this paper, we formally analyze the current Markov blanket discovery approach for support vector machines and propose to discover Markov blankets by performing a fast heuristic Bayesian network structure learning. We give a sufficient condition that our approach will improve the performance. Two major factors that make it prohibitive for learning Bayesian networks from high-dimensional data sets are the large search space and the expensive cycle detection operations. We propose to restrict the search space by only considering the promising candidates and detect cycles using an online topological sorting method. Experimental results show that we can efficiently reduce the feature dimensionality while preserving a high degree of classification accuracy.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AAAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2147461057", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3854717", "2076794", "8478115", "6146974", "961425", "2941443", "743435", "6268910", "15420840", "18041873", "1378728", "53928084", "1455429", "2148887", "120766874", "8251892", "2302939", "425446", "5083193", "1170457"], "inbound_citations": ["1509896", "5395774", "11369795", "10132933", "8164003"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8966194"}
