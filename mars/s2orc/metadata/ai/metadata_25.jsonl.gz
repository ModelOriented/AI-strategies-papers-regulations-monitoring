Since computing the pairwise similarity between the training data is prohibitively expensive in most kinds of input data, currently, there is no general ready-to-use semi-supervised learning method/tool available for learning with tens of millions or more data points. In this paper, we adopted the idea of two low-rank label propagation algorithms, GLNP (Global Linear Neighborhood Propagation) and Kernel Nystr\\\"om Approximation, and implemented the parallelized version of the two algorithms accelerated with Nesterov's accelerated projected gradient descent for Big-data Label Propagation (BigLP). ::: The parallel algorithms are tested on five real datasets ranging from 7000 to 10,000,000 in size and a simulation dataset of 100,000,000 samples. In the experiments, the implementation can scale up to datasets with 100,000,000 samples and hundreds of features and the algorithms also significantly improved the prediction accuracy when only a very small percentage of the data is labeled.

However, a spatial-detailed and high-precision remote sensing method for the identification of desert vegetation-habitat complexes and characterization of their biophysical processes remain scarce. Here, we developed an innovative cross-wavelet transform (XWT)-based approach coupled with logistic regression to extract critical vegetation-habitat interaction characteristics in order to identify, map, and understand their complex ecological processes. Fine intraannual profiles between the green vegetation (GV) fraction and habitat fractions including dark material (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL) were unmixed by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) from 16-period Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) images in Minqin County, after which XWT was performed to extract feedback characteristics as feature parameters. Major principal components (PCs) were obtained from those feature parameters to reduce dimensions and solve multicollinearity, logistic regression was applied for mapping. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced desert vegetation-habitat complexes with high accuracy (overall accuracy: 87.33%; Kappa coefficient: 0.86) in the entire Minqin County, representing a 3.42% overall accuracy increase relative to a previously published decision tree (DT) method.

Moreover, this procedure not only achieved comparable accuracy to that of an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and superior to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based U-net model, but also explored biophysical processes and complex relationships with better interpretability.

In general, it is difficult to foresee the time required by a coalition to finish a task because it depends, among other factors, on the physical interference. Interference is a phenomenon produced when two or more robots want to access the same point simultaneously. This paper presents a new model to predict the time to execute a task. Thanks to this model, the robots needed to carry out a task before a deadline can be determined. Within this framework, the robots learn the interference and therefore, the coalition's utility, from their past experience using an on-line Support Vector Regression method (SVR). Furthermore, the SVR model is used together with a new auction method called 'Double Round auction' (DR).

This is mainly because electroencephalogram (EEG) bio-signal intensity is very small, in $\\mu \\text{V}$ range, and there are significant sensing difficulties given physiological and non-physiological artifacts. Today the process of accurate epileptic seizure identification and data labeling is done by neurologists. The current unpredictability of epileptic seizure activities together with the lack of reliable treatment for patients living with drug resistant forms of epilepsy creates an urgency for research into accurate, sensitive and patient-specific seizure forecasting. Most seizure forecasting algorithms use only labeled data for training purposes. As the seizure data is labeled manually by neurologists, preparing the labeled data is expensive and time consuming, making the best use of the data critical. In this article, we propose an approach that can make use of not only labeled EEG signals but also the unlabeled ones which are more accessible. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 28-s EEG windows as a pre-processing step. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained in an unsupervised manner where information of seizure onset is disregarded. The trained Discriminator of the GAN is then used as a feature extractor. Features generated by the feature extractor are classified by two fully-connected layers (can be replaced by any classifier) for the labeled EEG signals. This semi-supervised patient-specific seizure forecasting method achieves an out-of-sample testing area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 77.68%, 75.47% and 65.05% for the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset and the EPILEPSIAE dataset, respectively. Unsupervised training without the need for labeling is important because not only it can be performed in real-time during EEG signal recording, but also it does not require feature engineering effort for each patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of GAN to seizure forecasting.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944691", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2978219229", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52058059", "21037500", "51966202", "15028166", "18044506", "12907798", "5538376", "42309086", "22320880", "23284533", "24181644", "44163363", "42093653", "44162789", "1678184", "7283214", "24851404", "58670158", "11758569", "49332810", "142894564", "6047818", "15953181", "46929348"], "inbound_citations": ["211031968"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204701539"}

Many scientific and commercial organizations are maintaining large information databases specific to their needs. As a result of the continuing optimization of CPU architecture and random access memory technology, it has become feasible to implement computational numerical analysis on this archived data. The focus of the proposed research is the creation of efficient algorithms specifically targeted for large scale analysis through use of modern advances in computing architecture. Classification algorithms constitute one family of numerical analysis method and are often used in pattern matching and machine learning applications. By properly training classification algorithms on data entities with a common set of features and a classification known a priori, classifiers are produced capable of accurately classifying new data entities with feature sets common to the training data, and for which a classification is desired. This kind of analysis makes it possible to easily extract information from sets of data based on complex relationships among data features that would otherwise be difficult to observe. One example of the application of these algorithms is in the prediction of medical risks and outcomes of a new patient. By training a classifier with a possibly extensive set of pre-specified medical attribute and case outcome data from records of previous patients, it can be used as an accurate predictor of new cases by inputting the values of the same set of medical attributes recorded for a new patient. This ability to classify based on a set of data features has proven useful in a wide range of applications including image and text processing (E. Osuna, E. OsunaE. Osuna1997b), drug discovery (Zernov, ZernovZernov2003), finance and e-commerce. The Support Vector Machine, or SVM (Vapnik & Cortes, Vapnik & CortesVapnik & Cortes1995), is one type of classification algorithm that has enjoyed frequent use in recent years. The process of training SVMs still remains computationally and fiscally expensive as the processing speed and memory size needed to efficiently (in time) analyze large sets of data (i.e. 100,000 data entities) limits the amount of data that can practically be used for training (Burges, BurgesBurges1998). Training also involves a process of choosing different parameters, adjusting them and re-testing until satisfactory classification is achieved. These two factors limit the effectiveness of SVMs for use in real-time and industrial applications like finance, where it is necessary to process large databases of information and quick analysis is needed for decision making purposes.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2594281041", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64197103"}

Prior studies have proposed relevant dosimetric constraints to limit this toxicity. Using machine learning algorithms, we performed analyses of contributing factors in the development of RP to uncover previously unidentified criteria and elucidate the relative importance of individual factors. Materials and methods We evaluated 32 clinical features per patient in a cohort of 203 stage II\u2013III LA-NSCLC patients treated with definitive chemoradiation to a median dose of 66.6 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions at our institution from 2008 to 2016. Of this cohort, 17.7% of patients developed grade \u22652 RP. Univariate analysis was performed using trained decision stumps to individually analyze statistically significant predictors of RP and perform feature selection. Applying Random Forest, we performed multivariate analysis to assess the combined performance of important predictors of RP. Results On univariate analysis, lung V20, lung mean, lung V10 and lung V5 were found to be significant RP predictors with the greatest balance of specificity and sensitivity. On multivariate analysis, Random Forest (AUC = 0.66, p = 0.0005) identified esophagus max (20.5%), lung V20 (16.4%), lung mean (15.7%) and pack-year (14.9%) as the most common primary differentiators of RP.

This paper investigates human motion recognition based on feature-selected sequential Kinect skeleton data. We extract features from the Cartesian coordinates of human body joints for machine learning and recognition. As there are errors associated with the sensor, in addition to other uncertain factors, human motion sequential sensor data usually includes some irrelative and error features. To improve the recognition rate, an effective method is to reduce the amount of irrelative and error features from original sequential data. Feature selection methods for static situations, such as photo images, are widely used. However, very few investigations in the literature discuss this with regards to sequential data models, such as HMM (Hidden Markov Model), CRF (Conditional Random Field), DBN (Dynamic Bayesian Network), and so on. Here, we propose a novel method which combines a Markov blanket with the wrapper method for sequential data feature selection.

Recently, the microarray technology is employed to monitor the level of activity or expression of large number of genes simultaneously. The gene expression data derived from the microarray experiment usually involve a large number of genes but a very few number of samples. There is a need to reduce the dimension of gene expression data which intends to find a small set of discriminative genes that accurately classifies the samples of various kinds of diseases. So, our goal is to find a small subset of genes which ensures the accurate classification of neuromuscular disorders. In the present paper, we propose a novel hybrid feature selection model for classification of neuromuscular disorders. The process of feature selection is done in two phases by integrating Bhattacharyya coefficient and genetic algorithm (GA). In the first phase, we find Bhattacharyya coefficient to choose a candidate gene subset by removing the most redundant genes. In the second phase, the target gene subset is created by selecting the most discriminative gene subset by applying GA wherein the fitness function is calculated using radial basis function support vector machine (RBF SVM). The proposed hybrid algorithm is applied on two publicly available microarray neuromuscular disorders datasets. The results are compared with two individual techniques of feature selection, namely Bhattacharyya coefficient and GA, and one integrated technique, i.e., Bhattacharyya-GA wherein the fitness function of GA is calculated using four other classifiers, which shows that the proposed integrated method is capable of giving the better classification accuracy.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27637476", "doi": "10.1007/s12539-016-0183-6", "venue": "Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences", "journal": "Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2519826763", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["20756738", "33026371", "253190", "60248445", "215212331", "2382206", "10223976", "1270250", "7591348", "15958855", "7728223", "10813197", "207720429", "6110844", "26669137", "45234458", "15429426", "35423744", "8784315", "16710935", "30875380", "11224443", "15187900", "5223511", "15874442"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2067957"}

Currently distribution grids are characterized by dispersed infeed and distributed power generation that render conventional protection settings more challenging, and, hence, new methods must be investigated to resolve these issues. In this paper, a novel framework capable of detecting and classifying faults in power distribution grids is presented. The proposed algorithm formulates a unique fault classification technique based on measurement samples of three-phase voltage and currents after the occurrence of a fault event in power distribution grid. Thereby, negative sequence components of three-phase voltage and current quantities are used for online fault detection that triggers a fault classification method based on a support vector machine. In order to simulate fault scenarios, a model of a reference distribution grid incorporating distributed generation is developed, simulated, and analyzed under fault conditions. For the final evaluation, the designed protection scheme is implemented on a Programmable Logic Controller connected to the model running on a real-time simulator hardware that provides voltage and current measurements. Thus experimental results are provided to demonstrate and prove the contribution of the algorithm in its ability to correctly identify and classify faults in modern distribution grids.

Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classifiers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classification processes. In this study, we first construct a database with 28 fields using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientific papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classification accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classifiers, and land-cover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classification are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we find that supervised object-based classification is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classification. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classification performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy benefits from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6% of studies involve an area less than 300 ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2 m.

Under our approach, manifolds in high-dimensional spaces are inferred by estimating geometric relationships among the input instances. Unlike conventional manifold learning, we do not perform dimensionality reduction, but instead perform all operations in the original input space. For this purpose we employ a novel formulation of tensor voting, which allows an N-D implementation. Tensor voting is a perceptual organization framework that has mostly been applied to computer vision problems. Analyzing the estimated local structure at the inputs, we are able to obtain reliable dimensionality estimates at each instance, instead of a global estimate for the entire data set. Moreover, these local dimensionality and structure estimates enable us to measure geodesic distances and perform nonlinear interpolation for data sets with varying density, outliers, perturbation and intersections, that cannot be handled by state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative results on the estimation of local manifold structure using ground truth data are presented. In addition, we compare our approach with several leading methods for manifold learning at the task of measuring geodesic distances.

Image corrections, including planar indexing to align module images, are applied. On extracted cell images, degradation states such as busbar corrosion, cracking, wafer edge darkening, and between-busbar dark spots can be studied in comparison to new cells using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The systematic feature groupings provide a scalable method without bias to quantitatively monitor the degradation of laboratory and commercial systems alike. The evolution of these degradation features through varied exposure conditions provides insight into mechanisms causing degradation in field deployed modules. The supervised algorithms used in this application are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

In this paper, we confirm the ability of autoantibody profiling as a diagnostic test by providing evidence that not only cancer sera can be distinguished well from normal controls, but also from sera of patients with noncancerous diseases. Altogether, we screened blood sera of 191 cancer patients, 60 physiologically unaffected controls, and 177 sera of patients with noncancerous diseases for more than 1800 immunogenic clones. The measured autoantibody fingerprints were evaluated using a novel image analysis pipeline. For 13 antigens, statistically significant (p<0.05) and at least two-fold elevated immuno-reactivity in cancer sera compared to normal sera could be observed. Nine of these antigens also showed increased reactivity compared to sera of patients with other diseases, including the tumor marker vimentin. Supervised discrimination between cancer and normal sera by using linear Support Vector Machines was possible with an accuracy of 94.04%, a specificity of 83.38%, and a sensitivity of 97.44%. Here, our so-called MIMM (minimally invasive multiple marker) approach showed no significant difference in the classification accuracy between low and higher tumor grades.

The human locomotion recognition algorithm comprises both low-level (to detect activities) and high-level classifiers to detect transitions between activities. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Discrete Hidden Markov Model (DHMM) are used as low-level and high-level classifiers respectively. The human locomotion recognition algorithm is trained using two-dimensional features, Amplitude (A) and Omega (\u03c9), obtained from thigh angle measurements, using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on each limb. In A\u03c9AO, a pool with four adaptive oscillators (AOs) is used to estimate the filtered thigh angle trajectory. This pool converges to the frequency and phase of the signal, adaptively. To account for amplitude convergence, the amplitude parameters of the oscillator need to be reinitialized based on the human activity, identified by the human locomotion recognition algorithm.

Accordingly, a novel moving target recognition based on three distribution over-complete dictionary in conjunction with transfer learning is proposed. Specifically, we propose a three distribution over-complete dictionary to represent the target and extract its moving status by dictionary learning. Moreover, we structure the feature set with generation among target-aspect angles by using a transfer learning method. This framework can be trained by using a small number of samples from limited target-aspect angles to recognize the targets of other target-aspect angles.

This paper presents an optimal multi-order particle filter method to improve the prediction accuracy. The multiple \u03c4 th-order state equation is established by training Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) via electronics historical failure data, the \u03c4 value and LSSVR parameters are optimized through Genetic Algorithm (GA). The optimal \u03c4 th-order state equation which can really reflect electronics degradation process is used in particle filter to predict the electronics status, remaining useful life (RUL) or other performances. An online update scheme is developed to adapt the optimal \u03c4 th-order state transformation model to dynamic electronics. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using the testing data from CG36A transistor degradation and lithium-ion battery data.

The NN model is first trained with spectro-temporal features extracted from the audio, characterized by scalogram images that are generated through the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Activations that are extracted from the selected layer of the concerned neural network model, are then sent as features used to train the machine learning approach for classification. Utilization of the network activations learnt from the deep learning component of the classifier strengthens the time-frequency features of the signal that are extracted from the spectrogram.

The diagnosis of convective clouds is key in a large airport like Barajas, since these meteorological events are associated with strong winds and local precipitation, which may affect air and land operations at the airport. In this work, we deal with a 12-h time horizon in the analysis of convective clouds, using as input variables data from a radiosonde station and also from numerical weather models. The information about the objective variable (convective clouds presence at the airport) has been obtained from the Madrid-Barajas METAR and SPECI aeronautical reports. We treat the problem as an ordinal regression task, where there exist a natural order among the classes. Moreover, the classification problem is highly imbalanced, since there are very few convective clouds events compared to clear days. Thus, a process of oversampling is applied to the database in order to obtain a better balance of the samples for this specific problem. An important number of ordinal regression methods are then tested in the experimental part of the work, showing that the best approach for this problem is the SVORIM algorithm, based on the Support Vector Machine strategy, but adapted for ordinal regression problems.

One method applies a probability distribution over the space of rules and selects rules more likely to improve Gleaner's performance. A second method follows a boosting framework and repeatedly re-weights examples in order to maximize AURPC. Merging the combining and search portions finds good candidate rules and shows improvement over the Gleaner algorithm. ::: I apply these first-order ensemble techniques to several data sets from two very different domains. The first data sets come from the Information-Extraction (lE) domain where the task is to find specific relationships in text. The next data sets come from the computer-assisted medical-diagnosis domain. The task is to identify findings on a mammogram as malignant or benign given descriptors of the findings, patient risk factors, radiologist's score, and information from any previous mammograms. ::: I also include my work with Davis et al.'s SAYU algorithm. I demonstrate methods to improve predictive performance and to increase understanding of malignancy indicators. I show that computer models trained on data from one institution are able to outperform radiologists at another institution even when no additional data are available from the new institution.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2187378587", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["8911506"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31254833"}

The two datasets are concatenated into an integrated dataset based on ordering of the data as a research dataset. The proposed time-series forecasting model summarily has three foci. First, this study uses five imputation methods to directly delete the missing value. Second, we identified the key variable via factor analysis and then deleted the unimportant variables sequentially via the variable selection method. Finally, the proposed model uses a Random Forest to build the forecasting model of the reservoir\u2019s water level. This was done to compare with the listing method under the forecasting error. These experimental results indicate that the Random Forest forecasting model when applied to variable selection with full variables has better forecasting performance than the listing model.

The analytical approach includes analyzing tweets using text classification and geocoding locations based on string similarity. A case study conducted for the New York City and its surrounding areas demonstrates the feasibility of the analytical approach. Approximately 700,010 tweets are analyzed to extract relevant transportation-related information for one week. The SVM classifier achieves >85% accuracy in identifying transportation-related tweets from structured data. To further categorize the transportation-related tweets into sub-classes: incident, congestion, construction, special events, and other events, three supervised classifiers are used: L-LDA, SVM, and L-LDA incorporated SVM.

Experiments are carried out on a large image set of some 20 000 images, and the preliminary results demonstrate that the developed method consistently improves the performance over conventional SVM-based RFs in terms of precision and standard deviation, which are used to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of a RF algorithm, respectively", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17076417", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2006.881938", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2110112487", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["194951", "14712495", "206420153", "503568", "9294768", "1991617", "14372485", "3852078", "8167136", "8891673", "7138354", "14845602", "62394", "2838173"], "inbound_citations": ["65301487", "45432389", "210930083", "20171066", "18342365", "40299085", "14754454", "3850501", "13990599", "10842394", "14297630", "14987689", "17447412", "40330319", "28521990", "113405749", "111287855", "3870065", "15075568", "11378891", "10899521", "10899521", "2218399", "23585508", "15211146", "836606", "46787928", "4946847", "26712253", "18355464", "4369827", "25508991", "7672266", "20126393", "198907565", "48356891", "12928985", "15464078", "18444622", "18740138", "12751921", "15212837", "14952309", "55542742", "17522273", "2823109", "2483888", "62278013", "9447186", "198190947", "205166367", "16452313", "27691342", "13890317", "16690621", "1166938", "13954935", "7918246", "9144255", "15705403", "16829947", "13979308", "25550079", "1456857", "5628898", "6227024", "2083895", "18530632", "16680737", "2238314", "6076316", "14801035"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16334272"}

In this paper, we formally name this problem as \u201cClinical State Progression Prediction (CSPP).\u201d Conventional temporal modeling may fit well to predictions of fixed size observations and number of stages, but have troubles and less flexibility when addressing CSPP. To that end, we cast this problem as multi-label learning on time series data in which each stage is marked by a label. The implementation of entire framework includes two phases. In learning, an RNN based Encoder-Decoder deep model is developed for basic temporal modeling. In addition, Attention mechanism and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) are integrated to explicitly model the temporal dependency as well as monotonic relation between input time series and output label space.

One way to respond to it is to extract prosodic features from speech which are relevant in emotion research and feed this to a machine learning algorithm. This thesis discusses the encoding, decoding and inference processes of emotional sentences. These sentences were simulated by 3 actresses and 4 actors. Each person simulated 10 sentences with each sentence being performed in three emotional levels (neutral, fearful and very fearful). In total, the dataset consisted of 208 speech samples. Three decoders, two psycho-therapist and one speech-language pathologist rated each sample into the three emotional levels. Out of the three, two were highly correlated when the samples were presented randomly. Their ratings were used to code the samples. The formants, F1, F2, F3, F4, F0 (fundamental frequency) and the intensity were extracted from each sample and were given as input to a machine learning algorithm called Support Vector Machine (SVM). Due to the ordinal nature of the samples, SVM was used as the base learner of a meta classifier called OrdinalClassClassifier which exploits the ordering properties of the attributes. This algorithm served as a classifier analyzing the data from the samples. The results showed that the performance of the combination SVM and OrdinalClassClassifier was not significantly better than when the classifier SVM was only used.

The Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) technique provided significantly higher user, producer and overall accuracies and less \u201csalt and pepper effects\u201d compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. The classified satellite images using the MLC technique showed that IM lost 6740 ha of mangrove areas from 1989 to 2014. Nevertheless, a gain of 710 ha of mangroves was observed in this region, resulting in a net loss of 6030 ha or 33%. The loss of about 241 ha per year of mangroves was associated with a steady increase in urban land use (1225 ha per year) from 1989 until 2014. Action is necessary to protect the existing mangrove cover from further loss. Gazetting of the remaining mangrove sites as protected areas or forest reserves and introducing tourism activities in mangrove areas can ensure the continued survival of mangroves in IM.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs71114360", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1820104892", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["18371244", "116070507", "128922131", "40128126", "15169063", "2642961", "8717830", "6931083", "140660985", "55915556", "11150379", "14757831", "45551986", "62766703", "128368906", "154956321", "127191239", "2451054", "85772706", "67752957", "127600651", "9583006", "126630480", "29506878", "129743787", "6327665", "14917167", "2357415", "57911384", "23544307", "17883484", "129803791", "62638056", "109796082", "6906514", "456914", "140182457", "33542843", "129038986", "206378885", "17790515", "1706934", "6481993", "9505582", "39755373"], "inbound_citations": ["133768704", "164904954", "51736397", "52190850", "71143141", "91160910", "210843341", "134405769", "135026918", "43899767", "210905117", "135351481", "6885426", "73744", "214008166", "135283865", "209353617", "133605388", "201059539", "125736890", "55784937", "56314363", "135446878", "3482199", "4014155"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7257013"}

In the proposed approach, the inferred topic is automatically detected from the user's utterance, and speech recognition is then performed by applying an appropriate topic-dependent language model. This approach enables users to freely switch between domains while maintaining high recognition accuracy. As topic detection is performed on a single utterance, detection errors may occur and propagate through the system. To improve robustness, a hierarchical back-off mechanism is introduced where detailed topic models are applied when topic detection is confident and wider models that cover multiple topics are applied in cases of uncertainty. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated when combined with two topic detection methods: unigram likelihood and SVMs (Support Vector Machines). On the ATR Basic Travel Expression Corpus, both methods provide a significant reduction in WER (9.7% and 10.3%, respectively) compared to a single language model system.

These advances in urban feature extraction and built-area detection can refine the mapping of human population densities, especially in lower income countries where rapid urbanization and changing population is accompanied by frequently out-of-date or inaccurate census data. However, in these contexts it is unclear how best to use built-area data to disaggregate areal, count-based census data. Here we tested two methods using remotely sensed, built-area land cover data to disaggregate population data. These included simple, areal weighting and more complex statistical models with other ancillary information. Outcomes were assessed across eleven countries, representing different world regions varying in population densities, types of built infrastructure, and environmental characteristics. We found that for seven of 11 countries a Random Forest-based, machine learning approach outperforms simple, binary dasymetric disaggregation into remotely-sensed built areas. For these more complex models there was little evidence to support using any single built land cover input over the rest, and in most cases using more than one built-area data product resulted in higher predictive capacity.

The core of this algorithm is a second order Taylor expansion with which the backscatter is normalized at a reference angle. Studies have shown that the first and second order derivative within this Taylor expansion, known as slope and curvature, are somehow related to the wet biomass and structure of vegetation. The general approach to forward model satellite observations with land surface variables in a data assimilation framework is through a radiative transfer model (Albergel et al., 2017). However, this requires plenty of assumptions about the vegetation canopy (such as stem height, shape, size, orientation etc.) and is therefore relatively inefficient for understanding the impact of soil moisture and vegetation dynamics on backscatter on a large scale. This study investigates the possibility of using support vector machines as a surrogate model instead of a radiative transfer model to link the TU-Wien normalized backscatter and slope to land surface variables soil moisture and leaf area index. The land surface variables are simulations from the CO2-responsive ISBA-A-gs land surface model. Support vector machines have the advantage of providing implicit kernel functions, which make them very useful for non-linear problems. The ISBA-A-gs data is provided by Meteo-France. In total, 1324 support vector machines have been optimized through a cross validated grid search. The optimized hyperparameters were shown to have spatial consistency and look promising as an initial approach to forward modelling backscatter and slope.

One of the challenging problems is how to effectively model temporal and multi-modality characteristics of video. In this paper, we employ Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to fuse temporal multi-modality cues for event detection. CRFs are undirected probabilistic models designed for segmenting and labeling sequence data. Compared with traditional SVM and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), CRFs based event detection offers several particular advantages including the abilities to relax strong independence assumptions in the state transition and avoid a fundamental limitation of directed graphical models.

Statistical-relational methods rely on some First- ::: Order Logic as a general, expressive formal language to encode both the data ::: instances and the relations or constraints between them. The latter encode ::: background knowledge on the problem domain, and are use to restrict or bias ::: the model search space according to the instructions of domain experts. The ::: new tools developed within SRL allow to revisit old computational biology ::: problems in a less ad hoc fashion, and to tackle novel, more complex ones. ::: Motivated by these developments, in this thesis we describe and discuss the ::: application of SRL to three important biological problems, highlighting the ::: advantages, discussing the trade-offs, and pointing out the open problems. ::: ::: In particular, in Chapter 3 we show how to jointly improve the outputs ::: of multiple correlated predictors of protein features by means of a very gen- ::: eral probabilistic-logical consistency layer. The logical layer \u2014 based on ::: grounding-specific Markov Logic networks [3] \u2014 enforces a set of weighted ::: first-order rules encoding biologically motivated constraints between the pre- ::: dictions. The refiner then improves the raw predictions so that they least ::: violate the constraints. Contrary to canonical methods for the prediction ::: of protein features, which typically take predicted correlated features as in- ::: puts to improve the output post facto, our method can jointly refine all ::: predictions together, with potential gains in overall consistency. In order ::: to showcase our method, we integrate three stand-alone predictors of corre- ::: lated features, namely subcellular localization (Loctree[4]), disulfide bonding ::: state (Disulfind[5]), and metal bonding state (MetalDetector[6]), in a way ::: that takes into account the respective strengths and weaknesses. The ex- ::: perimental results show that the refiner can improve the performance of the ::: underlying predictors by removing rule violations. In addition, the proposed ::: method is fully general, and could in principle be applied to an array of ::: heterogeneous predictions without requiring any change to the underlying ::: software. ::: ::: In Chapter 4 we consider the multi-level protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) ::: prediction problem. In general, PPIs can be seen as a hierarchical process ::: occurring at three related levels: proteins bind by means of specific domains, ::: which in turn form interfaces through patches of residues. Detailed knowl- ::: edge about which domains and residues are involved in a given interaction has ::: extensive applications to biology, including better understanding of the bind- ::: ing process and more efficient drug/enzyme design. We cast the prediction ::: problem in terms of multi-task learning, with one task per level (proteins, ::: domains and residues), and propose a machine learning method that collec- ::: tively infers the binding state of all object pairs, at all levels, concurrently. ::: Our method is based on Semantic Based Regularization (SBR) [7], a flexible ::: and theoretically sound SRL framework that employs First-Order Logic con- ::: straints to tie the learning tasks together. Contrarily to most current PPI ::: prediction methods, which neither identify which regions of a protein actu- ::: ally instantiate an interaction nor leverage the hierarchy of predictions, our ::: method resolves the prediction problem up to residue level, enforcing con- ::: sistent predictions between the hierarchy levels, and fruitfully exploits the ::: hierarchical nature of the problem. We present numerical results showing ::: that our method substantially outperforms the baseline in several experi- ::: mental settings, indicating that our multi-level formulation can indeed lead ::: to better predictions. ::: ::: Finally, in Chapter 5 we consider the problem of predicting drug-resistant ::: protein mutations through a combination of Inductive Logic Programming [8, ::: 9] and Statistical Relational Learning. In particular, we focus on viral pro- ::: teins: viruses are typically characterized by high mutation rates, which allow ::: them to quickly develop drug-resistant mutations. Mining relevant rules from ::: mutation data can be extremely useful to understand the virus adaptation ::: mechanism and to design drugs that effectively counter potentially resistant ::: mutants. We propose a simple approach for mutant prediction where the in- ::: put consists of mutation data with drug-resistance information, either as sets ::: of mutations conferring resistance to a certain drug, or as sets of mutants with ::: information on their susceptibility to the drug. The algorithm learns a set ::: of relational rules characterizing drug-resistance, and uses them to generate ::: a set of potentially resistant mutants. Learning a weighted combination of ::: rules allows to attach generated mutants with a resistance score as predicted ::: by the statistical relational model and select only the highest scoring ones. ::: Promising results were obtained in generating resistant mutations for both ::: nucleoside and non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

To date, almost linear maturation characteristic curves are used in univariate and multivariate models. Models using complex multivariate maturation characteristic curves are pending.To address this problem, we use Random Forest (RF) to assess fetal maturation age and compare RF with linear, multivariate age regression. We include previously developed HRV indices such as traditional time and frequency domain indices and complexity indices of multiple scales.We found that fetal maturation was best assessed by complexity indices of short scales and skewness in state-dependent datasets (quiet sleep, active sleep) as well as in state-independent recordings. Additionally, increasing fluctuation amplitude contributed to the model in the active sleep state. None of the traditional linear HRV parameters contributed to the RF models. Compared to linear, multivariate regression, the mean prediction of gestational age (GA) is more accurate with RF than in linear, multivariate regression (quiet state: R 2 = 0 , 617 vs. R 2 = 0 , 461 , active state: R 2 = 0 , 521 vs. R 2 = 0 , 436 , state independent: R 2 = 0 , 583 vs. R 2 = 0 , 548 ).We conclude that classification and regression tree models such as RF methodology are appropriate for the evaluation of fetal maturation age. The decisive role of adjustments between different time scales of complexity may essentially extend previous analysis concepts mainly based on rhythms and univariate complexity indices.

The proposed method combines the dynamic state estimation (DSE) based protection technique and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to achieve an accurate classification model with physical foundation. DSE utilizes measurement data from merging units and the model of transmission line to obtain estimated states of the line. The differences of measurements and estimated values are referred as residuals. Different fault types possess different patterns of residuals and include features that can be used in a classification scheme.

Such markers could represent an initial step into the AR and VR worlds. In this paper, we address the important question of how to recognise the presence of visual markers in freeform digital photos. We use a particularly challenging marker format that is only minimally constrained in structure, called Artcodes. Artcodes are a type of topological marker system enabling people, by following very simple drawing rules, to design markers that are both aesthetically beautiful and machine readable. Artcodes can be used to decorate the surface of any objects, and yet can also contain a hidden digital meaning. Like some other more commonly used markers (such as Barcodes, QR codes), it is possible to use codes to link physical objects to digital data, augmenting everyday objects. Obviously, in order to trigger the behaviour of scanning and further decoding of such codes, it is first necessary for devices to be aware of the presence of Artcodes in the image. Although considerable literature exists related to the detection of rigidly formatted structures and geometrical feature descriptors such as Harris, SIFT, and SURF, these approaches are not sufficient for describing freeform topological structures, such as Artcode images. In this paper, we propose a new topological feature descriptor that can be used in the detection of freeform topological markers, including Artcodes. This feature descriptor is called a Shape of Orientation Histogram (SOH). We construct this SOH feature vector by quantifying the level of symmetry and smoothness of the orientation histogram, and then use a Random Forest machine learning approach to classify images that contain Artcodes using the new feature vector. This system represents a potential first step for an eventual mobile device application that would detect where in an image such an unconstrained code appears. We also explain how the system handles imbalanced datasets ? important for rare, handcrafted codes such as Artcodes ? and how it is evaluated. Our experimental evaluation shows good performance of the proposed classification model in the detection of Artcodes: obtaining an overall accuracy of approx. 0.83, F2 measure 0.83, MCC 0.68, AUC-ROC 0.93, and AUC-PR 0.91.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3126686.3126761", "venue": "Thematic Workshops '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2765494719", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["56923011", "206590584", "17035962", "14167763", "89141", "1815530", "1554582", "2391953", "52874011", "13921950", "206590483", "16149383", "10578990", "5746274", "13146480", "1694378", "206742563", "8192877", "130535382", "17491721", "1777569", "13308232", "3770261", "1388140", "206769866", "17691725", "352038", "1447752"], "inbound_citations": ["49563561"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10463668"}

One of the practical applications of our algorithms is in the ecological characterization of different areas. ::: ::: Generally, the task of classification is to find a rule, which based on external observations assigns an object to one of several classes. A classification task supposes the existence of training and testing data given in the form of data instances. Each instance in the training set contains one target value, named class label and several attributes named features. One of the approaches used for solving the problem of binary or multiclass classification is represented by SVM algorithm. SVM models are obtained by convex optimization and are able to learn and generalize in high dimensional input spaces. The goal of SVM is to produce a model which predicts target value of data instances in the testing set which are given only the attributes. A very powerful idea, which can be used not only in SVM algorithms, is the kernel method. Using an appropriate kernel, the data are projected in a space with higher dimension in which they are separable by a hyperplane. Usually simple kernels are used but the real problems require more complex kernels. The kernel substitution can be used to define many other types of learning machines distinct from SVMs. ::: ::: We introduce and analyze multiple kernels based on simple kernels. Our intention was to study the possibility of obtaining nonlinear multiple kernels using simple classifiers and to analyze their performance comparing with other multiple kernels. Therefore we choose, first, for experiments the most common data sets, used in a great number of papers and taken from libsvm website. Second, we used different types of data obtained in the monitoring process of many ecological areas from Romania. ::: ::: In order to take advantage of possible correlations between the outputs to improve the quality of the predictions, we also consider the Support Vector Regression method (SVR). SVR is based on the theory of Support Vector Machines and belongs to the category of reproducing kernel methods. The kernel is viewed as the covariance of a second order Gaussian process. SVR builds a model, f, of the output of a system that depends on a set of factors.

Previous works show that sparse representation can effectively reduce catastrophic interference and hence provide relatively stable and consistent boostrap targets when training reinforcement learning algorithms. Tile coding is a well-known sparse feature generation method in reinforcement learning. However, its application is largely restricted to small, low dimensional domains, as its computational and memory requirement grows exponentially as dimension increases. This paper proposes a simple and novel tile coding operation---deep tile coder, which adapts tile coding into deep learning setting, and can be easily scaled to high dimensional problems. The key distinction of our method with previous sparse representation learning method is that, we generate sparse feature by construction, while most previous works focus on designing regularization techniques. We are able to theoretically guarantee sparsity and importantly, our method ensures sparsity from the beginning of learning, without the need of tuning regularization weight. Furthermore, our approach maps from low dimension feature space to high dimension sparse feature space without introducing any additional training parameters. Our empirical demonstration covers classic discrete action control and Mujoco continuous robotics control problems. We show that reinforcement learning algorithms equipped with our deep tile coder achieves superior performance. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate successful application of sparse representation learning method in online deep reinforcement learning algorithms for challenging tasks without using a target network.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.08068", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2989679455", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["1552061", "393948", "1854295", "3554631", "52947531", "59553460", "5937776", "29167535", "5575601", "28202810", "201903988", "57931704", "197638361", "6628106", "207079270", "6333733", "16326763", "3248358", "53670212", "58007008", "7027533", "682971", "61019113", "205242740", "142747336", "16846639", "6921329", "515925", "13928442", "10253791", "10253791", "9166388", "1211821", "5928833", "2353680", "54446702", "211179678", "9336262", "702279"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208158063"}

In level -1, HyFeat block uses two different scaled conv filters to preserve the domain knowledge features for expressive regions. Similarly, level -2 captures the enriched features through refine edge variation of the receptive fields by employing another two filters. Thus, HyFeat block allows network to perpetuate prominent features of facial expressions and enhances the discriminability of the HiNet.

Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to solve this problem. The existing deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), assume that the training and test data are generated from the same or similar imaging systems. They also require a lot of manual annotations for each task. In this paper, we aim to create an improved deep learning method for vehicle type recognition from surveillance images and propose a system based on CNN and transfer learning. Labeled image data of different types of vehicles are easy to acquire from both vehicle manufacturers and Internet sources. Therefore, our proposed surveillance-based vehicle type recognition system is implemented using only labels from Web data. This allows us to overcome the task of manually labeling the data from surveillance images during the training phase. We need to overcome the gap in the types of vehicles between two different imaging systems. For this, a regularization technique in transfer learning is introduced to the objective function of the traditional convolutional neural network. The proposed method was verified through experiments with the public data set comprehensive cars.

It makes possible to elucidate disease mechanisms, to predict protein functions and to select promising targets for drug development. Currently, several approaches for protein interaction prediction for non-model species incorporate only small fractions of the entire proteomes and their interactions. Based on this perspective, this study presents an integration of computational methodologies, protein network predictions and comparative analysis of the protozoan species Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania infantum. These parasites cause Leishmaniasis, a worldwide distributed and neglected disease, with limited treatment options using currently available drugs. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The predicted interactions were obtained from a meta-approach, applying rigid body docking tests and template-based docking on protein structures predicted by different comparative modeling techniques. In addition, we trained a machine-learning algorithm (Gradient Boosting) using docking information performed on a curated set of positive and negative protein interaction data. Our final model obtained an AUC = 0.88, with recall = 0.69, specificity = 0.88 and precision = 0.83. Using this approach, it was possible to confidently predict 681 protein structures and 6198 protein interactions for L. braziliensis, and 708 protein structures and 7391 protein interactions for L. infantum. The predicted networks were integrated to protein interaction data already available, analyzed using several topological features and used to classify proteins as essential for network stability. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The present study allowed to demonstrate the importance of integrating different methodologies of interaction prediction to increase the coverage of the protein interaction of the studied protocols, besides it made available protein structures and interactions not previously reported.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5840830", "pubmed_id": "29510668", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-018-2105-6", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2794495999", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3829633", "33503747", "215187042", "5069258", "15657266", "8165552", "4372602", "4404822", "10950726", "7418133", "29106447", "215185713", "17977683", "205060874", "2827301", "28916214", "15837946", "43803981", "3619819", "1026081", "31308628", "46425086", "16249101", "30180446", "9519139", "12876664", "484126", "9047515", "6238884", "39902684", "10631730", "8596553", "6174498", "30562613", "11599639", "719403", "215184548", "8731372", "5608035", "8970199", "40589986", "24887828", "54563700", "11392426", "17312187", "14441902", "10960997", "17406543", "26146374", "839796", "94303982", "24771528", "24887828", "10158494", "17179573", "83328734", "14665486", "25613732", "16280150", "9342362", "21986965", "1669217", "60545", "3001195", "10950726", "52848577", "14876970", "17795296", "11259051", "1335977", "9698532", "4426721", "86553126", "40417279", "28755614", "8612527", "3147406", "3059428", "16269056", "22138441", "7482622", "19542776", "14145661", "3585752", "9717376", "60545", "11155896", "14838044", "214942598", "34547380", "6104912", "14426931", "1751670", "2646971"], "inbound_citations": ["85513655", "212415862", "215382628"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3722265"}

One of the main goals in the automated factory environment is, therefore, the exploitation of resources to the full, in such a way as to optimize productivity. As widely documented in literature, this is a hard task on account of its computational complexity. For this reason a number of heuristic techniques are currently available, the best known of which are based on Event Graphs, which are a particular class of Petri Nets. The paper proposes a performance optimization technique which, although it is based on Event Graphs, applies algorithms which are different from traditional heuristic ones. More specifically, a novel neural model is used to solve the optimization problem. The neural model was obtained by making significant changes to a network that is well known in literature: the Hopfield network. The solution proposed is an original one and features several advantages against the most known heuristic approaches to the problem, the most important of which is the possibility of optimal or close to optimal solutions in a polynomial time, proportional to the size of the FMS. In addition, the possibility of simple, economical hardware implementation of the neural model favours its integration in the automated factory environment, allowing real-time supervision and optimization of productivity. The aim of the paper is to present the new neural model and its use in optimizing the performance of FMSs. A comparison of the neural approach with classical heuristic solutions and its real-time calculation capability, will also be treated in the paper.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1008244007194", "venue": "Applied Intelligence", "journal": "Applied Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1559019392", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["42679614", "32886195", "61063066", "34984082", "21227625", "23630375", "11202792", "62212393", "784288", "117092742", "36483354", "8104575", "109029097", "56514973", "16810163", "1232094"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21208346"}

Finally a number of locally smoothed values of each sample are combined together to obtain the global estimate of its noise-free coordinates. The fusion process is weighted by the fitness of EIV model in each region to account for the variation of curvatures of the manifold.

{"paper_id": "60868929", "title": "Integrating Prior Knowledge into Factorization Approaches for Relational Learning", "authors": [{"first": "Xueyan", "middle": [], "last": "Jiang", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "An efficient way to represent the domain knowledge is relational data, where information is recorded in form of relationships between entities. Relational data is becoming ubiquitous over the years for knowledge representation due to the fact that many real-word data is inherently interlinked. Some well-known examples of relational data are: the World Wide Web (WWW), a system of interlinked hypertext documents; the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud of the Semantic Web, a collection of published data and their interlinks; and finally the Internet of Things (IoT), a network of physical objects with internal states and communications ability. Relational data has been addressed by many different machine learning approaches, the most promising ones are in the area of relational learning, which is the focus of this thesis. While conventional machine learning algorithms consider entities as being independent instances randomly sampled from some statistical distribution and being represented as data points in a vector space, relational learning takes into account the overall network environment when predicting the label of an entity, an attribute value of an entity or the existence of a relationship between entities. An important feature is that relational learning can exploit contextual information that is more distant in the relational network. As the volume and structural complexity of the relational data increase constantly in the era of Big Data, scalability and the modeling power become crucial for relational learning algorithms. ::: ::: Previous relational learning algorithms either provide an intuitive representation of the model, such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), or assume a set of latent variables to explain the observed data, such as the Infinite Hidden Relational Model (IHRM), the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) and factorization approaches. Models with intuitive representations often involve some form of structure learning which leads to scalability problems due to a typically large search space. Factorizations are among the best-performing approaches for large-scale relational learning since the algebraic computations can easily be parallelized and since they can exploit data sparsity. Previous factorization approaches exploit only patterns in the relational data itself and the focus of the thesis is to investigate how additional prior information (comprehensive information), either in form of unstructured data (e.g., texts) or structured patterns (e.g., in form of rules) can be considered in the factorization approaches. The goal is to enhance the predictive power of factorization approaches by involving prior knowledge for the learning, and on the other hand to reduce the model complexity for efficient learning. ::: ::: This thesis contains two main contributions: ::: ::: The first contribution presents a general and novel framework for predicting relationships in multirelational data using a set of matrices describing the various instantiated relations in the network. The instantiated relations, derived or learnt from prior knowledge, are integrated as entities' attributes or entity-pairs' attributes into different adjacency matrices for the learning. All the information available is then combined in an additive way. Efficient learning is achieved using an alternating least squares approach exploiting sparse matrix algebra and low-rank approximation. As an illustration, several algorithms are proposed to include information extraction, deductive reasoning and contextual information in matrix factorizations for the Semantic Web scenario and for recommendation systems. Experiments on various data sets are conducted for each proposed algorithm to show the improvement in predictive power by combining matrix factorizations with prior knowledge in a modular way. ::: ::: In contrast to a matrix, a 3-way tensor si a more natural representation for the multirelational data where entities are connected by different types of relations. A 3-way tensor is a three dimensional array which represents the multirelational data by using the first two dimensions for entities and using the third dimension for different types of relations. In the thesis, an analysis on the computational complexity of tensor models shows that the decomposition rank is key for the success of an efficient tensor decomposition algorithm, and that the factorization rank can be reduced by including observable patterns. Based on these theoretical considerations, a second contribution of this thesis develops a novel tensor decomposition approach - an Additive Relational Effects (ARE) model - which combines the strengths of factorization approaches and prior knowledge in an additive way to discover different relational effects from the relational data. As a result, ARE consists of a decomposition part which derives the strong relational leaning effects from a highly scalable tensor decomposition approach RESCAL and a Tucker 1 tensor which integrates the prior knowledge as instantiated relations. An efficient least squares approach is proposed to compute the combined model ARE. The additive model contains weights that reflect the degree of reliability of the prior knowledge, as evaluated by the data. Experiments on several benchmark data sets show that the inclusion of prior knowledge can lead to better performing models at a low tensor rank, with significant benefits for run-time and storage requirements. In particular, the results show that ARE outperforms state-of-the-art relational learning algorithms including intuitive models such as MRC, which is an approach based on Markov Logic with structure learning, factorization approaches such as Tucker, CP, Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization (BCTF), the Latent Factor Model (LFM), RESCAL, and other latent models such as the IRM. A final experiment on a Cora data set for paper topic classification shows the improvement of ARE over RESCAL in both predictive power and runtime performance, since ARE requires a significantly lower rank.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1923878759", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60868929"}

Mammography, i.e. the screening for breast cancer with x-ray imaging, has significantly improved the prognosis of patients diagnosed with the disease. The evaluation of mammograms requires a panel of radiologists, but even well trained experts can err in their assessment. For this reason, Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems are becoming more prevalent. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for breast Micro-Calcification (MC) diagnosis using temporal sequences of digital mammograms. The goal is to increase the MC detection accuracy by subtracting prior images. A new dataset, with precise marking of MC locations, was created specifically for this study. The proposed approach began with temporal subtraction of mammograms, after demon-based registration, which effectively removed unchanged regions and MCs (17.3% reduction in the number of MCs). The second step was the classification of the MCs as benign or suspicious using the subtracted images. A set of diverse features were selected for the classification. Four different classifiers were tested with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. For comparison, the MC classification was also performed, using single mammograms, without temporal subtraction. The average accuracy of the classification of the MCs as benign or suspicious was 91.3% without and 99.2% with temporal subtraction using Support Vector Machines (statistically significant $\\mathbf{p}=0.026$ ). These results show that temporal subtraction could be a valuable addition to CAD systems to assist radiologists in effectively detecting breast MCs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BHI.2019.8834517", "venue": "2019 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI)", "journal": "2019 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2973176902", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["46943769", "5752518", "81764839", "22529478", "12489530", "400755", "1695342", "2494234", "33109454", "31506701", "8473401", "52874011", "13252401", "2594813"], "inbound_citations": ["214623824"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202561237"}

Given a video sequence of a pedestrian, the holistic and local features are simultaneously extracted using the E-GLRN network. Specifically, for the global feature learning, we adopt the channel attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, which are responsible for introducing a CNN-LSTM module to learn the features of consecutive frames. The local feature learning module relies on the key local information extraction, which is based on the Bi-LSTM networks. In order to obtain the local feature more effectively, our work defines a concept of \u201cthe main image group\u201d by selecting three representative frames. The local feature representation of a video is obtained by exploiting the spatial contextual and appearance information of this group. The local and global features extracted in this paper are complementary and further combined into a discriminative and robust feature representation of the video sequence.

Network embedding, as known as network representation learning, aiming to map nodes in network into a low-dimensional representation, is a data-driven problem. Most existing methods are based on a single granular, which learn representations from local structure of nodes. But global structure is important information on the network and has been proven to facilitate several network analysis tasks. Therefore, how to introduce GrC into network embedding to obtain a multi-granular network representation that preserves the global and local structure of nodes is a meaningful and tough task. In this paper, we introduce Quotient Space Theory, one of the GrC theories into network embedding and propose a Multi-Granular Network Representation Learning method based on Quotient Space Theory (MG_NRL, for short), which can preserve global and local structure at different granularities. Firstly, we granulate the network repeatedly to obtain a multi-granular network. Secondly, the embedding of the coarsest network is computed using any existing embedding method. Finally, the network representation of each granular layer is learned by recursively refining method from the coarsest network to original network.

We investigate why this approach works so well and demonstrate that the performance comes from a combination of three properties: (i) The integration of votes from multiple regions around the model point. (ii) The combination of multiple independent votes from each tree. (iii) The use of a coarse to fine strategy. We show that each property can improve performance, and that the best performance comes from using all three. We demonstrate that FASMM based on RF regression-voting generalises well across application areas, achieving state of the art performance in each of the three segmentation problems.

While these techniques, such as Deep Belief Networks or Random Forests, are becoming more and more popular on the market, the academic literature is relatively sparse. Through a series of applications involving hundreds of variables/predictors and stocks, this article presents some of the state-of-the-art techniques and how they can be implemented to manage a long-short portfolio. Numerous practical and empirical issues are developed. One of the main questions beyond big data use is the value of information. Does an increase in the number of predictors improve the portfolio performance? Which features are the most important? A large number of predictors means, potentially, a high level of noise. How do the algorithms manage this? This article develops an application using a 22-year trading period, up to 300 U.S. large caps and around 600 predictors. The empirical results underline the ability of these techniques to generate useful trading signals for portfolios with important turnovers and short holding periods (one or five days). Positive excess returns are reported between 1993 and 2008. They are strongly reduced after accounting for transaction costs and traditional risk factors. When these machine learning tools were readily available in the market, excess returns turned into the negative in most recent times.

The interconnection of these factors is vital since there is high dependence between them. Due to the high strength, material strengthening mechanisms under loading, and low thermal conductivity of nickel-based alloys, cutting tool health has significant influence on the quality of the machined part. The objective of this work is to study the underlying effects of tool flank wear on surface integrity metrics of Inconel 718 (IN718) nickel-based alloys in a turning operation. Three parameters are taken together to represent the workpiece state of health: surface roughness, dimensional integrity and residual stress; and the tool wear effect on each is investigated. It is shown that unlike the common belief of the detrimental effects of wear on surface roughness, tool flank wear does not necessarily have a significant effect on the roughness profile evolution of the workpiece. To study the effect of wear on dimensional integrity, the geometrical relationship of the tool-tip and flank wear width is derived, and the estimated results of tool wear from the previous work of the authors in the use of a probabilistic Extended Kalman Filter are utilized for classification of dimensional deviation. The results are also compared with naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification strategies, and it is shown that probabilistic-based methods outperform the deterministic classifier. For studying the wear effect on machining-induced residual stresses, a 3D finite element model is developed. The results of the finite element model for the sharp tool are first validated with the experimental results, with good agreement. Next, the sharp tool geometry is updated to represent a wear land and found to have deviation from the validation tests in the compression zone; the sources of error in the finite element numerical model are discussed. The combination of this work on monitoring state of workpiece health alongside the proposed wear estimation strategy for monitoring state of cutting tool health provides a complete platform for in-process monitoring of machining health in cutting hard-to-machine alloys.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.09.016", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Manufacturing Processes", "mag_id": "2763207739", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56172903", "212732974"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:139796047"}

Self-supervised learning collects training data online during the learning process. However, the trial samples lack the complete ground truth because the observable parts of the agent are limited. That is, the information contained in the trial samples is often insufficient to learn the specific grasping position of each object. Consequently, the training falls into a local solution, and the grasp positions learned by the robot are independent of the state of the object. In this study, the optimal grasping position of an individual object is determined from the grasping score, defined as the distance in the feature space obtained using metric learning. The closeness of the solution to the pre-designed optimal grasping position was evaluated in trials. The proposed method incorporates two types of feedback control: one feedback enlarges the grasping score when the grasping position approaches the optimum; the other reduces the negative feedback of the potential grasping positions among the grasping candidates. The proposed online self-supervised learning method employs two deep neural networks.: a single shot multibox detector (SSD) that detects the grasping position of an object, and Siamese networks (SNs) that evaluate the trial sample using the similarity of two input data in the feature space. Our method embeds the relation of each grasping position as feature vectors by training the trial samples and a few pre-samples indicating the optimum grasping position.

Firstly, the bootstrap sampling method is utilized to independently train multiple base ELMs which make up the initial base classifier pool.

In this paper independent component analysis (ICA), which is based on higher order statistics, is proposed to deal with the ultrasound speckle texture analysis problem.

In this paper, we propose an approach referred to as Extreme Learning Machine for Joint Embedding and Clustering (ELM-JEC), which incorporates desirable properties of both types of feature learning methods at the same time, specifically by (1) preserving the manifold structure of the data in the original space; (2) maximizing the class separability of the data in the embedded space.

Case-based reasoning is the process of using past experiences stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel situations or solve novel problems. However, this process assumes that past experiences are well understood and provide good \u201clessons\u201d to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Furthermore, the reasoner may not even have a case that adequately deals with the new situation, or may not be able to access the case using existing indices. We present a theory of incremental learning based on the revision of previously existing case knowledge in response to experiences in such situations. The theory has been implemented in a case-based story understanding program that can (a) learn a new case in situations where no case already exists, (b) learn how to index the case in memory, and (c) incrementally refine its understanding of the case by using it to reason about new situations, thus evolving a better understanding of its domain through experience.

However, traditional air-ratio control assumes the lambda sensor located at the tail pipe works properly and relies strongly on the air-ratio feedback signal measured by the lambda sensor. When the sensor is warming up during cold start or under failure, the traditional air-ratio control no longer works. To address this issue, this paper utilizes an advanced modelling technique, kernel extreme learning machine (ELM), to build a backup air-ratio model. With the prediction from the model, a limited air-ratio control performance can be maintained even when the lambda sensor does not work. Such strategy is realized as fault tolerance control. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault tolerance air-ratio control strategy, a model predictive control scheme is constructed based on the kernel ELM backup air-ratio model and implemented on a real engine. Experimental results show that the proposed controller can regulate the air-ratio to specific target values within a satisfactory tolerance under external disturbance and the absence of air-ratio feedback signal from the lambda sensor. This implies that the proposed fault tolerance air-ratio control is a promising scheme to maintain air-ratio control performance when the lambda sensor is under failure or warming up.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2015/317142", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1518855411", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["30629090", "24943645", "13374409", "110590482", "110599260", "122337080", "108773495", "34780958", "108495168", "8310720", "19383743", "110269514", "136674403", "62207270", "205703902", "9279281", "14713798", "7334818", "110781727", "120675286", "108993770"], "inbound_citations": ["73665388"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54710845"}

This study presents a review of human Cardiotocography trace interpretation and argues that machine learning, used as a decision support system by obstetricians and midwives, may provide an objective measure alongside normal practices. This will help to increase predictive capacity and reduce negative outcomes.

In this paper, first, a human study is conducted to understand the capabilities of human mind and to identify the discriminatory areas of a face that facilitate kinship-cues. The visual stimuli presented to the participants determine their ability to recognize kin relationship using the whole face as well as specific facial regions. The effect of participant gender and age and kin-relation pair of the stimulus is analyzed using quantitative measures such as accuracy, discriminability index d' , and perceptual information entropy. Utilizing the information obtained from the human study, a hierarchical kinship verification via representation learning (KVRL) framework is utilized to learn the representation of different face regions in an unsupervised manner. We propose a novel approach for feature representation termed as filtered contractive deep belief networks (fcDBN). The proposed feature representation encodes relational information present in images using filters and contractive regularization penalty. A compact representation of facial images of kin is extracted as an output from the learned model and a multi-layer neural network is utilized to verify the kin accurately. A new WVU kinship database is created, which consists of multiple images per subject to facilitate kinship verification. The results show that the proposed deep learning framework (KVRL-fcDBN) yields the state-of-the-art kinship verification accuracy on the WVU kinship database and on four existing benchmark data sets.

The vehicle senses its external environment using sensors, building a representation of the world used by the control systems. In on-road applications, the perception focuses on establishing the location of other road participants such as vehicles and pedestrians and identifying the road trajectory. Perception in the off-road environment is more complex, as the structure found in urban environments is absent. Off-road perception deals with the estimation of surface topography and surface type, which are the factors that will affect vehicle behaviour in unstructured environments. ::: ::: Off-road perception has seldom been explored in automotive context. For autonomous off-road driving, the perception solutions are primarily related to robotics and not directly applicable in the ADAS domain due to the different goals of unmanned autonomous systems, their complexity and the cost of employed sensors. Such applications consider only the impact of the terrain on the vehicle safety and progress but do not account for the driver comfort and assistance. ::: ::: This work addresses the problem of processing vision sensor data to extract the required information about the terrain. The main focus of this work is on the perception task with the constraints of automotive sensors and the requirements of the ADAS systems. By providing a semantic representation of the off-road environment including terrain attributes such as terrain type, description of the terrain topography and surface roughness, the perception system can cater for the requirements of the next generation of off-road ADAS proposed by Land Rover. ::: ::: Firstly, a novel and computationally efficient terrain recognition method was developed. The method facilitates recognition of low friction grass surfaces in real-time with high accuracy, by applying machine learning Support Vector Machine with illumination invariant normalised RGB colour descriptors. The proposed method was analysed and its performance was evaluated experimentally in off-road environments. Terrain recognition performance was evaluated on a variety of different surface types including grass, gravel and tarmac, showing high grass detection performance with accuracy of 97%. ::: ::: Secondly, a terrain geometry identification method was proposed which facilitates semantic representation of the terrain in terms of macro terrain features such as slopes, crest and ditches. The terrain geometry identification method processes 3D information reconstructed from stereo imagery and constructs a compact grid representation of the surface topography. This representation is further processed to extract object representation of slopes, ditches and crests. Thirdly, a novel method for surface roughness identification was proposed. The surface roughness descriptor is then further used to recommend a vehicle velocity, which will maintain passenger comfort. Surface roughness is described by the Power Spectral Density of the surface profile which correlates with the acceleration experienced by the vehicle. The surface roughness descriptor is then mapped onto vehicle speed recommendation so that the speed of the vehicle can be adapted in anticipation of the surface roughness. Terrain geometry and surface roughness identification performance were evaluated on a range of off-road courses with varying topology showing the capability of the system to correctly identify terrain features up to 20 m ahead of the vehicle and analyse surface roughness up to 15 m ahead of the vehicle. The speed was recommended correctly within +/- 5 kph. Further, the impact of the perception system on the speed adaptation was evaluated, showing the improvements in speed adaptation allowing for greater passenger comfort. ::: ::: The developed perception components facilitated the development of new off-road ADAS systems and were successfully applied in prototype vehicles. The proposed off-road ADAS are planned to be introduced in future generations of Land Rover products. The benefits of this research also included new Intellectual Property generated for Jaguar Land Rover. In the wider context, the enhanced off-road perception capability may facilitate further development of off-road automated driving and off-road autonomy within the constraints of the automotive platform", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2805738643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64707136"}

The key idea underlying this algorithmic family is to enforce labeling consistency between any two examples with a positive similarity.

To this end, we simultaneously leverage similarities and dissimilarities in our proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm which we term Bidirectional Label Propagation (BLP). Difierent from previous label propagation mechanisms that proceed along a single direction of graph edges, the BLP algorithm can propagate labels along not only positive but also negative edge directions. By using an initial neighborhood graph and class assignment constraints inherent among the labeled examples, a set of class-speciflc graphs are learned, which include both positive and negative edges and thus reveal discriminative cues. Over the learned graphs, a convex propagation criterion is carried out to ensure consistent labelings along the positive edges and inconsistent labelings along the negative edges.

Purpose of the researchSpasticity is one of the well-recognized complications of stroke which may give rise to pain and limit patients' ability to perform daily activities. The predisposing factors and direct effects of post-stroke spasticity also involve high management costs in terms of healthcare resources, and case-control designs are required for establishing such differences. Using 'The Health Improvement Network' (THIN) database, such a study would not provide reliable estimates since the prevalence of post-stroke spasticity was found to be 2%, substantially below the most conservative previously reported estimates. The objective of this study was to use predictive analysis techniques to determine if there are a substantial number of potentially under-recorded patients with post-stroke spasticity. MethodsThis study used retrospective data from adult patients with a diagnostic code for stroke between 2007 and 2011 registered in THIN. Two algorithm approaches were developed and compared, a statistically validated data-trained algorithm and a clinician-trained algorithm. ResultsA data-trained algorithm using Random Forest showed better prediction performance than clinician-trained algorithm, with higher sensitivity and only marginally lower specificity. Overall accuracy was 75% and 72%, respectively. The data-trained algorithm predicted an additional 3912 records consistent with patients developing spasticity in the 12months following a stroke. ConclusionsUsing machine learning techniques, additional unrecorded post-stroke spasticity patients were identified, increasing the condition's prevalence in THIN from 2% to 13%.

The researches need an efficient mechanism to recognise the various emotions precisely with less computation complexity. The current methods available are too complex with higher computational time. This study proposes a classification of human emotion using electroencephalogram signals (EEG). The study utilised electroencephalogram signals (EEG) to classify emotions which is positive/negative arousal, valence and normal emotions. Electroencephalogram signals (EEG) are analysed from 4 different participants from the dataset that acquire from the public data source. These dataset go through several processes before the derivation of the features such as preprocessing using band pass filtering and artifacts removals, segmentation of the signals and Multiwavelet Transform (MWT) analysis of the processed data. The signals are decomposed up to level 3 decomposition and detail coefficients are used for features extraction. Statistical and power spectral density (PSD) features are computed and feed into the classifiers. Simple classification methods Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the emotion and their performances are evaluated. The experimental results report that statistical features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved better accuracy up to 75.8%, 72.3% and 74.0% for arousal, valence and normal class respectively.

In Asia, FHD birth defect rates have reached as high as 9.3\u2030. For the early detection of birth defects and mortality, echocardiography remains the most effective method for screening fetal heart malformations. However, standard echocardiograms of the fetal heart, especially four-chamber view images, are difficult to obtain. In addition, the pathophysiological changes in fetal hearts during different pregnancy periods lead to ever-changing twodimensional fetal heart structures and hemodynamics, and it requires extensive professional knowledge to recognize and judge disease development. Thus, research on the automatic screening for FHD is necessary. In this paper, we proposed a new model named DGACNN that shows the best performance in recognizing FHD, achieving a rate of 85%. The motivation for this network is to deal with the problem that there are insufficient training datasets to train a robust model. There are many unlabeled video slices, but they are tough and time-consuming to annotate. Thus, how to use these unannotated video slices to improve the DGACNN capability for recognizing FHD, in terms of both recognition accuracy and robustness, is very meaningful for FHD screening. The architecture of DGACNN comprises two parts, that is, DANomaly and GACNN (Wgan-GP and CNN). DANomaly, similar to the ALOCC network, but incorporates cycle adversarial learning to train an end-to-end one-class classification (OCC) network that is more robust and has a higher accuracy than ALOCC in screening video slices. For the GACNN architecture, we use FCH(four chamber heart) video slices at around the endsystole, as screened by DANomaly, to train a WGAN-GP for the purpose of obtaining ideal low-level features that can robustly improve the FHD recognition accuracy. A few annotated video slices, as screened by DANomaly, can also be used for data augmentation so as to improve the FHD recognition further. The experiments show that the DGACNN outperforms other state-of-the-art networks by 1%\u201320% in recognizing FHD.A comparison experiment shows that the proposed network already outperforms the performance of expert cardiologists in recognizing FHD, reaching 84% in a test.

Their distributions in ForCenS, a database of species in seafloor sediment are studied as a proxy for upper ocean data and are analysed as occurrences using MaxEnt, and as relative abundances via non-parametric regression (Random Forests). Their distributions are similar and their co-occurrences are high but relations between their abundances and the environmental variables are complex and non-linear. In the occurrence analysis sea surface temperature is the strongest predictor of niche suitability, followed by chlorophyll-a; environments between 0 \u2013 20\u00b0 S are mapped as the most suitable for both species. To the contrary, predicted species distributions are strongly differentiated by the abundance analysis. Nitrate and chlorophyll-a are primary variables in the map of predicted relative abundances of Globigerinoides ruber, with maxima in the hyper-oligotrophic zone of the subtropical gyre. In contrast, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a are primary variables in the map for Trilobatus sacculifer and predicted maxima are at the margins of the hyper-oligotrophic zone and near the West Pacific Warm Pool. The high relative abundance of Globigerinoides ruber in the hyper-oligotrophic zone is attributed to its close photosymbiotic relation with on-board dinoflagellates; this compensates for the low primary productivity in the zone. It is clearly identified as the best-adapted planktonic foraminifer in this huge marine \u2018desert\u2019 and might serve as a useful proxy.

Some boosting methods use an specific combiner (Boosting Combiner) based on the accuracy of the network. Although the Boosting combiner provides good results on boosting ensembles, the simple combiner Output Average worked better in three new boosting methods we successfully proposed in previouses papers.

One approach is to use the information available about these genes in the biomedical literature. The goal in this paper, based on this approach, is to develop automatic annotation methods that can supplement the expensive manual annotation processes currently in place.ResultsUsing a set of Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers we were able to achieve Fscores of 0.49, 0.41 and 0.33 for codes of the molecular function, cellular component and biological process GO hierarchies respectively. We find that alternative term weighting strategies are not different from each other in performance and feature selection strategies reduce performance. The best thresholding strategy is one where a single threshold is picked for each hierarchy. Hierarchy level is important especially for molecular function and biological process. The cellular component hierarchy stands apart from the other two in many respects. This may be due to fundamental differences in link semantics. This research shows that it is possible to beneficially exploit the hierarchical structures by defining and testing a relaxed criteria for classification correctness. Finally it is possible to build classifiers for codes with very few associated documents but as expected a huge penalty is paid in performance.ConclusionThe GO annotation problem is complex.

For high dimension data, feature selection not only can improve the accuracy and efficiency of classification, but also discover informative subset.

The authors have examined the feasibility of the feature selection algorithm by conducting several experiments on KDD1999 intrusion detection dataset which was categorized as DOS, PROBE, R2L and U2R. The experimental results show that the approach is able not only to speed up the process of selecting important features but also to guarantee high detection rates.

Many functional sites and active sites often occur in polypeptides of \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 motifs. Therefore, the accurate prediction of \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 motifs is very important to recognizing protein tertiary structure and the study of protein function.

In the first layer, the framework trains lots of ELMs in different ensemble groups concurrently, then employs selective ensemble approach to pick out an optimal set of ELMs in each group, which can be merged into a large group of ELMs called candidate pool. In the second layer, selective ensemble approach is recursively used on candidate pool to acquire the final ensemble. In the experiments, we apply UCI blended datasets to confirm the robustness of our new approach in two key aspects (Mean Square Error and Standard Deviation). The space complexity of our method is increased to some degree, but the results have shown that RMSE-ELM significantly improves robustness with a rapid learning speed compared to representative methods (ELM, OP-ELM, GASEN-ELM, GASEN-BP and E-GASEN).

Any standard NLP techniques applied on such data such as POS tagging, Named entity recognition suffer because of noisy nature of the input. Usage of mixed script text is also prevalent in social media users. The current work addresses the identification of language at word level in mixed script scenarios, where all the text is written in roman script but the words being used by the users are transliterations of original words in native language into english. The core part of the problem is identifying the language, looking at small fragments of text among a set of languages. We propose a two stage approach for word-level language identification. In the first stage a mixing language combination is identified by using character n-grams of the sentence. Second stage consists of using the previous mixing combination class to make the word level language identification. We apply Conditional Random Fields(CRF) further in second stage to improve the performance of the word level language identification. Such simplification is essential, otherwise the number of states of the model will be huge and resultant model predictions are very noisy.

In particular, we introduce a modality classifier to predict the modality of a transformed feature.

A BCI can decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of brain activities, and then send a command or an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The effectiveness of the BCI depends on the performance in decoding the EEG. Usually, the EEG is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g., electromyogram (EMG), background activity), which leads to a low decoding performance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken the effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the EEG contains extreme artefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data segment containing extreme artefacts. This causes the fatal drawback that the BCI cannot output decoding results during that time. In order to solve this problem, we employ the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power from incomplete EEG (after removing only parts contaminated by artefacts), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for learning.

The feedback is based on three perception systems. The purpose of the presented research is to enhance the autonomy of the walking robot. The information about the class of the terrain allows the robot to work in the real world scenarios more efficiently. In the presented work twelve types of the ground were tested. Suitability of each type of the perception system for characterizing the terrain class was checked. Namely, vision, depth and tactile sensors were used. In each case as a classifier the Support Vector Machines were utilized. The separate classification results from each sensor were combined to obtain better precision and recall in the ground classification process. The information about the terrain type was fed into robot controller to adapt the robot gait parameters. The goal was to achieve good balance between the speed of the movement and the vibration caused by the bounciness and the irregularities of the terrain.The paper begins with the description of the experimental setup.

In this thesis we present two uses of word position in text: topic word selectors and topic flow signals. The topic word selectors identify important words, called topic words , by their spread through a text. The underlying assumption here is that words that repeat across the text are likely to be more relevant to the main topic of the text than ones that are concentrated in small segments. Our experiments show that manually selected keywords correspond more closely to topic words extracted using these selectors than to words chosen using more traditional indexing techniques. This correspondence indicates that topic words identify the topical content of the documents more than words selected using the traditional indexing measures that do not utilize word position in text. ::: The second approach to applying word position is through topic flow signals. In this representation, words are replaced by the topics to which they refer. The flow of any one topic can then be traced throughout the document and viewed as a signal that rises when a word relevant to the topic is used and falls when an irrelevant word occurs. To reflect the flow of the topic in larger segments of text we use a simple smoothing technique. The resulting smoothed signals are shown to be correlated to the ideal topic flow signals for the same document. ::: Finally, we characterize documents using the importance of their topic words and the spread of these words in the document. When incorporated into a Support Vector Machine classifier, this representation is shown to drastically reduce the vocabulary size and improve the classifier's performance compared to the traditional word-based, vector space representation.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2129263258", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62443950"}

This proposed transfer learning approach can be achieved by unifying existing Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Implementation of this unification is carried out by using \u201cTrain top layers and freeze out rest of the layers\u201d strategy. Here, the pre-trained VGG facilitates the role of expert learning model and SVM as domain specific learning model. Initial \u2018k\u2019 layers of pre-trained VGG are retained and (n-k) layers are replaced with SVM. To evaluate the proposed VGG-SVM model, a malaria digital corpus has been generated by acquiring blood smear images of infected and non-infected malaria patients and compared with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Malaria digital corpus images were used to analyse the performance of VGG19-SVM, resulting in classification accuracy of 93.1% in identification of infected falciparum malaria.

The welding current and speed are selected as the control variables. It is found that the correlation between any output and input depends on the value of another input. This cross coupling implies that a nonlinearity exists in the process being controlled. A neurofuzzy model is used to model this nonlinear dynamic process.

Various visual attention characteristics, including acceleration, geometric, and muscle properties, are extracted from eye gaze data and used as biometric features to identify persons. An algorithm based on mutual information of features is adopted to perform feature evaluation for obtaining a set of the most discriminative features for biometric identification. Experiments are conducted by using two types of classifiers, Back-Propagation (BP) neural network and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR strategy is constructed using a multi-kernel least squares support vector regression where the learning procedure of the proposed TS-LSSVR is achieved in three steps: In the first step, which is an offline step, the antecedent parameters of the TS-LSSVR are initialized using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The second step, which is an online step, deals with the adaptation of the antecedent parameters which can be implemented using a back-propagation algorithm. Finally, the last online step is to use the Fixed-Budget Kernel Recursive Least Squares algorithm to obtain the consequent parameters. Furthermore, an adaptive generalized predictive control for nonlinear systems is introduced by integrating the proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR into the generalized predictive controller (GPC). The reliability of the proposed adaptive TS-LSSVR GPC controller is investigated by controlling two nonlinear systems: A surge tank and continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) systems.

Initially, a single camera covering the full view of the room environment is used for the video recording of an elderly person's daily activities for a certain time period. The recorded video is then manually segmented into short video clips containing normal postures, which are used to compose the normal dataset. We use the codebook background subtraction technique to extract the human body silhouettes from the video clips in the normal dataset and information from ellipse fitting and shape description, together with position information, is used to provide features to describe the extracted posture silhouettes. The features are collected and an online one class support vector machine (OCSVM) method is applied to find the region in feature space to distinguish normal daily postures and abnormal postures such as falls. The resultant OCSVM model can also be updated by using the online scheme to adapt to new emerging normal postures and certain rules are added to reduce false alarm rate and thereby improve fall detection performance. From the comprehensive experimental evaluations on datasets for 12 people, we confirm that our proposed person-specific fall detection system can achieve excellent fall detection performance with 100% fall detection rate and only 3% false detection rate with the optimally tuned parameters.

The hybrid models in the performance comparison include Adaboost\u2013GD-ALR-BP\u2013MLP, Adaboost\u2013GDM-ALR-BP\u2013MLP, Adaboost\u2013CG-BP-FR\u2013MLP, Adaboost\u2013BFGS\u2013MLP, GD-ALR-BP\u2013MLP, GDM-ALR-BP\u2013MLP, CG-BP-FR\u2013MLP and BFGS\u2013MLP. Two experimental results show that: (1) the proposed hybrid Adaboost\u2013MLP forecasting architecture is effective for the wind speed predictions; (2) the Adaboost algorithm has promoted the forecasting performance of the MLP neural networks considerably; (3) among the proposed Adaboost\u2013MLP forecasting models, the Adaboost\u2013CG-BP-FR\u2013MLP model has the best performance; and (4) the improved percentages of the MLP neural networks by the Adaboost algorithm decrease step by step with the following sequence of training algorithms as: GD-ALR-BP, GDM-ALR-BP, CG-BP-FR and BFGS.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enconman.2014.12.053", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy Conversion and Management", "mag_id": "2011666252", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21028272", "205695212", "208973622", "116539651", "133605008", "56028418", "85449596", "133606249", "209696422", "54179143", "56440979", "10140327", "59620491", "52929070", "208163211", "59503428", "195831687", "109927873", "171084715", "211298726", "174809071", "81983782", "92992460", "202729376", "111383153", "159384512", "20150167"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108773413"}

Optimal integration of data from different MRI modalities is an active area of research aimed at increasing diagnostic accuracy. Based on a sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and a matched sample of 115 healthy controls that had undergone a single multimodal MRI session we generated individual brain maps of grey matter vbm, 1back and 2back levels of activation (nback fMRI), maps of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (resting fMRI) and maps of weighted global brain connectivity (resting fMRI). Four unimodal classifiers (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests and Gradient boosting) were applied to these maps to evaluate their classification accuracies. Based on the assignments made by the algorithms on test individuals we quantified the amount of predictive information shared between maps (what we call redundancy analysis). Finally, we explored the added accuracy provided by a set of multimodal strategies that included post-classification integration based on probabilities, two step sequential integration and voxel level multimodal integration through 1D-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN). All four unimodal classifiers showed the highest test accuracies with the 2back maps (80% on average) achieving a maximum of 84% with the Lasso. Redundancy levels between brain maps were generally low (overall mean redundancy score of 0.14 in a 0-1 range) indicating that each brain map contained differential predictive information. The highest multimodal accuracy was delivered by the two step Ridge classifier (87%) followed by the Ridge maximum and mean probability classifiers (both with 85% accuracy) and by the 1D-CNN that achieved the same accuracy than the best unimodal classifier (84%). From the results we conclude that from all MRI modalities evaluated, task based fMRI may be the best option for unimodal diagnostic in schizophrenia. Low redundancy values point to ample potential for accuracy improvements through multimodal integration, with the two step Ridge being a suitable strategy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6855131", "pubmed_id": "31787874", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2019.01203", "venue": "Front.

The case for discontinuous epitopes is even worse - currently there are only a few discontinuous epitope prediction servers available, though discontinuous peptides constitute the majority of all B-cell antigenic epitopes. The small number of structures for antigen-antibody complexes limits the development of reliable discontinuous epitope prediction methods and an unbiased benchmark to evaluate developed methods.ResultsIn this work, we present two novel server applications for discontinuous epitope prediction: EPSVR and EPMeta, where EPMeta is a meta server. EPSVR, EPMeta, and datasets are available at http://sysbio.unl.edu/services.ConclusionThe server application for discontinuous epitope prediction, EPSVR, uses a Support Vector Regression (SVR) method to integrate six scoring terms. Furthermore, we combined EPSVR with five existing epitope prediction servers to construct EPMeta. All methods were benchmarked by our curated independent test set, in which all antigens had no complex structures with the antibody, and their epitopes were identified by various biochemical experiments. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of EPSVR was 0.597, higher than that of any other existing single server, and EPMeta had a better performance than any single server - with an AUC of 0.638, significantly higher than PEPITO and Disctope (p-value < 0.05).", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2910724", "pubmed_id": "20637083", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-11-381", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2171732889", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["45223080", "8759259", "43441837", "8182012", "26599497", "90850", "1689272", "10620201", "18994303", "20647381", "84721900", "6822087", "6735806", "5201514", "11918059", "18739995", "2145296", "16280260", "153464", "24049376", "8403387", "2581246"], "inbound_citations": ["3258513", "210172889", "55857520", "11682699", "4637657", "215649957", "196679918", "40444575", "2581246", "1232457", "40527579", "7269181", "16168766", "37629685", "6725997", "36026125", "16307982", "17791652", "46934399", "7496454", "11476441", "18768289", "121184143", "201919351", "215436347", "215104696", "53867816", "1070594", "2620990", "190532081", "215448140", "49564807", "15948551", "214946177", "17944833", "16463612", "82109260", "1225028", "83233782", "18557540", "43572995", "10071067", "7756397", "215564845", "12728221", "4926262", "3374053", "1424805", "214877911", "15440606", "15141609", "379238", "215649307", "36908159", "23993422", "12633138", "2950149", "195847671", "191161295", "214952657"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2581246"}

Given the positions of team players from a plan view of the playing field at any given time, we solve a particular Poisson equation to generate a smooth distribution defined on whole playground, termed the position distribution of the team. Computing the position distribution for each frame provides a sequence of distributions, which we process to extract motion features for team activity recognition. The motion features are obtained at each frame using frame differencing and optical flow. We investigate the use of the proposed motion descriptors with Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification, and evaluate on a publicly available European handball dataset. Results show that our approach can classify six different team activities and performs better than a method that extracts features from the explicitly defined positions. Our method is new and different from other trajectory-based methods. These methods extract activity features using the explicitly defined trajectories, where the players have specific positions at any given time, and ignore the rest of the playground. In our work, on the other hand, given the specific positions of the team players at a frame, we construct a position distribution for the team on the whole playground and process the sequence of position distribution images to extract motion features for activity recognition. Results show that our approach is effective.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-33786-4_6", "venue": "ECCV", "journal": null, "mag_id": "192074925", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2849490", "10027965", "5896134", "46960348", "195884439", "8483403", "422698", "132328189", "55703342", "10214635", "2853476", "16014459", "14527880"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32610145"}

More specifically, biomolecules can be represented as vectors by the algorithm called biomarker2vec which combines 2 kinds of information involved the attribute learned by k-mer, etc and the behavior learned by Graph Factorization (GF). Then, Random Forest classifier is applied for training, validation and test. MAN-GF obtained a substantial performance with AUC of 0.9647 and AUPR of 0.9521 under 5-fold Cross-validation.

A novel technique for image retrieval in medical field with Grey Wolf Optimization-Support Vector Machine (GWO-SVM) is proposed. CT scan images are used as input images. Firstly, the images are considered for extraction, where the scaling & rotation invariant features are taken out using corresponding colour moments. Secondly, texture features are taken out using dominant GLCM features that comprise of correlation, contrast, energy, etc. Feature mapping is performed with the help of Bag of Words (BoW). In the existing system, the images are first retrieved and then classified. In the proposed method, the time of image retrieval is more since it has to search the whole database for performing the retrieval. Moreover, the retrieval rates obtained by the existing methods are not satisfactory. The novelty of proposed paper gives GWO-SVM technique that initially classifies the class to which the query image belongs. Further the retrieval task are organized only from the Database of query images. The GWO algorithm gives the solved and optimized parameters are given a clear optimized value for the SVM classifier. Thus, by finding the retrieval rate after performing the classification, it is evident that output retrieval rate is large when compared to existing methods. The fundamental performance metrics like accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are taken into comparison. The proposed techniques provides higher accuracy 97.3% than the performance of BoW and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO).", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-019-07777-w", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011792304", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7950087", "12014229", "17719593", "65065458", "12107967", "206787478", "13903183", "36834503", "17118616", "7232657", "110716", "14357198", "44050331", "17406079", "27207901", "15827348", "124319112", "1862649", "16714668", "12939740", "1046658", "2910032", "120332064", "21933379", "207217044", "7664224", "6029228", "45149192"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212689928"}

The blurry images could affect clinical diagnosis for both ophthalmologists and automatic aided system. Inspired by the great success of generative adversarial networks, a data-driven approach is proposed to enhance the blurry images in a weakly supervised manner. That is to say, instead of paired blurry and high-quality images, our approach can be trained with two sets of unpaired images. The advantage of unpaired training setting makes our approach easily applicable, since the annotated data are very limited in medical images. Compared with traditional methods, our model is an end-to-end approach without human designed adjustments or prior knowledge. However, it achieves a superior performance on blurry images. Besides, a dynamic retinal image feature constraint is proposed to guide the generator to improve the performance and avoid over-enhancing the extremely blurry region.

The WAAC algorithm is an extension of the modified ant colony algorithm of Shen et al. (J Chem Inf Model 2005, 45: 1024\u20131029). We test the ability of the algorithm to develop a predictive partial least squares model for the Karthikeyan dataset (J Chem Inf Model 2005, 45: 581\u2013590) of melting point values. We also test its ability to perform feature selection on a support vector machine model for the same dataset.ResultsStarting from an initial set of 203 descriptors, the WAAC algorithm selected a PLS model with 68 descriptors which has an RMSE on an external test set of 46.6\u00b0C and R2 of 0.51. The number of components chosen for the model was 49, which was close to optimal for this feature selection. The selected SVM model has 28 descriptors (cost of 5, \u03b5 of 0.21) and an RMSE of 45.1\u00b0C and R2 of 0.54. This model outperforms a kNN model (RMSE of 48.3\u00b0C, R2 of 0.47) for the same data and has similar performance to a Random Forest model (RMSE of 44.5\u00b0C, R2 of 0.55). However it is much less prone to bias at the extremes of the range of melting points as shown by the slope of the line through the residuals: -0.43 for WAAC/SVM, -0.53 for Random Forest.ConclusionWith a careful choice of objective function, the WAAC algorithm can be used to optimise machine learning and regression models that suffer from overfitting. Where model parameters also need to be tuned, as is the case with support vector machine and partial least squares models, it can optimise these simultaneously. The moving probabilities used by the algorithm are easily interpreted in terms of the best and current models of the ants, and the winnowing procedure promotes the removal of irrelevant descriptors.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2603525", "pubmed_id": "18959785", "doi": "10.1186/1752-153X-2-21", "venue": "Chemistry Central Journal", "journal": "Chemistry Central Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2124416069", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["379259", "12826032", "15011754", "15943670", "44969235", "31707429", "21266356", "12795832", "61649919", "15979205", "1811676", "20672785", "93911432", "10590411", "25915420", "197248987", "7138354", "15480929", "9918876", "18506807", "990370", "38846537", "13017241", "9555836", "5490204", "30824639", "49926110"], "inbound_citations": ["2811065", "16897832", "59039499", "37910939", "4715436", "113397801", "53334227", "10064221", "37717131", "199510084", "40892892", "38439749"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2022096"}

In the feature learning process, the key ingredient is how to learn a good feature mapping that connects patches to feature vectors. Among various feature mapping methods, the sparse filtering is easy to be implemented and hyper-parameter free.

This will lead to a random magnitude for mapping matrix and further weaken the generation performance. In this paper we proposed L2 regularized sparse filtering for the feature mapping in SULF.

This contrasts with the more common situation in which we have only few labeled documents and an abundance of unlabeled ones. A further degree of complexity of the learning task is represented by the importance of spatial relationships between layout components, which cannot be adequately represented by feature vectors. To face these problems, we investigate the application of a relational classifier that works in the transductive setting. Transduction is justified by the possibility of exploiting the large amount of information conveyed in the unlabeled documents and by the contiguity of the concept of positive autocorrelation with the smoothness assumption which characterizes the transductive setting.

Many sectors of our economy are now guided by data-driven decision processes. Big Data and business intelligence applications are facilitated by the MapReduce programming model while, at infrastructural layer, cloud computing provides flexible and cost effective solutions for allocating on demand large clusters. In such systems, capacity allocation, which is the ability to optimally size minimal resources for achieve a certain level of performance, is a key challenge to enhance performance for MapReduce jobs and minimize cloud resource costs. In order to do so, one of the biggest challenge is to build an accurate performance model to estimate job execution time of MapReduce systems. Previous works applied simulation based models for modeling such systems. Although this approach can accurately describe the behavior of Big Data clusters, it is too computationally expensive and does not scale to large system. We try to overcome these issues by applying machine learning techniques.

The supercapacitor-battery hybrid energy storage system is deployed in a solar energy system to improve the reliability of delivered power. The combination of batteries and supercapacitors makes use of complementary characteristic that allow the overlapping of a battery\u2019s high energy density with a supercapacitors\u2019 high power density. This hybrid system produces a straightforward benefit over either individual system, by taking advantage of each characteristic. When the supercapacitor caters for the instantaneous peak power which prolongs the battery lifespan, it also minimizes the system cost and ensures a greener system by reducing the number of batteries. The resulting performance is highly dependent on the energy controls implemented in the system to exploit the strengths of the energy storage devices and minimize its weaknesses. It is crucial to use energy from the supercapacitor and therefore minimize jeopardizing the power system reliability especially when there is a sudden peak power demand. This study has been divided into two stages. The first stage is to obtain the optimum SVM load prediction model, and the second stage carries out the performance comparison of the proposed SVM-load predictive energy management system with conventional sequential programming control (if-else condition). An optimized load prediction classification model is investigated and implemented. This C-Support Vector Classification yields classification accuracy of 100% using 17 support vectors in 0.004866s of training time. The Polynomial kernel is the optimum kernel in our experiments where the C and g values are 2 and 0.25 respectively. However, for the load profile regression model which was implemented in the K-step ahead of load prediction, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel was chosen due to the highest squared correlation coefficient and the lowest mean squared error. Results obtained shows that the proposed SVM load predictive energy management system accurately identifies and predicts the load demand. This has been justified by the supercapacitor charging and leading the peak current demand by 200ms for different load profiles with different optimized regression models.

On the other hand, simulation tools can capture the performance of transportation systems in response to combinations of various policies at different levels, while they are more often used for evaluation instead of optimization due to their high computational cost. This paper applies the surrogate-based optimization method, which enjoys the advantages of both simulation evaluations and mathematical optimization methods, to jointly optimize a transportation demand management policy (i.e. high-occupancy/toll, HOT) and a traffic operational strategy (i.e. freeway diversion control) for a freeway-arterial corridor (I-270 corridor) under a work zone scenario in the State of Maryland. A distribution based support vector regression model (D-SVR) is developed to take into account the observed asymmetric distribution of simulation noise. In addition, bootstrapping and expected improvement based infill strategies are incorporated into the D-SVR for the global optimization. Results of the numerical test show that the D-SVR can approximate the true response surface more accurately and the bootstrapped D-SVR converges to the global optimal solution much faster than other models. By applying the optimal solution predicted by the D-SVR in the I-270 corridor, the average trip travel time for work zone impacted vehicles is reduced by 7.66% compared to baseline during the PM peak period. With negligible cost in infrastructure construction, the total saved travel time by the D-SVR predicted optima corresponds to a yearly saving of around $11 million for the 5-hour extended PM peak period.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "309833822", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108005857"}

Existing automated or semi-automated methods usually require human interactions, which is time-consuming. Also, they typically use simple geometric properties as the criteria for segmentation, which cannot well handle the high variation of tooth appearance across different patients. Recently, several pioneering deep neural networks (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the computer vision and computer graphics communities to efficiently segment 3D shapes in an end-to-end manner. However, these methods do not perform well in our specific task of tooth labeling, especially considering that they cannot explicitly model fine-grained local geometric context of teeth (although only a small portion of dental surfaces but with different shapes and appearances). In this paper, we propose a specific deep neural network (called MeshSNet) for end-to-end tooth segmentation on 3D dental surfaces captured by advanced intraoral scanners. Using directly raw mesh data as input, our MeshSNet adopts novel graph-constrained learning modules to hierarchically extract multi-scale contextual features, and then densely integrates local-to-global geometric features to comprehensively characterize mesh cells for the segmentation task. We evaluated our proposed method on an in-house clinic dataset via 3-fold cross-validation.

Due to the seasonal variability of different vegetation types and land surface characteristics, the ability to discriminate land cover types changes over time. Multi-temporal classification can help to improve the classification accuracies, but different constraints, such as financial restrictions or atmospheric conditions, may impede their application. The optimisation of image acquisition timing and frequencies can help to increase the effectiveness of the classification process. For this purpose, the Feature Importance (FI) measure of the state-of-the art machine learning method Random Forest was used to determine the optimal image acquisition periods for a general (Grassland, Forest, Water, Settlement, Peatland) and Grassland specific (Improved Grassland, Semi-Improved Grassland) land cover classification in central Ireland based on a 9-year time-series of MODIS Terra 16 day composite data (MOD13Q1). Feature Importances for each acquisition period of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated for both classification scenarios. In the general land cover classification, the months December and January showed the highest, and July and August the lowest separability for both VIs over the entire nine-year period. This temporal separability was reflected in the classification accuracies, where the optimal choice of image dates outperformed the worst image date by 13% using NDVI and 5% using EVI on a mono-temporal analysis. With the addition of the next best image periods to the data input the classification accuracies converged quickly to their limit at around 8\u201310 images. The binary classification schemes, using two classes only, showed a stronger seasonal dependency with a higher intra-annual, but lower inter-annual variation. Nonetheless anomalous weather conditions, such as the cold winter of 2009/2010 can alter the temporal separability pattern significantly. Due to the extensive use of the NDVI for land cover discrimination, the findings of this study should be transferrable to data from other optical sensors with a higher spatial resolution. However, the high impact of outliers from the general climatic pattern highlights the limitation of spatial transferability to locations with different climatic and land cover conditions. The use of high-temporal, moderate resolution data such as MODIS in conjunction with machine-learning techniques proved to be a good base for the prediction of image acquisition timing for optimal land cover classification results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2014.08.001", "venue": "Int.

There are various types of glaucoma screening tests such as tonometry test which is based on IOP measurement, ophthalmology test which is based on shape and color of the eyes, and pachymetry test which is based on complete field vision measurement. All these three screening tests involve manual assessment which is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, an efficient glaucoma screening system that can automatically analyze the severity level of the disease is very much needed. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to develop an automatic glaucoma screening system based on superpixel classification by providing a high-quality input image. Firstly, input images are undergone preprocessing methods to cater for noise removal and illumination correction. This is emphasized in the implementation of the anisotropic diffusion filter and illumination correction method. The pixels of the input images are then aggregate into superpixels using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) approach. Then, image features based on histogram data and textural information are extracted on each superpixel using statistical pixel-level (SPL) method. The prominent features are then fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify each superpixel into optic disc, optic cup, blood vessel, and background regions. The classifier is also used to determine the boundaries of both optic disc and optic cup. Lastly, the segmented optic disc and optic cup are used to determine the presence of glaucoma using cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) measurement. The proposed method has been tested on RIM-One database. The experimental results have successfully distinguished optic disc and optic cup from the background with an average accuracy and sensitivity of 98.6% and 92.3%, respectively tested on linear kernel.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2019.01.003", "venue": "Biomed.

Specifically, we use the Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) method to predict the effectiveness of software engineering teamwork learning based on data collected during student team project development. These data include over 100 objective and quantitative Team Activity Measures (TAM) obtained from monitoring and measuring activities of student teams during the creation of their final class project in our joint software engineering classes which ran concurrently at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Fulda University (Fulda) and Florida Atlantic University (FAU). In this paper we provide the first RF analysis results done at SFSU on our full data set covering four years of our joint SE classes. These data include 74 student teams with over 380 students, totaling over 30000 discrete data points. These data are grouped into 11 time intervals, each measuring important phases of project development during the class (e.g. early requirement gathering and design, development, testing and delivery). We briefly elaborate on the methods of data collection and describe the data itself. We then show prediction results of the RF analysis applied to this full data set. Results show that we are able to detect student teams who are bound to fail or need attention in early class time with good (about 70%) accuracy. Moreover, the variable importance analysis shows that the features (TAM measures) with high predictive power make intuitive sense, such as late delivery/late responses, time used to help each other, and surprisingly statistics on commit messages to the code repository, etc. In summary, we believe we demonstrate the viability of using ML on objective and quantitative team activity measures to predict student learning of software engineering teamwork, and point to easy-to-measure factors that can be used to guide educators and software engineering managers to implement early intervention for teams bound to fail.

Case studies are performed by using real-time digital simulator that enables dynamic interactions between scheduling decisions and operating conditions. Simulation results show that the CRF-based RL method can approach the theoretical optimal scheduling solution after 50 days training.

Here we describe an algorithm based on kernel estimation called Adaptive Gaussian Filtering that incorporates several innovations to produce superior efficiency as compared to three other popular methods: k-nearest-neighbour (KNN), Learning Vector Quantisation (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This efficiency is gained with no compromises: accuracy is maintained, while estimates of the conditional probabilities are returned. These are useful not only to gauge the accuracy of an estimate in the absence of its true value, but also to re-calibrate a retrieved image...", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": "1202.2194", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/01431161.2010.507795", "venue": "International Journal of Remote Sensing, 2011, 32(21): 6109-6132", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2129036129", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["961425", "198120309", "5894296", "61769312", "60696486", "11480273", "121521074"], "inbound_citations": ["206776735", "753659", "15256224", "7424147", "66956494", "14700397", "1637949", "122867193", "61486567", "56321252", "49272985", "9093240", "8228228", "31194450", "59233679", "17053862", "91969229", "121926398", "55983308", "1608970", "4615880", "209445171", "25771898", "52291518", "209444797", "17944400", "53179236"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88518570"}

Therefore our method generates an output of the exact object regions instead of the bounding boxes generated by most detectors.

On the one hand, multiclass classification problems require the prediction of class labels: given observations of objects that belong to certain classes, can we predict to which class a new object belongs? On the other hand, the regularized regression problem is a variation of the common regression problem, which measures how changes in independent variables influence an observed outcome. In regularized regression, constraints are placed on the coefficients of the regression model to enforce certain properties in the solution, such as sparsity or limited size. ::: ::: In this dissertation several new algorithms are presented for both multiclass classification and regularized regression problems. For multiclass classification the GenSVM method is presented. This method extends the binary support vector machine to multiclass classification problems in a way that is both flexible and general, while maintaining competitive performance and training time. In a different chapter, accurate estimates of the Bayes error are applied to both meta-learning and the construction of so-called classification hierarchies: structures in which a multiclass classification problem is decomposed into several binary classification problems. ::: ::: For regularized regression problems a new algorithm is presented in two parts: first for the sparse regression problem and second as a general algorithm for regularized regression where the regularization function is a measure of the size of the coefficients.

Accordingly from the improved recursive algorithm [9], [10], we deduce a more efficient inverse-free algorithm ::: to update the regularized pseudo-inverse, from which we develop the proposed inverse-free ELM algorithm 1. Moreover, the proposed ELM algorithm 2 further reduces the computational complexity, which computes the output weights directly from the updated inverse, and avoids computing the regularized pseudoinverse. Lastly, instead of updating the inverse, the proposed ELM algorithm 3 updates the LDLT factor of the inverse by the inverse LDLT factorization [11], to avoid numerical instabilities after a very large number of iterations [12]. With respect to the existing ELM algorithm, the proposed ELM algorithms 1, 2 and 3 are expected to require only (8+3)/M , (8+1)/M and (8+1)/M of complexities, respectively, where M is the output node number.

Corpus-based bootstrapping using a multilingual, multifaceted lexicon was applied to construct an annotated testing dataset, while unsupervised methods such as lexicon polarity detection, frequent item extraction through association rules and latent semantic analysis were used to identify the polarity of Singlish n-grams before human assessment was done to isolate misleading terms and remove concept ambiguity.

In addition, a hybrid combination of the Support Vector Machine and a proposed Singlish Polarity Detection algorithm, which incorporates unigram and n-gram Singlish sentic patterns with other multilingual polarity sentic patterns such as negation and adversative, is able to outperform other approaches in comparison.

In the task of analyzing microarray data for the purpose of, e.g., predicting gene-disease association, feature selection is very important because it provides a way to handle the high dimensionality by exploiting information redundancy induced by associations among genetic markers. Judicious feature selection in microarray data analysis can result in significant reduction of cost while maintaining or improving the classification or prediction accuracy of learning machines that are employed to sort out the datasets. In this paper, we propose a gene selection method called Recursive Feature Addition (RFA), which combines supervised learning and statistical similarity measures. We compare our method with the following gene selection methods: N Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVMRFE) N Leave-One-Out Calculation Sequential Forward Selection (LOOCSFS) N Gradient based Leave-one-out Gene Selection (GLGS) To evaluate the performance of these gene selection methods, we employ several popular learning classifiers on the MicroArray Quality Control phase II on predictive modeling (MAQC-II) breast cancer dataset and the MAQC-II multiple myeloma dataset. Experimental results show that gene selection is strictly paired with learning classifier. Overall, our approach outperforms other compared methods. The biological functional analysis based on the MAQC-II breast cancer dataset convinced us to apply our method for phenotype prediction.

Deep convolutional network can learn the most suitable features of certain images without specific measure functions and outperform lots of traditional image processing methods. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is becoming one of the highlights among these deep neural networks. GAN is capable of generating realistic images which are imperceptible to the human vision system so that the generated images can be directly used as intermediate medium for many tasks. One promising application of using GAN generated images would be image concealing which requires the embedded image looks like not being tampered to human vision system and also undetectable to most analyzers. Texture synthesizing has drawn lots of attention in computer vision field and is used for image concealing in steganography and watermark. The traditional methods which use synthesized textures for information hiding mainly select features and mathematic functions by human metrics and usually have a low embedding rate. This paper takes advantage of the generative network and proposes an approach for synthesizing complex texture-like image of arbitrary size using a modified deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), and then demonstrates the feasibility of embedding another image inside the generated texture while the difference between the two images is nearly invisible to the human eyes.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3970/cmc.2018.03950", "venue": null, "journal": "Cmc-computers Materials & Continua", "mag_id": "2900501183", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54456753", "203605616", "195488286"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:139766649"}

The problem is important since with the recent advances in the Internet and Web technologies, consumers have access to vast amount of multimedia data that can be viewed over a range of devices and are in urgent need of new tools to manage/utilize the video/image content efficiently. ::: The principal goal of this thesis is to design an automatic video processing architecture that will enable us to design and develop efficient multimedia applications such as summarization, indexing, retrieval and many others. While there are many research projects in this area, many, if not all, rely on MPEG-7 standard for high-level semantic retrieval. The proposed architecture is compatible with MPEG-7 standard in that the proposed architecture can be annotated using the MPEG-7 specifications, but we focus on user relevance feedback in the high-level semantic retrieval task. We address the problem of automatic video indexing, organization and video information retrieval through user interaction at multiple levels. Our work focuses on the following three important areas: (1) low-level temporal video segmentation that automatically divides the video data into meaningful units---\"shots\"; (2) middle-level semantic cluster construction that automatically groups frames/shots into clusters for semantic analysis and retrieval; (3) high-level video/image data retrieval that automatically learns users' semantic requirements and returns results. ::: In particular, we propose the following: (1) a novel automatic temporal segmentation method; (2) a new cluster-based framework for hierarchical video representation; (3) a novel automatic video summarization method for quick user browsing; (4) a new method to answer user's high-level semantic query using user relevance feedback. The proposed algorithms will implement the components of a complete video content management system and will provide such key functionalities as browsing, visual summarization, content-based retrieval and indexing. ::: We first develop a fully automatic clustering algorithm to group video frames into different clusters without the need for threshold selection. The algorithm is based on Delaunay Triangulation. These clusters can be manually annotated based on MPEG-7 standard and can then be used by applications that are compliant with the MPEG-7 specifications. ::: Then the low-level video segmentation method is proposed by integrating the sliding window method and the Delaunay clustering algorithm. The mid-level video summarization is derived directly from the automatic clustering algorithm. A keyframe based summary is automatically generated from the clusters. ::: Finally, in the high-level video/image retrieval task, we propose a new algorithm integrating Fuzzy Support Vector Machine and Relevance Feedback for content-based information retrieval. This algorithm learns users' semantic requirement and adjusts results automatically. ::: For all the proposed algorithms, we test their performance on publicly available data set and compare the results with other related work.

In the first part, we developed an original Random Forest based framework for vertebrae corner localization that was applied on sagittal radiographs of both cervical and lumbar spine regions. A rigorous evaluation of the method confirms robustness and high accuracy of the proposed method. In the second part, we developed an algorithm for the clinically-important task of pedicle localization in the thoracolumbar region on frontal radiographs. The proposed algorithm compares favourably to similar methods from the literature while relying on less manual supervision. The last part of this PhD tackled the scarcely-studied task of joint detection, identification and segmentation of spinous processes of cervical vertebrae in sagittal radiographs, with again high precision performance. All three algorithmic solutions were designed around a generic framework exploiting dedicated visual feature descriptors and multi-class Random Forest classifiers, proposing a novel solution with computational and manual supervision burdens aiming for translation into clinical use.

Moreover, such the method is very subjective and may have a high degree of variability, being unable to provide accurate assessments. Additionally, because only a small area of the road surfaces can be sampled by using this method, it will result in relatively low coverage of the road's pavement distress information. Hence, an automatic pavement inspection system is desired in hope of resolving the aforementioned problems. This paper presents a novel method to classify pavement distress images and to store the information analyzed into a spatial database. The system is called pavement distress recognition system (PDRS), and it is installed on a pavement inspection vehicle with image acquiring devices in order to expedite the entire analysis process while maintaining traffic flows. First, pavement images were processed to show only black-and-white pixels that can render true pavement cracks. Then, the pavement images were analyzed by a clustering algorithm to transform into a set of clusters in order to capture the distress location of each crack. Next, the distress types, i.e., horizontal, vertical, alligator-like, or man-hole-like, were obtained by applying a decision tree algorithm. The two data mining algorithms utilized in this research are similar to the ones used in wafer defects image detection. Then, the system stores the data and images into a spatial database, which can provide spatial query functions for users to retrieve crack information. Finally, the pavement distress database is populated using the crack grouping algorithm (CGA) and the crack linking algorithm (CLA) to create spatial relations for further management of pavement cracks.

The segmentation algorithm is fully automated to accurately and efficiently delineate the whole tumor on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for radiotherapy treatment planning. The survival algorithm predicts the OS for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients based on regression and classification principles. Multi-institutional BRATS\u20192017 data of MRI scans from 477 patients with high-grade and lower-grade glioma (HGG/LGG) used in this study. Clinical patient survival data of 291 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were available in the provided data. Support vector machines (SVMs) were used to develop both algorithms. The segmentation chain comprises pre-processing with a goal of noise removal, feature extraction of the image intensity, segmentation process using a non-linear classifier with \u2018Gaussian\u2019 kernel, and post-processing to enhance the segmentation morphology. The OS prediction algorithm sequence involves two steps; extraction of patient\u2019s age, and segmented tumor\u2019s size and its location features; prediction process using a non-linear classifier and a linear regression model with \u2018Gaussian\u2019 kernels.

Our primary contribution is showing that a generative model can be used to learn a density estimation from screen space buffers to an advanced illumination model for a 3D environment. Once trained, our network can approximate global illumination for scene configurations it has never encountered before within the environment it was trained on. We evaluate Deep Illumination through a comparison with both a state of the art real-time GI technique (VXGI) and an offline rendering GI technique (path tracing).

Breast cancer is one of the prime causes of death in women. Early detection may help to improve the survival rate to a great extent. Mammography is considered as one of the most reliable methods to prescreen of breast cancer. However, reading the mammograms by radiologists is laborious, taxing, and prone to intra/inter observer variability errors. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) helps to obtain fast, consistent and reliable diagnosis. This paper presents an automated classification of normal, benign and malignant breast cancer using digitized mammogram images. The proposed method used Gabor wavelet for feature extraction and Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) for data reduction. The reduced features are ranked using their F-values and fed to Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost and Fuzzy Sugeno (FSC) classifiers one by one to select the highest performing classifier using minimum number of features. The proposed method is evaluated using 690 mammogram images taken from a benchmarked Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset. Our developed method has achieved mean accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of 98.69%, 99.34% and 98.26% respectively for k-NN classifier using eight features with 10-fold cross validation.

Currently, most of the methods mainly rely on prior knowledge to extract features artificially for cloud detection. However, these features may not be able to accurately represent the cloud characteristics under complex environment. In this paper, we adopt an innovative model named Fuzzy Autoencode Model (FAEM) to integrate the feature learning ability of stacked autoencode networks and the detection ability of fuzzy function for highly accurate cloud detection on remote sensing imagery. Our proposed method begins by selecting and fusing spectral, texture, and structure information. Thereafter, the proposed technique established a FAEM to learn the deep discriminative features from a great deal of selected information. Finally, the learned features are mapped to the corresponding cloud density map with a fuzzy function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 172 Landsat ETM+ images and 25 GF-1 images with different spatial resolutions are used in this paper. For the convenience of accuracy assessment, ground truth data are manually outlined. Results show that the average RER (ratio of right rate and error rate) on Landsat images is greater than 29, while the average RER of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is 21.8 and Random Forest (RF) is 23. The results on GF-1 images exhibit similar performance as Landsat images with the average RER of 25.9, which is much higher than the results of SVM and RF.

Given a feature set and a local feature evaluation function (such as chi-square measure, mutual information etc.,) the proposed framework ranks the features in groups instead of ranking individual features. A group of features with rth rank is more powerful than the group of features with (r+1)th rank. Each group is made up of a subset of features which are supposed to be capable of discriminating every class from every other class. The added advantage of the proposed framework is that it automatically eliminates the redundant features while selecting features without requirement of study of features in combination. Further the proposed framework also helps in handling overlapping classes effectively through selection of low ranked yet powerful features. An extensive experimentation has been conducted on three benchmarking datasets using four different local feature evaluation functions with Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes classifiers to bring out the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the respective conventional counterparts.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2017.12.025", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.

A comprehensive analysis of the application of these methods for the diversity oriented virtual screening of biological targets/drug classes is presented here. A number of classification models have been built using three types of inputs namely structure based descriptors, molecular fingerprints and therapeutic category for performing virtual screening. The activity and affinity descriptors of a set of inhibitors of four target classes DHFR, COX, LOX and NMDA have been utilized to train a total of six classifiers viz. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), k nearest neighbor (k- NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree - (DT) and Random Forest - (RF). Among these classifiers, the ANN was found as the best classifier with an AUC of 0.9 irrespective of the target. New molecular fingerprints based on pharmacophore, toxicophore and chemophore (PTC), were used to build the ANN models for each dataset. A good accuracy of 87.27% was obtained using 296 chemophoric binary fingerprints for the COX-LOX inhibitors compared to pharmacophoric (67.82 %) and toxicophoric (70.64 %). The methodology was validated on the classical Ames mutagenecity dataset of 4337 molecules. To evaluate it further, selectivity and promiscuity of molecules from five drug classes viz. anti-anginal, anti-convulsant, anti-depressant, anti-arrhythmic and anti-diabetic were studied. The TPC fingerprints computed for each category were able to capture the drug-class specific features using the k-NN classifier.

NER in Indian languages is always a complex task due to their morphological richness and agglutinative nature. Even though different solutions were proposed for NER, it is still an unsolved problem. Traditional approaches to Named Entity Recognition were based on the application of hand-crafted features to classical machine learning techniques such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and so forth.

A promising approach is to embed the high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional latent representation space, estimate the latent dynamics model, then utilize this model for control in the latent space. An important open question is how to learn a representation that is amenable to existing control algorithms? In this paper, we focus on learning representations for locally-linear control algorithms, such as iterative LQR (iLQR). By formulating and analyzing the representation learning problem from an optimal control perspective, we establish three underlying principles that the learned representation should comprise: 1) accurate prediction in the observation space, 2) consistency between latent and observation space dynamics, and 3) low curvature in the latent space transitions. These principles naturally correspond to a loss function that consists of three terms: prediction, consistency, and curvature (PCC). Crucially, to make PCC tractable, we derive an amortized variational bound for the PCC loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmark domains demonstrate that the new variational-PCC learning algorithm benefits from significantly more stable and reproducible training, and leads to superior control performance. Further ablation studies give support to the importance of all three PCC components for learning a good latent space for control.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.01506", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2971413157,2995322606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14273320", "17139307", "1731857", "50782752", "1925548", "1616437", "44177328", "53280207", "52115594", "26765592", "15238391", "33559516", "54437075"], "inbound_citations": ["203591671", "211678253", "214667003"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202541346"}

Kawamoto (ahk@ucsc.edu) Department of Psychology, University of California at Santa Cruz Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA Abstract for responses beginning with plosive segments is typically 50 \u2013 100 ms slower than responses beginning with non- plosive segments, although this difference can be as short as 20 ms in speeded naming tasks (see Kawamoto, Kello, Jones & Bame, 1998). Notably, the plosivity effect can be completely eliminated in some tasks (Kawamoto, Liu, Mura, & Sanchez, 2008), or enhanced in others (Liu, Kawamoto, & Grebe, 2009). In this paper, we consider articulatory processes in a connectionist model of reading aloud to account for effects of manner of articulation of the initial segment in a variety of tasks. We first describe experimental results showing how flexibility in articulation can completely eliminate the a priori acoustic latency difference between plosives and non-plosives in some tasks, and exaggerate this difference in other tasks. We then simulate an expanded version of the Connectionist Incremental Articulation Model that incorporates Stevens\u2019 (1998) 3 phases involved in articulating a speech segment. The Elimination of the Plosivity Effect In a study examining the temporal relationship between the onsets of the articulatory and acoustic responses in the delayed naming task, participants were presented with the complete stimulus (a monosyllabic word) at the beginning of a trial and were told to respond as quickly and accurately as possible only after a signal to respond was given, which was given after a delay. Using stimuli that began with the segments /p/, /t/, /m/, and /n/, Kawamoto and colleagues found that what constituted the initiation of the response to participants was the onset of the acoustic response, despite the fact that for long delays, the onset of the articulatory response occurred before the signal to respond. In essence, participants were moving their articulators into the optimal position for the phonation of the acoustic response while they were waiting for the signal to respond. For sufficiently long delays, that meant holding the acoustic response in abeyance until the signal to respond was detected. For responses beginning with non-plosive segments (/m/ and /n/), that meant holding the response at the cusp of the second articulatory phase, whereas for responses beginning with plosive segments (/p/ and /t/), it was held at the cusp of the third articulatory phase. Basically, when participants were afforded the opportunity (i.e., long delays) to not only form the appropriate oral constriction (phase 1), but also build the required intra-oral pressure (phase 2) for plosive initial segments, the plosivity effect disappeared completely. But when there was insufficient time for the first two phases to be completed for plosive initial segments (i.e., short delays), a plosivity effect could still be observed, although the magnitude of the plosivity effect diminishes as a function of delay. Keywords: Phonological Priming; Word Naming; Speech Production; Segment Duration; Jordan Network; Minimal Unit of Articulation; Response Criterion The Precise Articulatory Sequence in the Production of Individual Sounds Researchers have known that the onset of the articulatory response occurs long before the onset of the acoustic response (Bell-Berti & Harris, 1981). This asynchrony between the onset of articulatory and acoustic responses is due to the fact that individual sounds are produced in three distinct articulatory phases: (1) the movements of the articulators toward the formation of the oral constriction; (2) the flow of air behind or around the oral constriction; and (3) the release of the current constriction and movement toward the next constriction (Stevens, The exact point at which the acoustic event is produced in the sequence above for initial segments that differed in manner can be distinguished according to their specific articulatory requirements. For non-plosive segments such as /m/, /l/, /r/, /s/, etc., acoustic energy can be generated shortly after their respective oral constriction are formed. However, for plosive segments such as /p/, /t/, /k/, etc., acoustic energy can be generated only after (a) the buildup of sufficient intra-oral pressure, and (b) the release of the current oral constriction. That is, acoustic onset for non-plosive segments occurs during the second phase, whereas for plosive segments, it occurs during the third. The Plosivity Effect This differential requirement for the production of the acoustic events of plosive and non-plosive segments is the basis for the Plosivity Effect. Because the acoustic event for plosive segments requires the buildup of the intra-oral pressure, the onset of acoustic energy (acoustic latency) The Enhancement of the Plosivity Effect In a different study, which examined the minimal unit of phonological information needed to initiate articulation (i.e., minimal unit of articulation), participants again produced monosyllabic utterances that began with the", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2626798000", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["23280118", "1825817", "15375627", "143446741", "29201627", "144806020", "59709491"], "inbound_citations": ["19474720"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14704677"}

Models which may simulate these tasks, such as the configural-cue network (Gluck & Bower, 1988b), appear to be unable to accurately simulate certain data well simulated by exemplar-based models such as ALCOVE (Kruschke, 1992). ::: ::: A task in which the advantage of ALCOVE is exemplified is the prediction of human learning rates on the six category structures tested by Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961). The ability of ALCOVE to simulate the observed order of difficulty depends on its incorporation of selective attention processes (Nosofsky, Gluck, Palmeri, McKinley, & Glauthier, 1994). This thesis focuses on developing configural-cue network models which incorporate these processes. ::: ::: Informed by an information-theoretic approach to modelling the implementation of selective attention using a configural-cue representation, five connectionist models are developed. Each is capable of predicting the order of difficulty reported by Shepard et al. (1961). Two models employ a modular structure, but analysis suggests that these may lack much of the functionality of the basic configural-cue network. The remaining three incorporate dimensional attention schemes. These models appear to offer superior generalisability in relation to the simulation of learning about variable dimensionality stimuli. ::: ::: This generalisability is examined by applying a variant of one of these dimensional attention models, to data collected by Kruschke (1996a) on the inverse base-rate effect and base-rate neglect. The model provides a qualitative fit to this data. ::: ::: The success of these configural-cue models on these two tasks, only successfully modelled previously using two distinct types of representation, indicates that the approach has some potential for further applications. Differences between the models applied, however, indicates that more sophisticated conceptions of the attention process may be required to allow further generalisability..", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1540150088", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53893787"}

The standard therapies prescribed to HGSOvCa patients include several chemotherapy cycles based on platinum-taxol drugs and a debulking surgery for removing the cancer tissues. A fundamental characteristic of this disease, that drastically decreases the 5-years survival rates, is the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance by the tumoral cells after the first-line treatment. Both the cancer aggressiveness and the development of the platinum resistance increase the necessity of a more effective and targeted therapy.During the last 10 years, a branch of the cancer research has focused its attention on the genomic components called \"long non-coding RNAs\". These elements, originating from RNA molecules, do not encode for proteins and are composed by a number of nucleotides that ranges from 200 to 100000. Even if they do not have encoding properties, it was shown that those transcripts are actively involved in many cell functions and they are dysregulated during the genesis and the development of different tumors. The main goal of this master thesis is to develop a pipeline for the automatic identification of long non-coding RNAs that can be possibly involved in the platinum-resistance process (generally called drivers). By knowing the drivers and the molecular processes that lead to chemotherapy resistance it would be possible to identify efficient pharmacological targets and design a more effective therapy. This thesis was conducted in collaboration with the System Biology Lab for Drug Resistance of the Helsinki University in Finland. The data employed in the analysis were measured amount of different long non-coding RNA molecules (called expression levels) obtained through the total RNA-sequencing of different HGSOvCa patients\u2019 samples, collected when the disease is diagnosed. In order to achieve the proposed goal, the analysis was focused on the identification of genes that showed different behaviours in the chemo-resistant patients with respect to the chemo-sensitive ones. For this reason, samples were initially divided in two groups, according to the available clinical data. The analysis was conducted by realizing a pipeline that integrates two different strategies: an unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach supported by statistical processing and a supervised procedure composed by two feature selection methods based on the Random Forest and the Boruta algorithms. The choice of combining different methods for the same analysis was raised by the necessity of having more confident results. The outcomes of the two employed methods, in fact, were finally compared and only the long non-coding RNAs identified by all the techniques were taken into account. From the analysis were retrieved 6 long non-coding RNAs that can potentially be related to the chemotherapy resistance and that are currently under validation. In this work of thesis were also highlighted the strength and the weaknesses of the adopted approaches as well as the limitations of the study encountered during the analysis.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2913411337", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86512373"}

However, most of the standard transfer learning algorithms are designed to repeat the same method for fine-tuning of the weights on the target domain. If we try to investigate the human brain's mechanism of learning a new complex concept based on a simple and basic concept, we can say, it is different from just the repetition of the same method of learning on a different dataset. In this article, we have introduced a novel transfer learning algorithm referred to as HTL (Hebbian transfer learning) using synaptic plasticity. The Hebbian theory, introduced by Donald Hebb, explains the \"associative learning\" in which the simultaneous activation of the brain cells positively affects the increase in the synaptic connection strength between the individual cells. This particular behaviour of Hebbian learning, makes it a very viable candidate for discriminative learning for the search of the specific feature for the task of object recognition or image classification. It helps connection weights of the learned model to adapt as per task dataset using numerical methods defining plasticity principles. Learning to discriminate between instances of different classes, over a variable number of classes within the dataset space defined by the task at hand, can be the result-oriented approach for classification problem. Extensive experiments verify that HTL, using synaptic plastic behaviour in heterogeneous transfer learning task does better than the standard state of the art methods of transfer learning on the cross-domain image classification task.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3374587.3375880", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 2019 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3010448671", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14739721", "16945044", "62285311", "147613", "29136678", "61444551", "16683347", "6719686", "5556470", "5258236", "461853", "17055992", "568305", "8909022"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212114311"}

This paper proposes a recursive approach based on the Perturbation theory to correct the forecasting of ML models. From the initial forecasting given by an ML model, a new ML model is trained using the error series (the difference between the actual series and forecasting) of the first model to decrease the overall error of the system. This process can be recursively repeated until convergence or some stop criterion. The response of the perturbative approach is composed of the sum of the predictions (perturbations) of the ML models trained in each recursion. The proposed approach is investigated with four ML models: Support Vector Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory, and Radial Basis Function network.

With an efficient implementation of single-label algorithms, and considering dependency between labels and the fact that similar samples often share the same labels, we can expect a highly effective classification in multi-label datasets. In this paper, to tackle multi-label classification problem, first using an improved twin support vector machine classifier, the hyperplanes containing structural information of samples and local information of each class label, are found. Then the prior probability of each hyperplane and the sample points that are located in the margins of the hyperplanes are extracted. For the prediction phase, several facts are applied to help finding the sets of relevant labels of a sample: (1) samples with similar labels share the same information, (2) local information has a great impact on the performance and efficiency of a multi-label algorithm, and (3) the samples that are most important in classifications are located in the margin of hyperplanes. To obtain the sets of relevant labels for a test sample, first its k nearest samples in the margin space of the hyperplanes are found. Then, relevant labels are extracted using statistical and membership counting methods. The nonlinear version of the algorithm is also developed through kernel trick. The experimental results obtained from different datasets and different measures indicated good performances of the proposed algorithm, compared to several relevant methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.09.044", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2894139356", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198147197", "155105443", "209451963"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53046756"}

While the number of intact sequences increases linearly with the number of previously acquired sequences, the amount of retraining due to interference appears to be independent of the size of existing memory. The model is extended to include a chunking network which detects repeated subsequences between and within sequences.

In this study, SVM predicts the factor of safety that has been modeled as a regression problem and stability status that has been modeled as a classification problem.

Then, a decision function, that receives as input the region to concepts associations together with contextual information, realizes image classification based on local-level information. The contextual information used is in the form of frequency of appearance of each concept in every particular sub-domain.

An increasing number of researchers from each side have tried to adopt the desirable characteristics of the approach. A major open question in this field is the extent to which a connectionist architecture can accommodate basic concepts of symbolic inference, such as a dynamic variable binding mechanism and a rule and fact encoding mechanism involving nary predicates. One of the current leaders in this area is the connectionist rule-based system proposed by Shastri and Ajjanagadde. The paper demonstrates that the mechanism for variable binding which they advocate is fundamentally limited, and it shows how a reinterpretation of the primitive components and corresponding modifications of their system can extend the range of inference which can be supported. Our extension hinges on the basic structural modification of the network components and further modifications of the rule and fact encoding mechanism. These modifications allow the extended model to have more expressive power in dealing with symbolic knowledge as in the unification of terms across many groups of unifying arguments.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/0950-7051(96)81918-6", "venue": "Knowl.

In order to solve this problem the paper addresses a prediction model based on Principal Component Analysis (abbr.PCA) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (abbr. LS-SVM).

The main objective of this work is to automate the classification of abnormal mammograms. As a pre-CAD system, not to miss any malignant mammogram is the most important point. The mammograms that the system was not sure, will be classified again by the medical staff. This system aims to help the medical staff in the mammograms that are difficult to analyse, providing an solid opinion based in the analysis of a trusted database. The method consists in extracting features from mammograms, previously classified by experts according to the breast density and then classify them into normal or abnormal mammograms for each of the tissue density types. A databased composed of 203 mammograms was used. Of this total number of mammograms, 153 were considered normal mammograms and 50 were considered abnormal mammograms. The 203 mammograms were classified by experts, according to the density of the breast, into dense and fatty, and three sets of mammograms were composed: a set composed by dense mammograms, another set composed by fatty mammograms and a set composed by the total number of mammograms. From each one of the sets, two types of features were extracted: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix features and Local Binary Pattern features. For the classification task, a crucial task in this work, three classifiers were used, in order to study the performance of each one of them. It was used the K-nearest neighbour, the Support Vector Machines and the Random Forests classifiers.

However, this idea has many disadvantages, for instance, the training accuracy and generalization accuracy etc. So how to change this condition is a hot topic in Academics. On the basis of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), this paper proposes a Weighted Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (WRELM), taking into account both minimizing structured risk and weighted least-squares principle, to train R-RBF-NN. The traditional iterative training method is replaced by the minimal norm least-squares solution of general linear system. The method proposed in this paper, increasing controllability of the entire learning process and considering the structured risk and empirical risk, can improve the performance of learning and generalization. Experiments show that it can reach a very superior performance in both time and accuracy when WRELM trains the Rough RBF Neural Networks in pattern classification and function regression, especially in pattern classification, which can improve the generalization accuracy more than 3.36 % compared with ELM.

Therefore, assigning the precise level of access in such an inherently scalable, heterogeneous and dynamic environment is not easy to perform. This work defines the uncertainty challenge for authentication phase of the access control in fog computing because on one hand fog has a number of characteristics that amplify uncertainty in authentication and on the other hand applying traditional access control models does not result in a flexible and resilient solution.

In the next step, the RoIs are characterized by means of nine discriminating variables, which measure event properties useful for the classification. The third phase (the classification step) relies on two different supervised algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The system was tested with a large simulated data set, composed by 40 GeV/c momentum electrons and protons. Moreover, in order to study the classification power of the calorimeter for experimental data, we have also used biased simulated data. A proton contamination in the range 10 \u22124 \u201310 \u22125 at an electron efficiency greater than 95% was obtained.

Concretely, we leverage semantic relationship among the annotated points by encouraging the feature representations of the intra- and intercategory points to keep consistent, i.e. points within the same category should have more similar feature representations compared to those from different categories. We formulate such a characteristic into a simple distance metric loss, which collaborates with the point-wise cross-entropy loss to optimize the deep neural networks. Furthermore, to fully exploit the limited annotations, distance metric learning is conducted across different training images instead of simply adopting an image-dependent manner.

Recently, the Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) was proposed, achieving performance similar to that of GANs, yet it is still unclear whether the two are fundamentally different or can be further improved into a unified model. In this work, we study the $f$-GAN and WAE models and make two main discoveries. First, we find that the $f$-GAN and WAE objectives partake in a primal-dual relationship and are equivalent under some assumptions, which then allows us to explicate the success of WAE. Second, the equivalence result allows us to, for the first time, prove generalization bounds for Autoencoder models, which is a pertinent problem when it comes to theoretical analyses of generative models. Furthermore, we show that the WAE objective is related to other statistical quantities such as the $f$-divergence and in particular, upper bounded by the Wasserstein distance, which then allows us to tap into existing efficient (regularized) optimal transport solvers.

Currently, disease severity is determined by self-reported scores to a list of symptoms which can be highly subjective. A more objective measure would allow for improved data analysis. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Twenty-one volunteers participated in an influenza challenge trial. We calculated the daily sum of scores (DSS) for a list of 16 influenza symptoms. Whole blood collected at baseline and 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post challenge was profiled on Illumina HT12v4 microarrays. Changes in gene expression most strongly correlated with DSS were selected to train a Random Forest model and tested on two independent test sets consisting of 41 individuals profiled on a different microarray platform and 33 volunteers assayed by qRT-PCR. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: 1456 probes are significantly associated with DSS at 1% false discovery rate. We selected 19 genes with the largest fold change to train a random forest model. We observed good concordance between predicted and actual scores in the first test set (r = 0.57; RMSE = -16.1%) with the greatest agreement achieved on samples collected approximately 72 h post challenge. Therefore, we assayed samples collected at baseline and 72 h post challenge in the second test set by qRT-PCR and observed good concordance (r = 0.81; RMSE = -36.1%). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: We developed a 19-gene qRT-PCR panel to predict DSS, validated on two independent datasets.

In this paper, we propose a novel model, called Discriminative Metric-based Generative Adversarial Networks (DMGANs), for generating real-like samples from the perspective of deep metric learning. To be specific, the generator is trained to generate realistic samples by reducing the distance between real and generated samples. Instead of outputting probability, the discriminator in our model is conducted as a feature extractor, which is well constrained by introducing a combination of identity preserving loss and discriminative loss. Meanwhile, to reduce the identity preserving loss, we calculate the distance between samples and their corresponding center and update these centers during training to improve the stability of our model. In addition, a data-dependent strategy of weight adaption is proposed to further improve the quality of generated samples. Experiments on several datasets illustrate the potential of our model.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105370", "venue": "Knowl.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems have become increasingly popular in the field of crop monitoring and classification. However, the potential of time-series polarimetric SAR data has not been explored extensively, with several open scientific questions (e.g. the optimal combination of image dates for crop classification) that need to be answered. In this research, the usefulness of full year (both 2011 and 2014) L-band fully-polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data in crop classification was fully investigated over an agricultural region with a heterogeneous distribution of crop categories. In total, 11 crop classes including tree crops (almond and walnut), forage crops (grass, alfalfa, hay, and clover), a spring crop (winter wheat), and summer crops (corn, sunflower, tomato, and pepper), were discriminated using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The SAR input variables included raw linear polarization channels as well as polarimetric parameters derived from Cloude-Pottier (CP) and Freeman-Durden (FD) decompositions. Results showed clearly that the polarimetric parameters yielded much higher classification accuracies than linear polarizations. The combined use of all variables (linear polarizations and polarimetric parameters) produced the maximum overall accuracy of 90.50 % and 84.93 % for 2011 and 2014, respectively, with a significant increase of approximately 8 percentage points compared with linear polarizations alone. The variable importance provided by the RF illustrated that the polarimetric parameters had a far greater influence than linear polarizations, with the CP parameters being much more important than the FD parameters. The most important acquisitions were the images dated during the peak biomass stage (July and August) when the differences in structural characteristics between most crops were the largest. At the same time, the images in spring (April and May) and autumn (October) also contributed to the crop classification since they respectively provided unique information for discriminating fruit crops (almond and walnut) as well as summer crops (corn, sunflower, and tomato). As a result, the combined use of only four acquisitions (dated May, July, August, and October for 2011 and April, June, August, and October for 2014) was adequate to achieve a nearly-optimal overall accuracy. In light of the promising classification accuracies demonstrated in this research, it becomes increasingly viable to provide accurate and up-to-date crops inventories over large areas based solely on multitemporal polarimetric SAR.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2019.102032", "venue": "Int.

Their popularity is mainly driven by learning oblique hyperplanes instead of expensively searching for axis-aligned hyperplanes in the standard random forest. However, most existing methods are trained in an off-line mode, which assumes that the training data are given as a batch. Efficient dual-incremental learning (DIL) strategies for ObRF have rarely been explored when new inputs from the existing classes or unseen classes come. The goal of this article is to provide an ObRF with DIL capacity to perform classification on-the-fly. First, we propose a batch multiclass ObRF (ObRF-BM) algorithm by using a broad learning system and a multi-to-binary method to obtain an optimal oblique hyperplane in a higher dimensional space and then separate the samples into two supervised clusters at each node, which provides the basis for the following incremental learning strategy. Then, the DIL strategy for ObRF-BM, termed ObRF-DIL, is developed by analytically updating the parameters of all nodes on the classification route of the increment of input samples and the increment of input classes so that the ObRF-BM model can be effectively updated without laborious retraining from scratch.

{"paper_id": "60948657", "title": "Minimum Enclosing Ball-based Learner Independent Knowledge Transfer for Correlated Multi-task Learning", "authors": [{"first": "Liu", "middle": [], "last": "Fan", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL), as opposed to Single Task Learning (STL), has become a hot topic in machine learning research. For many real world problems in application areas such as medical decision making, pattern recognition, and finance forecasting \u2013 MTL has shown significant advantage to STL because of its ability to faciliate knowledge sharing between tasks. This thesis presents our recent studies on Knowledge Transfer (KT) \u2013 the process of transferring knowledge from one task to another, which is at the core of MTL. The novelly proposed KT algorithm for correlation multi-task machine learning adapts learner independence into MTL, thus empowering any ordinary classifier for MTL. The improvement in the learning rate of MTL as compared with STL relies on KT between tasks. Given two correlated learning tasks T , T , previous approaches to MTL are often modeled as a learner dependent model: ML = L(T , KTL(T , T )), for i, j = 1, 2, i 6= j, where L is a specific learner such as an k Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and ML is the resultant learning model built from task T i and transferred knowledge KTL from T j to T . Because representation of the knowledge transferred in KTL depends on the learner, it follows that the transferred knowledge KT is incompatible for learners other than L. To remove the learner-dependent restriction, we propose a learner independent MTL scheme such that ML = L(T , KT (T , T )), for i, j = 1, 2, i 6= j, where KT is independent to the learner L, and MTL is conducted for arbitrary learner combinations. In the proposed solution, we use Minimum Enclosing Balls (MEBs) as knowledge carriers to extract and transfer knowledge from one task to another. Since the knowledge presented in MEB can be decomposed as raw data, it can be incorporated into any learner as additional training data for a new learning task and thus improve its learning rate. The proposed MEB-based KT is on the basis that in the feature space, the two correlated tasks share some common input data that lie on the overlapping regions of the feature spaces in-between the two correlated tasks. The main idea is to find the correlating knowledge \u2013 overlapping regions of the two tasks \u2013 and transfer the related data regardless of the learner employed. KT is done by building a correlation space via MEBs and transferring the enclosed instances from the primary task to the secondary task. The extent of KT depends on the amount of overlapping instances between two tasks. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed KT is evaluated on multi-task pattern recognition (MTPR) problems derived from synthetic datasets, University of California at Irvine (UCI) datasets, and real world face datasets, using classifiers from different disciplines for MTL. We evaluate the learner independent KT model on three measures: (A) KT capability \u2013 how much knowledge can the method transfer; (B) contribution of KT \u2013 how beneficial is the transferred knowledge to the new task; and (C) adaptability of KT \u2013 how could KT adapt to learning tasks with varied relevance. It is shown that multi-task learners using KT via MEB carriers perform better than learners without-KT, and it is successfully applied to all type of classifiers. On the other hand, in cases where the two learning tasks are semantically irrelevant, negative KT could happen to the proposed KT. For example, face recognition is not able to be supported by knowledge from hand writing recognition \u2013 simply overlapping feature domains does not work. How to discover correlated knowledge for MTL between unrelated topics remains a challenging problem and is left for future work.

Today there is much more interest in the structure and development of internal mental representation. All models of information processing implicitly include propositions about the status of knowledge representation. The particular mode of representation (see Cummins, 1989) renders possible that we can recognize something to be something and that we can \"see\" or \"think\" or \"hear\" something internally (i.e., something that must not necessarily be physically present). But if we recognize something to be something, we must have perceived it as a clear and concise structure that can be represented in our mind.

In this paper, we concentrate on the theoretical analysis for the solution to the primal optimization problem of SVDD. We first reformulate equivalently the primal optimization problem of SVDD into a convex programming problem, and then prove that the optimal solution with respect to the sphere center is unique, derive the necessary and sufficient conditions of non-uniqueness of the optimal solution with respect to the sphere radius in the primal optimization problem of SVDD. Moreover, we also explore the property of the SVDD solution from the perspective of the SVDD dual form.

Most of the existing methods rely on the network structure. However, explicit network structures are hard to be detected in large-scale networks. We notice that the information diffusion process across the network generally reflects rich proximity relationships between users. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel embedding-based approach named DiffusionGAN to embed users involved in the diffusion process into a fixed dimensional space. Then users are represented as vectors in the embedding space, and the proximity relationships between users are transformed as the distances between their representation vectors. To better learn user representations, we adopt the Generative Adversarial model to perform the network embedding, wherein the generator tries to generate users to fit the real user distribution in a diffusion cascade, while the discriminator tries to distinguish whether the sampled user is from ground truth or generated by the generator. The generator and the discriminator play a game-theoretical minimax game to optimize mutually. When converging, DiffusionGAN obtains the most efficient user representations.

Called the DIRECT model, it embodies a solution of the classical motor equivalence problem. Motor equivalence computations allow humans and other animals to flexibly employ an arm with more degrees of freedom than the space in which it moves to carry out spatially defined tasks under conditions that may require novel joint configurations. During a motor babbling phase, the model endogenously generates movement commands that activate the correlated visual, spatial, and motor information that are used to learn its internal coordinate transformations. After learning occurs, the model is capable of controlling reaching movements of the arm to prescribed spatial targets using many different combinations of joints. When allowed visual feedback, the model can automatically perform, without additional learning, reaches with tools of variable lengths, with clamped joints, with distortions of visual input by a prism, and with unexpected perturbations. These compensatory computations occur within a single accurate reaching movement. No corrective movements are needed. Blind reaches using internal feedback have also been simulated.

The spatial direction vector is adaptively transformed into a motor direction vector, which represents the joint rotations that move the end effector in the desired spatial direction from the present arm configuration.

Two spectra with the farthest distance first were chosen as reference spectra. The Euclidean distance method or spectral angle cosine method then were used to classify data cube on the basis of the two reference spectra, and delete the spectra which belongs to the two reference spectra. The rest data cube was used to perform new classification according to a third spectrum, which is the farthest distance or the biggest angle one corresponding to the two reference spectra.

Such rotations complicate the interpretation of the retinal image, because they nullify the retinal motion of the target, while generating retinal motion of stationary objects in the background. This poses a problem for the oculomotor system, which must track the stabilized target image while suppressing the optokinetic reflex, which would move the eye in the direction of the retinal background motion (opposite to the direction in which the target is moving). Similarly, the perceptual system must estimate the actual direction and speed of moving objects in spite of the confounding effects of the eye rotation. This paper proposes a neural model to account for the ability of primates to accomplish these tasks. The model simulates the neurophysiological properties of cell types found in the superior temporal sulcus of the macaque monkey, specifically the medial superior temporal (MST) region. These cells process signals related to target motion, background motion, and receive an efference copy of eye velocity during pursuit movements. The model focuses on the interactions between cells in the ventral and dorsal subdivisions of MST, which are hypothesized to process target velocity and background motion, respectively. The model explains how these signals can be combined to explain behavioral data about pursuit maintenance and perceptual data from human studies, including the Aubert\u2013Fleischl phenomenon and the Filehne Illusion, thereby clarifying the functional significance of neurophysiological data about these MST cell properties. It is suggested that the connectivity used in the model may represent a general strategy used by the brain in analyzing the visual world.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11224912", "doi": "10.1162/089892901564207", "venue": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "journal": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2112756339,2136505674", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["8810829", "38126119", "5667153", "25380002", "7907919", "2214701", "15984487", "23840329", "14124318", "10551801", "21936887", "3260963", "8466558", "22668811", "16388840", "1321582", "15882396", "16099349", "466742", "12603504", "314954", "4430422", "118398891", "34831867", "34347423", "4043722", "38633291", "31113002", "27346665", "29237761", "9069589", "40511289", "207732368", "207555004", "25382247", "14207173", "38553893", "16881892", "30833508", "30188010", "6546536", "2634460", "24597129", "11725590", "33510062", "20984771", "10813434", "33744418", "8993394", "8217687", "40554368", "10014850", "36159914", "12211080", "10691623", "20193952", "1419728", "77871256", "40380446", "115760372", "9755946", "14120836"], "inbound_citations": ["14024502", "18864492", "17746421", "15667471", "11663199", "13905486", "29957282", "195352855", "19284702", "11644565", "5513645", "8265345", "346759", "7353036", "8239861", "56210126", "9223474", "15996566", "11890911", "28463847", "15185601", "14709895", "15848150", "31547720", "6327530", "18719028", "18445135", "5540036", "22450323", "149563519", "46250223", "9603982", "15507866", "2307597", "1155491", "6849966", "12504128", "15955188", "52988890", "4602772", "41582219", "1942483", "1056980", "215335362", "2218318"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5696884"}

The Cuckoo Search algorithm iteratively uses a Levy flight random walk to explore a search space. The Levy flight mechanism takes sudden turns of 90 degrees and consequently the Cuckoo's Search strategy does not carefully search around the cuckoos' nest, and hence it suffers from slow convergence and low optimisation accuracy. In order to improve the weaknesses of the Cuckoo Search algorithm, this paper proposes a pseudobinary mutation neighbourhood search procedure embedded in a new binary version of the Cuckoo Search algorithm. The proposed Extended Binary Cuckoo Search algorithm has been designed for the task of feature selection, and thus aims to minimise the number of selected features (such that only the best features are retained in the subset) whilst maximising the classification accuracy. Based on these criteria, a new objective function is proposed which considers the number of features in the subset as well as the classification accuracy when searching for the best subset of features. To measure the classification accuracy when using a set of candidate features, the Support Vector Machine classifier is utilised. Experiments were conducted with the proposed Extended Binary Cuckoo Search optimisation applied to biomedical datasets and the results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm against three other nature-inspired algorithms, namely the Binary Ant Colony Optimisation, Binary Genetic Algorithm, and Binary Particle Swarm Optimisation. Moreover, the experiments revealed that when using the proposed function, higher classification accuracy is achieved using a fewer number of features, as opposed to using the standard classification accuracy function which needed more features to achieve comparable accuracy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICKEA.2017.8169893", "venue": "2017 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Applications (ICKEA)", "journal": "2017 2nd International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Applications (ICKEA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2775254787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7367791", "391446", "206491725", "11144573", "12038595", "3340118", "62033239", "15699117", "45100805", "102860", "52820449", "13952162", "12172928", "117183447", "14649733", "207165665", "2427083"], "inbound_citations": ["214700332", "40827221"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38222860"}

Machine learning has powerful data processing capabilities and real-time computing functions and thus is suitable for offsetting the shortcomings of traditional risk methods. Risk analysis can be easily employed to perform risk-based data classification for a set of process data. However, the risk analysis process is too complicated to label risk levels for all processes, which is hard to satisfy the requirements of the amount of data for supervised learning. Therefore, the present paper focuses on developing semi-supervised learning methods for the construction of real-time risk-based early warning systems. By using fuzzy HAZOP, we estimate the risk of systems quantitatively based on the process data. With the consideration of scarce labeled data and numerous unlabeled information, we develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based semi-supervised learning method to identify the process risk timely. Besides, deep network architecture integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for the codification of multi-dimensional process data to enhance the generalization of warning models.

Compared with the traditional back propagation neural network algorithm, an extreme learning machine (ELM) has features of a faster learning speed and better generalization performance.

However, such a system has limited resolution, making it imperative to improve resolution from the system-level using super-resolution (SR) processing. Yet, how to improve resolution towards better cell detection and recognition with low cost of processing resources and without degrading system throughput is still a challenge. In this article, two machine learning based single-frame SR processing types are proposed and compared for lensless blood cell counting, namely the Extreme Learning Machine based SR (ELMSR) and Convolutional Neural Network based SR (CNNSR). Moreover, lensless blood cell counting prototypes using commercial CMOS image sensors and custom designed backside-illuminated CMOS image sensors are demonstrated with ELMSR and CNNSR. When one captured low-resolution lensless cell image is input, an improved high-resolution cell image will be output.

A novel approach for dealing with missing data are Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which have been generating huge research interest in image generation and transformation. Recently, researchers have attempted to apply GANs to missing data generation and imputation for EHR data: a major challenge here is the categorical nature of the data. State-of-the-art solutions to the GAN-based generation of categorical data involve either reinforcement learning, or learning a bidirectional mapping between the categorical and the a real latent feature space, so that the GANs only need to generate real-valued features. However, these methods are designed to generate complete feature vectors instead of imputing only the subsets of missing features. In this paper we propose a simple and yet effective approach that is based on previous work on GANs for data imputation. We first motivate our solution by discussing the reason why adversarial training often fails in case of categorical features. Then we derive a novel way to re-code the categorical features to stabilize the adversarial training.

The native fold information of proteins provide to understand their functions in the cell. In order to determine the 3D structure of the huge amount of protein sequence, the development of efficient computational techniques is needed. The thesis studies the computational approaches to provide new solutions for the secondary structure prediction of proteins. The 3D structure of a protein is composed of the secondary structure elements: \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-sheets, \u03b2-turns, and loops. The secondary structures of proteins have a high impact on the formation of their 3D structures. Two subproblems within secondary structure prediction have been studied in this thesis. The first study is for identifying the structural classes (all-\u03b1, all-\u03b2, \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1+\u03b2) of proteins from their primary sequences. The structural class information could provide a rough description of a protein\u2019s 3D structure due to the high effects of the secondary structures on the formation of 3D structure. This approach assembles the statistical classification technique, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and the variations of amino acid composition information. The performance results demonstrate that the utilization of neighborhood information between amino acids and the high classification ability of the SVM provides a significant improvement for the structural classification of proteins. The second study in thesis is for predicting one of the secondary structure element, \u03b2-turns, through primary sequence. The formation of \u03b2-turns has been thought to have critical roles as much as other secondary structures in the protein folding pathway. Hence, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been developed to predict the location and type of \u03b2-turns from its amino acid sequence. The neighborhood information between \u03b2-turns and other secondary structures has been introduced by designing the suitable HMM topologies. One of the amino acid similarity matrices is used to give the evolutionary information between proteins. Although applying HMMs and usage of amino acid similarity matrix is a new approach to predict \u03b2-turns through its protein sequence, the initial results for the prediction of \u03b2-turns and type classification are promising.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2146972313", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16058462"}

The CEEMDAN method is introduced to decompose the raw traffic flow data into several intrinsic mode function components and one residual component. Then, the XGBoost methods are trained and make predictions on the decomposed components respectively. The final prediction results are obtained by integrating the prediction outputs of the XGBoost methods. For illustrative purposes, the ground-truth lane-level traffic flow data captured by remote traffic microwave sensors installed on the 3rd Ring Road of Beijing are utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the CEEMDAN-XGBoost model. The experimental results confirm that the CEEMDAN-XGBoost model is capable of fitting the complex volatility of traffic flow efficiently at different types of lane sections.

The goal of the proposed algorithm is to select a feature subset such that, for each feature sample, there exists a feature that has a low uncertainty score in the selected feature subset. Features are first quantized into different bins. The proposed feature selection method first computes an uncertainty vector from weighted conditional entropy. Lower the uncertainty score for a class, better is the separability of the samples in that class. Next, an iterative feature selection method selects a feature in each iteration by (1) computing the minimum uncertainty score for each feature sample for all possible feature subset candidates, (2) computing the average minimum uncertainty score across all feature samples, and (3) selecting the feature that achieves the minimum of the mean of the minimum uncertainty score. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms mRMR and achieves lower misclassification rates using various types of publicly available datasets.

To alleviate this issue, in this work we propose to use Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for features augmentation to improve depression severity estimation from speech. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first attempt to apply the Generative Adversarial Network for depression severity estimation from speech. Besides, to measure the quality of the augmented features, we propose three different measurement criteria, characterizing the spatial, frequency and representation learning of the augmented features. Finally, the augmented features are used to train depression estimation models. Experiments are carried out on speech signals from the Audio Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC2016) depression dataset, and the relationship between the model performance and data size is explored.

One neuroinformatics system, CoCoMac, describes roughly 4x104 neuroanatomical connections from 413 papers; by way of constrast, the Mouse Genome Informatics (\u2018MGI\u2019) system, contains nucleotide sequences from ~105 papers. The resources needed to support a large-scale database are extraordinary (MGI supports a team of 30+ professsional biocurators), and even then, it is still highly challenging to maintain a complete, up-to-date account of large-scale portions of the literature. Curating knowledge from Neuroscientific papers is is made even more difficult because: (A) the information is largely unstructured (occuring either as natural language text or tables) and (B) the information is semantically complex: typically more so than genomic studies where individual genes are linked to ontologies of phenotype or function. Thus, we need to (A) provide tools to accelerate the process of biocuration and (B) we need to define a general-purpose Knowledge Representation (KR) that can capture the semantics of neuroscientific knowledge in a mathematically tractable format that is also intuitively understandable to bench-scientists.

The feature transform is formulated by a transform kernel and a bias matrix. To obtain feature sparsity, the sparse filtering is utilized as nonlinear activation function. A mutual information graph is proposed to describe the underlying manifold structure of the observation data. The transform kernel and the bias matrix are finally learned under the regularization of the mutual information graph.

The possibly infinite number of functions is reduced to a finite number of equivalence classes on the working sample. A rigorous Bayesian analysis reveals that for standard classification loss we cannot benefit from considering more than one test point at a time. The probability of the label of a given test point is determined as the posterior measure of the corresponding subset of hypothesis space. We consider the PAC setting of binary classification by linear discriminant functions (perceptrons) in kernel space such that the probability of labels is determined by the volume ratio in version space.

Many splicing detection schemes based on Markov features in transform domain have been proposed.

In this paper, a block DWT based scheme is proposed to improve the detection performance of the DWT based scheme. Firstly, the block DWT is applied on the source image. Then, the Markov features are constructed in block DWT domain to characterize the dependency among wavelet coefficients across positions. After that, feature selection method SVM-RFE is used to reduce the dimensionality of features. Finally, Support Vector Machine is exploited to classify the authentic and spliced images.

This paper presents a novel ensemble classifier framework for improved classification of mammographic lesions in Computer-aided Detection (CADe) and Diagnosis (CADx) systems. Compared to previously developed classification techniques in mammography, the main novelty of proposed method is twofold: (1) the \"combined use\" of different feature representations (of the same instance) and data resampling to generate more diverse and accurate base classifiers as ensemble members and (2) the incorporation of a novel \"ensemble selection\" mechanism to further maximize the overall classification performance. In addition, as opposed to conventional ensemble learning, our proposed ensemble framework has the advantage of working well with both weak and strong classifiers, extensively used in mammography CADe and/or CADx systems. Extensive experiments have been performed using benchmark mammogram dataset to test the proposed method on two classification applications: (1) false-positive (FP) reduction using classification between masses and normal tissues, and (2) diagnosis using classification between malignant and benign masses. Results showed promising results that the proposed method (area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.932 and 0.878, each obtained for the aforementioned two classification applications, respectively) impressively outperforms (by an order of magnitude) the most commonly used single neural network (AUC?=?0.819 and AUC?=0.754) and support vector machine (AUC?=?0.849 and AUC?=?0.773) based classification approaches.

Groundwater appears to be one of the main natural resources capable to reverse this situation. Uncovering the spatial patterns of groundwater occurrence is a crucial factor that could assist in carrying out successful water resources management projects. The main objective of the current study was to provide a novel methodology approach which utilized Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to perform a feature selection procedure and data mining methods for generating a groundwater spring potential map. Three data mining methods, Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to construct a groundwater spring potential map that had over 0.81 probability of occurrence for the Wuqi County, Shaanxi Province, China. Groundwater spring locations and sixteen related variables were analyzed, namely: lithology, soil cover, land use cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope angle, aspect, planform curvature, profile curvature, curvature, stream power index (SPI), stream transport index (STI), topographic wetness index (TWI), mean annual rainfall, distance from river network and distance from road network. The Frequency ratio method was used to weight the variables, whereas a multi-collinearity analysis was performed to identify the relation between the parameters and to decide about their usage. The optimal set of parameters, which was determined by the GA, reduced the number of parameters into twelve removing planform curvature, profile curvature, curvature and STI. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUROC) were estimated so as to evaluate the predictive power of each model.

After standard pre-processing (slice scan time correction, motion correction), we generated rating predictions based on linear Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) learning from all brain voxels. Spatial and temporal filtering of the time series was optimized rating by rating. For some of the ratings (e.g. Instructions, Hits, Faces, Velocity ), linear RVM regression was accurate and very consistent within and between subjects. For other ratings (e.g. Arousal, Valence ) results were less satisfactory. Our approach ranked overall second. To investigate the role of different brain regions in ratings prediction we generated predictive maps , i.e. maps of the weighted contribution of each voxel to the predicted rating. These maps generally included (but were not limited to) \u201cspecialized\u201d regions which are consistent with results from conventional neuroimaging studies and known functional neuroanatomy. In conclusion, Sparse Bayesian Learning models, such as RVM, appear to be a valuable approach to the multivariate regression of fMRI time series. The implementation of the Automatic Relevance Determination criterion is particularly suitable and provides a good generalization, despite the limited number of samples which is typically available in fMRI.

This was caused by the overfitting problem that SVM sometimes selected unsuitable support vectors for each category in the training set. To avoid the overfitting problem, we propose a two step text categorization method with a variable cascaded feature selection (VCFS) using SVM.

This paper has proposed a model to integrate object ontology, a local multitask deep neural network (local MDNN), and an imbalanced data solver to take advantages and overcome the shortcomings of deep learning network models to improve the performance of the large-scale object retrieval system from the coarse-grained level (categories) to the fine-grained level (attributes). Our proposed coarse-to-fine object retrieval (CFOR) system can be robust and resistant to the challenges listed above. To the best of our knowledge, the new main point of our CFOR system is the power of mutual support of object ontology, a local MDNN, and an imbalanced data solver in a unified system. Object ontology supports the exploitation of the inner-group correlations to improve the system performance in category classification, attribute classification, and conducting training flow and retrieval flow to save computational costs in the training stage and retrieval stage on large-scale datasets, respectively. A local MDNN supports linking object ontology to the raw data, and an imbalanced data solver based on Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) addresses that the imbalance of data has contributed effectively to increasing the quality of object ontology realization without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation.

Based on current scientific evidence, a multifactorial approach, including the analysis of physical performance, gait parameters, and both extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors, is highly recommended. A smartphone-based app was designed to assess the individual risk of falling with a score that combines multiple fall-risk factors into one comprehensive metric using the previously listed determinants. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: This study provides a descriptive evaluation of the designed fall-risk score as well as an analysis of the app's discriminative ability based on real-world data. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Anonymous data from 242 seniors was analyzed retrospectively. Data was collected between June 2018 and May 2019 using the fall-risk assessment app. First, we provided a descriptive statistical analysis of the underlying dataset. Subsequently, multiple learning models (Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Classification, and Random Forest Regression) were trained on the dataset to obtain optimal decision boundaries. The receiver operating curve with its corresponding area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity were the primary performance metrics utilized to assess the fall-risk score's ability to discriminate fallers from nonfallers. For the sake of completeness, specificity, precision, and overall accuracy were also provided for each model. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Out of 242 participants with a mean age of 84.6 years old (SD 6.7), 139 (57.4%) reported no previous falls (nonfaller), while 103 (42.5%) reported a previous fall (faller). The average fall risk was 29.5 points (SD 12.4). The performance metrics for the Logistic Regression Model were AUC=0.9, sensitivity=100%, specificity=52%, and accuracy=73%. The performance metrics for the Gaussian Naive Bayes Model were AUC=0.9, sensitivity=100%, specificity=52%, and accuracy=73%. The performance metrics for the Gradient Boosting Model were AUC=0.85, sensitivity=88%, specificity=62%, and accuracy=73%. The performance metrics for the Support Vector Classification Model were AUC=0.84, sensitivity=88%, specificity=67%, and accuracy=76%. The performance metrics for the Random Forest Model were AUC=0.84, sensitivity=88%, specificity=57%, and accuracy=70%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Descriptive statistics for the dataset were provided as comparison and reference values. The fall-risk score exhibited a high discriminative ability to distinguish fallers from nonfallers, irrespective of the learning model evaluated.

A spoken language understanding system that learns from interaction with and demonstrations from the user, allows the use of such a system in different settings and for different types of speech, even for deviant or impaired speech, while also allowing the user to choose a phrasing. The user gives a command and enters its intent through an interface, after which the model learns to map the speech directly to the right action. Since the effort of the user should be as low as possible, capsule networks have drawn interest due to potentially needing little training data compared to deeper neural networks. In this paper, we show how capsules can incorporate multitask learning, which often can improve the performance of a model when the task is difficult. The basic capsule network will be expanded with a regularisation to create more structure in its output: it learns to identify the speaker of the utterance by forcing the required information into the capsule vectors.

A neoteric hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and gradient boosting regression (GBRT) called VMD-GBRT was proposed and applied for monthly runoff forecasting. VMD was first employed to decompose the original monthly runoff series into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The optimal number of input variables were then chosen according to the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF). The trained GBRT model was used as a forecasting instrument to predict the testing set of each normalized subsequence. The ensemble forecasting result was finally generated by aggregating the prediction results of all subsequences. The proposed hybrid model was evaluated using an original monthly runoff series, from 1/1969 to 12/2018, measured at the Huaxian, Lintong and Xianyang hydrological stations in the Wei River Basin (WRB), China. The EEMD-GBRT, the single GBRT, and the single SVM were adopted as comparative forecast models using the same dataset. The results indicated that the VMD-GBRT model exhibited the best forecasting performance among all the peer models in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.8840), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 19.7451), and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE = 0.3468) at Huaxian station. Furthermore, the model forecasting results applied at Lintong and Xianyang stations were consistent with those at Huaxian station. This result further verified the accuracy and stability of the VMD-GBRT model.

The pre-processing of 242 bands of Hyperion data resulted into 160 noise-free and vertical stripe corrected reflectance bands. Of these, 29 bands were selected through step-wise exclusion of bands (Wilk's Lambda). Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were applied to the selected bands to assess their effectiveness in classification. SVM was also applied to broadband data (Landsat TM) to compare the variation in classification accuracy. All commonly occurring six gregarious tree species, viz., white oak, brown oak, chir pine, blue pine, cedar and fir in western Himalaya could be effectively discriminated. SVM produced a better species classification (overall accuracy 82.27%, kappa statistic 0.79) than SAM (overall accuracy 74.68%, kappa statistic 0.70).

Sarcopenia is a prevalent pathology in adults of around 50 years of age, whereby the muscle mass decreases by 1 to 2% a year, and muscle strength experiences an annual decrease of 1.5% between 50 and 60 years of age, subsequently increasing by 3% each year. The World Health Organisation estimates that 5\u201313% of individuals of between 60 and 70 years of age and 11\u201350% of persons of 80 years of age or over have sarcopenia. This study was conducted with 166 patients and 99 variables. Demographic data was compiled including age, gender, place of residence, schooling, marital status, level of education, income, profession, and financial support from the State of Baja California, and biochemical parameters such as glycemia, cholesterolemia, and triglyceridemia were determined. A total of 166 patients took part in the study, with an average age of 77.24 years. The purpose of the study was to provide an automatic classifier of sarcopenia level in older adults using artificial intelligence in addition to identifying the weight of each variable used in the study. We used machine learning techniques in this work, in which 10 classifiers were employed to assess the variables and determine which would provide the best results, namely, Nearest Neighbors (3), Linear SVM (Support Vector Machines) (C = 0.025), RBF (Radial Basis Function) SVM (gamma = 2, C = 1), Gaussian Process (RBF (1.0)), Decision Tree (max_depth = 3), Random Forest (max_depth=3, n_estimators = 10), MPL (Multilayer Perceptron) (alpha = 1), AdaBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis). Feature selection determined by the mean for the variable ranking suggests that Age, Systolic Arterial Hypertension (HAS), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Number of chronic diseases (ECNumber), and Sodium are the five most important variables in determining the sarcopenia level, and are thus of great importance prior to establishing any treatment or preventive measure. Analysis of the relationships existing between the presence of the variables and classifiers used in moderate and severe sarcopenia revealed that the sarcopenia level using the RBF SVM classifier with Age, HAS, MNA, ECNumber, and Sodium variables has 82\u20325 accuracy, a 90\u20322 F1, and 82\u20328 precision.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6765933", "pubmed_id": "31489909", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph16183275", "venue": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "journal": "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2972090290", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["24404188", "7360246", "4705967", "58619846", "39195", "51710082", "7615915", "54579909", "214836085", "17681584", "215149911", "206802635", "3814481", "30898203", "91489674", "58536101", "4629357", "23313097", "20046289", "19095540", "214845644", "34867212", "52149330", "182948199", "13765894", "215674572", "14756775"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201846125"}

However, there are few existing RUL prediction methods because the observed data involve various uncertainties, leading to the great limitation of RUL prediction in practical application. In this work, we propose an uncertainty RUL prediction method based on the exponential stochastic degradation model that considers the multiple uncertainty sources of oscillator stochastic degradation processes simultaneously. Next, based on Bayesian theory, a novel Bayesian-Extreme Learning Machine parameter-updating algorithm that combines the local and global similarity methods is presented and used to eliminate the effects of multiple uncertainty sources and predict the RUL accurately. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using the accelerated degradation tests of crystal oscillators. Through comparisons with the predicted results without uncertainty, the proposed method demonstrates its superiority in describing the stochastic degradation processes and predicting the oscillator's RUL.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.04.043", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2802866110", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["86770387", "117600661", "209518739", "86581763"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44120683"}

To estimate the $i$-th row of $\\Omega$, $1 \\leq i \\leq p$, PCS uses a Screen step and a Clean step. In the Screen step, PCS recruits a (small) subset of indices using a stage-wise algorithm, where in each stage, the algorithm updates the set of recruited indices by adding the index $j$ that has the largest (in magnitude) empirical partial correlation with $i$. In the Clean step, PCS re-investigates all recruited indices and use them to reconstruct the $i$-th row of $\\Omega$. PCS is computationally efficient and modest in memory use: to estimate a row of $\\Omega$, it only needs a few rows (determined sequentially) of the empirical covariance matrix. This enables PCS to execute the estimation of a large precision matrix (e.g., $p=10K$) in a few minutes, and open doors to estimating much larger precision matrices. We use PCS for classification. Higher Criticism Thresholding (HCT) is a recent classifier that enjoys optimality, but to exploit its full potential in practice, one needs a good estimate of the precision matrix $\\Omega$. Combining HCT with any approach to estimating $\\Omega$ gives a new classifier: examples include HCT-PCS and HCT-glasso. We have applied HCT-PCS to two large microarray data sets ($p = 8K$ and $10K$) for classification, where it not only significantly outperforms HCT-glasso, but also is competitive to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The results suggest that PCS gives more useful estimates of $\\Omega$ than the glasso. We set up a general theoretical framework and show that in a broad context, PCS fully recovers the support of $\\Omega$ and HCT-PCS yields optimal classification behavior.

Scene Text Character (STC) recognition, which generally includes feature representation to model character structure and multi-class classification to predict label and score of character class, mostly plays a significant role in word-level text recognition. The contribution of this paper is a complete performance evaluation of image-based STC recognition, by comparing different sampling methods, feature descriptors, dictionary sizes, coding and pooling schemes, and SVM kernels. We systematically analyze the impact of each option in the feature representation and classification. The evaluation results on two datasets CHARS74K and ICDAR2003 demonstrate that Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor, soft-assignment coding, max pooling, and Chi-Square Support Vector Machines (SVM) obtain the best performance among local sampling based feature representations.

Among these methods, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as one of the best time-frequency method has been used for both stationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of overlapping and distortion ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of redundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or misinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact Wavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of overlapping and distortion in case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have been implemented for the acceleration signals from 2D acceleration sensor acquired by Advantech PCI-1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir University of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and chipped tooth gears conditions. Kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis functions has used the extracted features from exact wavelet analysis for classification. The efficiency of this classifier is then evaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show that in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in feature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO exact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact wavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and crossover in PSO algorithm.

In order to circumvent this difficulty, we introduce feature relevance network-based method, which focuses on interrelatedness among features. Feature relevance networks are connected graphs representing concurrency of the signalling devices such as APs. In the newly created relevance network, a test instance and the prototype of a location are expanded until convergence. The expansion cost corresponds to distance between the test instance and the prototype. Unlike other methods, our model is nonparametric making no assumptions about signal distributions.

Because proteins that participate in a common structural complex or metabolic pathway are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion, the phylogenetic profiles of such proteins are often \u201csimilar\u201d or at least \u201crelated\u201d to each other. The question we address in this paper is the following: how to measure the \u201csimilarity\u201d between two profiles , in an evolutionarily relevant way, in order to develop efficient function prediction methods? Results: We show how the profiles can be mapped to a high-dimensional vector space which incorporates evolutionarily relevant information, and we provide an algorithm to compute efficiently the inner product in that space, which we call the tree kernel. The tree kernel can be used by any kernel-based analysis method for classification or data mining of phylogenetic profiles . As an application a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained to predict the functional class of a gene from its phylogenetic profile is shown to perform better with the tree kernel than with a naive kernel that does not include any information about the phylogenetic relationships among species.

Traditional methods, such as linear correlation plotting, have been proven to be effective, as forest recovery naturally increases with time.

In this work, we present a random forest variable importance (RF-VIMP) scheme called multilevel RF-VIMP to compare and assess the relationship between 36 spectral indices (parameters) of burnt boreal forest recovery in the Great Xing\u2019an Mountain, China. Six Landsat images were acquired in the same month 0, 1, 4, 14, 16, and 20 years after a fire, and 39,380 fixed-location samples were then extracted to calculate the effectiveness of the 36 parameters. Consequently, the proposed method was applied to find correlations between the forest recovery indices. The experiment showed that the proposed method is suitable for explaining the efficacy of those spectral indices in terms of discrimination and trend analysis, and for showing the satellite data and forest succession dynamics when applied in a time series.

The few works which already exploited GPS data for vehicle classification rely on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines. In this work, we study how performance can be improved by deploying deep learning methods, which are recently achieving state of the art results in the classification of signals from various domains. In particular, we propose an approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks that are able to learn effective hierarchical and stateful representations for temporal sequences.

Although a variety of powerful algorithms have been presented in the past few years, most of them usually focus on designing hand-crafted features and learning metrics either individually or sequentially. Different from previous works, we formulate a unified deep ranking framework that jointly tackles both of these key components to maximize their strengths. We start from the principle that the correct match of the probe image should be positioned in the top rank within the whole gallery set. An effective learning-to-rank algorithm is proposed to minimize the cost corresponding to the ranking disorders of the gallery. The ranking model is solved with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that builds the relation between input image pairs and their similarity scores through joint representation learning directly from raw image pixels. The proposed framework allows us to get rid of feature engineering and does not rely on any assumption. An extensive comparative evaluation is given, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and CNN-based methods on the challenging VIPeR, CUHK-01, and CAVIAR4REID datasets.

Empirical results on a large number of images from the Fish-94 and COIL-20 datasets show that on average, the proposed ensembles using multiple Pareto features perform much better than both, the traditional classifier ensembles of single Pareto features with data randomization, and the well-known Random Forest ensemble. The better classification performance of the proposed ensemble is further supported by diversity analysis using a number of measures, indicating that the proposed ensemble consistently produces a higher degree of diversity than traditional ones.

In this paper, we propose to move the outlier detection from an application layer to a NIC (Network Interface Card). Only anomalous items or events are delivered for a network protocol stack and the other packets are discarded at the NIC. The demands for storage and computation costs at a host are thus drastically reduced. We employ lazy learning algorithms for the outlier detection, because they can be applied to complex reference data including different clusters. However, it is challenging to offload the lazy learning to NIC hardware because of high computational cost and huge reference data. In this paper, we propose to cache only a frequently-accessed portion of reference data in the NIC. This idea can be applied to lazy learning algorithms in general. LOF (Local Outlier Factor) and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) are thus implemented on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) based NIC. Simulation results of the proposed system using LOF with 100,000 reference data show that 45% to 90% of queries are hit to the proposed cache and filtered at the NIC.

This is also a flood-prone area where flood disasters are frequently experienced; the situations between the people\u2013land nexus and the people\u2013water nexus are very complicated. Therefore, the accurate assessment of flood risk is of great significance to regional development. The paper took the YRD urban agglomeration as the research case. The driving force, pressure, state, impact and response (DPSIR) conceptual framework was established to analyze the indexes of flood disasters. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to screen important indexes of floods risk, and a risk assessment model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network was constructed to evaluate the flood risk level in this region from 2009 to 2018. The risk map showed the I-V level of flood risk in the YRD urban agglomeration from 2016 to 2018 by using the geographic information system (GIS). Further analysis indicated that the indexes such as flood season rainfall, urban impervious area ratio, gross domestic product (GDP) per square kilometer of land, water area ratio, population density and emergency rescue capacity of public administration departments have important influence on flood risk. The flood risk has been increasing in the YRD urban agglomeration during the past ten years under the urbanization background, and economic development status showed a significant positive correlation with flood risks. In addition, there were serious differences in the rising rate of flood risks and the status quo among provinces. There are still a few cities that have stabilized at a better flood-risk level through urban flood control measures from 2016 to 2018. These results were basically in line with the actual situation, which validated the effectiveness of the model.

Nowhere has the debate over rules been more heated than within the field of language acquisition. Most researchers agree on the need for statistical learning mechanisms in lan- guage acquisition, but disagree on whether rule-learning com- ponents are also needed. Marcus, Vijayan, Rao, & Vishton (1999) have provided evidence of rule-like behavior which they claim can only be explained by a dual-mechanism ac- count. In this paper, we show that a connectionist single- mechanism approach provides a more parsimonious account of rule-like behavior in infancy than the dual-mechanism ap- proach. Specifically, we present simulation results from an ex- isting connectionist model of infant speech segmentation, fit- ting the behavioral data under naturalistic circumstances with- out invoking rules. We further investigate diverging predic- tions from the single- and dual-mechanism accounts through additional simulations and artificial language learning experi- ments. The results support a connectionist single-mechanism account, while undermining the dual-mechanism account. Introduction The nature of the learning mechanisms that infants bring to the task of language acquisition is a major focus of research in cognitive science. With the rise of connectionism, much of the scientific debate surrounding this research has focused on whether rules are necessary to explain language acquisition. All parties in the debate acknowledge that statistical learning mechanisms form a necessary part of the language acquisition process (e.g., Christiansen & Curtin, 1999; Marcus, Vijayan, Rao, & Vishton, 1999; Pinker, 1991). However, there is much disagreement over whether a statistical learning mech- anism is sufficient to account for complex rule-like behavior, or whether additional rule-learning mechanisms are needed. In the past this debate has primarily taken place within spe- cific areas of language acquisition, such as inflectional mor- phology (e.g., Pinker, 1991; Plunkett & Marchman, 1993) and visual word recognition (e.g., Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins & Haller, 1993; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989). More re- cently, Marcus et al. (1999) have presented results from ex- periments with 7-month-olds, apparently showing that infants acquire abstract algebraic rules after two minutes of expo- sure to habituation stimuli. The algebraic rules are construed as representing an open-ended relationship between variables for which one can substitute arbitrary values, \u201csuch as \u2018the first item X is the same as the third item Y,\u2019 or more gener- ally, that \u2018item I is the same as item J\u201d\u2019 (Marcus et al., 1999, p. 79). Marcus et al. further claim that a connectionist single- mechanism approach based on statistical learning is unable to fit their experimental data. In this paper, we build on earlier work (Christiansen & Curtin, 1999) and present a detailed connectionist model of these infant data, and provide new experimental data that support a statistically-based single- mechanism approach while undermining the dual-mechanism account. In the remainder of this paper, we first show that knowl- edge acquired in the service of learning to segment the speech stream can be recruited to carry out the kind of classification task used in the experiments by Marcus et al. For this pur- pose we took an existing model of early infant speech seg- mentation (Christiansen, Allen & Seidenberg, 1998) and used it to simulate the results obtained by Marcus et al. The simu- lations demonstrate that no rules are needed to account for the data; rather, statistical knowledge related to word seg- mentation can explain the rule-like behavior of the infants in the Marcus et al. study. We then explore the issue of timing in stimuli presentation and present additional simu- lations from which empirical predictions are derived that di- verge from those of the rule-based account. These predictions are tested in experiments with adults. Experiment 1 replicated the results from Marcus et al. using adult subjects. Experi- ment 2 confirmed the predictions from our single-mechanism approach, whereas the dual-mechanism approach cannot ac- count for these results without adding extra machinery to complement the statistical and rule-based components. To- gether, the simulations and the experiments thus suggest that a single-mechanism model provides the most parsimonious account of the empirical data presented here and in Marcus et al., thus obviating the need for a separate rule-based compo- nent. Simulation 1: Rule-Like Behavior without Rules Marcus et al. (1999) used an artificial language learning paradigm to test their claim that the infant has two mecha- nisms for learning language, one that uses statistical informa- tion and another which uses algebraic rules. They conducted three experiments which tested infants\u2019 ability to generalize to items not presented in the familiarization phase of the ex- periment. We focus here on their third experiment because it was controlled for possible confounds found in the first two experiments: differences in phonetic features (Experiment 1) and reduplication 1 (Experiment 2). Marcus et al. claim that Though the control for reduplication was not entirely complete (see Elman, 1999).", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proceedings of the Twenty Second Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. XX-XX.
