We bring into account a new and influential asset \u2014 human intuition and perception \u2014 to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called \u201crisk\u201d if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of \u201crisks\u201d as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CogSIMA.2014.6816558", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Inter-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support (CogSIMA)", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Inter-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support (CogSIMA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2000231926", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["107513355", "22566276", "9535689", "11103579", "94188", "17660134", "29188527", "9778754", "129969", "9483510", "15015161", "10318045", "1502059", "16981948", "1206", "775373", "277918"], "inbound_citations": ["25309771", "16019169", "34158967", "8172504", "51908345", "19250439", "13197213", "18532662"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18985312"}

Our first results suggest that the selected features contribute to increase the CCR of different existing classification methods. Secondary experiments are performed on unknown covariate conditions and viewpoints. Inspired by the location of our first experiments' features, we proposed a simple mask. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mask gives satisfactory results for all angles of the probe and consequently is not view specific. We also show that our mask performs well when an uncooperative experimental setup is considered as compared to the state-of-the art methods. As a consequence, we propose a panoramic gait recognition framework on unknown covariate conditions.

We borrow the idea of \"family resemblances\" from Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations and Eleanor Rosch's psychological studies to support the idea of learning the detailed relationships between images of the same category, which is a departure from some popular machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machines that seek only the boundaries between categories. ::: We represent images as sets of patch-based features. To find the distance between two images, we first find for each patch its nearest patch in the other image and compute their inter-patch distance. The weighted sum of these inter-patch distances is defined to be the distance between the two images. The main contribution of this thesis is a method for learning a set-to-set distance function specific to each training image and demonstrating the use of these functions for image browsing, retrieval, and classification. The goal of the learning algorithm is to assign a non-negative weight to each patch-based feature of the image such that the most useful patches are assigned large weights and irrelevant or confounding patches are given zero weights. We formulate this as a large-margin optimization, related to the soft-margin Support Vector Machine, and discuss two versions: a \"focal\" version that learns weights for each image separately, and a \"global\" version that jointly learns the weights for all training images. In the focal version, the distance functions learned for the training images are not directly comparable to one another and can be most directly applied to in-sample applications such as image browsing, though with heuristics or additional learning, these functions can be used for image retrieval or classification. The global approach, however, learns distance functions that are globally consistent and can be used directly for image retrieval and classification. Using geometric blur and simple color features, we show that both versions perform as well or better than the best-performing algorithms on the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark. The global version achieves the best results, a 63.2% mean recognition rate when trained with fifteen images per category and 66.6% when trained with twenty.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1574877432", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1555909", "9983575", "11797378"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:473524"}

In this paper, heterogeneous ensemble learning is proposed to realize tool condition monitoring in which the support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM) and radius basis function (RBF) are selected as base classifiers and a stacking ensemble strategy is further used to reflect the relationship between the outputs of these base classifiers and tool wear states. Based on the heterogeneous ensemble learning classifier, an online monitoring system is constructed in which the harmonic features are extracted from force signals and a minimal redundancy and maximal relevance (mRMR) algorithm is utilized to select the most prominent features. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a titanium alloy milling experiment was carried out and samples with different tool wear states were collected to build the proposed heterogeneous ensemble learning classifier.

In addition to its pervasiveness, pediatric asthma shows high sensitivity to the environment. Combining medical-social dataset with machine learning methods we demonstrate how socio-markers play an important role in identifying patients at risk of hospital revisits due to pediatric asthma within a year. Introduction A socio-marker is a measurable indicator of social conditions where a patient is embedded in and exposed to, being analogous with a biomarker indicating the severity or presence of some disease state. Social factors are one of the most clinical health determinants [1], which play a critical role in explaining health outcomes. Socio-markers can help medical practitioners and researchers to reliably identify high-risk individuals in a timely manner. Methods We collected data from three different sources: pediatric asthma encounter records from Jan 1 st , 2016 to Dec 31 st , 2016 at a children\u2019s hospital, the 2010 U.S census data and neighborhood quality survey data by Memphis Property Hub. After merging these datasets we examine the effect of social features in identifying the patients who visited the hospital more than once during the observation period. We only use the first time visit (3,678 cases) to avoid over-counting of the same patients. In addition to demographic features (age, gender, insurance type, and race (African American and White)), we incorporate the social features such as the proportion of individuals living below the federal poverty level, blight prevalence, neighborhood quality, neighborhood quality inequality, trash dumping presence, the broken window pervasiveness within the zip code area of patients\u2019 residence are included. We then implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification model using abovementioned 11 social features. The classification outcome is either patient visits the hospital only one-time (class 0) or revisits the hospital within a year (class 1). Among 3,678 unique patients in the dataset, only 823 pediatric patients revisited hospital with asthma. So, to overcome the class imbalance issue, we have used 823 patients\u2019 data (randomly selected in 1,000 iterations) from each class. Further, to avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability, we divided the dataset as training, test, and validation with a proportion of 60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively. The reported test (5-folds cross-validation using training and testing data) and validation accuracy of the SVM method are averaged over 1,000 iterations to avoid sampling error and bias. Results The proposed socio-marker model resulted in an average classification accuracy of 63.70% for the test set and 63.67 % for the validation set. Further, the average specificity (the total true negative cases divided by the sum of true negative and false positive) and sensitivity (the total number of true positive cases divided by the sum of positive predicted cases) is found to be 62.79% and 64.77%, respectively for the test set and 62.79% and 64.83%, respectively for the validation set. Results of this study suggest that socio-marker features that are not directly related to a patient\u2019s medical conditions can still predict whether the patient will come back to the hospital within a year or not with approximately 64% accuracy. Conclusions Bringing the socio-marker features in the surveillance system may ease the burden of detecting the patients at risk of revisiting the hospital. The results should be interpreted with caution because we only used 12-month period of observation and the visit beyond the observation window is not considered. Also the patients may have visited different hospitals which are not captured in the data. References 1.

In urban areas, information concerning very high resolution land cover and especially material maps are necessary for several city modelling or monitoring applications. That is to say, knowledge concerning the roofing materials or the different kinds of ground areas is required. Airborne remote sensing techniques appear to be convenient for providing such information at a large scale. However, results obtained using most traditional processing methods based on usual red-green-blue-near infrared multispectral images remain limited for such applications. A possible way to improve classification results is to enhance the imagery spectral resolution using superspectral or hyperspectral sensors. In this study, it is intended to design a superspectral sensor dedicated to urban materials classification and this work particularly focused on the selection of the optimal spectral band subsets for such sensor. First, reflectance spectral signatures of urban materials were collected from 7 spectral libraires. Then, spectral optimization was performed using this data set. The band selection workflow included two steps, optimising first the number of spectral bands using an incremental method and then examining several possible optimised band subsets using a stochastic algorithm. The same wrapper relevance criterion relying on a confidence measure of Random Forests classifier was used at both steps. To cope with the limited number of available spectra for several classes, additional synthetic spectra were generated from the collection of reference spectra: intra-class variability was simulated by multiplying reference spectra by a random coefficient. At the end, selected band subsets were evaluated considering the classification quality reached using a rbf svm classifier. It was confirmed that a limited band subset was sufficient to classify common urban materials. The important contribution of bands from the Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) spectral domain (1000\u20132400 nm) to material classification was also shown.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-annals-III-7-33-2016", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2414002301", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["129784017", "14134274", "89141", "9993730", "41945314", "111309741", "32989970", "15245447", "6340275", "61649919", "41827374", "15960436", "12135664", "16117907", "33296374", "46268665", "130201687", "15596243", "6658152", "11055443", "131528125", "12795832", "10800171", "16655704", "8366428", "16042923", "15614914"], "inbound_citations": ["52232041", "53618855", "204253592", "6611907", "8351919", "125849812"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54588483"}

In the first application, monthly stream flows of Hunza river are forecasted using local stream flow data of Hunza and precipitation and temperature data of nearby station. LSSVM provides slightly better forecasts than the FGA and M5T models. Stream flow and temperature inputs generally give better forecasts compared to other inputs.

Therefore, intrusion detection is an important task when dealing with an information infrastructure for security. A major challenge in intrusion detection is to unearth intrusions that happen almost instantaneously and thereafter lay embedded, to be discovered, in vast scattered resources in a normally operating real-time communication environment. Data mining process working on intrusion detection is to identify valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in massive data. Thus, it can be understood that, it is challenging as well as demanding to apply data mining techniques to detect intrusions of various types in an information infrastructure resource/s. To start with, our paper discusses different intrusion detection techniques that brings out and presents the underlying concepts and associated application of data mining approaches as an applied tool against intrusion detection system. Techniques include, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that was designed and utilized as classifiers for binary classification/s, and helped to solve multi-class problems. In this paper we bring in the fusion of Decision-Tree and Support Vector Machine (DT-SVM) which combines and reinforce in an effective way for solving multi-class problems in the information resource domain. This method has the potential, as confirmed in our findings, to decrease the training and testing time, contributing to increased efficiency of the system. The construction order of binary tree significantly influences classification performance.

To address these limitations, a multiple classifier system based on Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is proposed and evaluated to classify hyperspectral data. In this method, the hyperspectral datasets are first split into several band clusters based on the similarities between the contiguous bands. In an AdaBoost classification system, the redundant and noninformative bands in each cluster are then removed using an optimal band selection technique. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) is applied to each refined cluster based on the classification results of previous clusters, and the results of these classifiers are fused using the weights obtained from the AdaBoost processing. Experimental results with standard hyperspectral datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm with respect to both global and class accuracies, when compared to another ensemble classifiers such as simple majority voting and Naive Bayes to combine decisions from each cluster, a standard SVM applied on the selected bands of entire datasets and on all the spectral bands.

The UAV-based multispectral images with five wavebands (490, 550, 671, 700, 800 nm) were obtained at five growth stages from consecutive two years' wheat field experiments with different combinations in variety, N application rate and planting density. In this paper, we compared systematically leaf nitrogen content (LNC) estimation accuracy and processing speed of a multitude of vegetation indices (VIs), non-parametric and physically-based model retrieval methods. With regard to vegetation indices, most possible band combinations with existing five bands and a linear regression fitting function have been evaluated. The best performing index was optimized three-band combination 2.5(R 800 -R 700 )/(R 800 +6R 700 -7.5R 490 ) according to EVI (Enhanced vegetation index) for LNC with 10-fold cross-validation determination (R2) of 0.73. This method shows especially fast processing speed (0.03 s). As for non-parametric methods, 14 common regression algorithms have been evaluated. Among these algorithms, Random Forest [TreeBagger] is the best performing method with R2 of 0.79 for LNC. This method has the advantage of making use of the full optical spectrum as well as flexible, nonlinear fitting. Additionally, the model is trained and validated relatively fast (2.3 s). Compared with the front two methods, it remains a challenge to estimate the canopy nitrogen through inversion of a PROSAIL based radiative transfer model (RTM). After the generation of a look-up table (LUT), a number of cost functions and regularization options were evaluated for inversion of LCC (leaf chlorophyll content). Inversion of nitrogen indirectly relying on inversion of LCC based on the empirical linear relationship between LCC and LNC. Although this method offered per-pixel estimation, generation of a look-up table and image processing took considerably more time. Besides, the validation performed less reliable. To sum up, Random Forest [TreeBagger] provides fast and accurate estimation of nitrogen using UAV-acquired multispectral imagery which will be good basis for remote sensing of canopy nitrogen status in a wide range of crop.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730920", "venue": "2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)", "journal": "2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2548524756", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["129795406", "32320030", "98588756", "215188384", "17288868", "29540166", "22804178", "14264293", "129583586", "11168535", "126504503"], "inbound_citations": ["25112442", "204741050", "144207375", "51965311"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38645542"}

User-generated streaming data presents unique properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous new challenges for the once very successful recommendation techniques. Although a few temporal or sequential recommender models have recently been developed based on recurrent neural models, most of them can only be applied to the session-based recommendation scenario, due to their short-term memories and the limited capability of capturing users' long-term stable interests. In this paper, we propose a streaming recommender model based on neural memory networks with external memories to capture and store both long-term stable interests and short-term dynamic interests in a unified way. An adaptive negative sampling framework based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is developed to optimize our proposed streaming recommender model, which effectively overcomes the limitations of classical negative sampling approaches and improves both effectiveness and efficiency of the model parameter inference.

Existing studies have shown that S 3 VM is effective especially in the situations where labeled data is scarce. Nevertheless, most of existing S 3 VM algorithms belong to centralized learning, that is, all the data is stored and processed at a fusion center. In many real-world applications, data may be horizontally or vertically distributed over multiple nodes (parties). Besides, from the concerns of privacy and security, each node would not like to share its original data with the others. On the other hand, considering that the data is usually sequentially generated, online processing is preferred. In this paper, we propose two online distributed S 3 VM (dS 3 VM) algorithms, which are respectively used for horizontally and vertically partitioned data classification. In these two algorithms, to get a fully decentralized implementation, we propose a new form of manifold regularization defined on some anchor points that are adaptively selected by an online strategy. Besides, we use the sparse random feature map to approximate the kernel feature map. In this manner, the model parameters can be collaboratively estimated without transmitting the original data between neighbors. The convergence performances of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Simulations on several data sets are performed. Results show that the proposed dS 3 VM algorithms achieve good classification performance even when there is only a small portion of labeled data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2018.07.045", "venue": "Inf.

In this article, a Support Vector Machine is applied to predict the cleavability of oligopeptides by proteases with multiple and extended specificity subsites.

Language morphology varies widely across languages and must be accounted for when designing algorithms. Here, we compare the performance of a word embedding-based approach and a topic modeling approach with machine learning algorithms to determine the best method for Chinese, Arabic, and French languages. Introduction: Global biosurveillance is an extremely important, yet challenging task. One form of global biosurveillance comes from harvesting open source online data (e.g. news, blogs, reports, RSS feeds). The information derived from this data can be used for timely detection and identification of biological threats all over the world. However, the more inclusive the data harvesting procedure is to ensure that all potentially relevant articles are collected, the more data that is irrelevant also gets harvested. This issue can become even more complex when the online data is in a non-native language. Foreign language articles not only create language-specific issues for Natural Language Processing (NLP), but also add a significant amount of translation costs. Previous work shows success in the use of combinatory monolingual classifiers in specific applications, e.g., legal domain [1]. A critical component for a comprehensive, online harvesting biosurveillance system is the capability to identify relevant foreign language articles from irrelevant ones based on the initial article information collected, without the additional cost of full text retrieval and translation. Methods: The analysis text dataset contains the title and brief description of 3506 online articles in Chinese, Arabic, and French languages from the date range of August, 17, 2016 to July 5, 2017. The NLP article pre-processing steps are language-specific tokenization and stop words removal. We compare two different approaches: word embeddings and topic modeling (Fig. 1). For word embeddings, we first generate word vectors for the data using a pretrained Word2Vec (W2V) model [2]. Subsequently, the word vectors within a document are averaged to produce a single feature vector for the document. Then, we fit a machine learning algorithm (random forest classifier or Support Vector Machine (SVM)) to the training vectors and get predictions for the test documents. For topic modelling, we used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to generate five topics for all relevant documents [3]. For each new document, the output is the probability measure for the document belonging to these five topics. Here, we classify the new document by comparing the probability measure with a relevancy threshold. Results: The Word2Vec model combined with a random forest classifier outperformed the other approaches across the three languages (Fig. 2); the Chinese model has an 89% F1-score, the Arabic model has 86%, and the French model has 94%. To decrease the chance of calling a potentially relevant article irrelevant, high recall was more important than high precision. In the Chinese model, the Word2Vec with a random forest approach had the highest recall at 98% (Table 1). Conclusions: We present research findings on different approaches of relevance to biosurveillance identification on non-English texts and identify the best performing methods for implementation into a biosurveillance online article harvesting system. Our initial results suggest that the word embeddings model has an advantage over topic modeling, and the random forest classifier outperforms the SVM. Directions for future work will aim to further expand the list of languages and methods to be compared, e.g., n-grams and non-negative matrix factorization. In addition, we will fine-tune the Arabic and French model for better accuracy results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6087956", "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5210/ojphi.v10i1.8375", "venue": "Online Journal of Public Health Informatics", "journal": "Online Journal of Public Health Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2803465209", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["193594", "207556454"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44059737"}

In recent work, Boden and Niklasson have incorporated a variant of this view of semantics within their conception of semantic systematicity. Moreover, Boden and Niklasson contend that they have produced experimental results which not only satisfy a kind of context-based, semantic systematicity, but which, to the degree that reality permits, effectively deals with challenges posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988), and Hadley (1994a). The latter challenge involved well-defined criteria for strong semantic systematicity. This paper examines the relevant claims and experiments of Boden and Niklasson.

The teacher commonly plays a short excerpt, perhaps a phrase from a Bach chorale, and then the students attempt to translate the various pitches and durations into the symbols of standard musical notation. Each resulting symbol can be judged true or false, right or wrong. Music teachers also ask their classes to analyze the musical syntax of phrases from Bach chorales. The resulting answers will likely have varying shades of truth or falsity. Students can have legitimate differences of opinion about how to interpret ambiguous musical events or events that have one meaning in prospect and a second in retrospect. And not only students differ in their assessments of complex musical patterns. Acknowledged experts in eighteenth-century music are known to disagree about how, in a given phrase, the chords, rhythms, contours, melodies, textures, timbres, and counterpoint all interact. Connectionist models offer elegant ways of dealing with multidimensional complexity of the type found in polyphonic, harmonically oriented music. One can, for example, define a musical event as an input pattern of activation that is then transformed by a network of interconnected processing units into an output pattern of activation representing an interpretation of the event. Models that allow for learning often require an explicit teacher prepared to state unambiguously whether, and to what degree, the output pattern is in error (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986; Werbos 1988). For relatively low-level musical tasks, like the transcription problem described above, this requirement poses no serious obstacle; but for higher-level tasks, the notion of an explicit teacher becomes problematical.

In this paper, we introduce simulated SAR data to alleviate the problem of insufficient training data. To address domain shift and task transfer problems caused by differences between simulated and real data, we propose a model that integrates meta-learning and adversarial domain adaptation. We use sufficient simulated data and a few real data to pre-train the model. After fine-tuning, the pre-trained model can quickly adapt to new tasks in real data. Extensive experimental results obtained in the real SAR dataset demonstrate that our model effectively solves the cross-domain and cross-task transfer problem.

The algorithm has treated successfully some problems of implicit performance function in reliability analysis. However, its theoretical basis of empirical risk minimization narrows its range of applications for the regression model. In contrast to classical algorithms, the support vector machine for regression (SVR) based on structural risk minimization has the excellent abilities of small sample learning and generalization, and superiority over the traditional regression method. Nevertheless, SVR is time consuming and huge space demanding for the reliability analysis of large samples. This article introduces the least squares support vector machine for regression (LSSVR) into reliability analysis to overcome these shortcomings. Numerical results show that the reliability method based on the LSSVR has excellent accuracy and smaller computational cost than the reliability method based on support vector machine (SVM).

River features of meandering rivers evolve through dynamic avulsion, erosion and deposition processes.

{"paper_id": "212951879", "title": "An exploration of the use of machine learning techniques for site-specific weed management", "authors": [{"first": "Junfeng", "middle": [], "last": "Gao", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Weeds are common, and sometimes they are ignored for their economic impact on crop losses and management costs. In fact, they pose a serious risk for the food markets and agricultural productions all over the world. Herbicides are the dominant choice for weed control in modern agriculture. However, the overuse of herbicides entails a higher risk for herbicideresistance development and poses a heavy pollution threat to the environment. Site-specific weed management (SSWM) refers to the spatially variable application of a weed control strategy rather than controlling weeds uniformly over the entire area which enables to minimize herbicide usage and thereby potentially reduces the adverse effects on environment and ecosystem. However, one of the important and challenging components of SSWM is weed recognition and field mapping for an appropriate early automatic weed control. In this thesis, a systematic study of weed recognition and detection with different imaging sensors in different crops, under controlled environments and field conditions were discussed. In chapter 1, the agricultural background and state-of-the-art SSWM are presented. The cameras used for the PhD research and the theoretical backgrounds of machine learning algorithms are presented ::: in chapter 2. ::: At a laboratory scale, chapter 3 explored the potential of a novel hyperspectral snapshot mosaic camera for weed and maize classification. The image processing, feature engineering and machine learning techniques were discussed when developing an optimal classification model for the three kinds of weeds (Convolvulus arvensis, Rumex obtusifolius, Cirsium arvense) and maize. A total set of 185 spectral features including reflectance and vegetation index features was constructed. Subsequently, the principal component analysis was used to reduce the redundancy of the constructed features, and the first 5 principal components, explaining over 95% variance ratio, were kept for further analysis. Furthermore, random forests modeling as a machine learning algorithm was used for developing the classifier with ::: three different combinations of features. Accuracy oriented feature reduction was performed when choosing the optimal number of features for building the classification model. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning was explored for the optimization of the random forest model. The results showed that the optimal random forest model with 30 important spectral features could achieve a mean correct classification rate of 1.0, 0.789, 0.691 and 0.752 for maize, ::: Convolvulus arvensis, Rumex obtusifolius and Cirsium arvense, respectively. The McNemar test showed an overall better performance of the optimal random forest model at the 0.05 significance level compared to the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model. ::: Chapter 4 also described experiments carried out under controlled conditions. Two troublesome weed species, Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyard grass) and Oryza sativa f. spontanea (weedy rice), were selected as research objects. A classification model with important spectral features was developed to recognize these two weeds in a rice crop based ::: on hyperspectral imaging techniques. There were 287 plant leaf samples in total which were scanned by the hyperspectral imaging systems within the spectral range from 380 nm to 1080 nm. After obtaining hyperspectral images, a pipeline was developed to automatically extract spectral features from line-scanning hyperspectral images. Then the raw spectral features were subjected to wavelet transformation for noise reduction. Random forests and support vector machine models were developed with the optimal hyperparameters to compare their performances in the test set. Moreover, feature selection was explored using the successive projection algorithm (SPA). It is shown that the weighted support vector machine with 6 spectral features selected by SPA can achieve 100%, 100%, and 92% recognition rates for E. crus-galli, O. sativa f. spontanea and rice, respectively. Furthermore, the selected 6 wavelengths (415 nm, 561 nm, 687 nm, 705 nm, 735 nm, 1007 nm) had the potential to design a customized optical sensor for these two weeds and rice discrimination in practice. ::: The developments in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and advanced imaging sensors provide new opportunities for ultra-high resolution (e.g., less than a 10 cm ground sampling distance (GSD)) crop field monitoring and mapping in precision agriculture applications. In chapter 5, a strategy for inter- and intra-row weed detection in early seasonv maize fields from aerial visual imagery was developed. More specifically, the Hough transform algorithm (HT) was applied to the orthomosaicked images for inter-row weed detection. A semi-automatic Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) procedure was developed with Random Forests (RF) combined with feature selection techniques to classify soil, weeds and maize. Furthermore, the two binary weed masks generated from HT and OBIA were fused in order to obtain an accurate binary weed image. The developed RF classifier was evaluated by 5-fold cross validation, and it obtained an overall accuracy of 0.945, and Kappa value of 0.912. Finally, the relationship between detected weeds and their ground truth densities was quantified by a fitted linear model with a coefficient of determination of 0.895 and a root mean ::: square error of 0.026. Besides, the importance of input features was evaluated, and it was found that the ratio of vegetation length and width was the most significant feature for the classification model. Overall, it was shown that the proposed approach can yield a satisfactory weed map, and it was expected that the obtained weed map from UAV imagery will be applicable to realize SSWM in early season crop fields to reduce the amount of herbicides used and herbicide costs. ::: Under field conditions, challenges such as plant species variations, growth differences, foliage occlusions and interference from changing outdoor conditions still need to be further overcome in order to develop a real-time and robust weed detection model in agricultural environments. Current approaches for weed and crop recognition, segmentation and detection rely predominantly on conventional machine-learning techniques that require a large set of ::: hand-crafted features for modeling. These might fail to generalize over different fields and environments. Chapter 6 presents an approach that developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the YOLOv3 architecture for Convolvulus sepium and sugar beet detection. There were 2271 synthetic images, before combining these images with 402 field images which were generated to train the developed model. YOLO anchor box sizes were calculated from the training dataset using a k-means clustering approach. The resulting model was tested on 100 field images, showing that the combination of synthetic and original field images to train the developed model can improve the mean average precision (mAP) metric from 0.751 to 0.829 compared to using collected field images alone. The performances of the ::: developed model with the YOLOv3 and Tiny YOLO models were also compared. The developed model achieved a better trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, the average precisions (APs@IOU0.5) of Convolvulus sepium and sugar beet were 0.761 and 0.897 respectively with 6.48 ms inference time per image (800x1200) on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU environment. ::: The thesis followed the logic from lab exploration to field study. The methodology used in the thesis was based on image processing and machine learning but the specific image processing approaches and classifiers were different over these chapters. This indicates that it is necessary to select appropriate imaging sensors and algorithms based on real circumstances. Generally, a visual and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system is appropriate to be used for the differentiation of morphologically similar species. Visual camera with a UAV platform, a cost-effective system, is also capable of providing a satisfactory detection result in some cases where preconditions like the presence of a wide row crop, and early crop and weed growth stages should meet. It was indicated that feature fusion could improve model performances. Deep neural network, learning hierarchical features automatically, provides an end-to-end solution for weed detection tasks, which requires little engineering by hand. But one of the bottlenecks of this algorithm is the requirement of large manually labeled datasets for its superior prediction performances. Future works can be done based on the results from this thesis. E.g. fusing spectral features with other features such as textural features to develop a more robust model. Moreover, developing a vision-based SSWM prototype is meaningful to integrate all these techniques and demonstrate its applicable abilities.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "3000531614", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212951879"}

Maternal breathing can introduce motion, but a larger effect is frequently due to fetal movement within the womb. Consequently, imaging is frequently performed slice-by-slice using single shot techniques, which are then combined into volumetric images using slice-to-volume reconstruction methods (SVR). For successful SVR, a key preprocessing step is to isolate fetal brain tissues from maternal anatomy before correcting for the motion of the fetal head. This has hitherto been a manual or semi-automatic procedure. We propose an automatic method to localize and segment the brain of the fetus when the image data is acquired as stacks of 2D slices with anatomy misaligned due to fetal motion. We combine this segmentation process with a robust motion correction method, enabling the segmentation to be refined as the reconstruction proceeds. The fetal brain localization process uses Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER), which are classified using a Bag-of-Words model with Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features. The segmentation process is a patch-based propagation of the MSER regions selected during detection, combined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The gestational age (GA) is used to incorporate prior knowledge about the size and volume of the fetal brain into the detection and segmentation process. The method was tested in a ten-fold cross-validation experiment on 66 datasets of healthy fetuses whose GA ranged from 22 to 39 weeks. In 85% of the tested cases, our proposed method produced a motion corrected volume of a relevant quality for clinical diagnosis, thus removing the need for manually delineating the contours of the brain before motion correction. Our method automatically generated as a side-product a segmentation of the reconstructed fetal brain with a mean Dice score of 93%, which can be used for further processing.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25058899", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.07.023", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2002800263", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8955709", "3077937", "3027134", "89141", "32142022", "22348423", "1815599", "17606900", "53335638", "14461734", "7900817", "972888", "14460981", "11446019", "14492961", "16174379", "17850254", "8923799", "277918", "5258236", "18659314", "41908779", "14419291", "12220680", "17975028", "16351941", "54432685", "209661", "208365112", "24867987", "65217601", "7859796", "41064846", "6147258", "18669496", "61930962"], "inbound_citations": ["11358033", "8911895", "44069325", "215578684", "207844623", "215338947", "563962", "16836495", "10726144", "3213653", "53776136", "53210273", "196627471", "3672411", "214943985", "12641294", "24030109", "201838172", "6201371", "424951", "3381542", "14217201", "7693072", "36697825", "719911", "99276012", "214990446", "52154967", "207205594", "204700015", "207974144", "3846068", "214890315", "1153755", "4585436", "17799042", "215290059", "3163632", "215651692", "10588710", "214883166", "215563991"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207190956"}

The aim of this paper is to identify the pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) images of the lung using a hybrid intelligent approach. At first, the proposed approach utilizes a type-II fuzzy algorithm to improve the quality of raw CT images. Then, a novel segmentation algorithm based on fuzzy c-means clustering, called modified spatial kernelized fuzzy c-means (MSFCM) clustering, is offered in order to achieve another representation of lung regions through an optimization methodology. Next, nodule candidates are detected among all available objects in the lung regions by a morphological procedure. This is followed by extracting significant statistical and morphological features from such nodule candidates and finally, an ensemble of three classifiers comprising Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for the actual diagnosis and determining whether the nodule candidate is nodule (cancerous) or non-nodule (healthy). The effectiveness of the hybrid intelligent approach is evaluated using a public dataset for lung CT images, viz.: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). The experimental results positively demonstrate that the modified spatial kernelized FCM segmentation is superior to the other techniques existing in the literature. More importantly, a number of useful performance measurements in medical applications including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, as well as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve are computed.

Therefore, assessing vulnerabilities exploitability risk is critical as it aids decision-makers prioritize among vulnerabilities, allocate resources, and choose between alternatives. Several methods have recently been proposed in the literature to deal with this challenge. However, these methods are either subjective, requires human involvement in assessing exploitability, or do not scale. In this research, our aim is to first identify vulnerability exploitation risk problem. Then, we introduce a novel vulnerability exploitability metric based on software structure properties viz.: attack entry points, vulnerability location, presence of dangerous system calls, and reachability. Based on our preliminary results, reachability and the presence of dangerous system calls appear to be a good indicator of exploitability. Next, we propose using the suggested metric as feature to construct a model using machine learning techniques for automatically predicting the risk of vulnerability exploitation. To build a vulnerability exploitation model, we propose using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

Several image classification methods are used to create standardized Land use and Land cover (LULC) maps which facilitate research on spatial and ecological processes and human activities. Local Climate Zones (LCZ) classification maps are an example of standardized maps which have been widely used to demarcate the homogeneity in built and natural character in the cities. The LCZ classification scheme is primarily focused on urban climate-related research, in which 17 climate zones are mapped in a city area with the 100-150m spatial resolution. Each zone exhibits physical properties related to urban form and functions essential for thermal behavior studies. Extending this widely adopted approach to create LULC maps at finer resolution using LCZ mapping scheme would benefit the allied domains of urban planning, transportation, and water resources management. This study proposes a novel solution to generate classification maps with a 10-band Sentinel-2B dataset and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at the 10m spatial resolution. The classification benefits from the CNN's property to preserve local structures in the image datasets. The proposed CNN model outperforms traditional machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. The overall accuracy and kappa of the CNN model trained on 14 urban and natural classes are 82 percent and 81 percent, respectively.

A desirable approach is building a prediction model on unlabeled data and labeled data. CPDP in this scenario is called cross-project semi-supervised defect prediction (CSDP).

For effectively learning the discriminative features of data from different projects, we propose a Discriminative Adversarial Feature Learning (DAFL) approach for CSDP.

This paper presents the development of a PV abnormal condition detection system by combining regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. The regression model is used to estimate the expected power generation under the respective solar irradiance, which is used as the input for the SVM model. The SVM model is then used to identify the abnormal condition of a PV system.

These structures are represented quantitatively as finite collections of elements. The displacement of each element is computed using algebraic equations.

Considerable expertise is required in choosing these resolution values. A too fine mesh leads to unnecessary computational overheads when executing the model. A too coarse mesh produces intolerable approximation errors. In this paper we demonstrate that rules for deciding on appropriate resolution values can be inductively constructed from expert provided examples.

Because the primary purpose of DG is to classify unseen domains rather than the invariance itself, the improvement of the invariance can negatively affect DG performance under this trade-off. To overcome the problem, this study first expands the analysis of the trade-off by Xie et. al., and provides the notion of accuracy-constrained domain invariance, which means the maximum domain invariance within a range that does not interfere with accuracy. We then propose a novel method adversarial feature learning with accuracy constraint (AFLAC), which explicitly leads to that invariance on adversarial training.

Moreover, by associating the information from stored training templates with unlabeled testing samples, a bilinear graph is defined accordingly to propagate the label of each sample.

Although up to hundreds of TCSs may operate in parallel in a bacterial cell, the high-fidelity of a TCS signaling is well maintained, minimizing irrelevant crosstalk between TCSs. When a HK gene and a RR gene in a given TCS system exist in neighboring positions, it is almost certain that their protein products (i.e., HK and RR) are interacting partners. However, large bacterial genomes often have multiple HK genes and/or cognate RR genes that are not neighboring positions. In many partially assembled genomes, some HK genes and RR genes belong to different contigs. In these cases, it is not clear which HK(s) and RR(s) interact. By combining information-theoretic and graph-theoretic approaches, we developed a computational method identifying co-evolving residue pairs between HKs and cognate RRs and predicting the interacting HK:RR pairs for each TCS. In addition, we built a TCSppWWW webserver (http://compath.org/platcom/tcs) that takes query sequences of pairing candidates and predicts their HK:RR pairing using precomputed models. The current release of TCSppWWW provides predictors for 48 TCSs using over 20,000 protein sequences from about 900 bacterial genomes. Three different types of predictors using Random Forest, RBF Network, and Naive Bayes are provided. Once a set of HK and RR candidate sequences are submitted, TCSppWWW aligns query sequences to the precomputed multiple sequence alignment of HK:RR pairs, extracts co-evolving column positions, then returns prediction results with prediction margin and additional information.

This type of studies has been very successful in the case of Mendelian monogenic disorders while it has been less successful in identifying genetic variants related to complex diseases where the insurgence depends on the interactions between different genes and the environment. The current technology allows to genotype more than a million of markers and this number has been rapidly increasing in the last years with the imputation based on templates sets and whole genome sequencing. This type of data introduces a great amount of noise in the statistical analysis and usually requires a great number of samples. Current methods seldom take into account gene-gene and gene-environment interactions which are fundamental especially in complex diseases. In this paper we propose to use a non-parametric additive model to detect the genetic variants related to diseases which accounts for interactions of unknown order. Although this is not new to the current literature, we show that in an isolated population, where the most related subjects share also most of their genetic code, the use of additive models may be improved if the available genealogical tree is taken into account. Specifically, we form a sample of cases and controls with the highest inbreeding by means of the Hungarian method, and estimate the set of genes/environmental variables, associated with the disease, by means of Random Forest.ResultsWe have evidence, from statistical theory, simulations and two applications, that we build a suitable procedure to eliminate stratification between cases and controls and that it also has enough precision in identifying genetic variants responsible for a disease. This procedure has been successfully used for the beta-thalassemia, which is a well known Mendelian disease, and also to the common asthma where we have identified candidate genes that underlie to the susceptibility of the asthma. Some of such candidate genes have been also found related to common asthma in the current literature.ConclusionsThe data analysis approach, based on selecting the most related cases and controls along with the Random Forest model, is a powerful tool for detecting genetic variants associated to a disease in isolated populations. Moreover, this method provides also a prediction model that has accuracy in estimating the unknown disease status and that can be generally used to build kit tests for a wide class of Mendelian diseases.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3155486", "pubmed_id": "21767363", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2156-12-63", "venue": "BMC Genetics", "journal": "BMC Genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2162003537", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8690595", "135541", "32964859", "15537841", "39834052", "21324731", "9426884", "121660071", "8690595", "45174121", "17535443", "10658714", "28905284", "15787530", "16462531", "7484575", "12777404", "6799971", "1045813", "15245447", "123445436", "123625726", "58827013", "1290347", "25740812", "85628528", "10036362", "8529157", "16190154", "12852360"], "inbound_citations": ["67766997", "215212050", "6099828", "12454277", "2828056"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11762153"}

It is not trivial due to appearance variations across different modalities. Rigidly aligning two images is used to register rigid body structure, and it is also usually the first step for deformable registration with a large discrepancy. In the field of computer vision, one well-established method for image alignment is to find corresponding points from two images, and image alignment is based on identified corresponding points. Our method lies in this category. Feature representation is crucial in finding corresponding points. However, conventional feature representation like SIFT does not take multi-modal information into account, and thus, it fails. In this paper, we propose a Convolution Neural Network Feature-based Registration (CNNFR) method for aligning the multi-modal medical image. The important component in this method is learning keypoint descriptors using contrastive metric learning, which minimizes the difference between two feature representations from two corresponding points and maximizes difference of two feature representation from two distant points. Also, a transfer learning-based CNNRF (TrCNNRF) is proposed to improve the generalization learning performance when the training data are insufficient.

Identification of crop and its accuracy is an important aspect in predicting crop production using Remote Sensing technology. This study investigates the ability of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in discriminating fodder crops and estimating its area using moderate resolution multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI data. SVM is a non-parametric statistical learning method and its accuracy is dependent on the parameters and the kernels used. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of SVM in fodder classification and compare the results with traditional parametric Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Fodder crops are available over small fields in the study area thus having large number of pure fodder pixels over small area is difficult. Hence, SVM has an advantage over MLC as it works well with less training data sets also. Three kernels (linear, polynomial and radial based function) were used with SVM classification. Comparative analysis showed that higher overall accuracy was observed in SVM in comparison to MLC. Temporal change in the spectral properties of the crops derived through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multi-temporal Landsat-8 was found to be the most important information that affects accuracy of classification. The classification accuracies for SVM with radial based function, polynomial, linear kernel and MLC were 90.09%, 89.9%, 88.9% and 82.4% respectively. The result suggested that SVM including three kernels performed significantly better than MLC.

In this paper, we study such a problem of performing Text Classification WithOut labeled Negative data TC-WON). In this paper, we explore an efficient extension of the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, called SVMC (Support Vector Mapping Convergence) [17]for the TC-WON tasks. Our analyses show that when the positive training data is not too under-sampled, SVMC significantly outperforms other methods because SVMC basically exploits the natural \"gap\" between positive and negative documents in the feature space, which eventually corresponds to improving the generalization performance. In the text domain there are likely to exist many gaps in the feature space because a document is usually mapped to a sparse and high dimensional feature space. However, as the number of positive training data decreases, the boundary of SVMC starts overfitting at some point and end up generating very poor results.This is because when the positive training data is too few, the boundary over-iterates and trespasses the natural gaps between positive and negative class in the feature space and thus ends up fitting tightly around the few positive training data.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/956863.956909", "venue": "CIKM '03", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2101246646", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1692262", "59639035", "14591650", "60458454", "2748729", "15112547", "270398", "686980", "207673395", "3091", "11860755", "28637672", "67073325", "4362821"], "inbound_citations": ["276267", "62574776", "17324236", "978891", "15022378", "204895939", "46169715", "15814355", "64483515", "62532519", "18013368", "8056255", "214638351", "8956727", "10855718", "42736128", "62522903", "208039099", "42617440", "204771186", "647177", "17776520", "14348108", "9854397", "6998037", "8556597", "22046249", "207732962", "4247496", "15295257", "18328795"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10460697"}

At the same time, the (functional) requirements derived from the customers are becoming more challenging to fulfill. In order to cope with this challenge, designers have to focus more on design for manufacturing besides taking the requirements derived from the customers into account. This is not only important from an economic perspective, e.g., to reduce avoidable expenses during manufacturing but often also directly related to the fulfillment of customer requirements from a quality perspective, e.g., structural behavior of highly stressed products. In manufacturing, the product state concept describes the subsequent development of a product along the process chain by its accumulated state. It can be used to increase the understanding of the manufacturing processes from a system's point of view and can be applied e.g., to support quality management. Within the concept it is possible to identify so-called \u2018state drivers\u2019, by means of Support Vector Machine based feature ranking on an accumulating product and process state vector. These state drivers take explicit and implicit intra- and inter-relations between states into account and provide an insight which parameters are most relevant for the final quality outcome and where the critical points along the process chain are. In this paper, the relation between design for manufacturing and the product state concept will be discussed with a special focus on the state drivers. The question, if and how state drivers can be utilized to support the design phase and designers will be examined in detail, whilst the overall question of the appropriate detail of manufacturing feedback to design is also examined.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procir.2015.01.081", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia CIRP", "mag_id": "1756974789", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109035798"}

We developed an automated, quantitative method that objectively classifies five distinct motility patterns of mouse sperm using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a common method in supervised machine learning. This multiclass SVM model is based on more than 2000 sperm tracks that were captured by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) during in vitro capacitation and visually classified as progressive, intermediate, hyperactivated, slow, or weakly motile. Parameters associated with the classified tracks were incorporated into established SVM algorithms to generate a series of equations. These equations were integrated into a binary decision tree that sequentially sorts uncharacterized tracks into distinct categories. The first equation sorts CASA tracks into vigorous and nonvigorous categories. Additional equations classify vigorous tracks as progressive, intermediate, or hyperactivated and nonvigorous tracks as slow or weakly motile. Our CASAnova software uses these SVM equations to classify individual sperm motility patterns automatically. Comparisons of motility profiles from sperm incubated with and without bicarbonate confirmed the ability of the model to distinguish hyperactivated patterns of motility that develop during in vitro capacitation. The model accurately classifies motility profiles of sperm from a mutant mouse model with severe motility defects. Application of the model to sperm from multiple inbred strains reveals strain-dependent differences in sperm motility profiles. CASAnova provides a rapid and reproducible platform for quantitative comparisons of motility in large, heterogeneous populations of mouse sperm.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3099585", "pubmed_id": "21349820", "doi": "10.1095/biolreprod.110.088989", "venue": "Biology of reproduction", "journal": "Biology of reproduction", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2112523892", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["31457559", "39774400", "7555169", "10681580", "37112242", "13015239", "19235674", "11213081", "11325224", "16143775", "7839928", "27706451", "2578827", "45544323", "10755736", "22621937", "321070", "32535386", "33368019", "84580786", "8771595", "9350923", "45103254", "41424067", "144565557", "85771691", "20138217", "12084155", "37273002", "10581655", "13716512", "41262949", "28525792", "28145328", "20624802", "5990579", "20970550", "6723081", "34697330"], "inbound_citations": ["24286792", "25122515", "202806670", "52286578", "6470565", "7589309", "46006052", "38341012", "205364336", "56486719", "28847194", "205359599", "4650760", "17602421", "38958753", "215573501", "207758384", "5880530", "48362941", "203565664", "214941812", "10567063", "22708639", "214783190", "204966878", "20336501", "50786697", "215493433", "13806753", "18824623", "155102843", "53871561", "14000571", "201656054", "215455871", "58578850", "215467040", "17665008", "24853270", "108294426", "32804051", "23579410", "1984415", "14151324", "14524953", "7419517", "10003717", "5067153", "370043"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18544973"}

TF-IDF aims to identify the most frequent words, whereas stemming aims to retrieve the stem of the word by removing the inflectional derivations. The dataset that has been used is Modern Arabic Corpus which consists of Arabic tweets.

When SOC mapping over a large region is required, the usual approach has to employ a model calibrated for the whole area. An alternative is to use a series of locally calibrated models to map smaller areas that collectively cover the large region of interest. The accuracy of the SOC products generated by these two approaches can potentially vary. However, performance of whole-area calibrated models versus locally calibrated models in mapping SOC of large extents has seldom been explored in detail, particularly with respect to the type of model being employed. Our study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the SOC prediction performance of three common models, multiple linear regression (MLR), Regression tree model; Cubist and Support Vector Regression (SVR) that are calibrated locally and for the whole study area. This study was carried out using eight identified local areas in New South Wales (NSW), Australia and across the whole state entirely. Every model was calibrated separately for each local area and for the entire state. The local and whole-area models were validated using the same test data set over 50 realizations. In particular, local prediction accuracy of whole-area calibrated models was compared to that of locally calibrated models. The models were tested separately for the standard soil depth layers including 0\u20135 cm, 5\u201315 cm, 15\u201330 cm, 30\u201360 cm; 60\u2013100 cm. The results show that SVR models have a superior performance out of three tested models for all standardized depth layers. In general the local models outperform the whole-area models for all three tested models with respect to the accuracy of predictions. All models displayed area specific performances proving the importance of inclusion of prevailing local conditions in SOC modelling and mapping. Therefore, we introduce a moving window approach where a hybrid series of locally calibrated models and a whole-area calibrated model can be used against using one calibrated model for the modelling very large mapping extents. Moving window approach provides more accurate results having the lowest error compared to the whole-area model. Also it provides the least biased predictions. Therefore, this novel approach provides a promising way of increasing the efficiency and accuracy of digital soil mapping.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geodrs.2015.12.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma Regional", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2196593491", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["140667116", "132724701", "129365524", "128880230", "134531151", "128776899", "129934019", "84318357", "84539860", "129749977", "129099643", "14093930", "20020173", "13928679", "132862616", "106572610", "140675994", "129312459", "128997359", "32656801", "128610571", "128912231", "128760105", "12134662", "85934330", "129769934", "128988659", "130483591", "130119475", "205142520", "119597580", "129324729", "84854172", "128487442", "53375302", "1056674", "18110260", "15480929", "94277524", "129304014", "140704779", "58534172", "109598144", "18071645", "13509055", "130059289", "93402438"], "inbound_citations": ["55008117", "134349102", "7379476"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123965206"}

We apply a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) consisting of a land cover and a land use layer. In the land cover layer of the CRF, the nodes represent super-pixels; in the land use layer, the nodes correspond to objects from a geospatial database. Intra-layer edges of the CRF model spatial dependencies between neighbouring image sites. All spatially overlapping sites in both layers are connected by inter-layer edges, which leads to higher order cliques modelling the semantic relation between all land cover and land use sites in the clique. A generic formulation of the higher order potential is proposed. In order to enable efficient inference in the two-layer higher order CRF, we propose an iterative inference procedure in which the two classification tasks mutually influence each other. We integrate contextual relations between land cover and land use in the classification process by using contextual features describing the complex dependencies of all nodes in a higher order clique. These features are incorporated in a discriminative classifier, which approximates the higher order potentials during the inference procedure. The approach is designed for input data based on aerial images. Experiments are carried out on two test sites to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experiments show that the classification results are improved compared to the results of a non-contextual classifier. For land cover classification, the result is much more homogeneous and the delineation of land cover segments is improved. For the land use classification, an improvement is mainly achieved for land use objects showing non-typical characteristics or similarities to other land use classes. Furthermore, we have shown that the size of the super-pixels has an influence on the level of detail of the classification result, but also on the degree of smoothing induced by the segmentation method, which is especially beneficial for land cover classes covering large, homogeneous areas.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.04.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2621331406", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["133740521", "52117390", "197488479", "54939297", "54450715", "44131435", "9705204", "104293053", "127119944"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125445943"}

As a result of these variations, features describing the same person get transformed between cameras. To model the transformation of features, the feature space is nonlinearly warped to get the \u201cwarp functions\u201d. The warp functions between two instances of the same target form the set of feasible warp functions while those between instances of different targets form the set of infeasible warp functions. In this work, we build upon the observation that feature transformations between cameras lie in a nonlinear function space of all possible feature transformations. The space consisting of all the feasible and infeasible warp functions is the warp function space (WFS). We propose to learn a discriminating surface separating these two sets of warp functions in the WFS and to re-identify persons by classifying a test warp function as feasible or infeasible. Towards this objective, a Random Forest (RF) classifier is employed which effectively chooses the warp function components according to their importance in separating the feasible and the infeasible warp functions in the WFS.

However, both theories depend on ad hoc assumptions to exclude specific instances of these forms of compositionality (e.g. grammars, networks) that do not account for systematicity. By analogy with the Ptolemaic (i.e. geocentric) theory of planetary motion, although either theory can be made to be consistent with the data, both nonetheless fail to fully explain it. Category theory, a branch of mathematics, provides an alternative explanation based on the formal concept of adjunction, which relates a pair of structure-preserving maps, called functors. A functor generalizes the notion of a map between representational states to include a map between state transformations (or processes). In a formal sense, systematicity is a necessary consequence of a higher-order theory of cognitive architecture, in contrast to the first-order theories derived from Classicism or Connectionism. Category theory offers a re-conceptualization for cognitive science, analogous to the one that Copernicus provided for astronomy, where representational states are no longer the center of the cognitive universe\u2014replaced by the relationships between the maps that transform them.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2908697", "pubmed_id": "20661306", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000858", "venue": "PLoS Computational Biology", "journal": "PLoS Computational Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2009745850", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["117983612"], "inbound_citations": ["2813204", "211554211", "16608996", "41637033", "51908091", "15883603", "37526288", "13900169", "53995337", "17574827", "210131229", "209531706", "78090330", "11359108", "12655919", "208076999", "7763236", "983580", "7971442", "15530403", "10281493", "1831704", "2280695", "34031291", "195732459", "209370884", "16276525", "16448242"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10282577"}

Next, the model is tested against a different set of samples, obtaining an excellent agreement between the SVM model and MoM-LP simulations for all reflection coefficients, including the cross-coefficients. The surrogate model is then used for an efficient analysis of three reflectarrays with pencil beam for point-to-point communications, isoflux pattern for global Earth coverage, and a shaped beam for local multipoint distribution service application, showing excellent agreement in both copolar and crosspolar patterns between the SVM and MoM-LP simulations.

We introduce an auxiliary variable mu for each example in D a to reflect its mismatch with D p. Under an appropriate constraint the mus are estimated as a byproduct, along with the classifier.

This brief presents a sparse Bayesian approach for learning the output weights of ELM in classification.

In this paper, we describe a computational model of putative neural mechanisms that would produce this behaviour. These simula- tions highlight the role of transient attentional enhancement in mediating the temporal binding of features into working mem- ory. This model builds upon previous approaches, and explains a range of behavioural findings relating to the patterns of illu- sory conjunctions observed in experiments. Further, it pro- vides a parsimonious account of a counter-intuitive pattern of reaction time data. Keywords: Binding Problem, Temporal Feature Binding, Neural Modelling Introduction We generally see the world as containing coherent bound ob- jects. We might perceive the coincidence of the colour red and a rapidly moving form as a speeding red Ferrari. Such feature binding is effectively pre-conscious, and as such, we would not notice it as a task to be performed. However, the brain has to conjoin features in the environment in order that we can perceive bound objects. In other words, the brain has to solve the \u201cbinding problem\u201d. This refers to the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which feature binding is accom- plished (Treisman, 1996). In experiments that impede the fo- cusing of attention on specific visual objects, participants can be induced to produce errors in binding, generally referred to as conjunction errors. Under such circumstances, they often consciously perceive illusory conjunctions of visual features, which are defined as \u2018miscombination of features actually presented in a single display\u2019 (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Since the pioneering work by Treisman and Gelade, the vari- ous aspects of feature binding in space have been extensively explored in numerous experiments. Temporal Feature Binding Although largely unnoticed by us, the brain also has an impressive capacity to correctly bind features through time. For example, when we are driv- ing along a busy road, it does a good job of tracking a large number of moving objects. However, such dynamic visual environments also cause us to make occasional errors. These errors in temporal binding occur when a feature from one ob- ject is mistakenly bound to a temporally neighbouring ob- ject. The pattern of these errors is revealing of the means by which the brain binds through time. Temporal binding errors can be generated in experiments using rapidly presented se- quential stimuli, but have received relatively little theoretical attention. In response, this paper focuses on a theoretical ex- ploration of temporal feature binding in vision. In particular, we build upon previous research to propose the 2f-ST 2 model of temporal feature binding (see Figure 1a). This neural net- work model emphasises the role of transient attentional en- hancement as a mediator between two stages of visual infor- mation processing, enabling the binding of stimulus features into working memory (see Figure 1b). Experiments involving feature binding in time usually em- ploy the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm (see Figure 1b for an example), where a stream of stimuli is presented, with each rapidly replacing the previous one, at the rate of approximately 10/sec. The task-defining feature, present only in the target, is called the key feature. The feature of the target that is to be identified and reported is termed the response feature. For example, in Figure 1b, each RSVP trial consists of a stream of coloured letters, and participants are asked to detect the identity (the response feature) of the letter presented in red (the key feature). In such situations, mul- tiple stimuli may be simultaneously processed in the visual system, leading to the possibility of the formation of illusory conjunctions. In this context, the visual system has the task of solving the binding problem in time: it must pick out the features of targets amongst multiple, temporally overlapping features of distractors. This process is referred to as temporal feature binding. The BBS Model The BBS model (Botella, Barriopedro, & Suero, 2001) is currently the dominant account of temporal feature binding in vision, and indeed, it provides an accurate fit to available data. This model assumes that such binding occurs either through an attentional focusing (AF) route or through a sophisticated guessing (SG) route. These two bind- ing routes are additional to the two parallel pathways posited for processing key and response features. The AF route is taken when attention has enough time to correctly pick out the target\u2019s key and response features. SG, on the other hand, comes into play when there is temporal uncertainty about the target\u2019s response feature. Importantly, AF leads to a distinct (always correct) outcome, requiring a binding route function- ally different from that which produces conjunction errors. To justify this dual-route approach, the authors point to reaction time (RT) data from Botella (1992), which suggests that most", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1794945755", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["144543708", "28516529", "1957024", "141258113", "353246"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14277884"}

Pedestrian and cyclist collisions involving motor-vehicles result in high injury and fatality rates for these two modes. Data for pedestrian and cyclist activity at intersections such as volumes, speeds, and space-time trajectories are essential in the field of transportation in general, and road safety in particular. However, automated data collection for these two road user types remains a challenge. Due to the constant change of orientation and appearance of pedestrians and cyclists, detecting and tracking them using video sensors is a difficult task. This paper presents a method based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients to extract features of an image box containing the tracked object and Support Vector Machine to classify moving objects in crowded traffic scenes. Moving objects are classified into three categories: pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicles. The proposed methodology is composed of three steps: i) detecting and tracking each moving object in video data, ii) classifying each object according to its appearance in each frame, and iii) computing the probability of belonging to each class based on both object appearance and its speed. For the last step, Bayes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rule is used to fuse appearance and speed in order to predict the object category. Using various video datasets collected in different intersections, the methodology was developed and tested. The developed methodology shows an overall classification accuracy of more than 90 %.

In this scheme the maximum boundaries of a compliance controller and a force reflection gain guaranteeing stability and good task performance greatly depend upon characteristics of a slave arm, a master arm, and an environment. These characteristics, however, are generally unknown in teleoperation. It is, therefore, very difficult to determine such maximum boundary of the gain. The paper presented a novel method for design of an advanced bilateral controller. The factors affecting task performance and stability in the advanced bilateral controller were analyzed and a design guideline was presented. The neurofuzzy compliance model (NFCM)-based bilateral control proposed herein is an algorithm designed to automa ti- cally determine the suitable compliance for a given task or environment. The NFCM, composed of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and a rule -learning mechanism, is used as a compliance controller. The FLC generates compliant motions according to contact forces. The rule-learning mechanism, which is based upon the reinforcement learning algorithm, trains the rule-base of the FLC until the given task is done successfully. Since the scheme allows the use of large force reflection gain, it can assure good task performance. Moreover, the scheme does not require any priori knowledge on a slave arm dynamics, a slave arm controller and an environment, and thus, it can be easily applied to the control of any telerobot systems.

But applying pattern theory to real world images is currently less successful than discriminative methods such as deep networks. Deep networks, however, are black-boxes which are hard to interpret and can easily be fooled by adding occluding objects. It is natural to wonder whether by better understanding deep networks we can extract building blocks which can be used to develop pattern theoretic models. This motivates us to study the internal representations of a deep network using vehicle images from the PASCAL3D+ dataset. We use clustering algorithms to study the population activities of the features and extract a set of visual concepts which we show are visually tight and correspond to semantic parts of vehicles. To analyze this we annotate these vehicles by their semantic parts to create a new dataset, VehicleSemanticParts, and evaluate visual concepts as unsupervised part detectors. We show that visual concepts perform fairly well but are outperformed by supervised discriminative methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). We next give a more detailed analysis of visual concepts and how they relate to semantic parts. Following this, we use the visual concepts as building blocks for a simple pattern theoretical model, which we call compositional voting. In this model several visual concepts combine to detect semantic parts.

Evolution of travel demand models started from the early paper and pencil versions of conventional four-step models of the late 50s and proceeded to the activity-based models. During this transition the emphasis shifted from aggregate to disaggregate models, whereby researchers increasingly paid attention to individual decision making regarding daily activities. This alteration engendered a conspicuous disparity between aggregate and disaggregate models regarding their practicality, precision and policy sensitivity level. This disparity is the main attention of this paper. Unlike the four-step models, a highly disaggregate travel demand modelling structure is proposed in this paper in which trip purpose, mode of transport, time of day, commute distance and attributes of trip destination are modelled. Unlike activity-based models, the proposed method is computational efficient and cost effective making it attractive for small or medium size cities. Destination choice problem is decomposed from the framework by using the attributes of the destination rather than its actual location. All the decisions are modelled using Decision Tree (DT), a Modified version of Decision Tree (MDT), and Random Forest (RF). The model estimation practice is done using the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) of 2007 as the training set, and its transferability is examined by utilizing the 2009 year of the same dataset.

Many groups are exploring hardware architectures and theoretical ideas about spiking recurrent neural networks. The overarching goal is to exploit the low power promise of these neuromorphic systems. However, it is difficult to train spiking recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) to perform tasks and make efficient use of neuromorphic hardware. Reservoir Computing is an attractive methodology because it requires no tuning of weights for the reservoir itself. Yet, to find optimal reservoirs, manual tuning of hyperparameters such as hidden neurons, synaptic density, and natural structure is still required. Because of this, researchers often have to generate and evaluate many networks, which can result in non-trivial amounts of computation. This paper employs the reservoir computing technique (specifically liquid state machines) and genetic algorithms in order to develop useful networks that can be deployed on neuromorphic hardware. We build on past work in reservoir computing and genetic algorithms to demonstrate the power of combining these two techniques and the advantage it can provide over manually tuning reservoirs for use on classification tasks.

Aiming at the limitation of the regional POLY model, this paper proposes a new ionosphere modeling method with combining the support vector machine (SVM) regression model and the POLY model. Firstly, the POLY model is established using observations of regional continuously operating reference stations (CORS). Then the SVM regression model is trained to compensate the model error of POLY, and the TEC SVM-P model is obtained by the combination of the POLY and the SVM. The fitting accuracies of the models are verified with the root mean square errors (RMSEs) and static single-frequency precise point positioning (PPP) experiments. The results show that the RMSE of the SVM-P is 0.980 TECU (TEC unit), which produces an improvement of 17.3% compared with the POLY model (1.185 TECU). Using SVM-P models, the positioning accuracies of single-frequency PPP are improved over 40% compared with those using POLY models.

EIT measurement frames, taken from an electrode array placed on the head surface, are used to train and test linear SVM classifiers. Various scenarios are implemented on both platforms to examine the impact of variables such as noise level, lesion location, lesion size, variation in electrode positioning, and variation in anatomy, on the classifier performance. The classifier performed well in numerical models (sensitivity and specificity of 90%+) with signal-to-noise ratios of 60 dB+, was independent of lesion location, and could detect lesions reliably down to the tested minimum volume of 5 ml. Slight variations in electrode layout did not affect performance. Performance was affected by variations in anatomy however, emphasising the need for large training sets covering different anatomies. The phantom models proved more challenging, with maximal sensitivity and specificity of 75% when used with the linear SVM. Finally, the performance of two more complex classifiers is briefly examined and compared to the linear SVM classifier. These results demonstrate that a radial basis function (RBF) SVM classifier and a neural network classifier can improve detection accuracy. Classifiers applied to EIT measurement frames is a novel approach for lesion detection and may offer an effective diagnostic tool clinically.

Previous works have been using the low-rank latent feature subspace to capture the task relations, and some of them aim to learn the group based relational structure of tasks. However, in many cases, the low-rank subspace may not exist for the specific group of tasks, thus using this paradigm would not work. To discover the task relational structures, we propose a novel multi-task learning method using the structured sparsity-inducing norms to automatically uncover the relations of tasks. Instead of imposing the low-rank constraint, our new model uses a more meaningful assumption, in which the tasks from the same relational group should share the common feature subspace. We can discover the group relational structure of tasks and learn the shared feature subspace for each task group, which help to improve the predictive performance. Our proposed algorithm avoids the high computational complexity of integer programming, thus it converges very fast.

This limits the potential to both predict change in SOC stocks in temperate Australia and to identify where and how SOC stocks can be managed to mitigate climate change. Based on data from 707 sites, we examine variations in SOC concentrations and stocks across a range of natural temperate broadleaf forests in south-eastern Australia. Comparisons with current Australia-wide databases highlight previous under-estimation of forest SOC concentrations, leading to substantial underprediction of SOC stocks in the most productive forests (e.g. this study\u2019s mean of 207 Mg C ha\u22121 compared with a database mean estimate of 141 Mg C ha\u22121 for Tall open-forests to 30-cm soil depth). Random Forest models involving 27 environmental variables (representing climate, terrain, parent material, soil attributes, vegetation, and fire history) explained up to 79% of the variation in SOC concentrations and 77% of the variation in SOC stocks to 30-cm depth. Climate variables (precipitation, temperature) were of greatest importance to the prediction of both SOC concentrations and SOC stocks, tending to override the importance of terrain and fire-history variables at this study\u2019s regional scale. While patterns in SOC concentrations and stocks were correlated, SOC concentrations were not a reliable proxy for SOC stocks to 10-cm depth, reiterating the importance of mass equivalent measures (i.e. soil bulk density) to assessing changes in soil carbon storage. Our study provides a timely check of the model-based estimates of SOC concentrations and stocks in Australia\u2019s temperate forests that are currently available in nation-wide databases and improves the available information for defining benchmarks, and for identifying potential areas of SOC loss and gain, in programs that aim to mitigate climate change.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114246", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "3007801731", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214388203"}

Due to a combination of early successes, increased computational power and advanced, automated data collection methods, sports analytics has been a steadily growing area in the last decade. The discipline is no longer restricted to designing new statistics and building simple statistical models. Moreover, sports analytics has found its way in other professional sports as well. Many professional sports clubs have started hiring performance analysts whose main task is to analyze the large quantities of data that are being collected nowadays, including play-by-play data, video tracking data, and sensor readings. In hindsight, the success of sports analytics in baseball is not surprising. Baseball matches can easily be split into distinct events, which can be analyzed using simple statistical tools. However, more sophisticated techniques are needed to analyze more fluid sports such as basketball and soccer. In these sports, it is much harder to distinguish between events which are also not necessarily sequential and have more complex interrelations. In order to address this additional complexity and to deal with the large quantities of data that are available, we are applying machine learning and data mining techniques to this type of data. In terms of soccer, we are looking at predicting match outcomes using raw statistics and match ratings [1], predicting and preventing injuries using test results and workloads, automatically generating match reports from play-by-play data, and identifying players' playing styles in play-by- play data. In terms of basketball, we are looking at predicting match outcomes using raw statistics [2], identifying playing styles of both teams and players, and determining optimal player rotations using play-by-play data as any number of substitutions can be made during a basketball match.

Even though the features extracted from VGG19 are usually adopted in image recognition application; in this research, we apply these features to the prediction model to obtain rotation and translation parameters.

Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations. ::: ::: In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness. ::: ::: The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex\u00ae honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex\u00ae honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort. ::: ::: Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm. ::: ::: In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2962951945", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199582824"}

We implement here several improvements to overcome these difficulties. We use a Random Forest (RF) classifier for model selection to circumvent the curse of dimensionality and apply a binned representation of the multidimensional site frequency spectrum (mSFS) to address issues related to the simulation and summarization of large SNP data sets. We evaluate the performance of these improvements using simulation and find low overall error rates (~7%). We then apply the approach to data from Haplotrema vancouverense, a land snail endemic to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Fifteen demographic models were compared, and our results support a model of recent dispersal from coastal to inland rainforests. Our results demonstrate that binning is an effective strategy for the construction of a mSFS and imply that the statistical power of RF when applied to demographic model selection is at least comparable to traditional ABC algorithms.

Furthermore, online dialog policy learning with RL typically requires a large number of queries to users, suffering from sample efficiency problem. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning method to learn dialog rewards directly from dialog samples. Such rewards are further used to optimize the dialog policy with policy gradient based RL.

In this paper, we develop an incremental classification algorithm, Supervised Clustering for Classification with Feature Space Heterogeneity (SCCFSH), to address this problem. In our approach, supervised clustering is implemented to obtain a number of clusters such that samples in each cluster are from the same class. After the removal of outliers, relevance of features in each cluster is calculated based on their variations in this cluster. The feature relevance is incorporated into distance calculation for classification. The main advantage of SCCFSH lies in the fact that it is capable of solving a classification problem with feature space heterogeneity in an incremental way, which is favorable for online classification tasks with continuously changing data.

In contrast, machine learning models are derived to maximize prediction accuracy through mechanisms such as out-of-sample validation, non-linear structure, and automated covariate selection, albeit at the expense of interpretability and sound behavioral theory. We investigate how machine learning models can outperform discrete choice models for prediction of car ownership using transportation household survey data from Singapore.

The machine learning models are inferior to the discrete choice model when using discrete choice features. However, after engineering features more appropriate for machine learning they are superior.

We provide theoretical insight into this phenomenon via an analysis of the expectation of the logistic model weight updates by an SGD-based adversarial learning algorithm, where examples are drawn from a random binary data-generation process. We empirically demonstrate the feature-pruning effect on a synthetic dataset, some datasets from the UCI repository, and real-world large-scale advertising response-prediction data-sets from MediaMath. In several of the MediaMath datasets there are 10s of millions of data points, and on the order of 100,000 sparse categorical features, and adversarial learning often results in model-size reduction by a factor of 20 or higher, and yet the model performance on natural test data (measured by AUC) is comparable to (and sometimes even better than) that of the naturally trained model.

Then, OPML employs a closed-form solution to update the metric for new coming samples, which leads to a low space (i.e., O ( d )) and time (i.e., O ( d 2 )) complexity, where d is the feature dimensionality. In addition, an extension of OPML (namely COPML) is further proposed to enhance the robustness when in real case the first several samples come from the same class (i.e., cold start problem). In the experiments, we have systematically evaluated our methods (OPML and COPML) on three typical tasks, including UCI data classification, face verification, and abnormal event detection in videos, which aims to fully evaluate the proposed methods on different sample number, different feature dimensionalities and different feature extraction ways (i.e., hand-crafted and deeply-learned).

Logistic Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forests (RF) models were trained on a random two-thirds of sample plots combining both years, and defoliation predictions were validated on the remaining one-third of plots.

In Experiment 1 a levels-of-processing manipulation at study was found to affect free recall but not masked fragment completion, suggesting that repetition priming in the latter task is not the result of explicit memory processes. Subsequent experiments revealed that both masked and standard fragment completion are influenced by morphological priming and that, although this effect cannot be attributed to the orthographic and phonological similarity of morphologically related words, it does vary in magnitude as a function of orthographic similarity. These results are consistent with a connectionist account of morphological priming in which morphological effects arise from the activation dynamics of a connectionist network even though morphological relationships are not explicitly represented in this network.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1006/jmla.1996.2489", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Memory and Language", "mag_id": "2047633567", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17539426", "1850436", "51761937", "215426702", "17414799", "5612649", "4798610", "7130987", "6115936", "64928111", "144712848", "13121349", "212675872", "55525464", "21811292", "1835581", "16007015", "18114028", "6882725", "2340761", "9634314", "275603", "16894652", "17944057", "61098686", "18336330", "8200769", "144674580", "55117689", "11388702", "17865035", "18050571", "9313010", "201037399", "115136378", "16801217", "10948290", "14215259", "144369911", "18271713", "67821087", "43692529", "3251918", "36768213", "64643725", "9782856", "10260827", "145590037", "17251896", "5646989", "16774887", "91368", "6983209", "18657731", "31097188", "32884979", "146576768", "15052191", "145377904", "5764658", "60671619", "13680287", "2697813", "151144193", "13768450", "318439", "12063664"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144894381"}

The approach is able to consider arbitrary shape and appearance features in order to match laser scans. The model parameters are learned from labeled training data. Inference is performed efficiently using loopy belief propagation.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how \u201csequence package\u201d analysis, as a novel approach, can help to improve natural language understanding. Such an approach would go beyond the standard grammatical formalisms represented in most dialogue systems, to include context-dependent utterance sequences that are shaped by the unfolding talk. What is then comprised in a sequence package is a series of related turn construction units and turns that make up either single or multiple episodes of talk, and sometimes an entire conversation. The author examines help-related dialogue to show how reports of troubles that often appear ambiguous and vague can be better understood by looking at the sequential design of speakers' turn constructions. Subtle features found in troubles-related talk that are important, but often overlooked, may be identified by mapping out the sequence package arrangement of the talk. For example, a caller's need for vital empathic support, before he or she can be ready to receive help, might be hard to detect if the caller only provides hidden, and possibly contradictory, signs of emotional distress. Or a patient might be unclear and somewhat inconsistent when trying to describe his or her chief complaint in the course of a medical interview. Thus, an analysis of sequence packages can potentially uncover crucial information often buried in the talk.

Thus far, the vision community has focused on spatio-temporal approaches with fixed temporal convolution kernel depths. We introduce a new temporal layer that models variable temporal convolution kernel depths. We embed this new temporal layer in our proposed 3D CNN. We extend the DenseNet architecture - which normally is 2D - with 3D filters and pooling kernels. We name our proposed video convolutional network `Temporal 3D ConvNet'~(T3D) and its new temporal layer `Temporal Transition Layer'~(TTL). Our experiments show that T3D outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on the HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets. ::: The other issue in training 3D ConvNets is about training them from scratch with a huge labeled dataset to get a reasonable performance. So the knowledge learned in 2D ConvNets is completely ignored. Another contribution in this work is a simple and effective technique to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained 2D CNN to a randomly initialized 3D CNN for a stable weight initialization. This allows us to significantly reduce the number of training samples for 3D CNNs. Thus, by finetuning this network, we beat the performance of generic and recent methods in 3D CNNs, which were trained on large video datasets, e.g. Sports-1M, and finetuned on the target datasets, e.g. HMDB51/UCF101.

The problem is that such approaches typically encode each agent's policy separately. Such separation means that computational complexity explodes as the number of agents in the team increases, and also leads to the problem of reinvention: Skills that should be shared among agents must be rediscovered separately for each agent. To address this problem, this paper presents an alternative evolutionary approach to multiagent learning called multiagent HyperNEAT that encodes the team as a pattern of related policies rather than as a set of individual agents. To capture this pattern, a policy geometry is introduced to describe the relationship between each agent's policy and its canonical geometric position within the team. Because policy geometry can encode variations of a shared skill across all of the policies it represents, the problem of reinvention is avoided. Furthermore, because the policy geometry of a particular team can be sampled at any resolution, it acts as a heuristic for generating policies for teams of any size, producing a powerful new capability for multiagent learning. In this paper, multiagent HyperNEAT is tested in predator-prey and room-clearing domains. In both domains the results are effective teams that can be successfully scaled to larger team sizes without any further training.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1838206.1838303", "venue": "AAMAS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2130792561", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10861040", "14906701", "11866341", "3247164", "5943662", "871178", "17566887", "11507017", "10030620", "2200122", "60742600", "16811386", "15437475", "7671810", "19706", "27062291", "14262564", "1588520", "2818161", "7335456", "498161", "2124332"], "inbound_citations": ["11426009", "14621469", "16058342", "7330654", "7633531", "18800251", "18800251", "210999218", "9942722", "58676181", "53303313", "32247677", "9694598", "204009131", "28214623", "54025867", "26523660", "10308013", "13962651", "15186707", "10200561", "14724092", "3008628", "1442181", "31848510", "54441700", "57376559", "1194712", "14098526", "214595337", "8887578", "35810502", "6536428", "23380103", "7332484", "14980525", "14633319"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3083498"}

Looking at the different subset of features created by the ranking algorithm shows how different words influence the prediction and helps to gain insight into the classification. It is shown that the data preparation improves both the precision and recall of the classification.

The majority of the left-right structured phonetic compounds have the semantic radical on the left and the phonetic radical on the right \u2013 SP characters. The opposite arrangement also exists, in which the phonetic radical appears on the left and the semantic radical on the right \u2013 PS characters (Figure 1). The ratio of SP and PS character types in Chinese lexicon is about nine to one. They have correspondingly different internal information profiles. From an entropy analysis, there is greater entropy on the right side of the SP characters, reflecting greater variability of the phonetic radicals on the right as opposed to the semantic radicals on the left. In contrast, there is greater entropy on the left side of the PS characters, where the phonetic radicals appear. The distinction between the SP and PS characters provides important opportunities to examine hemispheric processing in language, given the very different information contained in the two halves of the character, interacting with the split fovea, which we discuss below. Abstract The split fovea model, which reflects some aspects of the anatomy of the visual pathways, has successfully addressed several phenomena in visual word recognition (e.g., Shillcock, Ellison & Monaghan, 2000). However, it is still unclear what qualitative processing differences exist between a split architecture and a non-split counterpart. In the current study, we compare the performance of split and non-split architectures in modelling Chinese character pronunciation and show that Chinese left-right structured phonetic compounds create a unique opportunity for understanding the qualitative processing differences between the two possible versions of cognitive architectures. Keywords: Connectionist modelling; Chinese character pronunciation; foveal splitting. Introduction In Chinese orthography, characters are the smallest units of the orthography. There exists a dominant type of Chinese characters, phonetic compounds, in which a semantic radical signifies the meaning of the character and a phonetic radical potentially informs the pronunciation of the character. Phonetic compounds comprise about 81% of the 7,000 frequent characters in the Chinese dictionary (Li & Kang, The phonetic compounds have different relationships with their phonetic radical. For current purposes, regular characters are referred to as the characters that have the same pronunciation and tone as their phonetic radical; semiregular characters have the same pronunciation as their phonetic radical, but with a different tone; irregular characters have different pronunciations from their phonetic radical. In the Chinese lexicon, about half of the phonetic compounds are irregular, the other half are either regular or semiregular (Hsiao & Shillcock, submitted(a); unless otherwise stated, all Chinese language statistics cited here are from this paper). A regularity effect has been reported in Chinese phonetic compound recognition: regular characters are named faster than irregular characters. There is also an interaction between character frequency and regularity in Chinese, as in English (see, e.g., Hue, 1992; Liu, Wu & Chou, 1996; Seidenberg, 1985). The regularity effect and its interaction with frequency have been commonly used to examine cognitive plausibility of computational models (see, e.g., Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, About two-thirds of phonetic compounds have a left-right structure. This left-right structure is the most tractable SP character PS Character Figure 1. An SP and a PS character The fovea is the part of the retina across which a fixated word is projected. It is responsible for fine-grain, focal visual processing. From anatomical and behavioural studies, it has become increasingly clear that the human fovea is precisely vertically split (see, e.g., Frendrich & Gazzaniga, 1989; Gray, Galetta, Siegal, & Schatz, 1997). This fact has fundamentally important implications for visual word recognition (Shillcock et al., 2000): when a word is fixated, the left part of the word is initially projected to the right hemisphere (RH) and the right part to the left hemisphere (LH). Thus, visual word recognition can be reconceptualised in terms of coordinating the information in the two hemispheres. The splitting is sufficiently precise that a single Chinese character, under normal reading conditions, is split precisely at the fixation point, with the semantic and phonetic radicals projected contralaterally to the two hemispheres (Hsiao, Shillcock, & Lavidor, submitted). The split fovea model of English word reading has successfully captured several reading phenomena (see. e.g.,", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2767644809", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["144036528", "4643694", "2411995", "4942234", "4948213", "1590696", "140461655", "39477876", "557347", "62245742", "13539926", "22218635", "1597106", "15757187", "210443860"], "inbound_citations": ["25560311", "18107787", "13003505", "1333415", "56084894", "4948213", "2464783", "38121436", "15822101"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6442205"}

In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of Extreme Learning Machines - the Annular ELM, with RANSAC multi model response regularization for pruning large number of hidden nodes to acquire better optimality, generalization and classification accuracy. Experimental evaluation of the proposed ELM formulation on different benchmark datasets showed that the algorithm optimally prunes the hidden nodes, with better generalization and higher classification accuracy as compared to other algorithms, including the well-known SVM, OP-ELM for binary and multi-class classification and regression problems.

The system was tested by using two datasets collected from mobile phones during social events gathering. Results show that mobile data can be used to detect anomalies in crowds as an alternative to video sensors with significant performances. Our approach is the first to detect any unusual behaviour in crowd with non-visual data, which is simple to train and easy to deploy.

The presence of clusters of promiscuous T-cell epitopes, immunological hotspots, has been observed in several antigens. These clusters may be exploited to facilitate the development of epitope-based vaccines by selecting a small number of hotspots that can elicit all of the required T-cell activation functions. Given the large size of pathogen proteomes, including of variant strains, computational tools are necessary for automated screening and selection of immunological hotspots. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Hotspot Hunter is a web-based computational system for large-scale screening and selection of candidate immunological hotspots in pathogen proteomes through analysis of antigenic diversity. It allows screening and selection of hotspots specific to four common HLA supertypes, namely HLA class I A2, A3, B7 and class II DR. The system uses Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine methods as predictive engines. Soft computing principles were employed to integrate the prediction results produced by both methods for robust prediction performance. Experimental validation of the predictions showed that Hotspot Hunter can successfully identify majority of the real hotspots. Users can predict hotspots from a single protein sequence, or from a set of aligned protein sequences representing pathogen proteome. The latter feature provides a global view of the localizations of the hotspots in the proteome set, enabling analysis of antigenic diversity and shift of hotspots across protein variants. The system also allows the integration of prediction results of the four supertypes for identification of hotspots common across multiple supertypes. The target selection feature of the system shortlists candidate peptide hotspots for the formulation of an epitope-based vaccine that could be effective against multiple variants of the pathogen and applicable to a large proportion of the human population. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Hotspot Hunter is publicly accessible at http://antigen.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/hh/.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a powerful class of generative models, and can generate realistic scenarios for renewable power sources without the need for any modeling assumptions. However, the performance of GANs in generating scenarios can further be improved by modifying the way in which a Lipschitz constraint on discriminator network is imposed. Another critical problem of applying deep neural networks is overfitting, a phenomenon especially prone to appear on small training sets. In this paper, we propose an improved GAN for the generation of wind power scenarios. To improve the training speed, we use a gradient penalty term to enforce the Lipschitz constraint based on the output and input of the discriminator network.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose the MCPL-based FT-LSTM, a clinical event prediction method based on medical concept representation learning. On one hand, inspired by FASTTEXT, we have developed an interpretative vector representation of medical events in EMRs, which enables us to capture the medical concept information effectively so that the patient's clinical data can be represented more reasonably. On the other hand, we propose a novel time-controlled long short-term memory (LSTM) prediction model, which adds time-control units to the original LSTM model. The model can describe the variable time intervals in EMRs, better capture long-term, and short-term information, and eliminate the strong dependence of clinical data on timestamps; thus, improving the model's prediction performance for clinical events.

When compared to results obtained with alternative dimensionality reduction techniques, objective and subjective assessments show that the probabilistic latent representations learned with CVAEs produce bandwidth-extended speech signals of notably better quality.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683611", "venue": "ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2935953376", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52290928", "27618530", "35408359", "14920851", "764648", "18147513", "43327285", "2132441", "44056001", "1544774", "23803287", "11298697", "52290478", "52188406", "7577075", "9922401", "372711", "2697097", "4677131", "52186871", "4387934", "52189551", "10510670", "60884624", "6628106", "13740328", "5808102", "124419055"], "inbound_citations": ["213187674", "211547194"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:96450459"}

In this paper, Teager Mel, a novel speech emotion feature is proposed based on Teager Energy Operator (TEO) and the Mel perception characteristics. Due to such advantages as nonlinear and simple, TEO appears to be appropriate for speech emotion description. From the auditory psychophysical point of view, Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP) features are also investigated as an extension to Teager Mel. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is then adopted to the fusion of Teager Mel and PLP features on a Chinese discrete emotional speech corpus (Dis-EC) that includes four emotions: happiness, anger, sorrow and surprise. Comparing with the previous studies based on prosodic features, the application of Teager Mel features can achieve a recognition accuracy improvement of 10.4%, and similarly 8.2% for PLP features. The recognition accuracy reaches79.7% while using the fusion features, which appears to be the most attractive in relative researches.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IMCCC.2015.239", "venue": "2015 Fifth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)", "journal": "2015 Fifth International Conference on Instrumentation and Measurement, Computer, Communication and Control (IMCCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2290415529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16019647", "12710581", "11150939", "14083190", "12749548", "29011535", "16193329", "53855225", "206031547", "8099816", "56503610", "9049364", "15733415", "15052804", "961425", "63443275"], "inbound_citations": ["3447684", "44709559"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35285611"}

One of the critical tasks in accomplishing this is to predict power consumption accurately, which usually requires considering diverse factors, including environmental, social, and spatial-temporal factors. Depending on the prediction scope, building type can also be an important factor since the same types of buildings show similar power consumption patterns. A university campus usually consists of several building types, including a laboratory, administrative office, lecture room, and dormitory. Depending on the temporal and external conditions, they tend to show a wide variation in the electrical load pattern. This paper proposes a hybrid short-term load forecast model for an educational building complex by using random forest and multilayer perceptron. To construct this model, we collect electrical load data of six years from a university campus and split them into training, validation, and test sets. For the training set, we classify the data using a decision tree with input parameters including date, day of the week, holiday, and academic year. In addition, we consider various configurations for random forest and multilayer perceptron and evaluate their prediction performance using the validation set to determine the optimal configuration. Then, we construct a hybrid short-term load forecast model by combining the two models and predict the daily electrical load for the test set. Through various experiments, we show that our hybrid forecast model performs better than other popular single forecast models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en11123283", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "mag_id": "2902285311", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204901622", "204077115", "182326761", "109929448", "204826680", "198475641"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117191780"}

In this study bio-window of coconut plantation was identified using NDVI images of two dates. It was observed that interclass variations were more prominent in February image. Forest, dense and moderately dense coconut plantations have significantly different NDVI values in February image whereas in December image all three features have similar values. Hence, February image was classified using three classification methods i.e. ISODATA, maximum likelihood and random forest classification to assess which method is better to distinguish coconut plantation from other classes. Random Forest classification technique was found to be more accurate in identifying coconut plantation. Area was also estimated for Kozhikode district and compared with the government statistics.

This paper presents such a technique using a distortion-free graph embedding, reformulating the problem as that of finding errortolerant point matching in the geometric space. The embedding works by finding the distance between every node pair. In order to properly perform the embedding for object recognition in which graph nodes represent image features and graph edges show the relations between the features, we first use a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, which obtains similar sets of features from images taken from close view points. Given a set of such features, we then perform their consistent ordering based on the local histogram around each feature.

The proposed GSDA-LSVM framework is used as an alternative to the Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM) approach, which despite its excellent classification accuracy requires significant computational resources for learning the events (i.e., for identifying the kernel parameters and KSVM penalty term) in large-scale video collections. In contrary, using the GSDA-LSVM approach the SVM penalty term can be rapidly identified in the lower dimensional subspace. Moreover, an additional speed up in deriving this lower-dimensional space is achieved by using the proposed GSDA method instead of conventional nonlinear subclass DA methods such as KSDA or KMSDA. This is made possible by GSDA exploiting the special structure of the inter-between-subclass scatter matrix to reformulate the original KSDA eigenvalue problem to one involving matrices of much smaller dimension.

Connectionism, or \u201cparallel distributed processing,\u201d as it is sometimes called, is a much more general thesis about the mind. Central to this thesis are the following claims: the mind is a huge structure of simple units linked together in a uniform, largely parallel network; units interact by exciting or inhibiting activity in one another; information processing takes place through the interactions between units; mental representations are typically patterns of activation involving many units.1 On the face of it, then, pictorialism and connectionism have little in common. Under the surface, however, there are certain similarities. Both views introduce concepts of representation which are not easy to grasp. Both views, although couched in information processing terms, have a definite physiological flavor. Admittedly, in the case of pictorialism, this flavor is not immediately discernible. But, it comes to the fore, as we shall see later, once the pictorialist thesis is fully stated.

For flood vulnerability assessment, the map and characteristics of elements-at-risk at different scales are strongly required depending on the risk and vulnerability assessment requirements. This study proposes a methodology to classify urban structure type by combining object-based image classification and different high resolution remote sensing data. In this study, a high resolution satellite image and LiDAR have been acquired over Kota Bharu, Kelantan which consists of highly heterogeneous urban structure type (UST) classes. The first stage is data pre-processing that includes orthorectification and pansharpening of Geoeye satellite image, image resampling for normalised Digital Surface Model (nDSM) and followed by image segmentation for creating meaningful objects. The second stage comprises of derivation of image features, generation of training and testing datasets, and classification of UST. The classification was based on three types of machine learning classifiers, i.e. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The results obtained from the classification processes were compared using individual omission and commission error, overcall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The results show that Random Forest classifier with all image features achieved the highest overall accuracy (93.5%) and Kappa coefficient (0.94). This is followed by CART classifier with overall accuracy of 93.7% and Kappa coefficient of 0.92. Finally, SVM classifier produced the lowest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient with 88.6% and 0.86, respectively.

Material and Methods: CBCT images of 66 patients (132 joints) with TMD and 66 normal cases (132 joints) were collected and 2 coronal cut prepared from each condyle, although images were limited to head of mandibular condyle. In order to extract features of images, first we use LBP and then histogram of oriented gradients. To reduce dimensionality, the linear algebra Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied to the feature vectors matrix of all images. For evaluation, we used K nearest neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayesian and Random Forest classifiers. We used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) to evaluate the hypothesis. Results: K nearest neighbor classifier achieves a very good accuracy (0.9242), moreover, it has desirable sensitivity (0.9470) and specificity (0.9015) results, when other classifiers have lower accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: We proposed a fully automatic approach to detect TMD using image processing techniques based on local binary patterns and feature extraction.

The main reason is that these algorithms are unable to adapt to the latest data accordingly when the distribution of the data stream changes. To mitigate this limitation, the forgetting factor is introduced into the relevant models, which is used to balance the relative importance of past data and new data when necessary. However, there is no efficient way to set the forgetting factor properly so far. In this paper, we have developed a novel updating strategy for setting the forgetting factor and proposed a dynamic forgetting factor based OS-ELM algorithm (DOS-ELM). In the sequential learning phase of DOS-ELM, the forgetting factor can be adjusted dynamically according to the change degree of the model accuracy in each learning epoch. This updating process does not require setting any parameters artificially and thus greatly improves the flexibility of the model. The experimental results on ten classification problems, five regression problems, one time-series problem show that DOS-ELM can deal well with both stationary and non-stationary data stream problems. In addition, we have extended DOS-ELM to an online deep model named ML-DOS-ELM, which can handle more complex tasks such as the face recognition problem and the handwritten digit recognition problem. Our experimental evaluations show that both DOS-ELM and ML-DOS-ELM can achieve higher prediction accuracy compared to the other similar algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2959032", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2995117712", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["118517", "881524", "9036821", "206634205", "10147945", "7028394", "26071844", "33342809", "207114430", "14160740", "8310720", "14644827", "24720334", "207103177", "34684840", "122539757", "46093484", "36974103", "63894699", "15589402", "206401842", "61610957", "23155638", "142407341", "25890860", "206757279", "209099422", "11868540", "14005036", "18892280", "42039623", "141914838", "17804904", "28301202", "127812469", "8285596", "125198828", "206919556", "123250444", "24964864", "14220380", "14542261", "3520224", "27810521", "5463828", "51612189", "149854245"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209458357"}

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regression without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regression on images re-synthesized from real human motion capture data.

In this paper, we proposed a novel ensemble method for learning from crowds. Our proposed method is a meta-learning scheme. It first uses a bootstrapping process to create $M$M sub-datasets from an original crowdsourced labeled dataset.

A base classifier is then trained from this extended sub-dataset. Finally, unlabeled instances are predicted by aggregating the outputs of these $M$M base classifiers.

It is crucial to identify breast cancer-related genes that could provide new biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis and potential treatment goals. In the development of our new high-risk breast cancer prediction model, seven raw gene expression datasets from the NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) database ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE31519\",\"term_id\":\"31519\"}}GSE31519, {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE9574\",\"term_id\":\"9574\"}}GSE9574, {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE20194\",\"term_id\":\"20194\"}}GSE20194, {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE20271\",\"term_id\":\"20271\"}}GSE20271, {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE32646\",\"term_id\":\"32646\"}}GSE32646, {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE45255\",\"term_id\":\"45255\"}}GSE45255, and {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE15852\",\"term_id\":\"15852\"}}GSE15852) were used. Using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method, we selected significant genes. Then, we mapped transcripts of the genes on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network from the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database, as well as traced the shortest path between each pair of proteins. Genes with higher betweenness values were selected from the shortest path proteins. In order to ensure validity and precision, a permutation test was performed. We randomly selected 248 proteins from the PPI network for shortest path tracing and repeated the procedure 100 times. We also removed genes that appeared more frequently in randomized results. As a result, 54 genes were selected as potential TNBC-related genes. Using 14 out the 54 genes, which are potential TNBC associated genes, as input features into a support vector machine (SVM), a novel model was trained to predict high-risk breast cancer. The prediction accuracy of normal tissues and TNBC tissues reached 95.394%, and the predictions of Stage II and Stage III TNBC reached 86.598%, indicating that such genes play important roles in distinguishing breast cancers, and that the method could be promising in practical use. According to reports, some of the 54 genes we identified from the PPI network are associated with breast cancer in the literature. Several other genes have not yet been reported but have functional resemblance with known cancer genes. These may be novel breast cancer-related genes and need further experimental validation. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to appraise the 54 genes.

Enforcing quality-of-service in such cellular network is challenging, as radio phenomena, as well as user (and their devices) mobility and dynamics, are uncontrolled. To solve this issue, estimating what the quality of transmissions will be in a short future for a connected user is essential. For that purpose, we argue that lower layer metrics are a key feature whose evolution can help predict the bandwidth that the considered connections can take advantage of in the following hundreds of milliseconds. The paper then describes how a 4G testbed has been deployed in order to investigate throughput prediction in uplink transmissions at a small time granularity of 100 ms. Based on lower layer metrics (physical and mac layers), the main supervised machine learning algorithms are used, such as Linear Regressor and Random Forest to predict the uplink received bandwidth in different radio phenomena environment. Hence, a deep investigation of the impact of radio issues on bandwidth prediction is conducted.

Within this context, one of the most latent applications is the monitoring of natural disasters. Vital information posted by OSN users can contribute to relief efforts during and after a catastrophe. Although it is possible to retrieve data from OSNs using embedded geographic information provided by GPS systems, this feature is disabled by default in most cases. An alternative solution is to geoparse specific locations using language models based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques. In this work, a sensor that uses Twitter is proposed to monitor natural disasters. The approach is intended to sense data by detecting toponyms (named places written within the text) in tweets with event-related information, e.g., a collapsed building on a specific avenue or the location at which a person was last seen. The proposed approach is carried out by transforming tokenized tweets into word embeddings: a rich linguistic and contextual vector representation of textual corpora. Pre-labeled word embeddings are employed to train a Recurrent Neural Network variant, known as a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (biLSTM) network, that is capable of dealing with sequential data by analyzing information in both directions of a word (past and future entries).

This will make it possible to relate broad-scale patterns to fine-scale processes and vice versa. In this study, we used class level landscape metrics calculated at multiple scales to fit scaling functions that were used to downscale metrics at higher resolutions. The main objectives were to assess the performance of different type of functions (i.e. power, logarithmic, etc.) to downscale metrics at the subpixel level and to analyze the variability of the accuracy of subpixel estimates among patch classes for each landscape metric. We used thirteen frequently used landscape metrics, computed on a land use/land cover map derived from Landsat imagery through visual interpretation and supervised classification using Support Vector Machines. The performance of scaling functions was assessed with the Accuracy Improvement percentage (AI). In general, the power function fitted better for most landscape metrics and classes; however, in several cases, more than one type of function showed similar R 2 values. Accuracy of subpixel estimates was very variable among landscape metrics and also among patch classes within a metric. The amount of variation was such that no generalization about the predictability of a landscape metric calculated at the class level was possible. Indeed, predictability seemed to be more of a characteristic of the class than a characteristic of the landscape metric. Additionally, the goodness of fit of the scaling functions was not a good indicator of the functions' ability to downscale landscape metrics accurately, indicating that different scaling functions should be analyzed when downscaling landscape metrics at higher resolutions is required.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.02.004", "venue": "Ecol.

However, it is often the case that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain adaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a data-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In general, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is a powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to another using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However, the conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may be overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training data. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via an external task specific model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a low-resource setting in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high resource unsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our approach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN to MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain. Moreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still outperforms many high-resource unsupervised models.

Deep learning is the subfield of machine learning studying algorithms and models constituted by several layers of functions learning in an increasingly level of abstraction the representation of a concept. \u201cOn graphs\u201d refers to the application of this class of methodologies to data that are inherently represented as a graph structure, requiring ad hoc strategies and theoretical machinery to perform tasks of various nature over them. In particular, this work studies, from a compilative point of view, a relatively recent model of deep learning called Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs are constituted by two neural networks, the most common form of deep learning, trying to beat each other in an optimization problem, in which one network, the generator, tries to deceive the other, the discriminator, producing examples that look similar to those belonging to a dataset of interest. At the end of the training of the networks, the generator should have learned the probability distribution of the dataset, allowing the algorithm to produce new, never seen, realistic examples. The first two chapters of this thesis are devoted to the description of these concepts and to the study of the best strategies allowing a smooth learning process. In the following two chapters, various architectures are described, referring to specific domains of application of GANs, with the main focus over the problems that arise when the previously explored concepts are applied to graph structured data, studying which are the currently available solutions in the literature.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2942850153", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155838924"}

For telecom operators, how to acquire and retain users is a significant and practical task. Note that telecom operators only have their own customer profiles. For the users from other telecom operators, their information is sparse. Thus, given a set of communication logs, the main theme of our work is to identify the potential users who will possibly join the target services in the near future. Since only a limited amount of information is available, one challenging issue is how to extract features from the communication logs. In this article, we propose a Communication-Based Feature Generation (CBFG) framework that extracts features and builds models to infer the potential users. Explicitly, we construct a heterogeneous information network from the communication logs of users. Then, we extract the explicit features, which refer to those calling features of users, from the potential users\u2019 interaction behaviors in the heterogeneous information network. Moreover, from the calling behaviors of users, one could extract the possible community structures of users. Based on the community structures, we further extract the implicit features of users. In light of both explicit and implicit features, we propose an information-gain-based method to select the effective features. According to the features selected, we utilize three popular classifiers (i.e., AdaBoost, Random Forest, and SVM) to build models to target the potential users. In addition, we have designed a sampling approach to extract training data for classifiers. To evaluate our methods, we have conducted experiments on a real dataset.

In large state spaces, however, training can be expensive, because it often requires many iterations of forward-backward. Beam search is a standard heuristic for controlling complexity during Viterbi decoding, but during forward-backward, standard beam heuristics can be dangerous, as they can make training unstable. We introduce sparse forward-backward, a variational perspective on beam methods that uses an approximating mixture of Kronecker delta functions. This motivates a novel minimum-divergence beam criterion based on minimizing KL divergence between the respective marginal distributions. Our beam selection approach is not only more efficient for Viterbi decoding, but also more stable within sparse forward-backward training.

Specifically, the structure of the software library ought to reflect the functional similarity of the stored software components in order to facilitate the retrieval process. We propose the application of artificial neural network technology to achieve such a structured library. In more detail, we rely on full-text indexing of the software manual in order to obtain the software representation. This software representation is further used as the input data during the training process of an artificial neural network adhering to the unsupervised learning paradigm. The distinctive feature of this very model is to make the semantic relationship between the stored software components geographically explicit. Thus, the actual user of the software library gets a notion of the semantic relationship between the components in terms of their geographical closeness.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proc Australasian Database Conf", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1543176425", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10602028", "60677509", "209399561", "17689128", "206775459", "198168767", "62155475", "13317307", "6420629", "60659881", "60453147", "11204383", "39964237", "109479097", "53772677", "10189623", "32234811", "1934568", "10833691"], "inbound_citations": ["2175784", "15218899", "18634921", "17138517", "10663144", "17269215", "16278093", "10188869", "16373171", "7034620", "18919768", "38437910", "18899288"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10808843"}

The structures and the properties of the two networks are detailed in this paper. Based on the integrated outputs, the features of distance distribution histograms and outline moments are extracted and fused to form the mixed features. Finally, gestures are classified by the multi-class Support Vector Machine.

A new definition of the posterior probability of a bag, based on the Lp-norm, improves the ability to deal with varying bag sizes over existing formulations.

ABSTRACT Text categorization \u2013 the assignment of natural language texts to one or more predefined categories based on their content \u2013 is an important component in many information organization and management tasks. We compare the effectiveness of five different automatic learning algorithms for text categorization in terms of learning speed, realtime classification speed, and classification accuracy. We also examine training set size, and alternative document representations. Very accurate text classifiers can be learned automatically from training examples. Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are particularly promising because they are very accurate, quick to train, and quick to evaluate. 1.1", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/288627.288651", "venue": "CIKM '98", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2170654002", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18461216", "14179936", "18123463", "9079593", "5978281", "14948357", "201833907", "15273230", "14788111", "38543065", "8295545", "18175609", "18990883", "8536512", "59317017", "18572171", "55958481", "7305901", "15519506", "10886891", "7120895", "4862083", "7861626", "2844383", "9547996", "43384314", "12200242", "15087179", "6695393", "5147713", "13528609", "17849587", "13462726", "18519325", "2006014", "207753020", "5923748", "67689605", "733999", "15741832", "16221853", "55445873", "62612081", "15084682", "6418815", "15005042", "14239522", "18657435", "14025939", "9544848", "18343121", "63116023", "46937542", "527605", "16321676", "27323247", "13684595", "8408873", "15730306", "15680339", "49192593", "14245095", "5404252", "14972283", "198959320", "14772847", "2678697", "15356855", "1322080", "15202204", "9411032", "209525446", "8977393", "60860751", "7582119", "5754740", "18234139", "4097405", "19252549", "721970", "14236731", "15192367", "1145062", "2226709", "23689185", "2386267", "12471299", "15956470", "28116876", "11978001", "7630344", "52940794", "38247422", "55946255", "8409664", "794477", "97681", "1292665", "10259562", "22615430", "18918470", "16635755", "73449", "67789476", "17717653", "8189944", "17319402", "15046270", "202700656", "991213", "14053903", "18675662", "29947795", "53745664", "14359883", "8914792", "11894967", "15829630", "4362907", "6805206", "24164941", "14349439", "2004867", "9636564", "60455", "7017463", "4899009", "2981934", "207646819", "26567247", "2954649", "40339683", "203688135", "17663713", "59466624", "6367729", "14464418", "14328840", "17925700", "143427653", "14275876", "5933622", "5084004", "58708650", "18107707", "39874121", "36841368", "43863516", "12977892", "125784569", "5132142", "17110635", "37547604", "7094838", "15732533", "17109741", "3677163", "7323448", "7444204", "38774304", "16951680", "6425449", "190724", "61502186", "211210893", "2765644", "52983770", "5568986", "394949", "808323", "207170363", "14796886", "16902615", "17853318", "1194024", "42621358", "5326963", "32838318", "15794465", "15709610", "13632938", "7231644", "2018851", "14169060", "17753475", "42993930", "210932490", "2968704", "7097161", "51798331", "15144406", "14723350", "1454481", "15472592", "15348179", "43031021", "14285533", "17758198", "87780", "1841906", "16836019", "182233907", "18273833", "16651384", "15312643", "8211043", "6736144", "13827293", "1729701", "8539222", "63789125", "11469818", "9558476", "17187346", "3115395", "9854397", "8014699", "206526925", "206419525", "3894491", "12863492", "14009021", "223100", "59316940", "54110472", "15464845", "14243822", "2466834", "18464314", "173989373", "9637532", "18687003", "17588631", "17316865", "2890660", "34751001", "16812143", "6470827", "14980372", "209456417", "16968848", "57189441", "673232", "5826141", "53782224", "1434844", "7279721", "207099548", "14471456", "14471456", "1465328", "6350669", "55364515", "2775831", "15634337", "1427386", "13962178", "16853095", "214596540", "13066753", "54708615", "13667267", "16560913", "16715686", "2039009", "278016", "3142786", "59490", "59819913", "9023584", "9149966", "414203", "17312738", "2997650", "7322085", "2101005", "73918713", "14353019", "15924696", "2198152", "332011", "6540537", "14752976", "18272867", "6235433", "10882538", "18317914", "9701328", "17036663", "5894989", "18403295", "10010959", "16578856", "196180017", "18146557", "27579194", "45642001", "59473115", "18097789", "17149892", "17286079", "2265211", "56463712", "15465644", "155107083", "17462140", "17637671", "16189411", "1573317", "8069417", "15935709", "4467142", "16144036", "18763212"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:617436"}

Challenges with gradient estimation, optimization instability, and mode collapse have lead practitioners to resort to maximum likelihood pre-training, followed by small amounts of adversarial fine-tuning. The benefits of GAN fine-tuning for language generation are unclear, as the resulting models produce comparable or worse samples than traditional language models. We show it is in fact possible to train a language GAN from scratch --- without maximum likelihood pre-training.

The aim of this study was to characterize the temporal dynamics in Mediterranean pines and evaluate the potential of LSP for species discrimination. We used 661 mono-specific plots for five different Pinus species (Pinus halepensis, P. pinea, P. pinaster; P. sylvestris, P. nigra) and the MOD13Q1-NDVI time series (2000\u20132016) to perform the analyses. The time series were smoothed to extract the phenological parameters and calculate multi-temporal metrics, to synthesize the inter-annual variability. The potential of LSP for discriminating between Pinus species was evaluated by the application of the Random Forest (RF) classifier from different subsets of explanatory variables: i) the smooth time series; ii) the multi-temporal metrics; and iii) the multi-temporal metrics plus the auxiliary physical variables. This latter subset was also used as input to a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm to better explain the differences between Pinus species regarding LSP parameters and other environmental drivers. The analysis showed two different patterns: an important NDVI decrease during the summer for P. halepensis, P. pinea, and P. pinaster; and lower NDVI variation along the year for P. sylvestris. P. nigra showed a heterogeneous intra-specific behavior, having locations with different patterns. We distinguished Pinus species plots with a global accuracy of 0.82, when we used multi-temporal metrics of LSP and auxiliary physical variables. More generally, the Mediterranean Pinus species could be differentiated considering the 23rd of July as the start of season and 179 km and 1100 m as distance to the coastline and elevation, respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2018.11.003", "venue": "Int.

In the context of rapid urbanization, accurate assessment of urban expansion has become increasingly important for urban sustainable development, and smart growth theory has been put forward to avoid urban sprawl. Previous studies about urban expansion simulation focused only on ecological constrain which prevent urban growth from developing in specific regions. However, government decision-making and urban planning greatly influence urban development and limit the disorderly expansion of the urban. In this paper, we consider planning policies into urban simulation and uses the ecological protection red line, farmland protection red line and cultural protection control line as limiting factors for future urban simulation. Choosing Shanghai as the study area, we integrated Random Forests Algorithm (RFA), Markov chain and Cellular Automata (CA) to simulate urban expansion in 2015, and further predict the urban expansion in 2020, 2025 and 2030. The results show that the overall accuracy of urban land use simulation in 2015 is 93.86%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.8577. The model has a good simulation effect. Furthermore, the predicted results in 2020, 2025 and 2030 show that the urban land area in Shanghai is still increasing, and the spatial distribution of urban land has obvious circle structure and regional differences. The urban areas within 10km from the city center are growing slowly, and the region within 30km from the city center is growing faster, and there are more new urban points from 2025 to 2030. But in the area 30km away from the city center, different administrative areas show different urban growth phenomena. Among them, there are a large number of new urban points in the junction area between Songjiang District and Jinshan District, which may be the focus of future urban development planning in Shanghai.

In our hypothesis, the inclusion of true active compounds in the high-ranked compound is not necessary. We regard the high-ranked compounds as being pseudo-active compounds. As a method to embody our hypothesis, we introduce a pseudo-structure-activity relationship (PSAR) model. Although the PSAR model is the same as a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model, in terms of statistical methodology, the implications of the training data are different. Known active compounds (ligands) are used as training data in the QSAR model, whereas the pseudo-active compounds are used in the PSAR model. In this study, Random Forest was used as a machine-learning algorithm. From tests for four functionally different targets, estrogen receptor antagonist (ER), thymidine kinase (TK), thrombin, and acetylcholine esterase (AChE), using five scoring functions, we obtained three conclusions: (1) the PSAR models significantly gave higher percentages of known ligands found than random sampling, and these results are sufficient to support our hypothesis; (2) the PSAR models gave higher percentages of known ligands found than normal scoring by scoring function, and these results demonstrate the practical usefulness of the PSAR model; and (3) the PSAR model can assess compounds failed in the docking simulation. Note that PSAR and QSAR models are used in different situations; the advantage of the PSAR model emerges when no ligand is available as training data or when one wants to find novel types of ligands, whereas the QSAR model is effective for finding compounds similar to known ligands when the ligands are already known.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18278890", "doi": "10.1021/ci7003384", "venue": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "mag_id": "2048641401", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30024184"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8886478"}

The study area, located in North-East Sicily, was hit on October 1st 2009 by a severe rainstorm (225 mm of cumulative rainfall in 7 h) which caused flash floods and more than 1000 landslides. Several small villages, such as Giampilieri, were hit with 31 fatalities, 6 missing persons and damage to buildings and transportation infrastructures. Landslides, mainly types such as earth and debris translational slides evolving into debris flows, were triggered on steep slopes and involved colluvium and regolith materials which cover the underlying metamorphic bedrock. The work has been carried out with the following steps: i) realization of a detailed event landslide inventory map through field surveys coupled with observation of high resolution aerial colour orthophoto; ii) identification of landslide source areas; iii) data preparation of landslide controlling factors and descriptive statistics based on a bivariate method (Frequency Ratio) to get an initial overview on existing relationships between causative factors and shallow landslide source areas; iv) choice of criteria for the selection and sizing of the mapping unit; v) implementation of 5 multivariate statistical susceptibility models based on Logistic Regression and Random Forests techniques and focused on landslide source areas; vi) evaluation of the influence of sample size and type of sampling on results and performance of the models; vii) evaluation of the predictive capabilities of the models using ROC curve, AUC and contingency tables; viii) comparison of model results and obtained susceptibility maps; and ix) analysis of temporal variation of landslide susceptibility related to input parameter changes.

In addition to nurse observations, higher acuity ED patients have their vital signs continuously monitored by bedside monitors. However, the alerts generated by the monitors are routinely ignored due to their high false alert rate. We investigated whether a baseline data fusion model and two alternative techniques, weighted Parzen windows and Support Vector Machines, could identify events relating to vital sign abnormality while keeping the number of false alerts to a minimum. The performance of each model was assessed by calculating its sensitivity and specificity. However, it was not possible to select an optimal model, due to the difficulty in assessing the relative importance of maximising true alertsand minimising false alerts. In the final part of this thesis, two limitations of the data fusion models are highlighted. Firstly, missing data is not handled coherently within the current models, and secondly the models do not make use of temporal information. One method of addressing both of these issues, Gaussian processes, was considered. Using this method, a novel framework was derived that allowed for alerts to be generated even when there is uncertainty in the vital sign values.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2177099968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4499045"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:74072139"}

Overlapping means when person is not fully visible in the image and occluded by another person at the front or right/left side. In order to achieve this goal, three steps were implemented. The algorithms were implemented in C++ with the help of Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) library. The first step was human detection when single person's body occupied most of the image. For this, three machine learning techniques were examined: K \u2014 Nearest Neighbour algorithm (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree learning. Their performances were compared and optimal classifier was chosen. The results of experiments have shown that SVM, in comparison with others, had the highest accuracy rate. It exceeded others for about 10\u201312%. So, SVM was taken as a classifier which detected human at an accuracy rate of about 95%. The second step was implementation of sliding window approach to detect multiple people in the image. And the last, third main step was people detection in conditions of occlusion. As it's known, SVM gives the decision value (confidence) for detection, negative value is for person and positive value is for non-person. Our approach was based on the assumption that if it is occluded person which overlap with detected person, its confidence should be smaller than confidences of its neighbour windows so that occluded person would be more \u2018human like\u2019 with respect to neighbours. So, we found local minima within the windows, which intersect with a window of detected for person more than 45%.

Monitoring traffic situations becomes an important challenge for the Traffic Control and Surveillance Systems (TCSS). In advanced TCSS, it is helpful to automatically detect and classify different traffic incidents such as severity of congestion, abnormal driving pattern, abrupt or illegal stop on road, etc. Although most TCSS are equipped with basic incident detection algorithms, they are however crude to be really useful as an automated tool for further classification. In literature, there is a lack of research for Automated Incident Classification (AIC). Therefore, a novel AIC method is proposed in this paper to tackle such challenges. In the proposed method, traffic signals are firstly extracted from captured videos and converted as spatial-temporal (ST) signals. Based on the characteristics of the ST signals, a set of realistic simulation data are generated to construct an extended big traffic database to cover a variety of traffic situations. Next, a Mean-Shift filter is introduced to suppress the effect of noise and extract significant features from the ST signals. The extracted features are then associated with various types of traffic data: one normal type (inliers) and multiple abnormal types (outliers). For the classification, an adaptive boosting classifier is trained to detect outliers in traffic data automatically. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is adopted to train the model for identifying the categories of outliers. In short, this hybrid approach is called an Adaptive Boosting Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM) method.

Based on a soft fiber representation, we extend the tensor kernel to deal with fiber tracts using the multi-instance kernel that reflects not only interactions between points along fiber tracts, but also the interactions between diffusion tensors. This unsupervised method is further extended by way of an atlas-based registration of diffusion-free images, followed by a classification of fibers based on nonlinear kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Promising experimental results of tensor and fiber classification of the human skeletal muscle over a significant set of healthy and diseased subjects demonstrate the potential of our approach.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206500", "venue": "CVPR 2009", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2148182561", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121889680"}

Introduction ARIs have epidemic and pandemic potential. Prediction of presence of ARIs from individual signs and symptoms in existing studies have been based on clinically-sourced data 1 . Clinical data generally represents the most severe cases, and those from locations with access to healthcare institutions. Thus, the viral information that comes from clinical sampling is insufficient to either capture disease incidence in general populations or its predictability from symptoms. Participatory data \u2014 information that individuals today can produce on their own \u2014 enabled by the ubiquity of digital tools, can help fill this gap by providing self-reported data from the community. Internet-based participatory efforts such as Flu Near You 2 have augmented existing ARI surveillance through early and widespread detection of outbreaks and public health trends. Methods The GoViral platform 3 was established to obtain self-reported symptoms and diagnostic specimens from the community (Table 1 summarizes participation detail). Participants from states with the most data, MA, NY, CT, NH, and CA were included. Age, gender, zip code, and vaccination status were requested from each participant. Participants submitted saliva and nasal swab specimens and reported symptoms from: fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Pathogens were confirmed via RT-PCR on a GenMark respiratory panel assay (full virus list reported previously 3 ). Observations with missing, invalid or equivocal lab tests were removed. Table 2 summarizes the binary features. Age categories were: \u2264 20, > 20 and < 40, and \u2265 40 to represent young, middle- aged, and old. Missing age and gender values were imputed based on overall distributions. Three machine learning algorithms\u2014Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 4 , Random Forests (RFs) 5 , and Logistic Regression (LR) were considered. Both individual features and their combinations were assessed. Outcome was the presence (1) or absence (0) of laboratory diagnosis of ARI. Results Ten-fold cross validation was repeated ten times. Evaluations metrics used were: positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity 6 . LR and SVMs yielded the best PPV of 0.64 (standard deviation: \u00b1 0.08) with cough and fever as predictors. The best sensitivity of 0.59 ( \u00b1 0.14) was from LR using cough, fever, and sore throat. RFs had the best NPV and specificity of 0.62 ( \u00b1 0.15) and 0.83 ( \u00b1 0.10) respectively with the CDC ILI symptom profile of fever and (cough or sore throat). Adding demographics and vaccination status did not improve performance of the classifiers. Results are consistent with studies using clinically- sourced data: cough and fever together were found to be the best predictors of flu-like illness 1 . Because our data include mildly infectious and asymptomatic cases, the classifier sensitivity and PPV are low compared to results from clinical data. Conclusions Evidence of fever and cough together are good predictors of ARI in the community, but clinical data may overestimate this due to sampling bias. Integration of participatory data can not only improve population health by actively engaging the general public 2 but also improve the scope of studies solely based on clinically-sourced surveillance data.

However, language models usually consist of a few hundred million trainable parameters with embedding space distributed across multiple layers, thus making them challenging to be fine-tuned for a specific task or to be transferred to a new domain. To determine whether there are task-specific neurons that can be exploited for unsupervised transfer learning, we introduce a method for selecting the most important neurons to solve a specific classification task. This algorithm is further extended to multi-source transfer learning by computing the importance of neurons for several single-source transfer learning scenarios between different subsets of data sources. Besides, a task-specific fingerprint for each data source is obtained based on the percentage of the selected neurons in each layer. We perform extensive experiments in unsupervised transfer learning for sentiment analysis, natural language inference and sentence similarity, and compare our results with the existing literature and baselines. Significantly, we found that the source and target data sources with higher degrees of similarity between their task-specific fingerprints demonstrate a better transferability property.

Thus, the ability to detect gear faults and classify them based on their nature becomes very important aspect of health monitoring of machines. In this paper, SVM algorithms have been used for the multiclass prediction of faults with the help of time domain vibration signals obtained from the gearbox casing operated in a suitable speed range. Moreover, it tries to examine the performance of the SVM technique by optimizing its parameters on utilization of time domain data from multi-fault gear box. The SVM software was fed with the training data and testing data at similar operating speeds for three types of defects and no defect case, and classification ability of SVM was noted and found to be excellent. The sensitivity analysis of optimized parameters is studied and conclusions are drawn.Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/GTINDIA2012-9586", "venue": "ASME 2012 Gas Turbine India Conference", "journal": "ASME 2012 Gas Turbine India Conference", "mag_id": "2085570289", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110573683"}

When the scaling ratio is small, point estimates achieve impressive performance, but soon they suffer from the regression-to-the-mean problem, result of their inability to capture the multi-modality of this conditional distribution. Modeling high-dimensional image and audio distributions is a hard task, requiring both the ability to model complex geometrical structures and textured regions. In this paper, we propose to use as conditional model a Gibbs distribution, where its sufficient statistics are given by deep convolutional neural networks. The features computed by the network are stable to local deformation, and have reduced variance when the input is a stationary texture. These properties imply that the resulting sufficient statistics minimize the uncertainty of the target signals given the degraded observations, while being highly informative. The filters of the CNN are initialized by multiscale complex wavelets, and then we propose an algorithm to fine-tune them by estimating the gradient of the conditional log-likelihood, which bears some similarities with Generative Adversarial Networks. We evaluate experimentally the proposed approach in the image super-resolution task, but the approach is general and could be used in other challenging ill-posed problems such as audio bandwidth extension.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1511.05666", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ICLR 2016", "journal": "arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963864522,2951139725,2196707239", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9494295", "1489107", "15285520", "206597351", "1282515", "18874645", "6775458", "9138017", "1808153", "1033682", "13333501", "1930231", "16165021", "12554042", "7088133", "14542261", "7027533", "5851469", "15310495", "206592191", "2475577", "14124313", "14888175", "7252503", "10349990", "2171181"], "inbound_citations": ["65323843", "202771836", "53722640", "67856640", "51767014", "210839162", "203904861", "88505246", "211026764", "215416330", "3013847", "22341613", "211227", "86672387", "52957374", "211521410", "2356935", "57721270", "211210849", "52250307", "85451786", "119186718", "146118934", "484327", "3951548", "209853434", "203581380", "2108093", "202494723", "58004880", "12093452", "3509003", "174804629", "22066308", "164593276", "21600447", "181448372", "8320498", "85522264", "6258790", "56517420", "182952569", "54434775", "81979377", "157061233", "4710407", "214624763", "51980301", "53779736", "199510374", "181509218", "208632419", "10307745", "25931462", "85443839", "207930664", "4752222", "195791820", "212633776", "11859568", "211041080", "67855714", "8478736", "211132707", "198968041", "210859386", "195346042", "23610502", "29185976", "56171426", "204801243", "14532409", "122395712", "6138149", "204184835", "52908500", "202540701", "201833649", "91176158", "52955830", "23101662", "8394195", "204028234", "3625846", "209496623", "9779093", "214691336", "2064528", "189928566", "49319704", "49413866", "51968038", "52154773", "206771333", "134859210", "199688641", "8191987", "127540247", "47017552", "195697333", "60441776", "207912376", "4133363", "71150867", "152282408", "210859102", "3951396", "49670656", "201622511", "67855709", "8768364", "203221188", "88483327", "3901628", "203606171", "207988910", "53176584", "209056163", "211097006", "211038546", "208201926", "51990067", "53643967", "39593759", "213005378"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10578341"}

It is quite well-known that the miRNAs are playing a crucial role for regulating the expression of target gene via repressing translation or promoting messenger RNAs degradation. Therefore, identification of discriminative and differentially expressed miRNA as a signature is an important task for cancer therapy. In this regard, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data of miRNAs, available at The Cancer Research Atlas (TCGA) repository, is analyzed here for prostate cancer. This cancer type is a serious threat to the health of men as found in the literature. Hence, finding miRNA signature using NGS based miRNA expression data for prostate cancer is an important research direction. Generally by motivating this fact, a new miRNA signature identification method for prostate cancer is proposed. The proposed method uses a global optimization technique, called Simulated Annealing (SA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Here SA encodes L number of features, in this case miRNAs. Similar number of top L key principal components of the original dataset is extracted using PCA. Thereafter, such components are multiplied with the reduced subset of data so that the classification task can be done on diverse dataset using SVM. Here the classification accuracy of SVM is considered as an underlying objective to optimize using SA. The proposed method can be seen as feature section technique in order to find potential miRNA signature. Finally, the experimental results provide a set of miRNAs with optimal classification accuracy. However, due to the stochastic nature of this algorithm a list of miRNAs is prepared. From the top 15 miRNAs of that list, four miRNAs, hsa-mir-152, hsa-mir-23a, hsa-mir-302f and hsa-mir-101-1, are associated with prostate cancer. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method has also been compared with other widely used state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, the obtained results have been justified by means of statistical test along with biological significance tests for the selected miRNAs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/RAIT.2016.7507956", "venue": "2016 3rd International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)", "journal": "2016 3rd International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2501931435", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["30394179", "124177967", "60577818", "207165665", "18555223", "10089339", "2914506", "120450474", "147194189", "14604895", "206764015", "14134274", "120581754", "5464782", "32703921", "22101528", "32507771", "46287924", "11994183", "25042827"], "inbound_citations": ["67449201", "15760977"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14363377"}

In this study, several machine learning algorithms are applied for the prediction of the intracellular protein locations. These algorithms use the features extracted from protein sequences. In contrast, protein interactions have been less investigated. ::: ::: ::: Objectives ::: As protein interactions usually occur in the same or adjacent places, using this feature to find the location would be efficient and impressive. This study did not aim at increasing the total accuracy of the conducted research. The study has focused on the features of the proteins' interaction and their employment which lead to a higher accuracy. ::: ::: ::: Materials and Methods ::: In this study, we have examined the protein interaction network as one of the features for prediction of the protein localization and its effects on the prediction results. In this regards, we have gathered some of the most common features including Amino Acid Composition, Dipeptide Compositions, Pseudo Amino Acid Compositions (PseAAC), Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), Functional Domain, Gene Ontology information, and the Pair-wise sequence alignment. The results of the classification are compared to the ones using protein interactions. For achieving this goal different machine learning algorithms were tested. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: The best-obtained results of using single feature set obtained using SVM classifier for PseAAC feature. The accuracy of combining all features with PPI data, using the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, was 82.49% and 83.35%, respectively. In another experiment, using just protein interaction data with the different cutting points resulted in obtaining an accuracy of 93.035% for the protein location prediction. ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: In total, it was shown that protein(s) interaction has a significant impact on the prediction of the mitochondrial proteins' location.

Despite the simplicity in the structures of individual units, the entire network can as a whole demonstrate some remarkable and subtle properties such as an ability to dynamically adapt to a changing environment. In contrast to the recognition and generalization problems, there are no labels attached to input data. The network clusters the data autonomously using unsupervised learning schemes.

On the other hand, cities have been found to provide valuable ecosystem services such as carbon storage. The aim of this study is to estimate the above-ground carbon storage in trees in the central European city of Leipzig and produce spatially explicit carbon storage maps. We used stratified random sampling across 19 land cover classes using 190 sample plots to measure carbon storage. In addition, we derived canopy cover from color-infrared orthophotos using an object-oriented approach and Random Forest machine learning. Finally, we apply an error assessment method that includes sampling error, but also uncertainty stemming from allometric equations, and that so far has only been applied to rural forests. The total above ground carbon stock of Leipzig was estimated using both land cover and canopy cover, which was more laborious than just using land cover but reduced the standard error. Canopy cover was approximately 19% of the city area. Leipzig's above-ground carbon storage was estimated to be 316,000 Mg C at 11 Mg C ha \u22121 . The distribution of carbon storage across the city showed the highest values at intermediate urbanization levels. Carbon storage in the city of Leipzig was in the lower range compared to cities in Europe, Asia and the USA, and our results indicate that great care should be taken when transferring values between cities.

A botnet attack typically works by infecting a device with malware and then recruiting it into a network of infected devices controlled by an attacker, which may lead to severe economic and social consequences. As a result, a considerable amount of research has been conducted to detect and prevent such attacks. In this paper, we create a foundation for an anomaly-based intrusion detection system to improve network security and to help reduce human involvement and error. The network traffic we used is captured in the form of connection logs, which are gen- erated by a popular network monitoring framework called Bro. We use our proposed framework to compare the performances of multiple supervised learning approaches, including Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest RF and Neural Networks (NN) at anomaly detection. We evaluated these models using F1 Score and Area Under Curve (AUC). Our models are trained on malicious network traffic samples from pervasive botnets like Zeus, Miuref and Conficker, as well as benign traffic samples. Using traditional cross validation, we illustrate that Random Forest has the best performance for anomaly detection. To test each algorithm's ability to generalize to unseen bot types, we implemented a custom-designed Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOBO-CV). In this procedure, each algorithm is trained on all but one bot family and evaluated on their ability to detect the unknown botnet traffic. We then improved overall detection performance by ensembling our two best models.

The diagnosis of epilepsy can usually only be made when a seizure is happening, which leads to some difficulties in the diagnostic process. The most recent way of diagnosing epilepsy is by using an Electroencephalograph (EEG) record. However, detecting epilepsy cases through EEG records takes a long time and may lead to misleading diagnostic results. The use of machine learning approaches is intended to generate fast and accurate classification results. As the EEG only generates a signal, direct analysis using RF or SVM cannot be carried out and the EEG record needs to be pre-processed. This paper uses Discrete Wavelet Transform and Line Length Features in the data pre-processing stage to decompose the signal by frequency and time. The classification results show that both RF and SVM perform very well and are able to classify cases of epilepsy accurately.

The FIRF framework consists of two stages. Stage 1 of the framework removes most of the ringing and aliasing artifacts in the initial bicubic interpolated image, while Stage 2 further refines the Stage 1 interpolated image. By varying the number of decision trees in the random forests and the number of stages applied, the proposed FIRF method can realize computationally scalable image interpolation.

GAN is applied to fully extract distributional information from historical data in a nonparametric and unsupervised way without a priori approximation or assumption. Since GAN utilizes deep neural networks, complicated data distributions and modes can be learned, and it can model uncertainty efficiently and accurately. Distributionally robust chance constrained programming takes into consideration ambiguous probability distributions of uncertain parameters.

Since the various activities are mutually related to each other, there is ::: a need not only to maximise the efficiency of each one, but also to ensure proper ::: coordination, hence to solve integrated decision-making problems. Several factors can ::: affect the quality of the services provided and the overall efficiency. Vessel arrival ::: uncertainty further complicates the task of the planners and, as a result, of the ::: effectiveness of the planning itself, in particular at the operational level. Each arrival ::: produces high peak loads for other terminal activities, as well as for the supporting ::: arrival activities (pilotage, towage, etc.) and hinterland transportation (waiting, ::: congestion etc.). Deviating arrivals only worsen this peak load. ::: On a daily level, the actual time of arrival of the vessels often deviates from the ::: scheduled time. Despite contractual obligations to notify the Estimated Time of ::: Arrival (ETA) at least 24 hours before the arrival, ship operators often have to adapt ::: and update the latest ETA due to unexpected circumstances. This aspect results in a ::: last-minute change of plans in terminal operations resulting in higher costs. In fact, the ::: ability to predict the actual time of a vessel\u2019s arrival in a port 24 hours in advance is ::: fundamental for the related planning activities for which the decision-making ::: processes need to be constantly adapted and updated. Moreover, disruptions in ::: container flows and operations caused by vessel arrival uncertainty can have cascade ::: effects within the overall supply chain and network within which the port is part. ::: Although vessel arrival uncertainty in ports is a well-known problem for the scientific ::: community, the literature review highlights that in the maritime sector the specific ::: instruments for dealing with this problem are extremely limited. ::: The absence of a reference model that specifies the relationship between vessel arrival ::: uncertainty and the involved variables resulted in the application of a specific machine ::: learning approach within the Knowledge Discovery in Database process. This ::: V ::: approach, that abandons all prior assumptions about data distribution shape, is based ::: on the self-learning concept according to which the relation between an outcome ::: variable Y and the set of predictors X is directly identified from the historical collected ::: data. ::: The approach has been validated thanks to two different case studies: the container ::: terminal of Cagliari, located in the Mediterranean basin, and one of the main container ::: terminals of Antwerp, located at the North Sea. ::: Depending on the framework and planning purposes several estimates can provide ::: useful information on vessel arrivals. Sometimes, it can be useful for planners to infer ::: a quantitative estimate of the delay/advance in minutes, sometimes it may be useful to ::: have a qualitative estimate, even only knowing whether or not an incoming vessel is ::: likely to arrive before or after the scheduled ETA.

From a practical point of view, the probability, associated to the continuous estimation, of specifically identifying the work-shift of the incoming vessel is calculated. In all predictions Random Forest algorithms still show the best performance. This aspect can help planners, in the daily strategy decision making process, in order to improve the use of the human, mechanical and spatial resources required for handling operations.

Such assessments inform restoration plans and future monitoring of ecosystem recovery. Due to the high cost and time to conduct fieldwork, remote sensing is an appealing alternative to assess post-fire condition over larger areas than can be surveyed practically in the field. The aim of this study is to use remote sensing data to characterize post-fire severity at tree level in a mixed conifer forest following the Cascade and East Zone megafires of 2007 in central Idaho, USA. We used remote sensing metrics derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data (2008) and high-resolution QuickBird (QB) multispectral satellite imagery (2007\u20132009) for calibrating and validating predictive models with field data (2008). We compared fire effects on trees in open canopies within recent fuel treatments to similar trees in closed canopies on adjacent, untreated sites. We observed more trees with charred crowns in high fire severity sites, mostly untreated, whereas we observed more trees with live crowns in low fire severity sites, independent of the treatment. Individual trees were more accurately detected from ALS data in treated sites with open canopies than untreated sites with closed canopies. For detected trees, the response variables predicted from ALS and QB metrics were total height (Ht), crown base height (CBH), total basal area (BAT), live basal area (BAL), scorched basal area (BAS), charred basal area (BAC) and crown severity (CS). None of the selected QB metrics were strongly correlated with the selected ALS metrics, which justified combining both data types into the predictive models. Random Forest regression models combining ALS + QB metrics or using ALS metrics alone performed similarly but clearly better than models using only QB metrics. This study shows the superiority of ALS data to high resolution, multispectral QB imagery for mapping fire severity at tree level. Managers with limited resources to plan for restoration of fire affected forests are advised to prioritize spending for data collection on ALS data and a modest number of field inventory plots, rather than QB or other broadband satellite imagery.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108820", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Modelling", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2977679490", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["28118454", "5118899", "89141", "4609040", "59068738", "43151461", "42014317", "83010105", "129503439", "64189607", "9412289", "16464904", "3897527", "133015690", "128779602", "24596318", "126767942", "130817245", "7057153", "11678417", "25789464", "127770840", "130395708", "129923034", "126522248", "41826038", "27034984", "5140933", "54870526", "9347826", "127627092", "129830460", "31204911", "129003158", "322132", "85142481", "56235735", "129568857", "40016027", "724358", "129048928", "84174277", "55188432", "132963634", "14457261", "131337727", "16880395", "16646823", "140576510", "140576095", "30439903", "19539613", "26725165", "140583140", "11976308", "85610577", "128680373", "53638103", "128619277", "53601665", "53500574", "53632466", "15329880", "128407868", "85175059", "51798703"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208569085"}

There are several IPS methods such as AOA, TOA, TDOA, which use trilateration for indoor location estimation but are generally based on line-of-sight. Other methods rely on classification such as fingerprinting which uses WLAN indoor signals. This paper re-examines the classical WLAN fingerprinting accuracy which uses received signal strength (RSS) measurements by introducing channel estimates for improvements in the classification of indoor locations. The purpose of this paper is to improve existing classification algorithms used in fingerprinting by introducing channel estimates when there are a low number of APs available. The channel impulse response, or in this case the channel estimation from the receiver, should characterize a complex indoor area which usually has multipath, thus providing a unique signature for each location which proves useful for better pattern recognition. In this experiment, channel estimates are extracted from a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) environment, thus exploiting the benefits of SDR from a NI-USRP model and LabVIEW software. Measurements are taken from a known building, and several scenarios with one and two access points (APs) are used in this experiment.

Recent deep learning based methods depend on learning global geometry from self-reconstruction. However, these methods are still suffering from ineffective learning of local geometry, which significantly limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this issue, we propose MAP-VAE to enable the learning of global and local geometry by jointly leveraging global and local self-supervision. To enable effective local self-supervision, we introduce multi-angle analysis for point clouds. In a multi-angle scenario, we first split a point cloud into a front half and a back half from each angle, and then, train MAP-VAE to learn to predict a back half sequence from the corresponding front half sequence. MAP-VAE performs this half-to-half prediction using RNN to simultaneously learn each local geometry and the spatial relationship among them. In addition, MAP-VAE also learns global geometry via self-reconstruction, where we employ a variational constraint to facilitate novel shape generation. The outperforming results in four shape analysis tasks show that MAP-VAE can learn more discriminative global or local features than the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1907.12704", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2019.01054", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3009750677,2964609265", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23102425", "7078650", "1003795", "52131369", "6746759", "49666173", "6598262", "1033682", "159041805", "51613778", "19603871", "12810980", "4562636", "5548308", "78094669", "53230690", "52166951", "53225185", "159041567", "3934562", "53399839", "35744583", "53224984", "5115938", "1745976", "59316487", "2782113", "4578850", "58006483", "52980377", "62775631", "94822", "3248075", "206592833", "4486619", "4536146", "8338993", "51908879"], "inbound_citations": ["199405439", "212725680", "199064226", "202572639", "212675638", "212747798", "208158329", "208910346", "214713787", "212675132", "201671359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198985902"}

Traditional ELMs assume that the training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution, which however is often violated in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a unified cross-domain ELM (CDELM) framework to address domain adaptation problems, in which the distributions of training data (source domain) and testing data (target domain) are different but related. CDELM not only fully leverages labeled source data and unlabeled target data simultaneously to construct an adaptive target classifier but also maintains the computational efficiency of ELMs. Specifically, CDELM adapts the source classifier to target domain by matching the projected means of both domains, and explores the structure property of target domain by using manifold regularization to make the final classifier more adaptable to target data. Based on the framework, two algorithms CDELM-M and CDELM-C are proposed, which aim at minimizing the marginal and conditional distribution distance between source and target domains, respectively. Moreover, CDELM-C can further enhance the classification accuracy by multiple iterations.

Usage of data mining techniques plays a major role in medical informatics. Especially when it comes to predicting or forecasting the survivability of a disease which is known as medical prognosis, data mining plays a major role. With the time medical prognosis is becoming highly important to increase the morality of patients especially who are diagnosed as cancer victims. Although the importance is increasing in the cancer prognosis, the methods that are in the practice for predicting still need to be improved and refined. In this paper we present an overview of the current research being carried out using the data mining techniques for prognosis of cancers. The goal of this study is to identify the well-performing data mining algorithms used on medical databases in order to predict survivability of cancer patients. The following algorithms have been identified: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks, Naive Bayes and Fuzzy Rules. Analyses show that it is very difficult to name a single data mining algorithm as the most suitable for cancer prognosis. At times some algorithms perform better than others, but there are cases when a combination of the best properties of some of the aforementioned algorithms together results more effective.

Determining the class labels at such pairs of confusing modes is challenging as the labeling decisions depend not only on the feature values but also on the context of the test scenario.

We view the model-selection step facing an ILP system as a decision problem, the solution of which requires knowledge of the context in which the model is to be deployed. In this paper, \"context\" will be defined by the current specification of the prior class distribution and the client's preferences concerning errors of classification. Within this restricted setting, we consider the use of an ILP system in situations where: (a) contexts can change regularly. This can arise for example, from changes to class distributions or misclassification costs; and (b) the data are from observational studies. That is, they may not have been collected with any particular context in mind. Some repercussions of these are: (a) any one model may not be the optimal choice forall contexts; and (b) not all the background information provided may be relevant for all contexts. Using results from the analysis of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, we investigate a technique that can equip an ILP system to reject those models that cannot possibly be optimal in any context. We present empirical results from using the technique to analyse two datasets concerned with the toxicity of chemicals (in particular, their mutagenic and carcinogenic properties). Clients can, and typically do, approach such datasets with quite different requirements. For example, a synthetic chemist would require models with a low rate of commission errors which could be used to direct efficiently the synthesis of new compounds. A toxicologist on the other hand, would prefer models with a low rate of omission errors. This would enable a more complete identification of toxic chemicals at a calculated cost of misidentification of non-toxic cases as toxic. The approach adopted here attempts to obtain a solution that contains models that are optimal for each such user according to the cost function that he or she wishes to apply. In doing so, it also provides one solution to the problem of how the relevance of background predicates is to be assessed in ILP.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1010980106294", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1479847447", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45058654", "26736242", "60993494", "203042391", "19990980", "3853553", "52866062", "125133067", "16875156", "607255", "123553195", "16762143", "39666367", "126253074", "157595", "15417881", "13923423", "16455032", "13036541", "8756813", "15982740", "2075186", "8863872", "126253074", "125134461", "57100530", "5899434"], "inbound_citations": ["17927968", "1720329", "14184740", "35907611", "10414560", "207988508", "15126143", "10682348", "18229590"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9220714"}

Our experimentation with different feature subsets shows that the category relying on domain-specific sentiment lexical ('contextual' category), able to grasp the jargon and lingo used in Norwegian financial news, is of cardinal importance in classification - these features yield a precision increase of ~21% when added to the other feature categories.

While such annotations are helpful in manual selection of data, they are insufficient for comprehensive and quantitate measurement of per-roadway-segment scenario complexity. To resolve such limitations, we propose a traffic sensory data classification paradigm based on quantifying the scenario complexity for each roadway segment, where such quantification is jointly based on road semantic complexity and traffic element complexity. The road semantic complexity is a proposed measurement of the complexity incurred by the static elements such as curvy roads, intersections, merges and splits, which is predicted with a Support Vector Regression (SVR).

In many domains, an ideal learning algorithm needs to approximate nonlinear time-varying functions from a high-dimensional input space and avoid problems from irrelevant or redundant input data. Therefore, the method has to meet three requirements, namely, it must: allow incremental learning to deal with changing functions and changing input distributions; keep the computational cost low; and achieve accurate estimations. In this paper, we explore different approaches to perform function approximation based on the Local Adaptive Receptive Fields Self-Organizing Map (LARFSOM). Local models are built by calculating between the output associated with the winning node and the difference vector between the input vector and the weight vector. These models are combined by using a weighted sum to yield the final approximate value. The topology is adapted in a self-organizing way, and the weight vectors are adjusted in a modified unsupervised learning algorithm for supervised problems. Experiments were carried out on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are key players in the control of cellular functions, being ideal modulators of hepatic proliferation and carcinogenesis. ::: ::: ::: METHODS & RESULTS ::: We used a previously validated RT-qPCR platform to profile modifications in the expression of all 49 members of the NR superfamily in mouse liver during LR. Twenty-nine NR transcripts were significantly modified in their expression during LR, including fatty acid (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, PPARs) and oxysterol (liver X receptors, Lxrs) sensors, circadian masters RevErb\u03b1 and RevErb\u03b2, glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) and constitutive androxane receptor (Car). In order to detect the NRs that better characterize proliferative status vs. proliferating liver, we used the novel Random Forest (RF) analysis to selected a trio of down-regulated NRs (thyroid receptor alpha, Tr\u03b1; farsenoid X receptor beta, Fxr\u03b2; Ppar\u03b4) as best discriminators of the proliferating status. To validate our approach, we further studied PPAR\u03b4 role in modulating hepatic proliferation. We first confirmed the suppression of PPAR\u03b4 both in LR and human hepatocellular carcinoma at protein level, and then demonstrated that PPAR\u03b4 agonist GW501516 reduces the proliferative potential of hepatoma cells. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Our data suggest that NR transcriptome is modulated in proliferating liver and is a source of biomarkers and bona fide pharmacological targets for the management of liver disease affecting hepatocyte proliferation.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4130532", "pubmed_id": "25116592", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0104449", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2065093481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["36239892", "39302882", "27675054", "31696736", "6283670", "29451421", "2756510", "30647609", "8831839", "3080288", "17548812", "13601982", "205872673", "940810", "13011175", "23323307", "24346342", "31198117", "45067730", "8306419", "16776282", "13016352", "10204504", "7990667", "2219148", "44834350", "44965098", "89141", "15245447", "8591392", "8529157", "8397120", "19528915", "23918627", "214646465", "22959975", "26943711", "22189354", "798296", "477175", "1885461", "11335320", "7551020", "24282153", "22839784", "7591953", "5082300", "205866636", "1346061", "2646966", "12811830", "5406754", "23674991", "36710107", "22377093", "89915946", "12917560", "87770606", "20140193", "22027644", "26953195", "30785541", "5432972", "6276930", "22167835", "6927523", "2146978", "22355457", "24336832"], "inbound_citations": ["8465687", "215590690", "20451893", "215077308", "24161371", "8056349", "15822183", "10826542", "215704433", "146810165", "1567840"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17640948"}

However, the standard SVM can not select variables automatically and therefore its solution typically utilizes all the input variables without discrimination. This makes it difficult to identify important predictor variables, which is often one of the primary goals in data analysis. In this paper, we propose two novel types of regularization in the context of the multicategory SVM (MSVM) for simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally requires estimation of multiple discriminating functions and applies the argmax rule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize its importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with different functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to a penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we propose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on different variables according to their relative importance. Both types of regularization automate variable selection in the process of building classifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced interpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low sample size data. One big advantage of the supnorm penalty is its easy implementation via standard linear programming. Several simulated examples and one real gene data analysis demonstrate the outstanding performance of the adaptive supnorm penalty in various data settings.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": "0803.3676", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1214/08-EJS122", "venue": "Electronic Journal of Statistics 2008, Vol. 2, 149-167", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2077659054", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["207165665", "5885974", "10151608", "119479891", "60753226", "10205866", "7349658", "116617051", "7087225", "15133424", "16399602", "7138354", "28637672", "17044466", "118799867", "8993541", "73603", "10757159", "6162124", "14791297", "2072265", "15379424", "122185949"], "inbound_citations": ["2556641", "8696946", "3587727", "668134", "34208807", "21961673", "16812153", "1261598", "5763874", "17002765", "88515113", "114236241", "15505139", "55001086", "8081719", "62016270", "88511721", "145050435", "8389973", "556331", "52892778", "16049948", "14322788", "39553894", "2870176", "44532", "23148191", "85552470", "14565533"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17641174"}

Various algorithms have been described for this purpose, a number of which frame the sound and classify these frames, while others take advantage of the sequential information embedded in a sound signal. In the paper, a new algorithm is proposed that, while maintaining the frame-classification advantages, adds a new phase that considers and classifies the score series derived after frame labelling.

However, the human perception system is believed to use different features for different objects. In this paper, we leverage semantic ontologies to solve the aforementioned problems. The authors propose an ontological random forest algorithm where the splitting of decision trees are determined by semantic relations among categories.

However, the neural mechanisms responsible for this behavior, and its progressive maturation in a multisensory environment, are still insufficiently understood. The aim of this letter is to analyze this problem with a neural network model of audiovisual integration, based on probabilistic population coding-the idea that a population of neurons can encode probability functions to perform Bayesian inference. The model consists of two chains of unisensory neurons auditory and visual topologically organized. They receive the corresponding input through a plastic receptive field and reciprocally exchange plastic cross-modal synapses, which encode the spatial co-occurrence of visual-auditory inputs. A third chain of multisensory neurons performs a simple sum of auditory and visual excitations. ::: ::: The work includes a theoretical part and a computer simulation study. We show how a simple rule for synapse learning consisting of Hebbian reinforcement and a decay term can be used during training to shrink the receptive fields and encode the unisensory likelihood functions. Hence, after training, each unisensory area realizes a maximum likelihood estimate of stimulus position auditory or visual. In cross-modal conditions, the same learning rule can encode information on prior probability into the cross-modal synapses. Computer simulations confirm the theoretical results and show that the proposed network can realize a maximum likelihood estimate of auditory or visual positions in unimodal conditions and a Bayesian estimate, with moderate deviations from optimality, in cross-modal conditions. Furthermore, the model explains the ventriloquism illusion and, looking at the activity in the multimodal neurons, explains the automatic reweighting of auditory and visual inputs on a trial-by-trial basis, according to the reliability of the individual cues.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28095201", "doi": "10.1162/NECO_a_00935", "venue": "Neural Computation", "journal": "Neural Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2573038364", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3125842", "16189850", "33081692", "25085402", "18801373", "14901317", "7307365", "47459", "8007941", "11560581", "9602111", "46511485", "2218969", "13636325", "38623065", "8958642", "12088850", "18813490", "1655633", "11562994", "14326162", "10149795", "2376942", "8571646", "34264592", "13907859", "6629393", "11061470", "7864606", "1224890", "14755865", "12549502", "205100761", "13634902", "14341145", "7906811", "8282748", "15908558", "10767838", "32533572", "9606218", "7887035", "8708445", "14828214", "177285", "42180539"], "inbound_citations": ["49867218", "42337797", "201666625", "3626965", "201084793", "4606317", "35951247", "160013427", "208555291", "209564819", "25139337", "215466622", "201812702"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2524731"}

The aim of this special issue is to account for some recent developments in the field by presenting a collection of ten articles written by distinguished colleagues who enthusiastically responded to our idea of dedicating a special issue to this subject. The first paper by David et al. develops a nitrogenbackboned model of wine-making in standard and nitrogen-added fermentations. Nitrogen has a strong impact on the key bio-mechanisms involved during the grape-must fermentation, but also on the synthesis of flavour markers determining the aromatic profile of the wine. This paper presents a dynamical mass balance model describing the main physiological phenomena involved in standard batch fermentations, i.e., consumption of sugar and nitrogen and synthesis of ethanol. It also includes nitrogen compounds such as hexose transporters. Moreover, a common practice in wine-making is the addition of nitrogen during the fermentation to boost and shorten the process duration. A tractable representation of this boost effect is, therefore, developed as an extension of the first model. It is apparent that yeast makes a different use of nitrogen depending on the fermentation stage at which the addition is effected, balancing the regrowth of biomass and the synthesis of supplementary hexose transporters. These models are validated in line with experimental evidence deduced from extensive experimental studies. Microalgae are often seen as a potential biofuel producer. To predict achievable productivities in the so-called raceway culturing system, the dynamics of photosynthesis has to be taken into account. In particular, the dynamical effect of inhibition by an excess of light (photoinhibition) must be represented. In the second paper by Hartmann et al., a model considering both photosynthesis and growth dynamics is proposed. This model involves three different time scales. The response of this model to fluctuating light with different frequencies is studied by slow\u2013fast approximations. Therefore, three different regimes are identified, for which a simplified expression of the model can be derived. These expressions give a hint on productivity improvement, which can be expected by stimulating photosynthesis with a faster hydrodynamics. The lack of sensors for some relevant state variables in fermentation processes can be coped by developing appropriate software sensors. In the third paper by Acuna et al., various Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are compared when acting as software sensors of biomass concentration for a Solid-Substrate Cultivation (SSC) process. In particular, Nonlinear AutoRegressive models with eXogenous variables (NARX) and Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average models with eXogenous variables (NARMAX) are considered. Results show that NARMAX-SVM outperforms the other models with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error, also called SMAPE index, under 9 for a 20 % amplitude noise. In addition, NARMAX models perform better than NARX models under the same noise conditions because of their better predictive capabilities as J. A.

Of the 19 available sites, 13 were replicated.ConclusionsWe identified 13 novel epigenetic loci associated with atopy and high IgE that could serve as candidate loci for future studies; four were within genes with known roles in the immune response (cg04983687 in the body of ZFPM1, cg18219873 in the 5\u2032UTR of PRG2, cg27469152 in the 3\u2032UTR of EPX, and cg09332506 in the body of COPA).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4545869", "pubmed_id": "26292806", "doi": "10.1186/s13073-015-0213-8", "venue": "Genome Medicine", "journal": "Genome Medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2115188287", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4688149", "31563057", "1708237", "46262682", "22410305", "3117411", "16156195", "84354757", "11022442", "206604897", "7152464", "18401995", "89141", "15245447", "14188202", "21029222", "16549644", "14561500", "2166297", "1834351", "4819721", "31828360", "21108587", "15768644", "14415031", "14297870", "17916020", "14780639", "19497257", "28748102", "12552917", "3093707", "27768367", "3640534", "2657379", "6870987", "36547840", "5010698", "10418677", "14847796", "18364642", "33847621", "20413635", "3669857", "25254034", "126996", "21304326", "10980699", "215623965", "3980700", "14883711", "5492560", "18474366", "8529157", "6441731"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18714254"}

This has to handle spatio-temporal dependencies of multiple traffic participants and uncertainties from different sources. Most existing approaches use probabilistic generative joint structures like Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which have long been used for dealing with activity recognition problems. Two significant limitations of these models are the assumption of conditional independence of observations and the availability of prior information. In this study, we present a probabilistic discriminative approach based on undirected probabilistic graphical models (Markov Networks). We combine two well-studied models: the log-linear model and the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which use dynamic programming for efficient, exact inference and their parameters can be learned via convex optimization. Since CRF conditions on entire observation sequences, we can avoid the requirement of independence between observations. Additionally, with discriminative models prior information of each activity is not necessary when performing a classification step. These two advantages of the discriminative models are very useful for our focusing problem of traffic scene understanding.

Different from the previous studies, the PSO-ELM models require no statistical inference nor distribution assumption of the model parameters, but rather focus on generating the prediction intervals (PIs) that can minimize a multi-objective function which considers two criteria, reliability and interval sharpness. The improved PSO-ELM models are developed for an hourly border crossing traffic dataset and compared to: (1) the original PSO-ELMs; (2) two state of the art models proposed by Zhang et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2014) separately; and (3) the traditional ARMA and Kalman filter models. The results show that the improved PSO-ELM can always keep the mean PI length the lowest, and guarantee that the PI coverage probability is higher than the corresponding PI nominal confidence, regardless of the confidence level assumed. The study also probes the reasons that led to a few points being not covered by the PIs of PSO-ELMs. Finally, the study proposes a comprehensive optimization framework to make staffing plans for border crossing authority based on bounds of PIs and point predictions. The results show that for holidays, the staffing plans based on PI upper bounds generated much lower total system costs, and that those plans derived from PI upper bounds of the improved PSO-ELM models, are capable of producing the lowest average waiting times at the border. For a weekday or a typical Monday, the workforce plans based on point predictions from Zhang et al. (2014) and Guo et al. (2014) models generated the smallest system costs with low border crossing delays. Moreover, for both holiday and normal Monday scenarios, if the border crossing authority lacked the required staff to implement the plans based on PI upper bounds or point predictions, the staffing plans based on PI lower bounds from the improved PSO-ELMs performed the best, with an acceptable level of service and total system costs close to the point prediction plans.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.trc.2018.05.012", "venue": null, "journal": "Transportation Research Part C-emerging Technologies", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2804811686", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["8337589", "106553179", "8797625", "14413332", "154265256", "16531368", "17521021", "11205607", "109191220", "111309700", "116858", "14345049", "15293685", "109827319", "13928067", "15345238", "127486156", "62182657", "62673172", "108435246", "153347834", "106903195", "30933402", "7079419", "109275349", "108825188", "122926112", "118799694", "36911759", "62676671", "18535851", "9975497", "110058587", "110572276", "40559861", "111183339", "5739191", "154815741", "16642138", "59431363", "110427797", "14712092", "45220648", "38627172", "108512242", "156856893", "110977917", "109718666", "112334579", "115589908", "115575491", "106864547", "67799653"], "inbound_citations": ["198473772", "203993915", "115452630", "201136815", "54460216", "198856772", "56517379", "30933402", "70228346", "208781193"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117658670"}

Many attempts on network structures and refinement strategies have been explored, such as using Conditional Random Field (CRF) to improve the accuracy of saliency map, but it is independent from the deep network and cannot be trained end-to-end. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep Conditional Random Field network (DCRF) to take both deep feature and neighbor information into consideration. First, Multi-scale Feature Extraction Module (MFEM) is adopted to capture the low level texture and high level semantic features, multi-stacks of deconvolution layers are employed to improve the spatial resolution of deep layers. Then we employ Backward Optimization Module (BOM) to guide shallower layers by high-level location and shape information derived from deeper layers, which intrinsically enhance the representational capacity of low-level features. Finally, a Deep Conditional Random Field Module (DCRFM) with unary and pairwise potentials is designed to concentrate on spatial neighbor relations to obtain a compact and uniformed saliency map.

Building on Random Forests (RF), Random Intersection Trees (RITs), and through extensive, biologically inspired simulations, we developed the iterative Random Forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order interactions with same order of computational cost as RF. We demonstrate the utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems: enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of primary transcripts in human derived cell lines. In Drosophila, among the 20 pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80% have been previously reported as physical interactions. Moreover, novel third-order interactions, e.g. between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived cells, iRF re-discovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated splicing regulation, and identified novel 5th and 6th order interactions, indicative of multi-valent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing regulation.

In this work, we introduce a novel noise assisted decomposition scheme to perform automatic sleep stage classification from single channel EEG signals. At first, we decompose the EEG signal segments into mode functions using Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN).

Many existing gene pair evaluation methods cannot highlight diverse patterns of gene pairs only used one strategy of vertical comparison and horizontal comparison, while individual-gene-ranking method ignores redundancy and synergy among genes.ResultsHere we proposed a novel score measure named relative simplicity (RS). We evaluated gene pairs according to integrating vertical comparison with horizontal comparison, finally built RS-based direct classifier (RS-based DC) based on a set of informative genes capable of binary discrimination with a paired votes strategy. Nine multi-class gene expression datasets involving human cancers were used to validate the performance of new method. Compared with the nine reference models, RS-based DC received the highest average independent test accuracy (91.40 %), the best generalization performance and the smallest informative average gene number (20.56). Compared with the four reference feature selection methods, RS also received the highest average test accuracy in three classifiers (Na\u00efve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine), and only RS can improve the performance of SVM.ConclusionsDiverse patterns of gene pairs could be highlighted more fully while integrating vertical comparison with horizontal comparison strategy.

We show that the minimizer of f-SPL preserves the pairwise label similarities in the learned feature embeddings. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed loss function on the task of cross-corpus SER with soft labels.

Sentiment classification on text data has been an active topic for the last two decades and learning-based methods are very popular and widely used in various applications. For learning-based methods, a lot of enhanced technical strategies have been used to improve the performance of the methods. Feature selection is one of these strategies and it has been studied by many researchers. However, an existing unsolved difficult problem is the choice of a suitable number of features for obtaining the best sentiment classification performance of the learning-based methods. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between the number of features selected and the sentiment classification performance of the learning-based methods. A new method for the selection of a suitable number of features is proposed in which the Chi Square feature selection algorithm is employed and the features are selected using a preset score threshold. It is discovered that there is a relationship between the logarithm of the number of features selected and the sentiment classification performance of the learning-based method, and it is also found that this relationship is independent of the learning-based method involved. The new findings in this research indicate that it is always possible for researchers to select the appropriate number of features for learning-based methods to obtain the best sentiment classification performance.

It is designed to work as a desktop application hence uploading large files to web servers is not required. This could speed up the data analysis process because server queries or queues are avoided, while ensuring security of confidential clinical data on a local computer. With MetaboNexus, users can progressively start from data pre-processing, multi- and univariate analysis to metabolite identity search of significant molecular features, thereby seamlessly integrating critical steps for metabolite biomarker discovery. Data exploration can be first performed using principal components analysis, while prediction and variable importance can be calculated using partial least squares-discriminant analysis and Random Forest. After identifying putative features from multi- and univariate analyses (e.g. t test, ANOVA, Mann\u2013Whitney U test and Kruskal\u2013Wallis test), users can seamlessly determine the molecular identity of these putative features. To assist users in data interpretation, MetaboNexus also automatically generates graphical outputs, such as score plots, diagnostic plots, boxplots, receiver operating characteristic plots and heatmaps. The metabolite search function will match the mass spectrometric peak data to three major metabolite repositories, namely HMDB, MassBank and METLIN, using a comprehensive range of molecular adducts. Biological pathways can also be searched within MetaboNexus. MetaboNexus is available with installation guide and tutorial at http://www.sph.nus.edu.sg/index.php/research-services/research-centres/ceohr/metabonexus, and is meant for the Windows Operating System, XP and onwards (preferably on 64-bit).

To explore the contributions of these factors to skin microbiome variation, we profiled the bacterial microbiomes of 495 North American subjects (ages, 9 to 78 years) at four skin surfaces plus the oral epithelium using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We collected subject metadata, including host physiological parameters, through standardized questionnaires and noninvasive biophysical methods. Using a combination of statistical modeling tools, we found that demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors collectively explained 12 to 20% of the variability in microbiome composition. The influence of health factors was strongest on the oral microbiome. Associations between host factors and the skin microbiome were generally dominated by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the Clostridiales and Prevotella. A subset of the correlations between microbial features and host attributes were site specific. To further explore the relationship between age and the skin microbiome of the forehead, we trained a Random Forest regression model to predict chronological age from microbial features. Age was associated mostly with two mutually coexcluding Corynebacterium OTUs. Furthermore, skin aging variables (wrinkles and hyperpigmented spots) were independently correlated to these taxa. IMPORTANCE Many studies have highlighted the importance of body site and individuality in shaping the composition of the human skin microbiome, but we still have a poor understanding of how extrinsic (e.g., lifestyle) and intrinsic (e.g., age) factors influence its composition. We characterized the bacterial microbiomes of North American volunteers at four skin sites and the mouth. We also collected extensive subject metadata and measured several host physiological parameters. Integration of host and microbial features showed that the skin microbiome was predominantly associated with demographic, lifestyle, and physiological factors. Furthermore, we uncovered reproducible associations between chronological age, skin aging, and members of the genus Corynebacterium. Our work provides new understanding of the role of host selection and lifestyle in shaping skin microbiome composition. It also contributes to a more comprehensive appreciation of the factors that drive interindividual skin microbiome variation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6606800", "pubmed_id": "31266865", "doi": "10.1128/mBio.00839-19", "venue": "mBio", "journal": "mBio", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2954285250", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3268835", "207781074", "215524106", "18588523", "17725633", "195680992", "13785027", "728983", "717109", "33315615", "5921192", "3879612", "21029734", "23966374", "1036797", "13769394", "36259705", "25501176", "215517508", "2920612", "13769967", "4981716", "206687954", "5998290", "11436934", "13980168", "29523539", "14343389", "42794179", "3321914", "8457923", "11604918", "205277725", "9325238", "9823349", "206692555", "19399647", "3567694", "22952296", "4682582", "52096108", "5042666", "43781791", "10040608", "37853114", "5165950", "18522335", "2639559", "1373790", "3093707", "89141"], "inbound_citations": ["212742929"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195787003"}

However, pre-evacuation time is rarely discussed in previous community-scale emergency evacuation studies. This paper proposes a new method that estimates the pre-evacuation time, which makes the evacuation simulation in urban residential communities more realistic. This method integrates the residents' pre-evacuation behavior data obtained by surveys to explore the influencing factors of pre-evacuation time and builds a predictive model to forecast pre-evacuation times based on the Random Forest algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to find the critical parameters in evacuation simulations. The results of evacuation simulations in different scenarios can be compared to identify potential evacuation problems. A case study in Luoshanqicun Community, Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The simulation results showed that the pre-evacuation times have significant impacts on the simulation procedure, including the total evacuation time, the congestion time and the congestion degree.

Together with the development of new techniques for analysis and processing of bioelectric signals, motor unit action potential (MUAP) wavelet analysis represents an important change in the development of electromyographic techniques. Methods: The proposed approach involves isolating single MUAPs, computing their scalograms, taking the maximum values of the scalograms in 5 selected scales, and averaging across MUAPs to give a single five-dimensional feature vector per muscle. After Support Vector Machine analysis, the feature vector is reduced to a single decision parameter that allows the subject to be assigned to 1 of 3 groups: myogenic, healthy, or neurogenic. The software is available as freeware. Results: MUAP wavelet analysis yielded consistent results for the diagnostic index and muscle classification, with only 7 incorrect classifications out of a total of 1,015 samples.

Most of these approaches treat tracking as a classification problem and solve it by training a discriminative classifier and exhaustively evaluating every possible target position; problems thus exist for two reasons. First, since the classifier describes the common feature of samples in an implicit way, it is not clear how well the classifier can represent the feature of the desired object against others; second, the brute-force search within the output space is usually time consuming, and thus limits the competence for real-time application. In this paper, we treat object tracking as a problem of similarity matching for streaming data.

Agricultural development supported by the multi-layer aquifer system has led to the overexploitation of the deep layers, while irrigation return flow and the subsequent increased recharge rates increased water table levels in the unconfined layer. In addition, a large number of boreholes of the area are screened in several aquifers and allow an artificial connection between different groundwater masses. Moreover, as a consequence of the water table increase in the shallow aquifer, a permanent flow appeared in the last kilometres of the surface watershed. Together with the uncontrolled release of brines from private groundwater desalination, it induced a permanent surface flow of water to the main outlet of the system, the Mar Menor lagoon. In this context, understanding the complex evolution of the whole system and how the water balance is affected is a hard task.The first research focus aimed at collecting and reviewing all kind of existing data in order to reconstruct the evolution along one century of the multi-layer aquifer system. It highlighted an inversion of the vertical hydraulic gradient between aquifers and the decrease of water table levels up to 500 m for the deepest layer. Facing the difficult identification of the origin of groundwater samples, a method based on the Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique was developed. Despite the difficulty of an unequal dataset, accuracy over 90% was reached and 107 groundwater samples of unknown origin could be classified. Results were much better than using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) or Decision Trees (CART).The second research axis was motivated by the difficulty to update the water balance of the multi-layer aquifer where irrigation return flow represents an additional source of recharge, added to the limited rainfall infiltration. Environmental tracers (14C, 13C, 2H, 18O, 3H) were combined to high-resolution temperature loggings to investigate the long-term evolution of recharge in the Campo de Cartagena aquifer system and discriminate local mixing processes (infra-boreholes) from regional mixing processes (between aquifers). Both pre-anthropization and post-anthropization recharge regime could be identified and quantified. Before the development of agriculture, recharge varied from 17 mm.a-1 in the mountain ranges to 6 mm.a-1 in the plain. In response to the increase of agricultural activity, recharge fluxes were amplified up to 210 mm.a-1 in irrigated areas.The third research axis consisted in quantifying submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). In order to decipher the influence of the different water sources on the Mar Menor, a radon (222Rn) and radium (223Ra, 224Ra) survey was combined with the hydrodynamic modeling of the lagoon. The areas of influence of a plume of radionuclides from the river were identified, the main areas of SGD were located and a location for a submarine emissary was proposed. Mass balances in winter and summer seasons provided total yearly SGD fluxes of water of 7.2-15.9 108 m3.a-1 (222Rn), 21.9-44.7 108 m3.a-1 (224Ra) and 6.9 108 m3.a-1 (223Ra, in winter). Water level effect, rather than tidal pumping, was identified as the main driver for recirculated saline groundwater, while fresh submarine groundwater discharge from the aquifer was about 1% of total SGD. As the case study is an extreme case of anthropization, these results present a wide interest that is not limited to the Murcia region or the Campo de Cartagena aquifer. The methods developed in this thesis might be used in other Mediterranean sites where groundwater exploitation seems to follow a continuous and inevitable increase.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2600292176", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133178428"}

Specifically, we have used band pass filter to cut off the signal other than between 5-35[Hz], JADE as a form of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a motion classifier. The interval of a motor area about the lower limb at two sides of the brain is very near and a motor area about it is located behind skin of scalp. Therefore, it is difficult for us to measure the EEG and cut off noises. However, we think that our proposal algorithm is effective to develop the real-time Brain Machine Interface (BMI). We performed the experiment that one subject lying down on a bed with closed eyes images the motion of walking, standing and turning the left and right direction among interval of 30 seconds, respectively. As the result of applying our algorithm, the recognition rate within 50-60[%] was achieved.

Thus, these methods cannot be used to learn calligraphy from unlabeled samples. To address this problem, a calligraphy robotic model based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper, which enables a robotic arm to write fundamental Chinese character strokes from stroke images.

The robot makes appropriate writing action based on the state information provided by the environment. In order to evaluate the writing action of the robot, a reward function is designed on the model. In addition, the stochastic policy gradient method is used in training on the model.

In the detection stage, moving objects must be detected as quickly and accurately as possible and the influence of environmental light changes and waving trees should be reduced. In this research a block-based method is introduced in HSV color space in the detection stage. This method did not scan all the pixels of the frame and acted well in situations like sudden light changes. A powerful pattern recognition system should have powerful feature extraction and classification. Note that, feature extraction in gray level or RGB color space has problems such as environmental light changes, adding noise or changes in contrast and sharpness of images, which lead to weak classification. So the HSV color space was used. Here, Block-based Improved Center Symmetric Local Binary Pattern is introduced for feature extraction. In each component of the HSV color space, information of highlight areas in the image such as edge, shape and some texture was extracted. The histogram was calculated in two-level blocks and Support Vector Machine was used for classifying into vehicles, motorcycles and pedestrians.

Instead of iteratively tuning the parameters, the extreme machine can be seen as a linear optimization problem by randomly generating the input weights and hidden biases. However, the random determination of the input weights and hidden biases may bring non-optimal parameters, which have a negative impact on the final results or need more hidden nodes for the neural network. To overcome the above drawbacks caused by the non-optimal input weights and hidden biases, we propose a new hybrid learning algorithm named dolphin swarm algorithm extreme learning machine adopting the dolphin swarm algorithm to optimize the input weights and hidden biases efficiently. Each set of input weights and hidden biases is encoded into one vector, namely the dolphin. The dolphins are evaluated by root mean squared error and updated by the four pivotal phases of the dolphin swarm algorithm. Eventually, we will obtain an optimal set of input weights and hidden biases. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare the proposed algorithm with the standard extreme learning machine and three state-of-the-art methods, which are the particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine, evolutionary extreme learning machine, and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine, under 13 benchmark datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The purpose of this study was to explore potential risk factors for CAI and serodiscordant CAI (SD-CAI) among YGBMSM with detectable viremia. Methods A total of 146 YGBMSM (aged 16\u201324 years) with a detectable viremia enrolled in a mobile health adherence intervention. Baseline characteristics, stratified by any CAI and any SD-CAI (past 3 months), were computed. Random Forests and regression methods were used to assess factors associated with each type of CAI. Adjusted prevalence rate ratios (aPRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Half (51.9%) reported engaging in CAI; 57.1% of those reported SD-CAI. There was strong agreement between the Random Forests and regression methods. Significant risk factors of CAI included marijuana use (aPRR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.21\u20133.21), problematic substance use (aPRR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.11\u20132.20), and being in a committed relationship (aPRR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.21\u20132.27). Only 47% believed they were less likely to transmit HIV through CAI when virally suppressed. Conclusion High rates of CAI, including engagement in SD-CAI in a population of YGBMSM with detectable viral loads, pose significant concerns for onward transmission. Individual, dyadic, and structural predictors of CAI were associated with engagement in risk in this priority population. Addressing these factors in concert with ensuring viral suppression will be key to ending the epidemic among youth.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31987721", "doi": "10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.12.006", "venue": "The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine", "journal": "The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine", "mag_id": "3002044493", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210933909"}

Most financial models assume as hypothesis a series of characteristics regarding the nature of financial time series and seek extracting information about the state of the market through calibration. Through backtesting, a large number of these models are seen not to perform and are thus discarded. The remaining well-performing models however, are highly vulnerable to overfitting. Financial time series are complex by nature and their behaviour changes over time, so this concern is well founded. In addition to the problem of overfitting, available data is far too scarce for most machine learning applications and impossibly scarce for advanced approaches such as reinforcement learning, which has heavily impaired the application of these novel techniques in financial settings. This is where data generation comes into play. Generative Adversarial Networks, GANs, are a type of neural network architecture that focuses on sample generation. Through adversarial training, the GAN can learn the underlying structure of the input data and become able to generate samples very similar to those of the data distribution. This is specially useful in the case of high-dimensional objects, in which the dimensions are heavily inter-dependent, such as images, music and in our case financial time series. In this work we want to explore the generating capabilities of GANs applied to financial time series and investigate whether or not we can generate realistic financial scenarios.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2958114180", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199010183"}

To address these issues, a novel and principled multiclass SVM based on geometric properties of hyperspheres, termed SVMGH, is proposed in this paper. Different from existing SVM-based methods that seek a cutting hyperplane between two classes, SVMGH draws the discriminative information of each class by constructing a minimum hypersphere containing all class members, and then defines a label function based on the geometric properties of the minimum hyperspheres. We prove theoretically the geometric properties of the minimum hyperspheres to guarantee the validation of SVMGH. The computational efficiency is enhanced by a data reduction strategy as well as a fast training method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SVMGH shows better performance and higher computational efficiency than the state of the art on multiclassification problems while maintaining comparable performance and efficiency on binary classification problems.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/int.21718", "venue": "Int.

To index Thai texts via the inverted index, a word segmentation algorithm is usually required to tokenize a text into a series of terms. Recent works on word segmentation reported Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as the best machine learning algorithm, outperforming the dictionary-based approach and other machine learning algorithms. Our main contribution is to propose a new hybrid approach, LearnLexTo, which further improves the CRF model by integrating the dictionary-based approach. The key idea is to solve the ambiguity problem in the CRF model by using the dictionary-based approach which relies on a valid word set. Experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid approach yields the highest F1 value of 88.46%, compared to 82.07% by using the dictionary-based approach and 85.71% by using the CRF model.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1460027.1460042", "venue": "iNEWS '08", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2078714787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61116939", "12446903", "12007034", "7418935", "277918", "10649571", "59833531"], "inbound_citations": ["14538409", "44719401", "17145319", "7849120", "14645741", "169217686", "73539218", "4903323"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6105174"}

The analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can lead to the detection of epileptic seizures. But due to immensely non-linear and non-stationary nature of EEG, it is very tedious to inspect and interpret these signals visually. Therefore, methods such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and non-linear features are used for automated detection of epilepsy from EEG signals. These methods represent discontinuities, repeated patterns and complexities in EEG signals much effectively and have very high discrimination ability to differentiate EEG segments into normal, interictal and ictal classes. In this work, we formed various feature sets using combination of DWT statistical features and non-linear features such as entropies and fractal dimension. These feature sets were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and various performance parameters were evaluated. One of the feature sets resulted in an overall accuracy of 99.7% and thereby the proposed technique emerged as an effective automatic seizure monitoring software.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WiSPNET45539.2019.9032871", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Wireless Communications Signal Processing and Networking (WiSPNET)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Wireless Communications Signal Processing and Networking (WiSPNET)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011176652", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27305335", "30980416", "733320", "9150088", "7418798", "12151870", "5582975", "124509842", "11103157", "15866458", "28003673", "35670355", "43779442", "2389971", "201271407", "119525164", "7874260", "28637672", "33120249", "6826672"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212702577"}

The first module recognizes the demonstrator\u2019s actions using two-stream convolution neural networks, and classifies the operated objects by adopting a Mask R-CNN. After that, two XGBoost classifiers are applied to further classify the objects into subject object and patient object respectively, according to the demonstrator\u2019s actions. In the second module, a grammar-based parser is used to summarize the videos and generate the common instructions for robot execution.

We contrast these with another tree-like approach, namely Random Forests, and a Bayesian logistic regression with stochastic search variable selection.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21383421", "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2011.46", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "journal": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2123427204", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8456180", "15657591", "207738357", "89141", "60993494", "2288180", "2581822", "7529644", "205830513", "28333324", "15250963", "118476306", "17132495", "5473663", "21957782", "61023588", "18957897", "205939", "186242719", "15880873", "125272654", "16848340", "11343012", "15736158", "551330", "205913286", "15503502", "13059209", "61296767", "2100328", "14727722", "1210670"], "inbound_citations": ["12764413", "28739261", "18640079", "210043107", "49356072", "13908292", "215396313", "215206439", "1008482", "20473112", "59233608", "215407862", "2181092", "1746430", "4908679", "51716423", "27924886", "122556904", "4555526", "54457275", "53208154", "211723518", "1378782", "27192314", "155980866", "7538919", "19108138", "34751189", "53108382", "61809259", "56596818", "215294249", "8617232", "12454277", "7161110", "5660803", "8619199", "2960783"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14874382"}

This phenomenon is widely exploited in many biosensors used for the measurement of bioelectromagnetism. One example of such sensors is an electroencephalograph (EEG) used for the recording and monitoring the bioelectrical activity of brain. Raw EEG scalp potentials are characterized by weak spatial resolution. Owing to the volume conduction there is an overlapping of the contribution to each electrode from neighboring bioelectrical sources. Due to described reasons, multichannel EEG recordings tend to provide an unclear image of the activity of brain. In this study the performance of algorithms based on spatial filtering in the task of eliminating source overlapping from EEG-based BCI system is examined and compared. The algorithms of choice are Common Average Reference (CAR), Surface Laplacian (SL), Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP). Additionally, a new approach to feature selection and knowledge extraction from BCI models is proposed. For that purpose criterion based on the Gini variable importance evaluation, commonly performed by the Random Forests algorithm, is used.

Advantages such as nonlinear approximation capability, highly desirable generalization ability and computational efficiency make the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) a practical approach for this critical task. Since the KELM model is intrinsically sensitive to the regularization parameter and the kernel parameter, a searching scheme combining the coupled simulated annealing (CSA) algorithm and the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm is adopted to find an optimal KLEM parameter set.

In this work, we study the synergic use of both methods by introducing a random forest kernel (RFK) in an SVM classifier. A time series of multispectral WorldView-2 images acquired over Mali (West Africa) in 2014 was used to develop our case study. Ground truth containing five common crop classes (cotton, maize, millet, peanut, and sorghum) were collected at 45 farms and used to train and test the classifiers. An SVM with the standard Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, a RF, and an SVM-RFK were trained and tested over 10 random training and test subsets generated from the ground data. Results show that the newly proposed SVM-RFK classifier can compete with both RF and SVM-RBF. The overall accuracies based on the spectral bands only are of 83, 82 and 83% respectively. Adding vegetation indices to the analysis result in the classification accuracy of 82, 81 and 84% for SVM-RFK, RF, and SVM-RBF respectively.

Similarly, the identification of such proteins could be valuable in comparing the metagenome of healthy and diseased individuals and estimating the proportion of pathogenic species. However, the common challenge in both the above tasks is the identification of virulent proteins since a significant proportion of genomic and metagenomic proteins are novel and yet unannotated. The currently available tools which carry out the identification of virulent proteins provide limited accuracy and cannot be used on large datasets. Therefore, we have developed an MP3 standalone tool and web server for the prediction of pathogenic proteins in both genomic and metagenomic datasets. MP3 is developed using an integrated Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to carry out highly fast, sensitive and accurate prediction of pathogenic proteins. It displayed Sensitivity, Specificity, MCC and accuracy values of 92%, 100%, 0.92 and 96%, respectively, on blind dataset constructed using complete proteins. On the two metagenomic blind datasets (Blind A: 51\u2013100 amino acids and Blind B: 30\u201350 amino acids), it displayed Sensitivity, Specificity, MCC and accuracy values of 82.39%, 97.86%, 0.80 and 89.32% for Blind A and 71.60%, 94.48%, 0.67 and 81.86% for Blind B, respectively. In addition, the performance of MP3 was validated on selected bacterial genomic and real metagenomic datasets. To our knowledge, MP3 is the only program that specializes in fast and accurate identification of partial pathogenic proteins predicted from short (100\u2013150 bp) metagenomic reads and also performs exceptionally well on complete protein sequences.

We compare student attitudes of comfort, attention, engagement, motivation, and physical proximity for two dyadic stance formations: a face-to-face stance and a side-by-side stance.

First, we explore the effect of a hard sample mining strategy. To alleviate the human labor of adjusting the margin hyper-parameter, a self-adaptive margin updating strategy is proposed. Then, a normalized version is given to take full advantage of the cosine similarity constraint.

Sea wave parameters prediction by support vector machine using a genetic algorithm. The prediction of sea wave parameters is important for the planning, design, and operation of coastal and ocean structures.

In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) approach, using various kernel functions, is presented for wave parameters prediction in an attempt to suggest a new model with superior explanatory power and stability. A genetic algorithm is used to determine the free parameters of the SVM. The SVM results are compared with the field data and with backpropagation and cascade-correlation neural network models.

The Intrusion Detection Systems most commonly used in enterprise networks are signature-based, because they can efficiently detect known attacks while generating a relatively low number of false positives.

The beginning of computer processing of natural language, when traced back to a system such as Winograd\u2019s SHRUDLU, conceived in 1973, actually aimed to address the issues of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) of relatively complex sentences by a robotic system which in turn takes actions accordingly based on the natural language input.

This paper explores the use of cognitive linguistic constructs as well as other constructs such as spatial relationship constructs to configure an NLU system for translating complex natural language instructions into actions to be taken by a robot.

A particularly severe security attack that affects the ad hoc network routing protocols at the network layer, is known as the Black hole attack. A malicious node advertises itself as having the freshest or shortest path to destination. Once the malicious node attracts the traffic toward itself, the attacker can misuse or discard the traffic and as a result data through the malicious node is lost. To properly protect these systems with limited resources, the security practitioners need to understand the possible security threats and their impacts on MANETs and have a framework to ensure that the protections implemented to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the systems are the most efficient ones possible. In this Research the effects of malicious nodes on MANETs proactive routing protocol, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) were studied using NS-3 and their vulnerabilities compared. A framework for a methodical security analysis and recommendation of efficient protection schemes was also developed as well Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification of categories of node as malicious and normal nodes and Apply filtering rule on network traffic for identification of UDP FLOOD and ICMP attack using Wireshark.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International journal of scientific research in science, engineering and technology", "mag_id": "2406803107", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19024435"}

The accuracy increased by over 4% whereas the loss decreased by 30% between a base model and the TL model.

This however will require a significant reduction in measurement time as Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) imaging takes hours to days to scan a clinically relevant specimen. A potential remedy for this issue is the use of Quantum Cascade Laser Infrared (QCL IR) microscopy performed in Discrete Frequency (DF) mode for maximum speed gain. This gain could be furthermore improved by applying a proper denoising algorithm that takes into account the specific data structure. We have recently compared spectral and spatial denoising techniques in the context of Fourier Transform IR (FT-IR) imaging and showed that the optimal methods depend heavily on the exact data structure. In general multivariate denoising methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) are the most effective for a dataset containing multiple bands. Histologic classification of QCL IR images of pancreatic tissue using Random Forest was therefore performed to investigate which denoising schemes are the most optimal for such experimental data structure. This work is the first to show the effects of denoising on classification accuracy of QCL data and is likely to be transferable to other QCL microscopes and other modalities using DF imaging, e.g. AFM-IR or CARS/SRS imaging.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30661616", "doi": "10.1016/j.aca.2018.11.032", "venue": "Analytica chimica acta", "journal": "Analytica chimica acta", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2901232419", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58648847"}

However, due to issues like data privacy, budget limitation, shortage of domain-specific annotators, the number of crowdsourced labels are still very limited. Moreover, because of annotators' diverse expertises, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent. Thus, directly applying existing representation learning algorithms may easily get the overfitting problem and yield suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \\emph{NeuCrowd}, a unified framework for representation learning from crowdsourced labels. The proposed framework (1) creates a sufficient number of high-quality \\emph{n}-tuplet training samples by utilizing safety-aware sampling and robust anchor generation; and (2) automatically learns a neural sampling network that adaptively learns to select effective samples for representation learning network.

Most of the existing de-anonymization approaches predict relevance score of paper-author pair via feature engineering, which is not only time and storage consuming, but also introduces irrelevant and redundant features or miss important attributes. Representation learning can automate the feature generation process by learning nodes\u2019 embeddings in academic network to infer the correlation of paper-author pair. However, the learned embeddings are often for general purpose (independent of the specific task), or based on network structure only (without considering the node content). To address these issues and make a further progress in solving the author identification problem, we propose a content-aware and meta-path augmented metric learning model. Specifically, first, the directly correlated paper-author pairs are modeled based on distance metric learning by introducing a push loss function. Next, the paper\u2019s content embedding encoded by the gated recurrent neural network is integrated into the distance loss. Moreover, the historical bibliographic data of papers is utilized to construct an academic heterogeneous network, wherein a meta-path guided walk integrative learning module based on the task-dependent and content-aware Skipgram model is designed to formulate the correlations between each paper and its indirect author neighbors, and further augments the model.

A network that can add nodes into its map space can approximate the input space more accurately, and often more parsimoniously, than a network with predefined structure and size, such as the Self-Organising Map. In addition, a growing network can deal with dynamic input distributions. Most of the growing networks that have been proposed in the literature add new nodes to support the node that has accumulated the highest error during previous iterations or to support topological structures. This usually means that new nodes are added only when the number of iterations is an integer multiple of some pre-defined constant, l. This paper suggests a way in which the learning algorithm can add nodes whenever the network in its current state does not sufficiently match the input. In this way the network grows very quickly when new data is presented, but stops growing once the network has matched the data. This is particularly important when we consider dynamic data sets, where the distribution of inputs can change to a new regime after some time. We also demonstrate the preservation of neighbourhood relations in the data by the network. The new network is compared to an existing growing network, the Growing Neural Gas (GNG), on a artificial dataset, showing how the network deals with a change in input distribution after some time. Finally, the new network is applied to several novelty detection tasks and is compared with both the GNG and an unsupervised form of the Reduced Coulomb Energy network on a robotic inspection task and with a Support Vector Machine on two benchmark novelty detection tasks. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In contrast to field measurements of mixing below confluences, satellite remote-sensing can provide detailed information on spatial distributions of SSSC over long distances. This paper presents a methodology that uses remote-sensing data to estimate spatial patterns of SSSC downstream of confluences along large rivers and to determine changes in the amount of mixing over distance from confluences. The method develops a calibrated Random Forest (RF) model by relating training SSSC data from river gaging stations to derived spectral indices for the pixels corresponding to gaging-station locations. The calibrated model is then used to predict SSSC values for every river pixel in a remotely sensed image, which provides the basis for mapping of spatial variability in SSSCs along the river. The pixel data are used to estimate average surficial values of SSSC at cross sections spaced uniformly along the river. Based on the cross-section data, a mixing metric is computed for each cross section. The spatial pattern of change in this metric over distance can be used to define rates and length scales of surficial mixing of suspended sediment downstream of a confluence. This type of information is useful for exploring the potential influence of various controlling factors on mixing downstream of confluences, for evaluating how mixing in a river system varies over time and space, and for determining how these variations influence water quality and ecological conditions along the river.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.11.026", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2768732505", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199113192", "197660319", "174804815", "205134303", "51965724", "155980866", "59232341", "199080100", "211205859", "202006937"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134493780"}

To address this problem, an adaptive acceleration particle swarm optimization (AAPSO) technique is proposed. To evaluate our proposed method, we employ both face and iris recognition based on AAPSO with SVM (AAPSO-SVM). In the face and iris recognition systems, performance is evaluated using two human face databases, YALE and CASIA, and the UBiris dataset. In this method, we initially perform feature extraction and then recognition on the extracted features. In the recognition process, the extracted features are used for SVM training and testing. During the training and testing, the SVM parameters are optimized with the AAPSO technique, and in AAPSO, the acceleration coefficients are computed using the particle fitness values.

Markov Random Field (MRF) related depth estimation methods have attracted extensive attentions due to their ability of building structural relationships on outputs. Almost all of them employed engineered low-level absolute and relative features for constructing MRF. However, the engineered features are not capable of producing accurate depths for various scenes. In this paper, we propose Convolutional Conditional Random Field Network (CCRFN) consisting of feature learning and depth tuning components. In feature learning component, we build two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to learn absolute and relative features from raw images. In depth tuning component, the learned features are fed into Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate the depths of all pixels in an image by optimizing a well-defined energy function. CCRFN has two advantages that (1) it does not need hand-crafted features and (2) it models the depths at individual points as well as the relationship between them in the deep model.
