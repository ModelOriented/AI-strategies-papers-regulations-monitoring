The main aim of the project is to develop Drowsy Driver Detection System that allows for warning the driver of drowsiness or in attention to prevent traffic accidents. We propose a vision based intelligent algorithm to detect driver drowsiness. Previous approaches are generally based on blink rate, eye closure, yawning, eye brow shape and other hand engineered facial features. Our system proposes an algorithm for driver drowsiness detection using representation learning. A new perspective towards driver sleep detection is presented as features responsible for decision making are produced by leveraging multi-layer convolutional neural networks. The proposed algorithm makes use of features learnt using convolutional neural network so as to explicitly capture various latent facial features and the complex non-linear feature interactions. A softmax layer is used to classify the driver as drowsy or non-drowsy. This system is hence used for warning the driver of drowsiness or in attention to prevent traffic accidents.

Generally, models are selected by trial and error testing using whole learning samples given in advance. In many cases, however, it is difficult and time consuming to prepare whole learning samples in advance. To overcome these inconveniences, we propose a hybrid on-line learning system for a radial basis function (RBF) network that repeats quick learning of novel instances by rote during on-line periods (awake phases) and repeats pseudo rehearsal for model selection during out-of-service periods (sleep phases). We call this system Incremental Learning with Sleep (ILS). During sleep phases, the system basically stops the learning of novel instances, and during awake phases, the system responds quickly. We also extended the system so as to shorten the periodic sleep periods.

In general, change detection aims to identify interesting changes between a given query image and a reference image of the same scene taken at a different time. This problem becomes a challenging one when query and reference images involve different domains (e.g., time of the day, weather, and season) due to variations in object appearance and a limited amount of training examples. In this study, we address the above issue by leveraging a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our key concept is to use a limited amount of training data to train a GAN-based image translator that maps a reference image to a virtual image that cannot be discriminated from query domain images. This enables us to treat the cross-domain change detection task as an in-domain image comparison. This allows us to leverage the large body of literature on in-domain generic change detectors. In addition, we also consider the use of visual place recognition as a method for mining more appropriate reference images over the space of virtual images.

However, most researches utilize the inner product of latent vectors as the representation of relationships, and they develop some embedding models based on this theory. In this paper, we take deep insight into the existing embedding models and find that utilizing the inner product may increase several problems: 1) in latent space, the inner product among three vectors may violate triangle principle; 2) the inner product cannot measure the relationships between vectors in the same category, such as user and user and item and item; and 3) the inner product cannot catch the collaborative relationships (user-user and item-item) for collaborative filtering. Along with this line, we propose a latent vector embedding model for collaborative filtering: latent dual metric embedding (LDME), which utilizes the dual-Euclidean distance in latent space, instead of the inner product, to represent different types of relationships (user-user, item-item, and user-item) with a uniform framework. Specifically, we design an embedding loss function in LDME, which can measure the close and remote relationships between entities, tackle the above problems, and achieve a more clear, well-explained embedding result.

Motivated to leverage the individual advantages of these techniques, this paper proposes and explores a novel framework, Strength Modelling, where two models are concatenated in a hierarchical framework. In doing this, the strength information of the first model, as represented by its predictions, is joined with the original features, and this expanded feature space is then utilised as the input by the successive model. A major advantage of Strength Modelling, besides its ability to hierarchically explore the strength of different machine learning algorithms, is that it can work together with the conventional feature- and decision-level fusion strategies for multimodal affect recognition. To highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach, extensive experiments have been carried out on two time- and value-continuous spontaneous emotion databases (RECOLA and SEMAINE) using audio and video signals. The experimental results indicate that employing Strength Modelling can deliver a significant performance improvement for both arousal and valence in the unimodal and bimodal settings.

We desire a method for learning a representation of the manifolds induced by identity-preserving transformations that can be used to increase robustness, reduce the training burden, and encourage interpretability in machine learning tasks. In particular, what is needed is a representation of the transformation manifold that can robustly capture the shape of the manifold from the input data, generate new points on the manifold, and extend transformations outside of the training domain without significantly increasing the error. Previous work has proposed algorithms to efficiently learn analytic operators (called transport operators) that define the process of transporting one data point on a manifold to another. The main contribution of this paper is to define two transfer learning methods that use this generative manifold representation to learn natural transformations and incorporate them into new data. The first method uses this representation in a novel randomized approach to transfer learning that employs the learned generative model to map out unseen regions of the data space. These results are shown through demonstrations of transfer learning in a data augmentation task for few-shot image classification. The second method use of transport operators for injecting specific transformations into new data examples which allows for realistic image animation and informed data augmentation. These results are shown on stylized constructions using the classic swiss roll data structure and in demonstrations of transfer learning in a data augmentation task for few-shot image classification.

Here, we developed a machine-learning model to predict p53 status in lower-grade gliomas based on radiomic features extracted from conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images. Methods Preoperative MR images were retrospectively obtained from 272 patients with primary grade II/III gliomas. The patients were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to a training (n = 180) or validation (n = 92) set. A total of 431 radiomic features were extracted from each patient. The lest absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for feature selection and radiomic signature construction. Subsequently, a machine-learning model to predict p53 status was established using the selected features and a Support Vector Machine classifier. The predictive performance of all individual features and the model was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves in both the training and validation sets. Results The p53-related radiomic signature was built using the LASSO algorithm; this procedure consisted of four first-order statistics or related wavelet features (including Maximum, Median, Minimum, and Uniformity), a shape and size-based feature (Spherical Disproportion), and ten textural features or related wavelet features (including Correlation, Run Percentage, and Sum Entropy). The prediction accuracies based on the area under the curve were 89.6% in the training set and 76.3% in the validation set, which were better than individual features. Conclusions These results demonstrate that MR image texture features are predictive of p53 mutation status in lower-grade gliomas.

The automatic description of interactions between humans and environment can be useful for providing: implicit assistance to the people inside the room, context-aware and content-aware information requiring a minimum of human attention or interruptions, support for high-level analysis of the underlying acoustic scene, etc. On the other hand, the recent fast growth of available audio or audiovisual content strongly demands tools for analyzing, indexing, searching and retrieving the available documents. Given an audio document, the first processing step usually is audio segmentation (AS), i.e. the partitioning of the input audio stream into acoustically homogeneous regions which are labelled according to a predefined broad set of classes like speech, music, noise, etc. Acoustic event detection (AED) is the objective of this thesis work. A variety of features coming not only from audio but also from the video modality is proposed to deal with that detection problem in meeting-room and broadcast news domains. Two basic detection approaches are investigated in this work: a joint segmentation and classification using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Gaussian Mixture Densities (GMMs), and a detection-by-classification approach using discriminative Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For the first case, a fast one-pass-training feature selection algorithm is developed in this thesis to select, for each AE class, the subset of multimodal features that shows the best detection rate. AED in meeting-room environments aims at processing the signals collected by distant microphones and video cameras in order to obtain the temporal sequence of (possibly overlapped) AEs that have been produced in the room. When applied to interactive seminars with a certain degree of spontaneity, the detection of acoustic events from only the audio modality alone shows a large amount of errors, which is mostly due to the temporal overlaps of sounds. This thesis includes several novelties regarding the task of multimodal AED. Firstly, the use of video features. Since in the video modality the acoustic sources do not overlap (except for occlusions), the proposed features improve AED in such rather spontaneous scenario recordings. Secondly, the inclusion of acoustic localization features, which, in combination with the usual spectro-temporal audio features, yield a further improvement in recognition rate. Thirdly, the comparison of feature-level and decision-level fusion strategies for the combination of audio and video modalities. In the later case, the system output scores are combined using two statistical approaches: weighted arithmetical mean and fuzzy integral. On the other hand, due to the scarcity of annotated multimodal data, and, in particular, of data with temporal sound overlaps, a new multimodal database with a rich variety of meeting-room AEs has been recorded and manually annotated, and it has been made publicly available for research purposes.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "795299307", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6082942", "6012019"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18224226"}

Because of inherent artifacts of the ultrasound images, such as speckle, acoustic shadows and blurry edges, the detection of lesions is not an easy task. In this work we propose a machine learning based approach to locate lesions in breast ultrasound images. This approach consists on the classification of image pixels as lesion or background with a Random Forest optimized with genetic algorithms to generate candidate regions. After pixel classification the method chooses the correct lesion region by discriminating false positives using a new proposed probability approach.

Using microarray data sets, clustering algorithms have been actively utilized in order to identify groups of co-expressed genes. This article poses the problem of fuzzy clustering in microarray data as a multiobjective optimization problem which simultaneously optimizes two internal fuzzy cluster validity indices to yield a set of Pareto-optimal clustering solutions. Each of these clustering solutions possesses some amount of information regarding the clustering structure of the input data. Motivated by this fact, a novel fuzzy majority voting approach is proposed to combine the clustering information from all the solutions in the resultant Pareto-optimal set. This approach first identifies the genes which are assigned to some particular cluster with high membership degree by most of the Pareto-optimal solutions. Using this set of genes as the training set, the remaining genes are classified by a supervised learning algorithm. In this work, we have used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for this purpose.ResultsThe performance of the proposed clustering technique has been demonstrated on five publicly available benchmark microarray data sets, viz., Yeast Sporulation, Yeast Cell Cycle, Arabidopsis Thaliana, Human Fibroblasts Serum and Rat Central Nervous System. Comparative studies of the use of different SVM kernels and several widely used microarray clustering techniques are reported. Moreover, statistical significance tests have been carried out to establish the statistical superiority of the proposed clustering approach. Finally, biological significance tests have been carried out using a web based gene annotation tool to show that the proposed method is able to produce biologically relevant clusters of co-expressed genes.ConclusionThe proposed clustering method has been shown to perform better than other well-known clustering algorithms in finding clusters of co-expressed genes efficiently. The clusters of genes produced by the proposed technique are also found to be biologically significant, i.e., consist of genes which belong to the same functional groups. This indicates that the proposed clustering method can be used efficiently to identify co-expressed genes in microarray gene expression data.Supplementary Website The pre-processed and normalized data sets, the matlab code and other related materials are available at http://anirbanmukhopadhyay.50webs.com/mogasvm.html.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2657792", "pubmed_id": "19154590", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-10-27", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2018744542", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4382833", "29535089", "30806637", "11912769", "15681914", "15097715", "23718398", "2604670", "28637672", "14133895", "16194837", "12576470", "14435293", "29901610", "5428395", "12107321", "17338385", "415414", "59726196", "10151608", "18462460", "14688842", "62582177", "16584254", "14561315", "24107017", "189900", "2783616", "17648602"], "inbound_citations": ["29188518", "215091526", "215091526", "27487154", "52078820", "5949417", "17097998", "1305719", "8959327", "19516905", "1079372", "3707723", "215551527", "17477863", "51615172", "6118652", "2220189", "17240638", "1963129", "1963129", "210837990", "17763392", "7204934", "1655220", "17990454", "57193319", "34539400", "24412303", "35965914", "2949343", "2956656", "1807841", "51879372", "24634954", "46936382", "53633190", "9923346", "18260581", "17160051", "31798194", "52294564", "60810426", "52029772", "51607840", "15886529", "11406613", "13192356", "15345683", "16218273", "11090813", "51805423", "51945231", "51945231", "2250247", "11432576", "15134650", "1297182", "6308492", "14118855"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1788029"}

Dimensionality and noise reduction improves both efficiency and accuracy, while retaining essential information. Among the many dimensionality reduction methods, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is one of the most popular techniques. However, ICA is computationally costly, and given the absence of specific criteria for component selection, constrains its application in high-dimension data analysis. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that applies Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as preprocessing for ICA. Our method exploits the unique capacity of DCT to pack signal energy in few low-frequency coefficients, thus reducing noise and computation time. Subsequently, ICA is applied on this reduced data to make the output components as independent as possible for subsequent hyperspectral classification. To evaluate this novel approach, the reduced data using (1) ICA without preprocessing; (2) ICA with the commonly used preprocessing techniques which is Principal Component Analysis (PCA); and (3) ICA with DCT preprocessing are tested with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifiers on two real hyperspectral datasets.

In this paper we present two novel algorithms: R-SVM \u00b5+--a SVM radius-margin based feature selection algorithm, and R-SVM+-- a metric learning-based SVM. We derive our algorithms by exploiting a new tighter approximation of the radius and a metric learning interpretation of SVM. Both optimize directly the radius-margin error bound using linear transformations. Unlike almost all existing radius-margin based SVM algorithms which are either non-convex or combinatorial, our algorithms are standard quadratic convex optimization problems with linear or quadratic constraints. We perform a number of experiments on benchmark datasets. R-SVM\u00b5+ exhibits excellent feature selection performance compared to the state-of-the-art feature selection methods, such as L1-norm and elastic-net based methods. R-SVM+ achieves a significantly better classification performance compared to SVM and its other state-of-the-art variants.

The literature does not, however, provide quantitative descriptions of how these algorithms behave in different circumstances. In this paper we study how the clusterings produced by different DSCAs change, relative to the ground truth, as quantitatively different types of concept drift are encountered. This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, we propose a method for generating real-valued data streams with precise quantitative concept drift. Second, we conduct an experimental study to provide quantitative analyses of DSCA performance with synthetic real-valued data streams and show how to apply this knowledge to real world data streams. We find that large magnitude and short duration concept drifts are most challenging and that DSCAs with partitioning-based offline clustering methods are generally more robust than those with density-based offline clustering methods. Our results further indicate that increasing the number of classes present in a stream is a more challenging environment than decreasing the number of classes.

Meta-modelling can be used to deal with the burden of computations in which a surrogate model, running of which is much faster than the exact simulation model, is used instead of the simulation model.

A recurrent neural network using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture is employed as the prediction model, and compared against Random Forest (RF), the solution used in industrial deployment at the moment.

Transfer learning requires some amount of fine-tuning on the real robot. For tasks which involve complex (non-linear) dynamics, the fine-tuning itself may take a substantial amount of time. In order to reduce the amount of fine-tuning we propose to learn robustified controllers in simulation. Robustified controllers are learned by exploiting the ability to change simulation parameters (both appearance and dynamics) for successive training episodes. An additional benefit for this approach is that it alleviates the precise determination of physics parameters for the simulator, which is a non-trivial task. We demonstrate our proposed approach on a real setup in which a robot aims to solve a maze game, which involves complex dynamics due to static friction and potentially large accelerations.

However, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) techniques can help the doctor make more reliable decisions.

The RL algorithm used in the first phase is the Q-learning and in the third phase is the recently proposed Case-based Heuristically Accelerated Q-learning. A set of empirical evaluations were conducted in transferring the learning between two domains, the Acrobot and the Robocup 3D: the policy learned during the solution of the Acrobot Problem is transferred and used to speed up the learning of stability policies for a humanoid robot in the Robocup 3D simulator.

The second front involves reframing the problem to simpler single-label multi-class classification and generating a multi-label multi-class prediction on a given movie poster as input.

Also, how do we rank a group of images precisely and efficiently for specific queries? These problems are critical for researchers and engineers to generate a novel image searching engine. First, it is important to obtain an appropriate description that effectively represent the images. In this paper, multimodal features are considered for describing images. The images unique properties are reflected by visual features, which are correlated to each other. However, semantic gaps always exist between images visual features and semantics. Therefore, we utilize click feature to reduce the semantic gap. The second key issue is learning an appropriate distance metric to combine these multimodal features. This paper develops a novel deep multimodal distance metric learning (Deep-MDML) method. A structured ranking model is adopted to utilize both visual and click features in distance metric learning (DML). Specifically, images and their related ranking results are first collected to form the training set. Multimodal features, including click and visual features, are collected with these images. Next, a group of autoencoders is applied to obtain initially a distance metric in different visual spaces, and an MDML method is used to assign optimal weights for different modalities. Next, we conduct alternating optimization to train the ranking model, which is used for the ranking of new queries with click features. Compared with existing image ranking methods, the proposed method adopts a new ranking model to use multimodal features, including click features and visual features in DML. We operated experiments to analyze the proposed Deep-MDML in two benchmark data sets, and the results validate the effects of the method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27529881", "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2016.2591583", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2497173630", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3424840", "3401305", "15231175", "4964720", "401761", "387449", "12849486", "10754483", "110716", "41630036", "2920441", "47312243", "5667114", "5258236", "6029228", "4274991", "20526839", "47325215", "15275534", "8740155", "26538880", "2754209", "17986384", "23579047", "3344397", "207763512", "11102127", "206592615", "206592484", "1241368", "3217198", "6650708", "15458908", "18169720", "22015539", "207605508", "28826624", "16342601", "12815222", "8923487", "2955919", "16837848", "14130958", "8616518", "1845522", "17671150", "14987948", "1970173", "508435", "20324757", "23344070", "207178999", "564746", "5155714", "12752611", "735750", "1981391"], "inbound_citations": ["19365258", "31177730", "22297626", "167211057", "195189792", "88494904", "23213492", "52915708", "21128482", "208261341", "204194411", "23584221", "208633957", "55729258", "52968048", "57428352", "53100739", "10361107", "54495812", "49434640", "182044848", "58543196", "3561597", "204919752", "52824644", "3626623", "1491930", "51626057", "46857537", "209912612", "199474003", "3864678", "848427", "52814662", "1793049", "211506084", "19123404", "3991565", "33221473", "50418", "201117801", "204886853", "46986655", "50779159", "209339399", "212704982", "204081594", "21146128", "201810004", "202558078", "3470977", "46805536", "198190524", "199439563", "195817232", "121128564", "21653932", "35112818", "52959725", "28430012", "19719621", "4848457", "22101860", "25911376", "201058113", "25500439", "4379845", "696551", "201094283", "70335317", "210697188", "208883628", "172131758", "204887647", "903922", "3852282", "36106290", "53187376", "201710040", "145882000", "52275690", "3606710", "3767657", "16962771", "2013783", "203654430", "199679975", "19096101", "49191761", "8811996", "210872916", "209930687", "214691263", "52977078", "13179792", "139107999", "17015993", "52053312", "208650352", "49295360", "47019927", "208044719", "3606146", "49576345", "49650627", "24383110", "202578017", "201285237", "204939903", "207913202", "198131471", "209900694", "127067164", "49867525", "85515533", "165163993", "4655398", "201653169", "47020034", "12634124", "41776526", "210848929", "32137540", "132609491", "8315188", "207993833", "71145954", "24788492"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22541202"}

This paper exposes a previously unknown incompleteness of Progol5 with respect to Bottom Generalisation, and proposes a new approach, called Hybrid Abductive Inductive Learning, that integrates the ILP principles of Progol5 with Abductive Logic Programming (ALP). A proof procedure is proposed, called HAIL, that not only overcomes this newly discovered incompleteness, but further generalises Progol5 by computing multiple clauses in response to a single seed example and deriving hypotheses outside Plotkin\u2019s relative subsumption.

Since these continuous seizures may cause permanent brain damage, it constitutes a medical emergency. This paper proposes a method to detect nonconvulsive seizures for a further nonconvulsive status epilepticus diagnosis. To differentiate between the normal and seizure electroencephalogram (EEG), a K-Nearest Neighbor, a Radial Basis Support Vector Machine, and a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier are used. The classifier features are obtained from the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) and Block Term Decomposition of the EEG data represented as third order tensor. To expand the EEG into a tensor, Wavelet or Hilbert-Huang transform are used. The algorithm is tested on a scalp EEG database of 139 seizures of different duration. The experimental results suggest that a Hilbert-Huang tensor representation and the CPD analysis provide the most suitable framework for nonconvulsive seizure detection. The Radial Basis Support Vector Machine classifier shows the best performance with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values over 98%. A rough comparison with other methods proposed in the literature shows the superior performance of the proposed method for nonconvulsive epileptic seizure detection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29994034", "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2018.2829877", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2799582985", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13712617", "19419044", "56550547", "7267525", "61479493", "18060030", "30980416", "36329658", "5916392", "15262155", "17923954", "17331321", "205752065", "14234266", "43995048", "41005583", "30144312", "40076790", "13239881", "6042413", "38385500", "1262186", "12250529", "147233160", "9252007", "7075447", "122056150", "14809982", "7500426", "123231383", "875376", "21152241", "16235752", "3889205", "3522546", "45676237"], "inbound_citations": ["207973134", "204230522", "86599835", "202777422", "210906567"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51612024"}

Many billionaires, experts, pundits and even the government are looking for many amendments in H-1B to abolish this by bringing in a merit system or increasing the minimum wages to awarding these visas. We attempt to analyze the petitions filed by 2011-16 and classify the petitions filed as positive or negative, indicating whether the petition is highly skilled or not. After classifying, we build a model using Random Forest to predict any visa petition in any state of the US as positive or negative. Experimental results show the companies that are classified as abusing these visas (negative) are well consistent with the ones shown in reports and news articles", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.09737", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2770410517", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8901879"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19052212"}

Since, it degrades the classification accuracy due to information loss during features extraction using speech signals. In previous researches, Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) coefficients were extracted by using Blackman windowing method along with the other features of speech signal to improve the classification accuracy. However, still some information was lost at those window edges which degrade the recognition accuracy and also more efficient features were required to improve the classification performance. Hence in this paper, SGC is improved by extracting the PLP coefficients based on novel windowing technique. In this technique, initially type-1 features such as spectral and prosodic features of speech signal are extracted. In addition, Information Preserving Perceptual Linear Prediction (IPPLP) coefficients are also extracted using Slepian windowing method. Moreover, the frequency-dependent transmission characteristics of the outer ear are compensated based on the analysis of time-varying Equal Loudness Contour (ELC) curves and Peak-to-Loudness Ratio (PLR). After that, the extracted IPPLP features are fused with type-1 features and classified by using different combinations of classifiers like Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and GMM supervectors-based SVM at score level fusion scheme.

We present two Reservoir Computing architectures, which loosely resemble neural dynamics, and show that a Reservoir Computer (RC) trained to identify relationships between image pairs drawn from a subset of training classes generalizes the learned relationships to substantially different classes unseen during training. We demonstrate our results on the simple MNIST handwritten digit database as well as a database of depth maps of visual scenes in videos taken from a moving camera. We consider image pair relationships such as images from the same class; images from the same class with one image superposed with noise, rotated 90\u00b0, blurred, or scaled; images from different classes. We observe that the reservoir acts as a nonlinear filter projecting the input into a higher dimensional space in which the relationships are separable; i.e., the reservoir system state trajectories display different dynamical patterns that reflect the corresponding input pair relationships. Thus, as opposed to training in the entire high-dimensional reservoir space, the RC only needs to learns characteristic features of these dynamical patterns, allowing it to perform well with very few training examples compared with conventional machine learning feed-forward techniques such as deep learning. In generalization tasks, we observe that RCs perform significantly better than state-of-the-art, feed-forward, pair-based architectures such as convolutional and deep Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs). We also show that RCs can not only generalize relationships, but also generalize combinations of relationships, providing robust and effective image pair classification.

Although existing feature selection methods have achieved promising progress, human factors have seldom been taken into account. To tackle such a problem, a novel two-stage feature selection method is proposed for image classification by taking human factors into account and leveraging the value of eye tracking data. In the coarse selection stage, with the help of eye tracking data, Regions of Interests (ROIs) from the human perspective are first identified to represent an image with visual features. Then, with an improved quantum genetic algorithm (IQGA) that incorporates a novel mutation strategy for alleviating the premature convergence, a subset of features is obtained for the subsequent fine selection. In the fine selection stage, a hybrid method is proposed to integrate the efficiency of the minimal-Redundancy-Maximal-Relevance (mRMR) and the effectiveness of the Support Vector Machine based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE). In particular, the ranking criterion of the SVM-RFE is improved by incorporating the ranking information obtained from the mRMR.

Putting all these data in simple-to-use databases is a first step; but realizing the full potential of the data requires algorithms that automatically extract regularities from the data, which can then lead to biological insight. ::: ::: Many of the problems in computational biology are in the form of prediction: starting from prediction of a gene's structure, prediction of its function, interactions, and role in disease. Support vector machines (SVMs) and related kernel methods are extremely good at solving such problems [1]\u2013[3]. SVMs are widely used in computational biology due to their high accuracy, their ability to deal with high-dimensional and large datasets, and their flexibility in modeling diverse sources of data [2], [4]\u2013[6]. ::: ::: The simplest form of a prediction problem is binary classification: trying to discriminate between objects that belong to one of two categories\u2014positive (+1) or negative (\u22121). SVMs use two key concepts to solve this problem: large margin separation and kernel functions. The idea of large margin separation can be motivated by classification of points in two dimensions (see Figure 1). A simple way to classify the points is to draw a straight line and call points lying on one side positive and on the other side negative. If the two sets are well separated, one would intuitively draw the separating line such that it is as far as possible away from the points in both sets (see Figures 2 and \u200band3).3). This intuitive choice captures the idea of large margin separation, which is mathematically formulated in the section Classification with Large Margin. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: A linear classifier separating two classes of points (squares and circles) in two dimensions. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 2 ::: ::: The maximum margin boundary computed by a linear SVM. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 3 ::: ::: The effect of the soft-margin constant, C, on the decision boundary. ::: ::: ::: ::: Instead of the abstract idea of points in space, one can think of our data points as representing objects using a set of features derived from measurements performed on each object. For instance, in the case of Figures 1\u2013\u200b\u200b\u200b5,5, there are two measurements for each object, depicted as points in a two-dimensional space. For large margin separation, it turns out that not the exact location but only the relative position or similarity of the points to each other is important. In the simplest case of linear classification, the similarity of two objects is computed by the dot-product (a.k.a. scalar or inner product) between the corresponding feature vectors. To define different similarity measures leading to nonlinear classification boundaries (cf. Figures 6 and \u200band7),7), one can extend the idea of dot products between points with the help of kernel functions (cf. the section Kernels: From Linear to Nonlinear Classifiers). Kernels compute the similarity of two points and are the second important concept of SVMs and kernel methods [2],[7]. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 4 ::: ::: The major steps in protein synthesis: transcription, post-processing, and translation. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 5 ::: ::: Sequence logo for acceptor splice sites: splice sites have quite strong consensus sequences, i.e., almost every position in a small window around the splice site is representative of the most frequently occurring nucleotide when many existing sequences ... ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 6 ::: ::: The effect of the degree of a polynomial kernel. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 7 ::: ::: The effect of the width parameter of the Gaussian kernel (\u03c3) for a fixed value of the soft-margin constant. ::: ::: ::: ::: The domain knowledge inherent in any classification task is captured by defining a suitable kernel (i.e., similarity) between objects. As we shall see later, this has two advantages: the ability to generate nonlinear decision boundaries using methods designed for linear classifiers; and the possibility of applying a classifier to data that have no obvious vector space representation; for example, DNA/RNA, or protein sequences, or protein structures. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Running example: Splice site recognition ::: Throughout this tutorial we are going to use an example problem for illustration. It is a problem arising in computational gene finding and concerns the recognition of splice sites that mark the boundaries between exons and introns in eukaryotes. Introns are excised from premature mRNAs in a processing step after transcription (see Figure 4 and, for instance, [8]\u2013[12] for more details). ::: ::: The vast majority of all splice sites are characterized by the presence of specific dimers on the intronic side of the splice site: GT for donor and AG for acceptor sites (see Figure 5). However, only about 0.1%\u20131% of all GT and AG occurrences in the genome represent true splice sites. In this tutorial, we consider the problem of recognizing acceptor splice sites as a running example, which allows us to illustrate different properties of SVMs using different kernels (similar results can be obtained for donor splice sites as well [13]). ::: ::: In the first part of the tutorial we are going to use real-valued features describing the sequence surrounding the splice site. For illustration purposes, we use only two features: the GC content in the exon and intron flanking potential acceptor sites. These features are motivated by the fact that the GC-content of exons is typically higher than that of introns (see, e.g., Figure 1). In the second part, we show how to take advantage of the flanking pre-mRNA sequence itself, leading to considerable performance improvements. (The data used in the numerical examples was generated by taking a random subset of 200 true splice sites and 2,000 decoy sites from the first 100,000 entries in the C. elegans acceptor splice site dataset from [13] (cf. http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/splice). Note that this dataset is much smaller than the original dataset, and is also less unbalanced. In the graphical examples in this tutorial, we show only a small and selected subset of the data suitable for illustration purposes. In practice, there is a considerably stronger overlap in the space of GC content between positive examples (true acceptor sites) and negative examples (other occurrences of AG) than appears on the figures. ::: ::: To evaluate the classifier performance, we will use so-called receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [14], which show the true positive rates (y-axis) over the full range of false positive rates (x-axis). Different values are obtained by using different thresholds on the value of the discriminant function for assigning the class membership. The area under the curve quantifies the quality of the classifier, and a larger value indicates better performance.

It tries to achieve predictions several steps ahead into the future starting from current information. The interest in this work is the development of nonlinear neural models for the purpose of building multi-step time series prediction schemes. In that context, the most popular neural models are based on the traditional feedforward neural networks. However, this kind of model may present some disadvantages when a long-term prediction problem is formulated because they are trained to predict only the next sampling time. In this paper, a neural model based on a partially recurrent neural network is proposed as a better alternative. For the recurrent model, a learning phase with the purpose of long-term prediction is imposed, which allows to obtain better predictions of time series in the future. In order to validate the performance of the recurrent neural model to predict the dynamic behaviour of the series in the future, three different data time series have been used as study cases. An artificial data time series, the logistic map, and two real time series, sunspots and laser data. Models based on feedforward neural networks have also been used and compared against the proposed model.

Generally, gait studies quantify human gait characteristics under natural walking speeds while mainly considering upper body movements. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to investigate the influence of different walking speeds on different gait parameters of both the upper and lower body, as a result of disabilities caused by Cerebellar Ataxia (CA). We employed wearable sensor technology to identify the kinematic characteristics which best identify the gait abnormalities seen in CA. Measurements were made at self-selected slow, preferred and fast walking speeds. Velocity irregularity and resonant frequency characteristics were identified as key features of truncal and lower limb movements respectively. Subsequently, the differentiating features for both trunk and lower limb movements were combined to produce an even greater separation between the patients and the normal subjects, as well as better correlation with the expert clinical assessment (ECA) (0.86) and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) (0.62). The different speed of walking conditions resulted in varying degrees of the separation and the correlation. Moreover, the contribution of the extracted features was examined using the random forest algorithm. Clinically observable truncal medio-lateral movements express the disability at relatively slow gait speeds while the anterior-posterior movements captured by the sensory mechanisms characterises the disability across all walking speeds.

This study utilizes Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), machine learning based interval estimation (MLIE), and Differential Evolution (DE) to establish a novel model for predicting construction project cost. LS-SVM is a supervised learning technique used for regression analysis. MLIE is employed for inference of prediction intervals.

In particular we compare two non-linear, discriminative regression strategies for predicting shape updates, a boosting approach and variants of Random Forest regression. We investigate the use of these regression methods within a sequential model fitting framework, where each stage in the sequence consists of a shape model and a corresponding regression model. The performance of the framework is assessed by both testing on unseen data taken from within the training databases, as well as by investigating the more difficult task of generalising to unrelated datasets.

This may cause inaccurate covariance estimation, which results to lower accuracy performance. In this study, a masking covariance matrix is introduced based on the functionality of brain region.

Conventional techniques achieve either visual quality or image diversity; the improvement in one side is often the result of sacrificing the degradation in the other side. In this paper, we aim to achieve both simultaneously by improving the stability of training GANs. A key idea of the proposed approach is to implicitly regularizing the discriminator using a representative feature.

We tested this approach, along with standard regression and Random Forest modeling techniques, in a northern hardwood-dominated watershed in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Additional objectives included assessing the effects of different inventory plot designs and GPS accuracy. The universal model performed poorly in this forested landscape due to the lack of a clear relationship between canopy height and stand basal area. Simple regression modeling also produced poor model fits; the Random Forest models produced somewhat better biomass predictions than either the universal or regression models, and had low predictive power as measured by R2 but root mean squared errors were comparable to those from other studies in complex forests.

The Generative adversarial network (GAN) is used in the dialogue generation, in previous works to build dialogue agents by selecting the optimal policy learning. The efficient dialogue policy learning aims to improve the quality of fluency and diversity for generated dialogues. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are used to optimize the policies because the sequence is discrete. In this study, we have proposed a new technique called Cascade Generative Adversarial Network (Cas-GAN) that is combination of the GAN and RL for dialog generation.

It is observed that some misbehaved drivers do not use turn indicators forehead a lane change on highway. For a self-driving car in such situations, a lane change is potentially dangerous without an accurate estimation of other vehicles\u2019 movements .If lane changes can be detected or predicted at its initial phase, DAVI vehicle can be advised in time to perform corresponding maneuvers to avoid collision. In this study, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method was proposed to fulfil this task. Predictions are generated through analysing vehicles\u2019 motion parameters. At the first place, a number of driving simulator tests were carried out to set up database of typical vehicle maneuvers features, including heading angle, yaw rate, lateral velocity and lateral acceleration. 14 driver databases were used in SVM training after removal of unrealistic info. An off-line trained SVM was obtained to perform lane change predictions. In addition to offline training, an incremental training SVM was introduced. Compared with off-line learning, its incremental feature enables the classifier to update itself with freshly recorded lane change data in a relatively short time. This enables the vehicle to be \"learning while predicting\" . Based on the databases, SVM based approaches were verified to be feasible of predicting lane changes. With the most optimal parameter combination, this method is able to perform predictions with 100% sensitivity ( predicted all lane changes successfully). Average advance time and average computational time are acceptable for automatic driving. Besides, the performance of sliding window method was evaluated for variation of its size, and a general applicability of overall prediction method was also examined on data from different drivers.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "202360911", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108071109"}

Such systems collect visible-wavelength color imagery of plant roots in-situ by scanning an imaging system within a clear tube driven into the soil. Automated analysis of root systems could facilitate new scientific discoveries that would be critical to address the world's pressing food, resource, and climate issues. A key component of automated analysis of plant roots from imagery is the automated pixel-level segmentation of roots from their surrounding soil. Supervised learning techniques appear to be an appropriate tool for the challenge due to varying local soil and root conditions, however, lack of enough annotated training data is a major limitation due to the error-prone and time-consuming manually labeling process. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep neural networks based on the U-net architecture for automated, precise pixel-wise root segmentation in minirhizotron imagery. We compiled two minirhizotron image datasets to accomplish this study: one with 17,550 peanut root images and another with 28 switchgrass root images. Both datasets were paired with manually labeled ground truth masks. We trained three neural networks with different architectures on the larger peanut root dataset to explore the effect of the neural network depth on segmentation performance. To tackle the more limited switchgrass root dataset, we showed that models initialized with features pre-trained on the peanut dataset and then fine-tuned on the switchgrass dataset can improve segmentation performance significantly. We obtained 99\\% segmentation accuracy in switchgrass imagery using only 21 training images.

PD patients were clinically defined as tremor dominant, postural instability-gait difficulties or mixed phenotype. All 65 subjects performed seven MDS-UPDRS III motor tasks wearing inertial sensors: rest tremor, postural tremor, rapid alternating hand movement, foot tapping, heel-to-toe tapping, Timed-Up-and-Go test (TUG) and pull test. The most relevant motor tasks were found combining ReliefF ranking and Kruskal- Wallis feature-selection methods. We used these features, linked to the relevant motor tasks, to highlight differences between PD from HC, by means of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

To quantify the impact of seabed properties on higher moment statistics, scattered amplitudes were acquired at various sites displaying a large spectrum of seabed properties. Concurrent measurements of the seabed properties were conducted using two-dimensional stereo-photogrammetry, core and grab samples, videos and seabed penetrometers. To complement this experimental work, a temporal snapshot model based on the fourth order small slope approximation for interface scattering and on the small perturbation theory for the volume has been developed.

Since the convolutional neural networks (CNN) have excellent capability of feature extraction, certain deep learning methods have been recently applied in person re-identification. However, in person re-identification, the deep networks often suffer from the over-fitting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based method to learn a discriminative metric with good robustness to the over-fitting problem in person re-identification. Firstly, a novel deep architecture is built where the Mahalanobis metric is learned with a weight constraint. This weight constraint is used to regularize the learning, so that the learned metric has a better generalization ability. Secondly, we find that the selection of intra-class sample pairs is crucial for learning but has received little attention. To cope with the large intra-class variations in pedestrian images, we propose a novel training strategy named moderate positive mining to prevent the training process from over-fitting to the extreme samples in intra-class pairs.

They are very simple and efficiently provide life-like speech thanks to the use of concatenative speech synthesis. We describe a technique which allows to continuously control both the age of a synthetic voice and the quantity of emotions that are expressed. Also, we present the first large-scale data mining experiment about the automatic recognition of basic emotions in informal everyday short utterances. We focus on the speaker-dependent problem. We compare a large set of machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks, Support Vector Machines or decision trees, together with 200 features, using a large database of several thousands examples. We show that the difference of performance among learning schemes can be substantial, and that some features which were previously unexplored are of crucial importance. An optimal feature set is derived through the use of a genetic algorithm. Finally, we explain how this study can be applied to real world situations in which very few examples are available.

In this paper, we propose a symmetry-aware face completion method based on facial structural features using a deep generative model. The model is trained with a combination of a reconstruction loss, a structure loss, two adversarial losses and a symmetry loss, which ensures pixel faithfulness, local-global contents integrity and symmetrical consistency. We conduct a dedicated symmetry detection technique for facial components and show that the symmetrical attention module significantly improves face completion results. Experiments show that our method is capable of synthesizing semantically valid and visually plausible contents for the missing facial key parts from random mask.

Hence, considerable amount of work has been published recently that aim to predict the error in a registration without any human effort. If provided, these error predictions can be used as a feedback to the registration algorithm to further improve its performance. Recent methods generally start with extracting image-based and deformation-based features, then apply feature pooling and finally train a Random Forest (RF) regressor to predict the real registration error. Image-based features can be calculated after applying a single registration but provide limited accuracy whereas deformation-based features such as variation of deformation vector field may require up to 20 registrations which is a considerably high time-consuming task. This paper proposes to use extracted features from a local search algorithm as image-based features to estimate the error of a registration. The proposed method comprises a local search algorithm to find corresponding voxels between registered image pairs and based on the amount of shifts and stereo confidence measures, it predicts the amount of registration error in millimetres densely using a RF regressor. Compared to other algorithms in the literature, the proposed algorithm does not require multiple registrations, can be efficiently implemented on a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) and can still provide highly accurate error predictions in existence of large registration error.

In particular, it does not scale well to large corpora, primarily because it proposes the sentence as the main unit of analysis. In this paper, we will present a connectionist version of the SP model that operates at the word level and demonstrate that it is able to to predict when words will be used with some precision. We introduce a connectionist version of the Syntagmatic Paradigmatic model (Dennis, 2005) and train it on subcorpora drawn from the gigaword corpus. Decaying syntagmatic repre- sentations of the words to the left and right are used to estimate the paradigmatic associates of a word. The pattern of paradig- matic associates is then combined with an order independent associative representation of the surrounding words to predict the word that will appear in a given slot. The best performing version of the model produced a perplexity of 28.3 on a vocab- ulary of 5006 words, significantly lower than Good Turing and Kneser Ney ngram models trained under the same conditions. Furthermore, we changed parameters and lesioned compo- nents to isolate which properties of the model are critical to its performance. Online update of the weights - a kind of priming - allows the model to track short term contingencies and signif- icantly improves performance. When we removed the paradig- matic and associative layers performance dropped, when we removed just the associative layer performance dropped and when we removed the right context from the syntagmatic and associative layers performance also dropped - suggesting that all of the hypothesized components of the model are crucial to its performance. Keywords: syntagmatic, paradigmatic, sentence processing, perplexity, connectionist The Model Output Units Associative Units Introduction Dennis (2005) introduced the Syntagmatic Paradigmatic model as a general account of verbal cognition. It is based on the distinction between syntagmatic associations that oc- cur between words that appear together in utterances (e.g. run fast) and paradigmatic associations that occur between words that appear in similar contexts, but not necessarily in the same utterances (e.g. deep and shallow, cf. Ervin-Tripp, 1970). The model has been used to explain a number of phenomena including long term grammatical dependencies and systematicity (Dennis, 2005), the extraction of statisti- cal lexical information (syntactic, semantic and associative) from corpora (Dennis, 2003a), sentence priming (Harrington & Dennis, 2003), verbal categorization and property judg- ment tasks (Dennis, 2005), serial recall (Dennis, 2003b), and relational extraction and inference (Dennis, 2005, 2004). Previous instantiations of the model have used string edit theory (SET) as a way of capturing the notion of paradig- matic association. While SET has been a fruitful mechanism Paradigmatic Units Syntagmatic Units Syntagmatic Units (before) (after) Figure 1: The syntagmatic paradigmatic model Our connectionist implementation of the SP model has five main sets of units arranged into a two layer architecture. The initial syntagmatic inputs consist of two sets of units each of which contain a unit for each word in the vocabulary of the system. The syntagmatic units (before) represent the words that appear before a given word within the sentence, while the syntagmatic units (after) represent those words that ap- pear after the word.

In this work, we exploit the idea of progressive growing of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for higher resolution video generation. In particular, we begin to produce video samples of low-resolution and short-duration, and then progressively increase both resolution and duration alone (or jointly) by adding new spatiotemporal convolutional layers to the current networks. Starting from the learning on a very raw-level spatial appearance and temporal movement of the video distribution, the proposed progressive method learns spatiotemporal information incrementally to generate higher resolution videos. Furthermore, we introduce a sliced version of Wasserstein GAN (SWGAN) loss to improve the distribution learning on the video data of high-dimension and mixed-spatiotemporal distribution. SWGAN loss replaces the distance between joint distributions by that of one-dimensional marginal distributions, making the loss easier to compute.

Generally, the image recognition task involves two subtasks: image representation and image classification. Most feature extraction approaches for image representation developed so far regard independent component analysis (ICA) as one of the essential means. However, ICA has been hampered by its extremely expensive computational cost in real-time implementation. To address this problem, a fast cognitive computational scheme for image recognition is presented in this paper, which combines ICA and the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. It tries to solve the image recognition problem at a much faster speed by using ELM not only in image classification but also in feature extraction for image representation. As an example, our proposed approach is applied to the face image recognition with detailed analysis. Firstly, common feature hypothesis is introduced to extract the common visual features from universal images by the traditional ICA model in the offline recognition process, and then ELM is used to simulate ICA for the purpose of facial feature extraction in the online recognition process. Lastly, the resulting independent feature representation of the face images extracted by ELM rather than ICA will be fed into the ELM classifier, which is composed of numerous single hidden layer feed-forward networks.

Recently, feature learning-based shape retrieval methods have been widely studied, where the distance metrics between 3-D shape descriptors are usually hand-crafted. In this paper, motivated by the fact that deep neural network has the good ability to model nonlinearity, we propose to learn an effective nonlinear distance metric between 3-D shape descriptors for retrieval. First, the locality-constrained linear coding method is employed to encode each vertex on the shape and the encoding coefficient histogram is formed as the global 3-D shape descriptor to represent the shape. Then, a novel deep metric network is proposed to learn a nonlinear transformation to map the 3-D shape descriptors to a nonlinear feature space. The proposed deep metric network minimizes a discriminative loss function that can enforce the similarity between a pair of samples from the same class to be small and the similarity between a pair of samples from different classes to be large. Finally, the distance between the outputs of the metric network is used as the similarity for shape retrieval. The proposed method is evaluated on the McGill, SHREC'10 ShapeGoogle, and SHREC'14 Human shape datasets.

Since CT image intensities are directly related to positron emission tomography (PET) attenuation coefficients, they are indispensable for attenuation correction (AC) of the PET images. However, due to the relatively high dose of radiation exposure in CT scan, it is advised to limit the acquisition of CT images. In addition, in the new PET and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanner, only MR images are available, which are unfortunately not directly applicable to AC. These issues greatly motivate the development of methods for reliable estimate of CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject. In this paper, we propose a learning-based method to tackle this challenging problem. Specifically, we first partition a given MR image into a set of patches. Then, for each patch, we use the structured random forest to directly predict a CT patch as a structured output, where a new ensemble model is also used to ensure the robust prediction. Image features are innovatively crafted to achieve multi-level sensitivity, with spatial information integrated through only rigid-body alignment to help avoiding the error-prone inter-subject deformable registration. Moreover, we use an auto-context model to iteratively refine the prediction. Finally, we combine all of the predicted CT patches to obtain the final prediction for the given MR image. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two datasets: human brain and prostate images. Experimental results show that our method can accurately predict CT images in various scenarios, even for the images undergoing large shape variation, and also outperforms two state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4703527", "pubmed_id": "26241970", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2015.2461533", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2208340121", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["413926", "75497666", "1656678", "8466695", "451019", "15261328", "43914828", "41412638", "33052332", "28002245", "9494752", "6699302", "2926046", "3176907", "11867508", "1209889", "9559147", "15850341", "2715202", "9385343", "60265938", "17821565", "44460266", "63115125", "10702897", "129468", "1344879", "6628577", "2177465", "7677466"], "inbound_citations": ["54447952", "204816310", "53106563", "4972872", "51629280", "214795218", "29787632", "23396922", "210995727", "52173099", "55569363", "16628328", "201235776", "204817976", "4555696", "182905790", "195892000", "5658128", "53010261", "149493149", "49544315", "126304001", "3699622", "73511202", "108379974", "208202260", "73499599", "59232699", "35400056", "96421589", "3285215", "204754391", "53721101", "4864127", "6047818", "5078659", "23514450", "59601340", "206705478", "88515926", "201099680", "214605700", "49332999", "35411557", "3955080", "22848456", "2953744", "102352365", "73440963", "52278044", "13166434", "88517642", "52111591", "52314303", "53032488", "195766482", "44068082", "37155727", "212642213", "211830523", "208206044", "201660515", "202151746", "51614024", "49298083", "4668471", "197453915", "203704051", "201058618", "199543345", "7177735", "21743983", "126261702", "201892964"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6758477"}

The training data is randomly split into a number of mutually exclusive partitions defined by a row and column parameter. Each partition forms an input space and is transformed by an automatically selected kernel function into a kernel matrix K. Subsequently, each K is used as training data for a base binary classifier (Random Forest). This results in a number of predictions equal to the number of partitions. A weighted average combines the predictions into one final prediction. To optimize the weights, a genetic algorithm is used. This approach has the advantage of simultaneously promoting (1) diversity, (2) accuracy, and (3) computational speed. (1) Diversity is fostered because the individual K's are based on a subset of features and observations, (2) accuracy is sought by automatic kernel selection and the genetic algorithm, and (3) computational speed is obtained because the computation of each K can be parallelized. Using five times twofold cross validation we benchmark the classification performance of Kernel Factory against Random Forest and Kernel-Induced Random Forest (KIRF). We find that Kernel Factory has significantly better performance than Kernel-Induced Random Forest. When the right kernel is selected Kernel Factory is also significantly better than Random Forest.

The reason for this may be that the initial symptoms of preterm labour occur commonly in normal pregnancies. There is some misclassification in regard to recognizing full-term and preterm labour; approximately 20% of women who are identified as reaching full-term labour actually deliver prematurely.

Existing studies have proposed various solutions to learn a Mahalanobis or bilinear metric in an online fashion by either restricting distances between similar (dissimilar) pairs to be smaller (larger) than a given lower (upper) bound or requiring similar instances to be separated from dissimilar instances with a given margin. However, these linear metrics learned by leveraging fixed bounds or margins may not perform well in real-world applications, especially when data distributions are complex. We aim to address the open challenge of \u201cOnline Adaptive Metric Learning\u201d (OAML) for learning adaptive metric functions on-the-fly. Unlike traditional online metric learning methods, OAML is significantly more challenging since the learned metric could be non-linear and the model has to be self-adaptive as more instances are observed. In this paper, we present a new online metric learning framework that attempts to tackle the challenge by learning a ANN-based metric with adaptive model complexity from a stream of constraints. In particular, we propose a novel Adaptive-Bound Triplet Loss (ABTL) to effectively utilize the input constraints, and present a novel Adaptive Hedge Update (AHU) method for online updating the model parameters.

The motion of rigid objects can be analyzed in terms of edge features undergo-ing translation and rotation in the two-dimensional image. These features could be manipulated to match a fixed 3-D model. However, in a goal-driven system, where a priori knowledge of the 3-D model exists, it is more natural to manipulate the model before matching it to the edge features. We could speed up the 3-D to 2-D matching process by precomputing a range of possible orientations for the 3-D model. The difficulty is that one cannot predict all of the possible global changes of an object as it is moving in the scene. Our solution is to constrain the problem by looking at local changes that result from moving edge-features. The concept is borrowed from natural vision, where the visual field is divided into small regions and each region is analyzed by a column of orientation sensitive line segment operators. Each orientation operator has a preset maximal sensitivity to lines of a specific angle. Initially we assume that the 3-D model of a moving object has already been given. As an object rotates in the scene, the result is a spatial sequence of edges that activates adjacent columns. Heuristics to speed-up the matching of a 3-D model to a rotating or translating object can be derived from the local communication between neighboring columns of the moving edge features. The distance between successively activated columns can be used to measure how smoothly the edge features are undergoing motion. A slow moving object will produce a response in only a few successively adjacent columns and be interpreted as stepping slowly across the scene. A rapidly translating or rotating object will activate widely separated columns and be processed as undergoing discontinuous jumps. Similarly, in humans, when the velocity of key features in the visual field are either too low or too high, objects are perceived to be jumping instead of undergoing smooth motion [1].", "year": 1987, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.937734", "venue": "Other Conferences", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2053256229", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["144773989", "2630791", "39534974", "2150419", "61184844", "144773989", "2630791", "60545300", "39534974", "2150419", "61184844"], "inbound_citations": ["62608583"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121975005"}

RLfD mostly has been successfully exploited only in non-varying environments to reduce the programming time and cost, e.g. fixed manufacturing workspaces. Non-conventional production lines necessitate Human\u2013Robot Collaboration (HRC) implying robots and humans must work in shared workspaces. In such conditions, the robot needs to avoid colliding with the objects that are moved by humans in the workspace. Therefore, not only is the robot: (i) required to learn a task model from demonstrations; but also, (ii) must learn a control policy to avoid a stationary obstacle. Furthermore, (iii) it needs to build a control policy from demonstration to avoid moving obstacles. Here, we present an incremental approach to RLfD addressing all these three problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RLfD approach, by a series of pick-and-place experiments by an ABB YuMi robot.

An interesting question is if we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with AEs while retaining their good properties. We propose an answer to this question by introducing a new model called Y-Autoencoder (Y-AE). The structure and training procedure of a Y-AE enclose a representation into an implicit and an explicit part. The implicit part is similar to the output of an autoencoder and the explicit part is strongly correlated with labels in the training set. The two parts are separated in the latent space by splitting the output of the encoder into two paths (forming a Y shape) before decoding and re-encoding. We then impose a number of losses, such as reconstruction loss, and a loss on dependence between the implicit and explicit parts. Additionally, the projection in the explicit manifold is monitored by a predictor, that is embedded in the encoder and trained end-to-end with no adversarial losses.

According to the model, production of a phoneme or syllable starts with activation of a speech sound map cell (in left ventral premotor cortex) corresponding to the sound to be produced. This leads to production of the sound through two motor subsystems: a feedback control subsystem and a feedforward control subsystem. In the feedback control subsystem, signals from the premotor cortex travel to the auditory and somatosensory cortical areas through tuned synapses that encode sensory expectations for the sound being produced. These expectations take the form of time-varying auditory and somatosensory target regions. The target regions are compared to the current auditory and somatosensory state, and any discrepancy between the target and the current state leads to a corrective command signal to motor cortex. In the feedforward control subsystem, signals project from premotor cortex to primary motor cortex, both directly and via the cerebellum. These signals are tuned with practice by monitoring the commands from previous attempts to produce the sound, initially under feedback control. Feedforward and feedback-based control signals are combined in the model\u2019s motor cortex to form the overall motor command.

We illustrate that existing shadow features are not robust to changes in US acquisition parameters, and propose a novel robust shadow feature. We evaluate the method on several US data sets and report that it favorably compares with existing techniques.

To address these issues, a mix-ratio sampling approach for SVM is proposed which determines various over-sampling ratios for different minority classes.

The aim of this paper is to develop a prognostic technique for estimating IGBTs' RUL. There is a need for an efficient prognostic algorithm that is able to support in-situ decision-making. In this paper, a novel prediction model with a complete structure based on optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OPELM) and Volterra series is proposed to track the IGBT's degradation trace and estimate its RUL; we refer to this model as Volterra k-nearest neighbor OPELM prediction (VKOPP) model. This model uses the minimum entropy rate method and Volterra series to reconstruct phase space for IGBTs' ageing samples, and a new weight update algorithm, which can effectively reduce the influence of the outliers and noises, is utilized to establish the VKOPP network; then a combination of the k-nearest neighbor method (KNN) and least squares estimation (LSE) method is used to calculate the output weights of OPELM and predict the RUL of the IGBT.

Most of the existing image retrieval methods only focus on single-domain retrieval, which assumes that the distributions of retrieval databases and queries are similar. However, in practical application, the discrepancies between retrieval databases often taken in ideal illumination/pose/background/camera conditions and queries usually obtained in uncontrolled conditions are very large. In this paper, considering the practical application, we focus on challenging cross-domain retrieval. To address the problem, we propose an effective method named Probability Weighted Compact Feature Learning (PWCF), which provides inter-domain correlation guidance to promote cross-domain retrieval accuracy and learns a series of compact binary codes to improve the retrieval speed. First, we derive our loss function through the Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP): Bayesian Perspective (BP) induced focal-triplet loss, BP induced quantization loss and BP induced classification loss. Second, we propose a common manifold structure between domains to explore the potential correlation across domains. Considering the original feature representation is biased due to the inter-domain discrepancy, the manifold structure is difficult to be constructed. Therefore, we propose a new feature named Histogram Feature of Neighbors (HFON) from the sample statistics perspective.

Retrieving accurate atmospheric parameters from the raw data provided by IASI is a large challenge, but necessary in order to use the data in NWP models. Statistical models performance is compromised because of the extremely high spectral dimensionality and the high number of variables to be predicted simultaneously across the atmospheric column. All this poses a challenge for selecting and studying optimal models and processing schemes. Earlier work has shown non-linear models such as kernel methods and neural networks perform well on this task, but both schemes are computationally heavy on large quantities of data. Kernel methods do not scale well with the number of training data, and neural networks require setting critical hyperparameters. In this work we follow an alternative pathway: we study transfer learning in convolutional neural nets (CNN s) to alleviate the retraining cost by departing from proxy solutions (either features or networks) obtained from previously trained models for related variables. We show how features extracted from the IASI data by a CNN trained to predict a physical variable can be used as inputs to another statistical method designed to predict a different physical variable at low altitude. In addition, the learned parameters can be transferred to another CNN model and obtain results equivalent to those obtained when using a CNN trained from scratch requiring only fine tuning.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518097", "venue": "IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "journal": "IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2901134369", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1878904", "26941769", "23647315", "208192343", "6383532", "43271254", "11007436"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53233309"}

In this paper, we compare the performance of popular feature extraction methods and learning-based classification algorithms on time-stretch microscopy image recognition. The applied image recognition system comprises an outlier detection step, feature extraction method and classification. The main concept of outlier detection uses DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to eliminate error images. Gabor wavelet, HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradients), LBP (Local Binary Pattern) and PCA (Principal Components Analysis) are applied and compared as the feature extraction methods. Finally, with a set of extracted features, the computing time and accuracy of SVM (Support Vector Machines), LR (Logistics Regression), ResNet (Residual Neural Network) and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) classification algorithms are evaluated. The tested cell image datasets are acquired from high-throughput imaging of numerous drug-treated and untreated cells (N = ~21,000) with an optofluidic time-stretch microscope. Results show that PCA feature extraction and XGBoost classification proves to be the fastest algorithms with the highest level of accuracy. DBSCAN outlier detection helps to improve the recognition accuracy by 2% approximately. Therefore, we propose a recognition algorithm consisting of DBSCAN outlier detection, PCA feature extraction and XGBoost classification as a promising solution to process the image data of high-throughput optofluidic time-stretch microscopy accurately and rapidly.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2537782", "venue": "SPIE/COS Photonics Asia", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2989877380", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["4415762", "52134067", "23354408", "206094727", "355163", "205687522", "194951", "206594692", "4650265"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210131074"}

To achieve this, a new semi-supervised ML framework approach called Clustering-based Autistic Trait Classification (CATC) is proposed that uses a clustering technique and validation of the classifiers is done by classification techniques. The proposed method identifies potential autism cases based on their similarity traits as opposed to a scoring function used by many ASD screening tools. Empirical results on different datasets involving children, adolescents, and adults were verified and compared to other common machine learning classification techniques. The results showed that CATC offers classifiers with higher predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates than those of other intelligent classification approaches such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, and Random Trees, and Rule Induction.

In doing so, we follow the relevant literature and consider the contribution of selected variables as potential regressors in forecasting. Our empirical findings suggest that while all models outperform the Random Walk benchmark, the machine learning applications adhere more closely to the data generating process, producing more accurate out-of-sample forecasts than the classical econometric models. In most cases, we find that the transportation demand is driven by fuel costs, except for road transportation where macroeconomic conditions affect transportation volumes only for specific forecasting horizons. This finding deviates from the existing literature, given the support of previous studies to macroeconomic conditions are driving factors of transportation demand.

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-domain object detection method, named Cycle-consistent domain Adaptive Faster RCNN (CA-FRCNN). A couple of Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) are used to make the features from two domains consistent at both data distribution level and semantic level. Specifically, features from source domain are transformed to the target domain. Then they are aligned with features from target domain. At the same time, target features are handled with similar operations. Furthermore, a cycle-consistent loss is optimized to guarantee that the semantic information is preserved before and after the style translations. In the end, identity module is used to make the feature in source domain equivalent to the reconstructed feature output by the source generator, whose input is from the source domain. For the feature in the target domain, similar identity is required.

Recent attention has therefore focused on structured prediction methods, which combine the modeling flexibility of graphical models with the ability to employ complex, dependent features typical of traditional classification methods. Especially popular have been conditional random fields (CRFs), which are graphical models of the conditional distribution over outputs given a set of observed features. Unfortunately, parameter estimation in CRFs requires repeated inference, which can be computationally expensive. Complex graphical structures are increasingly desired in practical applications, but then training time often becomes prohibitive. ::: In this thesis, I investigate efficient training methods for conditional random fields with complex graphical structure, focusing on local methods which avoid propagating information globally along the graph. First, I investigate piecewise training, which trains each of a model's factors separately. I present three views of piecewise training: as maximizing the likelihood in a so-called \"node-split graph\", as maximizing the Bethe likelihood with uniform messages, and as generalizing the pseudo-moment matching estimator of Wainwright et al. [2003]. Second, I propose piecewise pseudolikelihood, a hybrid procedure which \"pseudolikelihood-izes\" the piecewise likelihood, and is therefore more efficient if the variables have large cardinality. Piecewise pseudolikelihood performs well even on applications in which standard pseudolikelihood performs poorly. Finally, motivated by the connection between piecewise training and BP, I explore training methods using beliefs arising from stopping BP before convergence. I propose a new schedule for message propagation that improves upon the dynamic schedule proposed recently by Elidan et al. [2006], and present suggestive results applying dynamic schedules to the system of equations that combine inference and learning. ::: I also present two novel families of loopy CRFs, which appear as test cases throughout.

Quantitative evaluation using imaging metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR), Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL), and Edge Preservation Parameter show significant visual quality improvement with the MPCRF approach.

Moreover, the weighted multiple instance learning (weighted MI-L) scheme is utilized in choosing the network with the greatest feature block, which has the most discriminative ability. In addition, a special method of calculating global output weights in weighted ELMs is introduced into the tracking framework.

For SVM modelling, different values for radial basis function (RBF) kernel width and penalty parameters (C) were considered and the optimum values were then found. The results demonstrate that SVM is capable of predicting the diesel engine performance and emissions. In the experimental step, Carbon nano tubes (CNT) (40, 80 and 120 ppm) and nano silver particles (40, 80 and 120 ppm) with nanostructure were prepared and added as additive to the diesel fuel. Six cylinders, four-stroke diesel engine was fuelled with these new blended fuels and operated at different engine speeds. Experimental test results indicated the fact that adding nano particles to diesel fuel, increased diesel engine power and torque output. For nano-diesel it was found that the brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) was decreased compared to the net diesel fuel. The results proved that with increase of nano particles concentrations (from 40 ppm to 120 ppm) in diesel fuel, CO2 emission increased. CO emission in diesel fuel with nano-particles was lower significantly compared to pure diesel fuel. UHC emission with silver nano-diesel blended fuel decreased while with fuels that contains CNT nano particles increased. The trend of NOx emission was inverse compared to the UHC emission. With adding nano particles to the blended fuels, NOx increased compared to the net diesel fuel. The tests revealed that silver & CNT nano particles can be used as additive in diesel fuel to improve complete combustion of the fuel and reduce the exhaust emissions significantly.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1757-899X/100/1/012069", "venue": "IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering", "journal": "IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "2519630668", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114313813"}

As a general conclusion we think reasonable construct models more able to reproduce dynamic properties observed in any kind of behavior, trying to link every all at a realistic perspective of the hippocampus processing, than explain any respective function through a linear reasoning. Introduction Since LTP and LTD were discovered more than thousands research articles have been devoted to study both on several subsets. The first and more accepted function is that these processes are devoted to the memory consolidation; more specifically, episodic memory. Besides, several functions have been attributed to the hippocampus, as visual navigation, episodic memory, emotional responses, attention phenomena and adaptively timed learning. However, the role of these two activities on each function and also on memory consolidation is not yet understood. The essential thinking is that LTP act by favoring the consolidation of memories processed by the hippocampus. But how could a so simple structure participate on these whole activities, sometimes simultaneously, storing many kinds of distinct information without errors? The hippocampal complex receives many afferent connections from several cerebral and brainstem areas participating on the functions above described. If we assume the hippocampus as the principal structure on each one, it is easy to understand why many proposed models aren\u2019t sufficient to account for the global functions that are processed on this intriguing structure.

Besides, recent neurobiological findings sustain some distinct interpretation of LTP and LTD.

Conclusions Our first question is: how could the hippocampus store information if this will be \u201cdeleted\u201d by LTP and/or LTD?

The idea is to speed up the application of the data mining algorithm with minimum or no sacrifice in performance. Data reduction techniques have been extensively used in the context of k -Nearest Neighbor classification, a lazy classifier that works by directly using a training dataset rather than building a model. This paper explores the application of data reduction techniques as a preprocessing step before the training step of Neural Networks and SVMs. Furthermore, the paper proposes a new data reduction technique that is based on k-median clustering algorithm. Our experimental results illustrate that, in the case of SVMs, data reduction techniques can effectively reduce the dataset size incurring small performance degradation.

Furthermore, since sexual dimorphism varies among populations, it is necessary to know the optimum values for each population. This study uses a hybrid feature extraction method and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for gender determination from teeth images.

Many previous works have aimed at finding accurate stock market forecasting models. In this paper, we use text mining and sentiment analysis on Chinese online financial news, to predict Chinese stock tendency and stock prices based on support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, we collect 2,302,692 news items, which date from 1/1/2008 to 1/1/2015. Secondly, based on this dataset, a specific domain stop-word dictionary and a precise sentiment dictionary are formed. Thirdly, we propose a forecasting model using SVM. On the algorithm of SVM implementation, we also propose two-parameter optimization algorithms to search for the best initial parameter setting. The result shows that parameter G has the main effect, while parameter C's effect is not obvious. Furthermore, support vector regression (SVR) models for different Chinese stocks are similar whereas in support vector classification (SVC) models best parameters are quite differential. Series of contrast experiments show that: a) News has significant influence on stock market; b) Expansion input vector for additional situations when that day has no news data is better than normal input in SVR, yet is worse in SVC; c) SVR shows a fantastic degree of fitting in predicting stock fluctuation while such result has some time lag; d) News effect time lag for stock market is less than two days; e) In SVC, historic stock data has a most efficient time lag which is about 10 days, whereas in SVR this effect is not obvious. Besides, based on the special structure of the input vector, we also design a method to calculate the financial source impact factor. Result suggests that the news quality and audience number both have a significant effect on the source impact factor.

Its environment has been degrading during the past decades for people neglecting the ecosystem services function value which is hard to currency turn. Thus, it is necessary to monitor and assess the Mangrove Reserve's dynamics, both to gain a better understanding of their basic biology and to help guide conservation and restoration efforts. Using Landsat TM/ETM+ Satellite data acquired in 1989, 1992, 1998, 2001 and an Aster image from the year 2003, the land use of the Reserve and its environment were extracted adopting the supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification Algorithm. The changes of land use and ecosystem services value were analyzed using Costanza's method of evaluating the global ecosystem service values. The total value change of ecosystem services in the study area per year are 2945.95\u00d7104$, 2861.74\u00d7104$, 2904.05\u00d7104$, 2794.67\u00d7104$, 2730.82\u00d7104$ respectively during the four periods (1989-1992, 1992-1998, 1998-2001, 2001-2003). The ecosystem services value change has a close relationship with W&B, population, build-up and forest. The results indicate that the ecosystem services value in the study area has been constantly deteriorating due to the human activities imposed on it, which is highly associated with the local expanding of build-up and brackish water fishponds all the while.

Still, creating these general-purpose models remains an expensive and time-consuming process restricting the use of these methods to a small sub-set of the wider NLP community. In this paper, we present HuggingFace's Transformers library, a library for state-of-the-art NLP, making these developments available to the community by gathering state-of-the-art general-purpose pretrained models under a unified API together with an ecosystem of libraries, examples, tutorials and scripts targeting many downstream NLP tasks. HuggingFace's Transformers library features carefully crafted model implementations and high-performance pretrained weights for two main deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow, while supporting all the necessary tools to analyze, evaluate and use these models in downstream tasks such as text/token classification, questions answering and language generation among others. The library has gained significant organic traction and adoption among both the researcher and practitioner communities. We are committed at HuggingFace to pursue the efforts to develop this toolkit with the ambition of creating the standard library for building NLP systems.

While the former are utterances which can be categorized as either positive or negative, the latter cannot be categorized as either of these two categories. This paper presents a small set of domain independent features to detect indefinite polar sentences. The features reflect the linguistic structure underlying these types of utterances.

For the knowledge graph in plant domain, most of its relations belong to one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many types (actually majority of them are attribute-type relations), which are not in the scope of consideration for classical TransE model. In order to deal with such unique challenges, we propose a novel model called PTA (path-based TransE for attributes). It constructs the relation path by combining attributes and hyponymy relations, and embeds them to a lower dimensional space as well.

However, supervised feature learning methods require a large amount of labeled training data. To address this limitation, in this article, a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method, namely, Attention generative adversarial networks (Attention GANs), is proposed for aerial scene classification. First, Attention GANs integrates the attention mechanism into GANs to enhance the representation power of the discriminator. Then, to obtain contextual information, a context-aggregation-based feature fusion architecture is designed in the discriminator. Furthermore, the generator and discriminator losses are improved on basis of the Relativistic GAN. At the same time, a content loss is formed by using the feature representations from the context-aggregation-based feature fusion architecture.

Proximal canopy sensing is a promising technology that can identify this variability but is limited to quantifying plant-specific parameters. In this study, we evaluated whether biometric variables integrated with canopy reflectance data can assist in the generation of models for early-stage sugarcane biomass prediction. To substantiate this assertion, four sugarcane-producing fields were measured with an active crop canopy sensor and 30 sampling plots were selected for manually quantifying chlorophyll content, plant height, stalk number and aboveground biomass. We determined that Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression models are similarly able to predict biomass, and that associating biometric variables such as number of stalks and plant height with reflectance data can assist model performance, depending on the attributes selected. This indicates that, when estimating biomass in the early stages, sugarcane growers can carry out site-specific management in order to increase yield and reduce the use of inputs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1590/1678-992x-2017-0301", "venue": null, "journal": "Scientia Agricola", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2923284467,2971546036", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["140686064", "3745838", "87160738", "35138641", "54577445", "15996741", "96891375", "379259", "57146809", "12592926", "18925995"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109538941"}

We build a goldstandard dataset of 9,476 sentences and clauses from 1,047 comments submitted to an eRulemaking platform and find that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained with n-grams and additional features capturing the verifiability and experientiality exhibit statistically significant improvement over the unigram baseline, achieving a macro-averaged F1 of 68.99%.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "W14-2105", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3115/v1/W14-2105", "venue": "ArgMining@ACL", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2250287365", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6897488", "10478168", "1070708", "1096570", "10151608", "3102322", "198120286", "3116168", "1805147", "150801286", "15874442", "261545", "252796", "14758935", "17511465", "207178694", "12801399", "10779824", "10648787", "927208", "16723397", "153350001", "120694372", "17616342", "7310570", "1586708", "16533102"], "inbound_citations": ["198147310", "1918254", "1613821", "8665449", "5106916", "6365069", "189818747", "204871859", "199405211", "202664989", "85556928", "18231353", "150590864", "15016494", "92982649", "991531", "34322135", "202768765", "86415091", "1804771", "44099358", "198980688", "6801402", "29571966", "5440111", "30019384", "15373809", "8541616", "53083439", "52011877", "208267859", "3898101", "36444432", "17560995", "207222464", "6304153", "13466665", "15229617", "1893041", "52274839", "21689265", "10010426", "32016845", "21306064", "207616908", "9561587", "44086579", "21698003", "195699602", "3083231", "9149774", "199523501", "38967002", "13650746", "150446654", "9431339", "13908606", "52303045", "29498410", "204898196", "1045043", "44146624", "11438927", "11567004", "7311195", "22309708", "52341649", "195798681", "201686090", "27944459", "16316003", "9982551", "26570934", "41683968", "18357627", "16843761", "4781346", "1225862", "202549982", "19259545", "9312342"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14764893"}

It is still challenging to get clear boundaries and consistent saliencies, which can be considered as the structural information of salient objects. A popular solution is to conduct some post-processes (e.g., conditional random field (CRF)) to refine these structural information. In this paper, a novel cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based method is proposed to implicitly learn these structural information via adversarial learning for salient object detection (we termed the proposed method as CCAL). A cascaded CNNs model is first designed as a generator $\\boldsymbol {G}$ , which consists of an encoder\u2013decoder network for global saliency estimation and a deep residual network for local saliency refinement. It is hard to explicitly learn such structural information due to the limitation of frequently-used pixel-wise loss functions. Instead, a discriminator $\\boldsymbol {D}$ is then designed to distinguish the real salient maps (i.e., ground truths) from the fake ones produced by $\\boldsymbol {G}$ , based on which an adversarial loss is introduced to optimize $\\boldsymbol {G}$ . $\\boldsymbol {G}$ and $\\boldsymbol {D}$ are trained in a fully end-to-end fashion by following the strategy of conditional generative adversarial networks to make $\\boldsymbol {G}$ well learn the structural information. At last, $\\boldsymbol {G}$ is able to produce high quality salient maps without requiring any post-process to fool $\\boldsymbol {D}$ .

In principle, all kinds of prediction models can be assessed, and the package readily supports most traditional regression modeling strategies, like Cox regression or additive hazard regression, as well as state of the art machine learning methods such as random forests, a nonparametric method which provides promising alternatives to traditional strategies in low and high-dimensional settings.

In this study, we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass (AGB) of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash-crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and/or vegetation indices (VIs). Therefore, we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops (forage turnip, white oats, and rye) in the season prior to cash-crop planting. Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models. They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope (PS) constellation of satellites. From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017, we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models. The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones. The cover-crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest root mean square (RMSE) in the validation and test datasets were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Cubist (CUB) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB). For most models and cover crops, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the two most important AGB predictors. At the date of maximum VI at the beginning of the flowering stage, the correlation coefficients (r) between the cover-crop AGB and the cash-crop yield (soybean and maize) ranged from +0.70 for forage turnip to +0.78 for rye. The fuzzy unsupervised classification of the cover-crop AGB estimates delineated two management zones, which were spatially consistent with those obtained from cash-crop yield. The comparison between both maps produced overall accuracies that ranged from 61.20% to 68.25% with zone 2 having higher cover-crop AGB and cash-crop yield than zone 1 over the three sites. We conclude that satellite AGB estimates of cover crops can be used as a proxy for generating management zone maps in agricultural fields.

Moreover, the so-called Bag of Pursuits method is introduced as an extension of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and it is shown that it provides an improved approximation of the optimal sparse coefficients and, therefore, significantly improves the performance of the here proposed gradient descent as well as of the MOD and K-SVD approaches.

Under these settings, expressions are divided into three categories based on parts of the face that contribute most toward an expression. During recognition, at the first level, SWLDA and HCRF are employed to recognize the expression category; whereas, at the second level, the label for the expression within the recognized category is determined using a separate set of SWLDA and HCRF, trained just for that category. In order to validate the system, four publicly available data sets were used, and a total of four experiments were performed. The weighted average recognition rate for the proposed FER approach was 96.37% across the four different data sets, which is a significant improvement in contrast to the existing FER methods.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25856814", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2015.2405346", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1995937139", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["18428732", "7585135", "30189359", "14188989", "8134664", "20779863", "7466778", "15823252", "11381028", "589516", "17152050", "4709079", "16875072", "31536692", "3835991", "709076", "1321884", "17401860", "9424558", "13085433", "33144733", "15338348", "15872128", "21167059", "1093792", "6579679", "128562142", "15615182", "1737914", "10691083", "2064887", "207321900", "122185367", "11665319", "62689072", "14238476", "35913714", "2034898", "10957773", "62618450", "21077536", "17447274", "18292169", "2353450", "5390768", "277918", "1282113", "13298437", "1744924", "13557558", "18663848", "8473401", "7036341", "63557656", "30582", "3329621", "1586662", "2458350", "9360559", "2637589", "28425384", "41701565", "3511972", "16488762", "3758725"], "inbound_citations": ["57200996", "17401740", "52051705", "198271678", "56178211", "30991858", "69340847", "189927698", "208608004", "3416161", "198147754", "477908", "215337830", "57762384", "52151065", "34710715", "34710715", "77375426", "210695749", "14975878", "15381036", "58010482", "312853", "195795789", "206713200", "3813227", "58669828", "17352305", "24894839", "212647183", "17485690", "45321938", "1444223", "41263724", "210697465", "211120784", "34580348", "171095259", "27185542", "55472219", "12254135", "15517411", "58954545", "44152131", "10033555", "204232065", "13888940", "49420176", "195881217", "14221636", "195774421", "209516984", "26069779", "703708", "199134184", "199541454", "14898563", "59409779", "14971817"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15910548"}

Various multiclass models with a single objective have been proposed mostly based on two families of methods: an all-together approach and a one-against-all approach. However,most of these single-objective models consider neither the different costs of misclassification nor the user's preferences. To overcome these drawbacks, multiobjective models have been proposed.In this paper we rewrite the different approaches that deal with the multiclass SVM using multiobjective techniques. These multiobjective techniques can give us weakly Pareto-optimal solutions. We propose a multiobjective technique called Projected Multiobjective All-Together(PMAT), which works in a higher-dimension space than the object space. With this technique, we can theoretically characterize the Pareto-optimal solution set. For these multiobjective techniques we get approximate sets of the Pareto-optimal solutions. For these sets, we use hypervolume and epsilon indicators to evaluate different multiobjective techniques. From the experimental results, we can see that (PMAT) outperfoms the other multiobjective techniques.

Oligomerized Pool ENgineering (OPEN) is a recently developed method for engineering C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) designed to bind specific DNA sequences with high affinity and specificity in vivo. Because generation of ZFPs using OPEN requires considerable effort, a computational method for identifying the sites in any given gene that are most likely to be successfully targeted by this method is desirable.ResultsAnalysis of the base composition of experimentally validated ZFP target sites identified important constraints on the DNA sequence space that can be effectively targeted using OPEN. Using alternate encodings to represent ZFP target sites, we implemented Na\u00efve Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers capable of distinguishing \"active\" targets, i.e., ZFP binding sites that can be targeted with a high rate of success, from those that are \"inactive\" or poor targets for ZFPs generated using current OPEN technologies. When evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation on a dataset of 135 experimentally validated ZFP target sites, the best Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, designated ZiFOpT, achieved overall accuracy of 87% and specificity+ of 90%, with an ROC AUC of 0.89. When challenged with a completely independent test set of 140 newly validated ZFP target sites, ZiFOpT performance was comparable in terms of overall accuracy (88%) and specificity+ (92%), but with reduced ROC AUC (0.77). Users can rank potentially active ZFP target sites using a confidence score derived from the posterior probability returned by ZiFOpT.ConclusionZiFOpT, a machine learning classifier trained to identify DNA sequences amenable for targeting by OPEN-generated zinc finger arrays, can guide users to target sites that are most likely to function successfully in vivo, substantially reducing the experimental effort required.

Connectionist inductive inference typically involves gradient descent algorithms in weight space. When inferring functions of unbounded sequences such algorithms run on recurrent nets and become computationally expensive. A broader framework for inductive inference is presented, and it is shown that such problems admit a dual approach, which can be phrased in terms of the simulation-as-homomorphism perspective in systems theory. Whereas the usual approach adapts the dynamics of the net to match the dynamics of the target system, the dual approach keeps the dynamics fixed and learns a homomorphism from the net to the target.

The recent great improvements on benchmark data sets, which are achieved by increasingly complex unsupervised learning methods and deep learning models with lots of parameters, usually require many tedious tricks and much expertise to tune. However, filters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard hand-crafted features visually, and training the deep models costs quite long time to fine-tune their weights. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine-Autoencoder (ELM-AE) is employed as the learning unit to learn local receptive fields at each layer, and the lower layer responses are transferred to the last layer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation to retain more information. In addition, some beneficial methods in deep learning architectures such as local contrast normalization and whitening are added to the proposed hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine networks to further boost the performance.

Weather radar echo is one of the fundamental data for meteorological workers to weather systems identification and classification. Through the technique of weather radar echo extrapolation, the future short-term weather conditions can be predicted and severe convection storms can be warned. However, traditional extrapolation methods cannot offer accurate enough extrapolation results since their modeling capacity is limited, the recent deep learning based methods make some progress but still remains a problem of blurry prediction when making deeper extrapolation, which may due to they choose the mean square error as their loss function and that will lead to losing echo details. To address this problem and make a more realistic and accurate extrapolation, we propose a deep learning model called Adversarial Extrapolation Neural Network (AENN), which is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) structure and consist of a conditional generator and two discriminators, echo-frame discriminator and echo-sequence discriminator. The generator and discriminators are trained alternately in an adversarial way to make the final extrapolation results be realistic and accurate. To evaluate the model, we conduct experiments on extrapolating 0.5h, 1h, and 1.5h imminent future echoes, the results show that our proposed AENN can achieve the expected effect and outperforms other models significantly, which has a powerful potential application value for short-term weather forecasting.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W9-89-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981732294", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121259434", "5575601", "1033682", "6628106", "14120146", "16489696", "15539264", "6352419", "59150374", "17796912"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207985640"}

In particular, the illuminating article of Sass et al. gives an underpinning explanation of the disease along these lines in each of its 3 manifestations, with positive, negative, or disordered symptoms. The crucial component of the analysis of these researchers is that of various disturbances in ipseity (the ongoing sense of \u201cbeing there\u201d accompanying all conscious experience) that can occur for a sufferer, giving a framework with which to understand the disease. Such analyses of schizophrenia in terms of distortions of the self go back much earlier. However, the more recent work has become more precise and embracing in terms of seeing most forms of schizophrenia as arising from such distortions. It also provides new ways of looking at and diagnosing the disease.

Despite the reported increasing abundance of lianas across neotropics, very few studies have attempted to quantify the impact of lianas on tree and forest structure. Recent advances in high resolution terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) systems have enabled us to quantify the forest structure, in an unprecedented detail. However, the uptake of TLS technology to study lianas has not kept up with the same pace as it has for trees. The slower technological adoption of TLS to study lianas is due to the lack of methods to study these complex growth forms. In this study, we present a semi-automatic method to extract liana woody components from plot-level TLS data of a tropical rainforest. We tested the method in eight plots from two different tropical rainforest sites (two in Gigante Peninsula, Panama and six in Nouragues, French Guiana) along an increasing gradient of liana infestation (from plots with low liana density to plots with very high liana density). Our method uses a machine learning model based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The RF algorithm is trained on the eigen features extracted from the points in 3D at multiple spatial scales. The RF based liana stem extraction method successfully extracts on average 58% of liana woody points in our dataset with a high precision of 88%. We also present simple post-processing steps that increase the percentage of extracted liana stems from 54% to 90% in Nouragues and 65% to 70% in Gigante Peninsula without compromising on the precision. We provide the entire processing pipeline as an open source python package.

The results also reveal that PF is a little more stable than LT in terms of variance of accuracy, and it can also be used a good indicator for aging of Android.

The MC is used to generate random values of the assembly correction data, while the SVM is employed to forecast the assembly quality degree of IFOG. Then, the MC_SVM can tune the multi-type assembly errors. The second algorithm is the Series Feature Analysis (SFA) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) ranking algorithm, i.e. the SFA_AHP algorithm. The SFA is used to calculate the signal features of multi-type data from an IFOG environment adaptability test experiment. The AHP is employed to analyse the importance ranking of potential faults. Then, the SFA_AHP can detect and locate product faults. The above methods can correct errors before the product assembly and locate faults after the assembly.

This poses a real challenge for crop type classification using single date imagery. Site-specific information of crop type is required for agricultural management which includes technologies aiming at productivity and profit while practicing eco-friendly environment. Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) are effective image acquisition platforms for many agricultural applications. UAV\u2019s can acquire high levels of spatial details compared to standard remote sensing platforms. Single date RGB imagery of 5 cm spatial resolution obtained from processing the raw data was used for the classification of different types of crop. Traditional pixel-based analysis of remote sensing data results in inaccurate classification due to low spatial resolution, mixed pixels, and crop pattern variability. This can be overcome by using high-resolution UAV data and machine learning methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the present study SVM kernel functions namely linear, sigmoid, radial basis and polynomial function are adopted and compared for mapping the crop types. The classification shows that the radial and sigmoid kernel functions give high accuracy when compared with the rest by performing the accuracy assessment for all four classifiers.

We study the reconfiguration of the brain networks between task and resting-state conditions by a machine learning approach, to highlight the Intrinsic Connectivity Networks (ICNs) which are more affected by the change of network configurations in task vs. rest. We use a large cohort of publicly available data in both resting and task-based fMRI paradigms; by trying a battery of different supervised classifiers relying only on task-based measurements, we show that the highest accuracy is reached with a simple neural network of one hidden layer. In addition, when testing the fitted model on resting state measurements, such architecture yields a performance close to 90% for areas connected to the task performed, which mainly involve the visual and sensorimotor cortex, whilst a relevant decrease of the performance is observed in the other ICNs. On one hand, our results confirm the correspondence of ICNs in both paradigms (task and resting) thus opening a window for future clinical applications to subjects whose participation in a required task cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand it is shown that brain areas not involved in the task display different connectivity patterns in the two paradigms.

This paper comprises data pre-processing to remove noisy data in crop pest data that offers better accuracy. Feature selection takes an essential pre-processing step is to reduce the cost of learning by reducing the number of attributes. In this paper Relief and Random Forest Filters are applied for filtering crop pest data set attributes instead of using full attribute set. Relief carries out a selection of instances randomly for calculating the attribute weights. Random forest retains random selection, but provides two straightforward methods such as mean decrease impurity and mean decrease accuracy.

Our main contribution is the utilization of the semantic word similarity measures (Lin and PMI-IR similarities) for video retrieval. In our approach, we use trained concept detectors, and the visual co-occurrence relations between such concepts. We propose two methods for content-based retrieval of videos: (1) A method for retrieving a new concept(a concept which is not known to the system, and no annotation is available) using semantic word similarity and visual co-occurrence. (2) A method for retrieval of videos based on their relevance to a user defined text query using the semantic word similarity and visual content of videos. For evaluation purposes, we have mainly used the automatic search and the high level feature extraction test set of TRECVIDpsila06 benchmark, and the automatic search test set of TRECVIDpsila07. These two data sets consist of 250 hours of multilingual news video captured from American, Arabic, German and Chinese TV channels. Although our method for retrieving a new concept is an unsupervised method, it outperforms the trained concept detectors (which are supervised) on 7 out of 20 test concepts, and overall it performs very close to the trained detectors. On the other hand, our visual content based semantic retrieval method performs 81% better than the text-based retrieval method. This shows that using visual content alone we can obtain significantly good retrieval results.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587822", "venue": "2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2111092656", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["709482", "11730293", "15720307", "1130558", "26603751", "15199783", "60096480", "387449", "2785490", "61286221", "7661539", "1499545", "28504323", "14457153", "7677566", "11528628", "18342311", "657043", "5509836", "753564"], "inbound_citations": ["55274057", "56073741", "62147151", "35052244", "7441872", "10263523", "146116732", "34057513", "7755393", "15148748", "16403716", "54619161", "1487688", "9117438", "142503872", "24566905", "16728786", "8112675", "17517802", "17517802", "207012932", "56234151", "14284731", "6023325", "2119984", "12970430", "8985868", "15249518", "9999238", "3405825", "19648500", "24142451", "6361494", "1753262", "6720086", "11222879", "8282222", "29835820", "11669978", "12109071", "8333456", "5618427"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5784528"}

Existing compilers use conservative optimization strategies for automatic vectorization, which, in many cases, lead to the loss of vectorization opportunity. Studies have shown that the use of machine learning algorithms to build a performance prediction model is beneficial to improve the program performance. The model input is program features, and the output is the predicted optimization strategies or the program performance related to the optimization. In this paper, we focus on a computational intensive loop structure-tensor contraction, which is common in quantum chemical simulations. Most existing machine learning methods rely on control and data flow graphs as features to represent programs, but different tensor contraction kernels have the same control and data flow graphs. In addition, the existing methods often use the same kind of learning algorithm to construct a learning model, which is prone to overfitting and low-precision problems. In this paper, we propose an automatic vectorization performance enhancement method based on ensemble learning. We construct an ensemble learning model to predict the performance of tensor contraction kernels with different vectorization strategies and select the best vectorization strategy for the kernels. According to the storage access patterns of the tensor contraction kernels, we propose a static method for features representation. Based on the multi-algorithm ensemble learning strategy, we obtain better learning results than the single learning algorithm. The experimental results show that the prediction model achieves 88% and 87% prediction efficiency on two different platforms with different instruction sets, data types, and compilers.

Following that, the aim of this paper is to propose a new structure of connectionist network, the Summation Wavelet Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) that enables good accuracy and generalization performances, while limiting the learning time and reducing the impact of a random initialization procedure.

The initialization phase of wavelets (of hidden nodes) and neural network parameters (of input-hidden layer) is performed a priori, even before data are presented to the model. The whole proposition is illustrated and discussed by performing tests on three issues related to time-series application: an ''input-output'' approximation problem, a one-step ahead prediction problem, and a multi-steps ahead prediction problem.

Compared with discrete-return LiDAR data, full-waveform LiDAR data can provide more accurate and abundant vertical structure information on vegetation and thus have been increasingly applied to the estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB). The main objective of this research is to estimate forest AGB using full-waveform airborne LiDAR data. In this study, we constructed voxel-based waveforms (0.5 \u00d7 0.5 m) using small-footprint full-waveform LiDAR data, and then aggregated voxel-based waveforms into pseudo-large-footprint waveforms with a plot size of 20 \u00d7 20 m. We extracted a range of waveform metrics from voxel-based waveforms and pseudo-large-footprint waveforms (FW m ), respectively, and then calculated the mean of the voxel-based waveform metrics within a plot (FW \u03bc ). Based on the Random Forest (RF) regression, the forest biomasses were estimated using two types of waveform metrics: FW m (R 2 = 0.84, RMSE% = 21.4%, bias = -0.11 Mg ha \u22121 ) and FW \u03bc (R 2 = 0.81, RMSE% = 23.3%, bias = 0.13 Mg ha \u22121 ). We found that slightly higher biomass estimation accuracy was obtained with FW m than with FW \u03bc . In addition, a comparison between the biomasses predicted by the waveform metrics and by the traditional discrete-return metrics (R 2 = 0.80, RMSE% = 23.4%, bias = 0.20 Mg ha \u22121 ) was performed to explore the potential to improve biomass estimates using the waveform metrics, and the results showed that both waveform metrics and discrete-return metrics could accurately predict forest biomass.

To realise the full potential of digital pathology, accurate and robust computer techniques for automatically detecting biomarkers play an important role. Traditional methods transform the colour histopathology images into a gray scale image and apply a single threshold to separate positively stained tissues from the background. In this thesis, we show that the colour distribution of the positive immunohistochemical stains varies with the level of luminance and that a single threshold will be impossible to separate positively stained tissues from other tissues, regardless how the colour pixels are transformed. Based on this observation, two novel luminance adaptive biomarker detection methods are proposed. The first, termed Luminance Adaptive Multi-Thresholding (LAMT) first separate the pixels according to their luminance levels and for each luminance level a separate threshold is found for detecting the positive stains. The second, termed Luminance Adaptive Random Forest (LARF) applies one of the most powerful machine learning models, random forest, as a base classifier to build an ensemble classifier for biomarker detection. ::: ::: Second, we study a cell-level problem, the cell classification task in pathology images. Two different classification models are proposed. The first model for HEp-2 cell pattern classification comes with a novel object-graph based feature, which decompose the binary image into primitive objects and represent them with a set of morphological feature. Work on cell classification is further extended using deep learning model termed Deep Autoencoding-Classification Network (DACN). The DACN model consists of an autoencoder and a conventional classification convolutional neural network (CNN) with the two sharing the same encoding pipeline. The DACN model is jointly optimized for the classification error and the image reconstruction error based on a multi-task learning procedure. We will present experiment results to show that the proposed DACN outperforms all known state-of-the-art on two public indirect immunofluorescence stained HEp-2 cell datasets and H\\&E stained colorectal adenocarcinomas cell dataset. ::: ::: Third, we study an image-level problem, assessing the histochemical score of a histopathology image. To determine the molecular class of the tumour, pathologists will have to manually mark the nuclei activity biomarkers by assigning a histochemical score (H-Score) to each TMA core with a semi-quantitative assessment method. Manually marking positively stained nuclei is a time consuming, imprecise and subjective process which will lead to inter-observer and intra-observer discrepancies. In this thesis, we present an end-to-end deep learning system which directly predicts the H-Score automatically. Our system imitates the pathologists' decision process and uses one fully convolutional network (FCN) to extract all nuclei region, a second FCN to extract tumour nuclei region, and a multi-column convolutional neural network which takes the outputs of the first two FCNs and the stain intensity description image as input and acts as the decision making mechanism to directly output the H-Score of the input TMA image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that takes a TMA image as input and directly outputs a clinical score. We will present experimental results which demonstrate that the H-Scores predicted by our model have very high and statistically significant correlation with experienced pathologists' scores and that the H-Score discrepancy between our algorithm and the pathologists is on par with the inter-subject discrepancy between the pathologists.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2906127987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58117608"}

Weather forecasts, especially precipitation prediction, poses complex tasks because they depend on various parameters to predict the dependent variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, which are changing from time to time and weather calculation varies with the geographical location along with its atmospheric variables. To improve the prediction accuracy of precipitation, this context proposes a prediction model for rainfall forecast based on Support Vector Machine with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-SVM) to replace the linear threshold used in traditional precipitation. Parameter selection has a critical impact on the predictive accuracy of SVM, and PSO is proposed to find the optimal parameters for SVM. The PSO-SVM algorithm was used for the training of a model by using the historical data for precipitation prediction, which can be useful information and used by people of all walks of life in making wise and intelligent decisions. The simulations demonstrate that prediction models indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm has much better accuracy than the direct prediction model based on a set of experimental data if other things are equal.

An adversary intruder which possesses a crucial knowledge about a protection system can easily bypass the detection module.

To this end, we firstly propose several obfuscation techniques of remote attacks that are based on the modification of various properties of network connections; then we conduct a set of comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of intrusion detection classifiers against obfuscated attacks. We instantiate our approach by means of a tool, based on NetEm and Metasploit, which implements our obfuscation operators on any TCP communication. This allows us to generate modified network traffic for machine learning experiments employing features for assessing network statistics and behavior of TCP connections. We perform the evaluation of five classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes with kernel density estimation, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines. Our experiments confirm the assumption that it is possible to evade the intrusion detection capability of all classifiers trained without prior knowledge about obfuscated attacks, causing an exacerbation of the TPR ranging from 7.8% to 66.8%. Further, when widening the training knowledge of the classifiers by a subset of obfuscated attacks, we achieve a significant improvement of the TPR by 4.21% - 73.3%, while the FPR is deteriorated only slightly (0.1% - 1.48%).

Sentinel-3, a Copernicus satellite mission, offers three types of variables captured simultaneously for the first time; sea level (SSH), sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean colour (OC) variables. Sea level is measured with SAR altimetry, a technique that considerably increases spatial resolution compared to other means of observation. Altimetry measures sea level across a line that coincides with the satellite ground track, whereas SST and OC are measured on a grid. What we lack are sea level observations in-between ground tracks that would better resolve meso-scale variability. This thesis is focused on two objectives, considering previous work that has indicated associations between those variables. The first objective was to investigate the correlations among SSH, SST and OC, while the second objective was to assess to what extent inter-track sea level can be estimated using SST and OC as predictors in machine learning algorithms. Daily Sentinel-3 data over a period of eleven months were pre-processed and brought into a form that allowed for computation of metrics such as auto- and cross-correlations in the along-track direction. The focus was on the spatial scales that would enable to detect meso-scale features, such as eddies. With respect to the inter-track sea level estimation two paths were followed. In the first path, Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were applied using the complete 11-month dataset as input. Moreover, RF was applied on input data that belong to each separate day. In the second path, 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used on the complete 11-month dataset, which inherently honors the spatial dependency of the variables in contrast to the first path. Generally, the correlations between the variables were found to exist in the meso-scale but were not always strong and they depend on several other factors, such as meteorological conditions, scales included in the analysis and techniques used. All three techniques -RF, MLP and 1D CNN- that were applied on the complete 11-month dataset gave poor results. On the contrary, when RF was applied on the per-day data gave promising results that are reliable mostly in the vicinity of the ground track, although they are not based on one single global model. The results from this project suggest that there must be more research on the correlation analysis of Sentinel-3 data. It can be improved by using additional or similar techniques, such as localized cross-correlation metrics on various spatial scales. With respect to the inter-track sea level estimation, far more investigation is needed. However, there are indications that a machine learning data-driven approach could potentially work to some extent. Sentinel-3 data will become more abundant in the next years which will assist data science algorithms such as CNNs which require huge datasets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2995345199", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213372632"}

In an actual application like this, acquiring massive labeled data for deep convolutional networks is costly and difficult especially in the situation that the data sources are diverse and the requirements are changing. Transfer learning methods have already shown superior performance on exploiting domain invariance features in existing data for deep network-based categorization tasks. However, the data imbalance between source and target domains may bring negative transfer and weaken the classifier\u2019s ability. Moreover, it is still a difficult problem to extract object-level visual features among easy-mixed categories. In this context, Multi-adversarial Object-level Attention Network (MOAN) is proposed for partial transfer learning and selecting useful features. On the one hand, we present an improved object-level attention proposal network (OANet) for perceiving structural features of the main object in the picture, and weakening the unrelated regions. On the other hand, the extracted features are further enhanced by multi-adversarial framework in order to promote positive transfer, selecting and mapping valuable cross domain features from shared categories and suppressing others. This adversarial learning module can also generate pseudo tags for the samples in target domain so as to perceive integral visual signals, similar to the process in source domain. In addition, virtual adversarial training method is introduced in MOAN so as to regularize the model and maintain stability. Experimental analyses show that our MOAN can significantly promote positive transfer and restrain negative transfer in unsupervised classification problems. MOAN has good performances such as higher accuracies and lower loss values on several benchmark data sets.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982034", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011580887", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6755881", "4357800", "195908774", "3046524", "2871880", "13817347", "3461223", "51614408", "3408395", "4853672", "148572680", "51608784", "125713312", "3453954", "203850801", "201833473", "213777632", "56718910", "1926319", "7666160", "9560434", "1939509", "206594692", "206592484", "2575184", "2206412", "678821", "203110597", "41721092", "27428798", "52156503", "206597034", "52180375", "195768520", "202130351", "196699762", "198961036", "207991655", "556999", "145871146", "630188", "173990863", "195677126", "199537376", "4393270", "4009713", "50698", "187547", "2202933", "199543275", "4625569", "473729", "201668044", "206597351", "118828957", "993769", "13841056", "745350", "4445132", "6742009", "8308769", "173990164", "159563833", "1806714", "10707042", "210887901", "62841673"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:215721754"}

Several approaches and systems based on different mathematical tools have been studied and developed. Among them, the Anomaly-Network Intrusion Detection System (A-NIDS), this monitors network traffic and compares it against an established baseline of \u201cnormal\u201d traffic profile. Then, it is necessary to characterize the \u201cnormal\u201d Internet traffic. This paper presents an approach for anomaly detection and classification based on: the entropy of selected features (including Shannon, Renyi and Tsallis entropies), the construction of regions from entropy data employing the Mahalanobis distance (MD), and One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) with different kernels (RBF and particularity Mahalanobis) for \u201cnormal\u201d and abnormal traffic. Regular and non-regular regions built from \u201cnormal\u201d traffic profiles, allow the anomaly detection; whilst the classification is performed under the assumption that regions corresponding to the attack classes have been characterized previously. Although, this approach allows the use of as many features as required, only four well known significant features were selected in our case. To evaluate our approach two different data sets were used: one set of real traffic obtained from an Academic LAN, and the other a subset of the 1998 MIT-DARPA set. The selected features sets computed in our experiments provide detection rates up to 99.90% with \u201cnormal\u201d traffic and up to 99.83% with anomalous traffic and false alarm rate of 0.086%. Experimental results show that certain values of the q parameter of the generalized entropies and the use of OC-SVM improves the detection rate of some attack classes, due to a better fit of the region to the data. Besides, our results show that MD allows to obtain high detection rates with an efficient computation time, while OC-SVM achieved detection rates slightly higher but more expensive computationally.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/ecea-1-b004", "venue": "Proceedings of 1st International Electronic Conference on Entropy and Its Applications", "journal": "Proceedings of 1st International Electronic Conference on Entropy and Its Applications", "mag_id": "2330299179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43779750"}

Many Muslims complain that the information they get from the Internet is either inaccurate or simply wrong. With the content growing in an exponential way, its manual labeling and verification is simply an impossible task. To the extent of our knowledge, no previous work has been carried out regarding his task. In this study, we propose a new method for automatic classification of Islamic content on the Internet. A dataset of four Islamic groups has been created containing texts from four different Islamic groups, namely: Sunni (Content representing Sunni Islam), Shia (Content representing Shia Islam), Madkhali (Content forbidding politics and warning against all scholars with different views) and Jihadi (Content promoting Jihad). We collected a dataset containing 20 different texts for each of those groups, totalizing 80 texts, out of which 56 are used for training and 24 for testing. In order to classify those contents automatically, we first preprocessed the texts using normalization, stop words removal, stemming and segmentation into words. Then, we used the hyper-concepts method which makes it possible to represent any corpus through a relation and to decompose it into non-overlapping rectangular relations and to highlight the most representative attributes or keywords in a hierarchical way. The hyper concept keywords extracted from the training set are subsequently used as predictors (containing either 1 when the text contains the keyword and 0 otherwise). Those predictors are fed to a random forest classifier of 5000 random trees. The number of extracted keywords varies according to the depth of the hyper concept tree, ranging from 47 keywords (depth 1) to 296 keywords (depth 15). The average classification accuracy starts at 45.79% for depth 1 and remains roughly stable at 68.33% from depth 10. This result is very interesting as there four different classes (a random predictor would therefore score around 25%). This study is a great step towards the automatic classification of Islamic content on the Internet. The results show that the hyper concept method successfully extracts relevant keywords for each group and helps in categorizing them automatically. The method needs to be combined with some semantic method in order to reach even higher classification rates. The results of the method are also to be compared with manual classification in order to foresee the improvement one can expect as some texts might indifferently belong to more than one category.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5339/qfarc.2014.itpp0816", "venue": "Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference Proceedings Volume 2014 Issue 1", "journal": "Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference Proceedings Volume 2014 Issue 1", "mag_id": "1775591594", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129142189"}

Incremental learning studies training of models with the objective function evolving over time, eg, addition of new categories to a classification task. Image generation seeks to learn a distribution of natural images for generating new images resembling original ones.Incremental learning is a challenging problem due to the phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting: any significant change to the objective during training causes a severe degradation of previously learned knowledge. We present a learning framework to introduce new classes to an object detection network. It is based on the idea of knowledge distillation to counteract catastrophic forgetting effects: fixed copy of the network evaluates old samples and its output is reused in an auxiliary loss to stabilize learning of new classes. Our framework mines these samples of old classes on the fly from incoming images, in contrast to other solutions that keep a subset of samples in memory.On the second topic of image generation, we build on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. Recently, GANs significantly improved the quality of generated images. However, they suffer from poor coverage of the dataset: while individual samples have great quality, some modes of the original distribution may not be captured. In addition, existing GAN evaluation methods are focused on image quality, and thus do not evaluate how well the dataset is covered, in contrast to the likelihood measure commonly used for generative models. We present two approaches to address these problems.The first method evaluates class-conditional GANs using two complementary measures based on image classification - GAN-train and GAN-test, which approximate recall (diversity) and precision (quality of the image) of GANs respectively. We evaluate several recent GAN approaches based on these two measures, and demonstrate a clear difference in performance. Furthermore, we observe that the increasing difficulty of the dataset, from CIFAR10 over CIFAR100 to ImageNet, shows an inverse correlation with the quality of the GANs, as clearly evident from our measures.Inspired by our study of GAN models, we present a method to explicitly enforce dataset coverage during the GAN training phase. We develop a generative model that combines GAN image quality with VAE architecture in the feature space engendered by a flow-based model Real-NVP. This allows us to evaluate a valid likelihood and simultaneously relax the independence assumption in RGB space which is common for VAEs. We achieve Inception score and FID competitive with state-of-the-art GANs, while maintaining good likelihood for this class of models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2956833929", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199003218"}

The ensemble members are accurate protein secondary structure single model predictors namely, Multi-Class Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. Experiments are carried out using cross-validation tests on RS126 and CB513 benchmark datasets. Our results clearly confirm that ensembles are more accurate than a single model and the experimental comparison of the investigated ensemble schemes demonstrates that the newly introduced rule called Exponential Opinion Pool competes well against state-of-the-art fixed rules, especially the sum rule which in some cases is able to achieve better performance.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00500-014-1355-0", "venue": null, "journal": "Soft Computing", "mag_id": "2091196960", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["49654817", "47012251", "3957481", "49302377", "52269857", "211242307", "56030458"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45925302"}

In these studies, the methods based on biosignals have gained in popularity because biosignals can be measured using only wearable devices. Among the various biosignals, we focus on forearm deformation. The forearm deformation provides the motion information about the surface and deep layer muscles, tendons, and bones. The previous studies based on the forearm deformation only attempted to recognize types of hand motions/shapes or to estimate a single joint angle. In this study, we propose a hand motion estimation method for multiple joint angles based on the forearm deformation measured with a distance sensor array. A Support Vector Regression is used for the joint angles regression. The distance sensor array has 10 distance sensor units and a mechanism that can be adjusted to the size of the user's forearm.

This usually needs ``opposite'' strategies to suppress the two terms, and has not been well resolved in the literature. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial learning framework to improve this situation. Departing from the tradition of jointly reducing MD and FA via a single objective, we decompose this difficult task into two sub-tasks handled by two models trained adversarially, with each focusing on reducing either MD or FA. Such a new design brings forth at least three advantages. First, as each model focuses on a relatively simpler sub-task, the overall difficulty of ISOS is somehow decreased. Second, the adversarial training of the two models naturally produces a delicate balance of MD and FA, and low rates for both MD and FA could be achieved at Nash equilibrium. Third, this MD-FA detachment gives us more flexibility to develop specific models dedicated to each sub-task. To realize the above design, we propose a conditional Generative Adversarial Network comprising of two generators and one discriminator. Each generator strives for one sub-task, while the discriminator differentiates the three segmentation results from the two generators and the ground truth. Moreover, in order to better serve the sub-tasks, the two generators, based on context aggregation networks, utilzse different size of receptive fields, providing both local and global views of objects for segmentation. As verified on multiple infrared image data sets, our method consistently achieves better segmentation than many state-of-the-art ISOS methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2019.00860", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3010079414", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15007351", "33264528", "7695153", "1454111", "12093452", "14361528", "2446284", "124773453", "29853756", "541925", "51610676", "129888940", "2627428", "1033682", "13683000", "13740328", "6200260", "2656016", "109587845", "56507745", "15697276", "25120102", "8874508", "16819726", "54453444", "5519494", "4702621", "121063295"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204871575"}

Indeed, for researchers used to handle multidimensional data, the possibility of building classification algorithms avoiding the assumptions required by the Bayesian methods on the data probability distributions seemed rather attractive. For the case of parameter retrieval, neural networks owned the advantage of determining the input-output relationship directly from the training data with no need to seek for an explicit modelling of the physical mechanisms, often nonlinear and with poorly understood factors involved [5]. Moreover, it was shown that multilayer feedforward networks formed a class of universal approximators, capable of approximating any real-valued continuous function provided a sufficient number of units in the hidden layer was considered [6]. There were enough reasons to explore the potentialities of such neurocomputational models, also known as associative memory based models, in a wide range of remote sensing applications. This was actually what happened throughout all nineties and, even if with less emphasis, is continuing up to date. Image classification, from SAR imagery to latest hyperspectral data, has probably been one of the most investigated fields in this context. However, the use of neural network for the retrieval of bio-geophysical parameters from remotely sensed data has also played a significant role. In particular, the synergy between these algorithms and RT (Radiative Transfer) electromagnetic models represented a new and effective way to replace the empirical approaches, often based on limited seasonally or regionally data, hence with little generalization capabilities. The use of the RT models is twofold. They can help in the sensitivity analysis of the electromagnetic quantities to the bio-geophysical parameters. They can be exploited for the synthetic generation of training data in case of a lack of experimental data and ground-truth. The combined use of electromagnetic models and neural networks is a topic treated in many published studies taking into account the most diverse applicative scenarios: from the inversion of radiance spectra to infer atmospheric ozone concentration profiles [7], to the retrieval of snow parameters from passive microwave measurements [8] or to the estimation of sea water optically active parameters from hyperspectral data [9], just to mention one case for the three main different domains: atmosphere, earth surface and ocean. As far as the network topology is concerned, MLP probably are on the top of the authors preference ranking, but the choice is widely spread over the numerous alternatives which include RBF (Radial Basis Function), recurrent architectures, as well as the Kohonen SOM [10] if we focus on the unsupervised image classification field. Such an extensive research activity confirmed that neural networks, besides representing a new and easy way of machine learning, possess particularly interesting properties, such as the capability of capturing subtle dependencies among the data, an inherent fault tolerance due to their parallel and distributed structure, a capability of positively merging pieces of information stemming from different sources. Only advantages? Obviously not. The conventional backpropagation learning algorithm can be stuck in a local minimum. Moreover, the choice of network architecture (i.e. number of hidden layers and nodes in each layer), weight initialization and number of iterations required for training may significantly affect the learning performance. Addressing these issues is one of the dominant themes of the current research. Some authors [11] suggest that SVM (Support Vector Machines) may reach in terms of accuracy performances similar to those obtainable by means of neural networks without suffering from the problem of local minima and with limited effort required for architecture design. Other authors [12] remain focused on neural models, aiming at automating the selection of the parameters characterizing the algorithm or searching for improvements in the learning procedures. A different ongoing line of research is more sensitive to the opportunities that should be provided by the data of the last generation EO (Earth Observation) missions. Hence it is more dedicated to exploit the aforementioned neural networks potentialities for more complex applications [13][14].

By controlling feature information passing through two complementary directions, a substantially rich and discriminative feature representation is achieved. Specifically, we place biDFL module on the top of a CNN network to enhance high-level parsing performance. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale consistent decision fusion (mCDF) that is capable of selectively focusing on the informative decisions generated from multiple classification layers. By analysis of the consistency of the decision at each position, mCDF automatically adjusts the reliability of decisions and thus allows a more insightful skin lesion delineation.

They play a pivotal role in water quality, climate change, as well as carbon and hydrological cycles. Wetlands are environmental health indicators because of their contributions to plant and animal habitats. While a large portion of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) is covered by wetlands, no significant efforts had been conducted to identify and monitor these valuable environments when I initiated this project. At that time, there were only two small areas in NL that had been classified using basic Remote Sensing (RS) methods with low accuracies. There was an immediate need to develop new methods for conserving and managing these vital resources using up-to-date maps of wetland distributions. In this thesis, object- and pixel-based classification methods were compared to show the high potential of the former method when medium or high spatial resolution imagery were used to classify wetlands. The maps produced using several classification algorithms were also compared to select the optimum classifier for future experiments. Moreover, a novel Multiple Classifier System (MCS), which combined several algorithms, was proposed to increase the classification accuracy of complex and similar land covers, such as wetlands. Landsat-8 images captured in different months were also investigated to select the time, for which wetlands had the highest separability using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Additionally, various spectral, polarimetric, texture, and ratio features extracted from multi-source optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were assessed to select the most effective features for discriminating wetland classes. The methods developed during this dissertation were validated in five study areas to show their effectiveness. Finally, in collaboration with a team, a website (http://nlwetlands.ca/) and a software package were developed (named the Advanced Remote Sensing Lab (ARSeL)) to automatically preprocess optical/SAR data and classify wetlands using advanced algorithms. In summary, the outputs of this work are promising and can be incorporated into future studies related to wetlands.

Non-destructive testing methods are preferable due to the fact that those methods do not destroy concrete samples. However, they usually give larger percentage of error than using destructive tests. Among the non-destructive testing methods, the ultrasonic pulse velocity test is the popular one because it is economic and very simple in operation. Using the ultrasonic pulse velocity test gives 20% MAPE more than using destructive tests. This paper aims to improve the ultrasonic pulse velocity test results in estimating the compressive strength of concrete using the help of artificial intelligent. To establish a better prediction model for the ultrasonic pulse velocity test, data collected from 312 cylinder of concrete samples are used to develop and validate the model. The research results provide valuable information when using the ultrasonic pulse velocity tests to the inputs data in addition with support vector machine by learning algorithms, and the actual compressive strengths are set as the target output data to train the model. The results show that both MAPEs for the linear and nonlinear regression models are 11.17% and 17.66% respectively. The MAPE for the support vector machine models is 11.02%.

In turn, the rapid expansion of habitat mapping studies has resulted in a need for automated classification techniques to efficiently map benthic habitats, assess confidence in model outputs, and evaluate the importance of variables driving the patterns observed. The benthic habitat characterisation process often involves the analysis of MBES bathymetry, backscatter mosaic or angular response with observation data providing ground truth. However, studies that make use of the full range of MBES outputs within a single classification process are limited. We present an approach that integrates backscatter angular response with MBES bathymetry, backscatter mosaic and their derivatives in a classification process using a Random Forests (RF) machine-learning algorithm to predict the distribution of benthic biological habitats. This approach includes a method of deriving statistical features from backscatter angular response curves created from MBES data collated within homogeneous regions of a backscatter mosaic. Using the RF algorithm we assess the relative importance of each variable in order to optimise the classification process and simplify models applied. The results showed that the inclusion of the angular response features in the classification process improved the accuracy of the final habitat maps from 88.5% to 93.6%. The RF algorithm identified bathymetry and the angular response mean as the two most important predictors. However, the highest classification rates were only obtained after incorporating additional features derived from bathymetry and the backscatter mosaic. The angular response features were found to be more important to the classification process compared to the backscatter mosaic features. This analysis indicates that integrating angular response information with bathymetry and the backscatter mosaic, along with their derivatives, constitutes an important improvement for studying the distribution of benthic habitats, which is necessary for effective marine spatial planning and resource management.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4019575", "pubmed_id": "24824155", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0097339", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1995772470", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["204769274", "26206024", "54520065", "85156507", "110394916", "128401303", "85458214", "43781811", "131086014", "32927187", "7547936", "128756080", "28269742", "128496817", "129706931", "140611010", "108576715", "18912881", "84123111", "129779428", "55200821", "54978398", "140173453", "129337734", "129195423", "128772795", "14003658", "129568994", "21105327", "108712382", "89141", "3849386", "128838283", "129512074", "30482604", "131928776", "14049393", "129148394", "206786900", "129491054", "28992284", "60985554", "17883484", "129693413", "129379632", "620563", "42930714", "129181806", "86058889", "13188844", "83869830", "11024443", "84860609", "8254598", "85434514", "84200718"], "inbound_citations": ["134963900", "209487472", "128526423", "189825183", "55004518", "134196684", "146449229", "135168022", "125658739", "134594710", "134717922", "25979701", "198422187", "2853627", "134238187", "28561430", "56012544", "85502768", "21125239", "23488577", "181985179", "67766677", "134582649", "2964878", "73695445", "214904998", "54538409"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1225025"}

Previous studies predicted OLED display power using a pixel color-based linear model. In recent mobile devices, however, the relationship between a color and its power consumption has become complicated, due to the various options for display settings in the device and to device diversity. This makes it hard to predict the power consumption of a display accurately with the conventional linear model. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generate an OLED display power model optimized for a specific target device, as well as for each display mode, thus generating an accurate power model effectively. The technique automatically learns the power model through the RGB value of each pixel and its power consumption using Support Vector Regression (SVR)-based supervised learning. We evaluated the power models for recent smartphone models, and the results show that, on average, the accuracy of the pixel modeling is about 99% for the device models and display modes used in the experiment. Furthermore, the power consumption for real images is estimated with an accuracy of about 95%, on average.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.pmcj.2018.07.006", "venue": "Pervasive Mob.

All experiments use real world datasets coming from either the sensors located on the highways of Stockholm or from official accident and weather reports.

The design of an Apache Spark streaming application that uses the model with the best results is also provided.

Some progress has been made towards combining the two routes into a single system. In attempting a coherent connectionist account, however, we are forced to address from first principles the difficult problem of the synchronisation and integration of information from each route into an output which combines the capabilities of both. We believe that the interactions between cognitive modules may be more difficult to model than the modules themselves, and that connec\u00ad tionist approaches, by forcing these interactions to be addressed at a basic level, may help to focus attention on difficult problems of psy\u00ad chological modelling which might otherwise not be addressed. 1. Introduction - Solutions to the SpeIIing Problem. Many intellectual problems may be solved by more than one method. In particular, one may distinguish \"procedural\" methods and memory based methods. Procedural methods provide a general mental resource for solving a problem or task, and are par\u00ad ticularly important when faced with novel examples of a task. Memory based meth\u00ad ods rely on having previously solved examples of a problem - if one can remember the problem and the solution, then the next time the same problem arises, the solution can be arrived at directly from memory. The two methods can be seen as different ways of trading off time/space costs against speed/flexibility benefits. The procedural method is typically slower and more computationally expensive, but can be applied to novel situations. A good procedure will also have a small memory load compared to the number of cases (possibly infinite) to which it can be applied. The memory method has the advantage of speed, but will not adapt weil to novel situations and memory load increases with each solution learned. The two methods complement", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4471-3579-1_17", "venue": "Neural Computation and Psychology", "journal": "Neural Computation and Psychology", "mag_id": "135554372", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56162503", "18831587", "34820887", "41442006", "14850688", "14791163"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59846444"}

To remedy these deficiencies, we propose a chemical formula search engine. To build a chemical formula search engine, we must solve the following problems: 1) extract chemical formulae from text documents, 2) index chemical formulae, and 3) designranking functions for the chemical formulae. Furthermore, query models are introduced for formula search, and for each a scoring scheme based on features of partial formulae is proposed tomeasure the relevance of chemical formulae and queries. We evaluate algorithms for identifying chemical formulae in documents using classification methods based on Support Vector Machines(SVM), and a probabilistic model based on conditional random fields (CRF). Different methods for SVM and CRF to tune the trade-off between recall and precision forim balanced data are proposed to improve the overall performance. A feature selection method based on frequency and discrimination isused to remove uninformative and redundant features. Experiments show that our approaches to chemical formula extraction work well, especially after trade-off tuning. The results also demonstrate that feature selection can reduce the index size without changing ranked query results much.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1242572.1242607", "venue": "WWW '07", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2136796599", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36759287", "1085832", "14227081", "60779558", "5159247", "10239406", "8684662", "277918", "9966171", "775373", "11664683", "59921147", "7380336", "982", "820648", "10764748", "22633317", "13936575", "17052902", "49710", "2940771", "60654912", "16395771", "17089772"], "inbound_citations": ["15199990", "215703023", "17025874", "15599704", "17265297", "18140381", "743174", "1427846", "6945503", "6414412", "1271753", "45501055", "9482814", "1742960", "15779520", "17839569", "14199534", "14301228", "6722508", "8409014", "199510002", "14709272", "8778310", "44176684"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5994026"}

Automated image segmentation, which aims at automated extraction of region boundary features, plays a fundamental role in understanding image content for searching and mining in medical image archives. A challenging problem is to segment regions with boundary insufficiencies, i.e., missing edges and/or lack of texture contrast between regions of interest (ROIs) and background. To address this problem, several segmentation approaches have been proposed in the literature, with many of them providing rather promising results. In this chapter, we focus on a specific category of image segmentation methods widely used in medical vision, namely the deformable models. We first review two general classes of deformable models, i.e., (1) the parametric deformable models, or active contours, and (2) the geometric or implicit models. Then we describe the feature extraction, i.e., the estimation of image features based on which the segmentation is performed. We show the most common approaches of how the image data is transformed into compact (higher level) numerical representations, which are integrated into the deformable models to play the image-based driving factor for the segmentation. Since these features can be used in a deterministic or probabilistic manner, we describe the basic principles of transforming these numerical representations into probabilities, using two known probabilistic graphical models, namely the Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Then we show how these machine learning methods are integrated with deformable models to yield robust segmentation results. To illustrate the latter case, we describe a geometric model, which is integrated with a CRF: the deformable model is driven by probability fields estimated from the images (features), rather than being driven by the image features directly, with the main advantage being the increased robustness in cases of feature ambiguities, i.e., noise. We show different examples of medical data deformable model-based segmentation, we draw general conclusions from the methods described in this chapter, and we give future directions for solving challenging and open problems in medical image segmentation.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4419-8195-0_2", "venue": "Multi Modality State-of-the-Art Medical Image Segmentation and Registration Methodologies", "journal": "Multi Modality State-of-the-Art Medical Image Segmentation and Registration Methodologies", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "194330574", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["632396", "406088", "7602622", "6428775", "37988997", "59826707", "22617055", "11683218", "122598442", "4841279", "4865389", "13555130", "36044761", "12849354", "1282113", "277918", "15275549", "9505101", "14154576", "1035842", "18836072", "206631161", "56563878", "41053045", "25224187", "36113942", "14115051", "18002044", "17361614", "15489767", "5138046", "6175091", "35561340", "6116435", "6492817"], "inbound_citations": ["13642018", "9377848"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55869353"}

The results of applying SVM methods and the accuracy of forecasting were assessed and compared to those of the ARIMA and ANN methods through the minimum root-mean-square error of the natural logarithms of the data.

An evolutionary algorithm first designs optimal sequence motifs to associate explicit discriminating feature vectors with input DNA sequences. A second evolutionary algorithm then designs SVM kernel functions and parameters that optimally separate the HS and non-HS classes.

In order to capture concepts and events with longer temporal extent, kernels for sequences of feature vectors have been proposed, e.g. based on temporal pyramid matching or sequence alignment. However, all these approaches need a temporal segmentation of the video, as the kernel is applied to the feature vectors of a segment. In (semi-)supervised training, this is not a problem, as the ground truth is annotated on a temporal segment. When performing online concept detection on a live video stream, (i) no segmentation exists and (ii) the latency must be kept as low as possible. Re-evaluating the kernel for each temporal position of a sliding window is prohibitive due to the computational effort. We thus propose variants of the temporal pyramid matching, all subsequences and longest common subsequence kernels, which can be efficiently calculated for a temporal sliding window. An arbitrary kernel function can be plugged in to determine the similarity of feature vectors of individual samples.

Among the main results, we show that the classifier accuracy is preserved at excellent values even when the variable space is reduced by a 20-fold, hence providing a precious tool for cancer patient profiling even in case of limited experimental resources.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28410140", "doi": "10.2741/4566", "venue": "Frontiers in bioscience", "journal": "Frontiers in bioscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2604999186", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["16483446", "27478588", "75434756", "5370622", "29970851", "205108356", "12112025", "11188766", "23694007", "26107200", "214879302", "2512076", "6132929", "14879001", "17675287", "14879001", "15413626", "11910722", "75278263", "1220508", "17446390", "18851406", "6164542", "11016714", "1280204", "207513219", "3853811", "862224", "8632709", "1069019", "23817072", "12933558", "45174121", "207892709", "31122152", "7138354", "25315037", "37368096", "10305417", "15284640", "207049104", "15444165", "2726231"], "inbound_citations": ["90145175", "196665275", "46938865", "4592779", "76660392", "198950249", "208251941"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21447820"}

It is shown that the error has to be back-propagated through the adjoint model of the system and that the gradient can only be obtained after a delay. A faster version, accelerated back propagation, that eliminates this delay, is also developed. Various schemes including the sensitivity method are studied to update the weights of the network using these gradients. Motivated by the Lyapunov approach and the adjoint model, the predictive back propagation and its variant, targeted back propagation, are proposed. A further refinement, predictive back propagation with filtering is then developed, where the states of the model are also updated. The convergence of this scheme is assured. It is shown that it is sufficient to back propagate as many time steps as the order of the system for convergence. As a preamble, convergence of online batch and sample-wise updates in feedforward models is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach. >", "year": 1994, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18267792", "doi": "10.1109/72.279186", "venue": "IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2105377180", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["207511431", "10127893", "64348843", "1522994", "9459536", "127608", "9267259", "207975157", "10203109", "14711886", "122340800"], "inbound_citations": ["26991202", "11827569", "700711", "1031645", "72960368", "61431223", "118124040", "16787111", "18411406", "56329668", "6552762", "15090951", "7975921", "11438958", "14649204", "55888447", "26583484", "204229789", "8875133", "2960919", "12706100", "6430320", "53464892", "52821547"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:651454"}

Thus the research on the internal steam-water separation mechanism is of extremely significant value and the flow characteristics of the free falling water film on the corrugated plate wall are the basis of the research on water film rupture. The phenomenon of water film rupture on the wall surface will have a great impact on the secondary carrying, gas-water separation efficiency and even the economic indicators of nuclear power plants. However, it is meaningful to define whether the water film has broken and the fracture criterion because the method of defining the water film breakdown by the naked eye is extremely unreliable and inaccurate. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for defining the critical point of water film rupture on corrugated plate wall by the application of the SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) feature selection algorithm and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification method. The SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) algorithm is applied to obtaining the characteristic information of the wall water film rupture image when the airflow velocity in the flow channel of the experimental section of the corrugated plate captured by the high-speed camera is gradually increased. Meanwhile, the two-class model of SVM (Support Vector Machine) is used to classify water film images and define the critical point of water film rupture on the corrugated plate wall by training, detection and inversion. The results show that the algorithm based on SIFT feature selection and SVM classification method can well define the critical point of water film rupture, keep the certainty and consistency of the water film rupture determination benchmark, and avoid the introduction of human identification error. It greatly improved the stability of the measurement and provides a reference for the determination of the baseline of water film rupture.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.03.025", "venue": null, "journal": "Nuclear Engineering and Design", "mag_id": "2928677296", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211104748", "210692230", "191165662"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132121801"}

It utilizes a unified forward generative adversarial network (GAN) path and multiple independent backward GAN paths to transform images in different groups into a single reference one. To preserve image details and prevent resolution loss, two jump connections are applied in the CycleGAN generators. A weak-pair strategy is designed to fully utilize the prior knowledge of the organ structure and promote the performance of the GANs.

This work proposes a recursive multimodal (vibration and thermal) tactile material identification approach. Using the frequency response of the vibration induced by the material and a set of thermal features, we show that it is possible to accurately identify materials in less than half a second.

The primary focus was on one of the main problems in this area which is different duration of activities; it is assumed that the beginning and the end are known. Some existing methods use bag of features, hidden Markov models, recurrent neural networks or straighten the time interval by different sampling so that each activity has the same number of frames to solve this problem. The essence of our method is creating one or more matrices with a constant size. The sizes of matrices depend on the vector dimension containing the per-frame low-level features from which the matrix is created. The matrices then characterize the activity, even if we assume that certain activities may have different durations. The principle of this method is tested with two types of input features: (i) 3D position of the skeleton joints and (ii) invariant angular features of the skeleton. All kinds of feature types are processed by MDC separately and, in the subsequent step, all the information gathered together as a feature vector are used for recognition by Support Vector Machine classifier. Experiments have shown that the results are similar to results of the state-of-the-art methods.

In this study, NIR hyperspectral imaging was used to discriminate roots and crop residues of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and soil. This technique has been proposed as an alternative to the tedious hand sorting commonly needed with the soil coring method in studies on roots and crop residues (Eylenbosch et al., 2014). Organic matters collected after washing of soil cores have to be separated before quantification and characterization. Sorting is time-consuming and depends on operator subjectivity (Plaza-Bonilla et al., 2014). Dichotomist classification trees based on successive Support Vector Machine Discriminant Analysis (SVMDA) models were used to predict spectral nature of pixels on hyperspectral images (Fernandez et al., 2004). Images were acquired with a push-broom imaging system working in the range of 1100-2500 nm and combined with a conveyor belt. Our study highlighted the importance to select carefully pixels intended for models construction. A sufficient number of pixels have to be selected to have a high variability of spectra (Lebot, 2012) and care must be taken to select spectra of shadow separately to increase sensitivity of predictions. In our case, spectra of the conveyor belt, on which samples were laid under NIR camera, have been combined with spectra of root shadow in a single class (background). Pixels coming from the background and soil particles were well predicted. Mean percentages of correctly predicted pixels were respectively 100% and 98.4% (\u00b1 1.0%). For root sampled during the growing seasons, 97.7% (\u00b1 0.9 %) pixels were well predicted. Prediction of pixels of dead roots and crop residues was more difficult. Central area of crop residues was always well predicted but most pixels located on the edge were predicted as roots. Only 79.4% (\u00b1 4.7%) pixels of crop residues were well predicted. Use of model pattern recognition should allow to better predict pixels of crop residues and to better separate them from roots.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "433964437", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["122693861", "128441586", "14854046"], "inbound_citations": ["101086320"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127831489"}

In the present study, the authors have employed SVMs for assessing the quality of conceptual cost estimates, which may be helpful in measuring the accuracy of the estimates. The study presented by the authors demonstrates the effectiveness of the SVM-based classification approach in comparison to the discriminant analysis approach. The discussed paper represents an important step toward an ongoing research effort for the use of SVMs for efficient modeling of the complex physical processes involved in solving various civil engineering problems. The objective of this discussion is to make some observations about issues related to the design of SVMs and the way accuracy assessment was carried out in this paper. The discussers feel that certain points require further clarification, which would help readers to understand the authors\u2019 work. A number of research papers, such as Burges 1998 , referred to in the present study, discuss the theory of SVMs. In spite of this, the term \u201ctraining datum\u201d is used in place of \u201ctraining data.\u201d Per the discussers\u2019 view, no such term as training datum exists in the design of SVMs. This requires a clarification from the authors. Further, for defining b bias term , a reference to Fig. 3 in the discussed paper is provided, which does not give any information about this parameter. In their discussion of the nonlinear support vector classifier, the authors mention \u201ca kernel function satisfying this condition is known as the function satisfying Mercer\u2019s condition.\u201d We question the accuracy of this statement. A number of kernel functions are available in the literature, but only those kernels satisfying Mercer\u2019s condition Vapnik 1999 are used as a kernel function in the design of SVMs. So the authors should clarify this paragraph. In the section on SVM for assessing conceptual cost estimates in the discussed paper, the authors suggest that \u201cthe SVM model is better suited to two-class problems than to multiple-class problems.\u201d Again, the authors seem to be unclear about the theory of SVMs. Actually, the support vector classifier was designed for two-class problems Vapnik 1995 , which can easily be extended to multiclass problems by using an appropriate method.

There will be no more difficulty in usage of phones for local users and there is no need for any learning to use the smart phone. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system have achieved a great success in many applications. Among them, Template Matching techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Statistical Pattern Matching techniques such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Machine Learning techniques such as Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees (DT) are most popular. For this system, highest word recognition accuracy is achieved with HMM technique.

Intelligence is being introduced in robots and sensor platforms by utilizing machine learning techniques such as classification. In the field of robotics, generating training data can be very complex and often, expensive. In this set-up, transfer learning can greatly improve the performance of a classifier wherever and whenever enough labeled data is not available in a domain of interest (target domain), but ample labeled data can be found in a different but related domain (source domain). A new optimized method is proposed in this work to transform the observation from source domain along with a new label transfer mechanism. The transformed, or adapted, domain has the same number of features as the target domain and the same number of observations from the source domain.

In a previous work Genetic Algorithms has been used to dynamically optimize the size of RF. This study extends this genetic algorithm approach to further enhance the accuracy of Random Forests by building the forest out of heterogeneous decision trees, heterogeneous here means trees with different M values. The approach is termed as Heterogeneous Genetic Algorithm based Random Forests (HGARF). As Random Forests generates a typical large number of decision trees with randomisation over the feature space when splitting at each node for all the trees, this has motivated the development of a genetic algorithm based optimisation. Typically, HGARF accepts as an input a forest RF\u2192 of N trees, the initial population is randomly generated from RF\u2192 as a number of smaller random forests rf i \u2192 where each one has a number n i \u2264 N of trees.

These symbolic models intentionally segregate syntactic information processing from statistical information as well as semantic, pragmatic, and discourse influences, thereby minimizing the importance of these potential constraints in learning and processing language. While such models have the advantage of being relatively simple and explicit, they are inadequate to account for learning and validated ambiguity resolution phenomena. In recent years, interactive constraint-based theories of sentence processing have gained increasing support, as a growing body of empirical evidence demonstrates early influences of various factors on comprehension performance. Connectionist networks are one form of model that naturally reflect many properties of constraint-based theories, and thus provide a form in which those theories may be instantiated. Unfortunately, most of the connectionist language models implemented until now have involved severe limitations, restricting the phenomena they could address. Comprehension and production models have, by and large, been limited to simple sentences with small vocabularies (cf. St. John & McClelland, 1990). Most models that have addressed the problem of complex, multi-clausal sentence processing have been prediction networks (cf. Elman, 1991; Christiansen & Chater, 1999a). Although a useful component of a language processing system, prediction does not get at the heart of language: the interface between syntax and semantics. The current thesis focuses on the design and testing of the Connectionist Sentence Comprehension and Production (CSCP) model, a recurrent neural network that has been trained to both comprehend and produce a relatively complex subset of English. This language includes such features as tense and number, adjectives and adverbs, prepositional phrases, relative clauses, subordinate clauses, and sentential complements, with a vocabulary of about 300 total words. It is broad enough that it permits the model to address a wide range of sentence processing phenomena. The experiments reported here involve such issues as the relative comprehensibility of various sentence types, the resolution of lexical ambiguities, generalization to novel sentences, the comprehension of main verb/reduced relative, sentential complement, subordinate clause, and prepositional phrase attachment ambiguities, agreement attraction and other production errors, and structural priming. The model is able to replicate many key aspects of human sentence processing across these domains, including sensitivity to lexical and structural frequencies, semantic plausibility, inflectional morphology, and locality effects. A critical feature of the model is its suggestion of a tight coupling between comprehension and production and the idea that language production is primarily learned through the formulation and testing of covert predictions during comprehension.

In this work we show how multi-level optimization can be used to improve partitioning quality of Balanced Label Propagation. One of major difficulties with distributed multi-level optimization is finding a matching in the graph. The matching is needed to choose pairs of vertices for collapsing in order to produce a smaller graph. As this work shows, simply splitting graph into several parts and finding matching in these parts independently is enough to improve the quality of partitioning generated by Balanced Label Propagation.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a binary classifier based on a novel statistical learning technique that has been developed in recent years by Vapnik [2], are applied for face/non-face classification. The face detection system first performs a skin color-based image segmentation by modeling the skin chrominance distribution for several different chrominance spaces. Feature extraction of each face candidate in the segmented images is then implemented by calculating a selected number of OFMMs. Finally, the OFMMs form the input vector to the SVMs. The comparative face detection performance of the SVMs and of a multilayer perceptron Neural Network (NN) is analyzed for a set of 100 test images. For all the chrominance spaces that are used, the application of SVMs to the OFMMs yields a higher detection performance than when applying the NN. Normalized chrominance spaces produce the best segmentation results, and subsequently the highest rate of detection of faces with a large variety of poses, of skin tones and against complex backgrounds. The combination of the OFMMs and of the SVMs, and of the skin color-based image segmentation using normalized chrominance spaces, constitutes a promising approach to achieve robustness in the task of face detection.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-44732-6_9", "venue": "ICAPR", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1583943159", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11773414", "61326592", "17454846"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31370777"}

First, we show that a simple combination of the hypothesis transfer learning and the privacy preserving logistic regression can address the problem. However, the performance of this approach can be poor as the sample size in the target domain may be small. To address this problem, we propose a new method which splits the feature set in source and target data into several subsets, and trains models on these subsets before finally aggregating the predictions by a stacked generalization. Feature importance can also be incorporated into the proposed method to further improve performance. We prove that the proposed method has an $\\epsilon$-differential privacy guarantee, and further analysis shows that its performance is better than above simple combination given the same privacy budget.

This architecture gathers 256 cores distributed in 16 clusters working in parallel. This study aims at implementing a real-time hyperspectral SVM classifier, where real-time is defined as the time required to capture a hyperspectral image. To do so, two aspects of the SVM classifier have been analyzed: the classification algorithm and the system parallelization. On the one hand, concerning the classification algorithm, first, the classification model has been optimized to fit into the MPPA structure and, secondly, a probability estimation stage has been included to refine the classification results. On the other hand, the system parallelization has been divided into two levels: first, the parallelism of the classification has been exploited taking advantage of the pixel-wise classification methodology supported by the SVM algorithm and, secondly, a double-buffer communication procedure has been implemented to parallelize the image transmission and the cluster classification stages. Experimenting with medical images, an average speedup of 9 has been obtained using a single-cluster and double-buffer implementation with 16 cores working in parallel. As a result, a system whose processing time linearly grows with the number of pixels composing the scene has been implemented. Specifically, only 3 \u00b5s are required to process each pixel within the captured scene independently from the spatial resolution of the image.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.sysarc.2017.08.002", "venue": "J.

Arts and Humanities are sciences that are mainly based on the interpretation of cultural objects such as texts, paintings and works of arts, or historical/ethnological remains and monuments. Such objects are often unique, very valuable, fragile, irreplaceable and locally preserved in scientific collections at museums, in archives, or in urban and historic areas. Archives, museums and other cultural institutions do not simply conserve these objects. They also manage a large of documentation on them in the form of photo collections, expertise, records, scientific studies and analyses. Both the objects themselves as well as the supplementary documentation are often accessible only through physical contact with users. Duplicates such as text documents (e.g., critical editions), or image documents (facsimiles, photographs) on paper are extremely expensive in terms of manpower, know-how and printing costs, and often these expenses cannot be justified for a small scientific audience. Electronic formats for object documentation might alleviate this access problem. Numerous initiatives have been started and supported to highlight and investigate a variety of challenges that museums and other culture-historical institutions are facing in an increasingly digital, media saturated landscape. However, full knowledge and usage of this material are severely impeded by access problems, due to the lack of appropriate content-based search and retrieval aids that help users to find what they really need even when electronically and digitized copies are available. Preserving contents does not consist in simply storing them, but in actively transforming them to adapt them technically and keep them intelligible. Moreover, many informal and non-institutional contacts between cultural archives constitute specific professional communities which today, however, still lack effective and efficient technological support for cooperative and collaborative knowledge working. The creation of digital libraries, enhanced by annotation collaboratory facilities, is the technological response to bundle documents, interpretation knowledge, work processes and an expert network in a very flexible working environment. Object and document collections in the Arts and Humanities always represent work in progress. The inventory at cultural institutions is growing steadily due to donations, acquisitions, and by virtue of their own daily scientific and conservation services. These additions must be incorporated into the existing collections, but often space difficulties, problems of scientific know-how and lack of personnel have to be dealt with. Professionals and experts classify, analyze, assess and expose or edit these objects and documents. Highly qualified external specialists are frequently difficult to locate, if they are not part of a scholarly network. Internal experts are often overburdened with routine work in times of small cultural budgets and can only invest time sporadically and intermittently in integrating new inventories. Many scientific members of cultural institutions have temporary contracts and leave after a few years, taking with them a great part of the accumulated know-how. The intrinsic nature of the document processing procedures supporting the progressive work on historic material, as outlined in this introduction, poses several constraints that require solutions specifically tailored to the tasks mentioned above. Over the years, Intelligent Systems are becoming valuable working instruments for researchers involved in humanistic sciences. The new challenge is now to provide these people with tools that are able to facilitate the fruition and investigation of the cultural heritage, so that even non-experts or communities of researchers may use up-to-date tools for both their personal work and for collaborative purposes. Technologically, the World Wide Web can serve both as a standard communication platform for such communities and as a gateway for document-centered digital library applications. Yet, while the Web may solve the problem of the diffusion and access of this material in its digital form, new automated tools are needed to allow a more intelligent processing and a personalized utilization of this knowledge. According to the situation previously described, besides the effectiveness and the efficiency of such solutions, such automatic tools must be able to cope with situations in which the continuous growth of the available material and knowledge is a fundamental and unavoidable issue. Hence, there is the need for a system component that is able to build incrementally upon previously acquired knowledge through diverse reasoning mechanisms. Specifically, the availability of systems that can automatically identify and separate document classes and meaningful parts inside them would alleviate experts from the need to accomplish low-level tasks, thus allowing them to focus on more intellectual Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

For such systems to be successful in a real operating environment, however, their behavior and results must be comprehensible to human experts, which can happen only when symbolic representations are used. The choice of these symbolic mechanisms, which resemble closely the human way of reasoning, also allows a more direct comprehension and control of the knowledge synthesized at every step of the process. In the talk, different experiences and projects in the cultural heritage application domain are briefly presented and the symbolic Machine Learning approaches, developed by the LACAM Lab. of the Department of Computer Science of the University of Bari, are presented. Since the 90\u2019s Document Engineering has been one of the elective application domains for the research group working in the field of Conceptual Learning, Inductive Logic Programming and Statistical Relational Learning. The research projects ([1], [2], [3], [4]) financed by the UE and by the Italian Ministry of Research have allowed the development and the vast experimentation in the domain of Cultural Heritage preservation with different general purpose ML methods and tools. The proprietary systems WISDOM++ [5], ATRE [6], INTHELEX [7], DOMINUS [8] are characterized by the intensive exploitation of intelligent techniques in each step of the document processing, from the acquisition to the layout analysis, from classification to interpretation, from text categorization to semantic indexing for information retrieval purposes. For example, in the project Collate (Collaboratory for Annotation, Indexing and Retrieval of Digitized Historical Archive Material), which aimed to provide a support for archives, researchers and endusers, worked with digitized historic/cultural material. A large corpus of multi-format documents concerning rare historic film censorship forms from the 20's and 30's, fig.1 (a), but also including newspaper articles, photos, stills, posters and film fragments, provided by three major European Film archives, had to be processed. The application of different symbolic learning methods in the diverse phases of the automatic document processing, from the image document acquisition to the layout correction and analysis, from document classification to understanding, allowed to keep contents accessible in their integrity and intelligible according to their meaning. The possibility of understanding the content of a part of a document, basing on the layout, is reported In fig. 1, where an example of a censorship card is shown, with the automatically acquired rule for the recognition of the logic block of the film title, expressed in terms of position and relationships with other logical layout blocks. The application of symbolic ML methods allows to organize and classify documents, to cope with the incrementality and the need for continuous updating and refining classification theories and concepts, in order to improve accuracy according to new available documents. Techniques for text categorization and information extraction can be applied to selected blocks and provide information that can be added to the documents as metadata, in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the retrieval procedure. In document image understanding, the possibility of associating relevant text to underlying informative content allows to search documents at a semantic level rather than just at a syntactic one, in the perspective of the Semantic Web.

Background: Recent emotion recognition studies have tried to detect human emotion by using physiological signals. It is important for emotion reconition to apply on human-computer interaction system for emotion detection. Method: 217 students participated in this experiment. During three different emotional stimuli are presented to participants, ANS responses(EDA, SKT, ECG, Respiration, and PPG) as physiological signals were measured for 1 minute as baseline and for 1-1.5 minutes during emotional state. The obtained signals were analyzed for 30 seconds from the baseline and the emotional state. Participants assessed the induced emotion on emotional assessment scale after emotional stimuli presentation. Analysis for emotion classification were done by linear discriminant analysis (SPSS 15.0), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) using substracting baseline values from the emotional state. Results: The emotional stimuli had 96% validity and 5.8 effectiveness on average. The result of linear discriminant analysis using physiological signals showed that an accuracy of three different emotions classification was 83.4%. And an accuracy of three emotions classification by SVM was 75.5% and 55.6% by MLP. Conclusion: This study identified that three emotions were classified by linear discriminant analysis using various physiological features. Future study is needed to obtain stability and reliablity of this result compare with accuracy of emotion classification using other algorithms. Application: This could help emotion recognition studies lead to better chance to recognize various human emotions by using physiological signals as well as is able to be applied on human-computer interaction system for emotion reecognition.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1550212353", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:142726671"}

In fact, a proper outfit usually relies on good matching among complementary fashion items (e.g., the top, bottom, and shoes) that compose it, which thus propels us to investigate the automatic complementary clothing matching scheme. However, this is non-trivial due to the following challenges. First, the main challenge lies in how to accurately model the compatibility between complementary fashion items (e.g., the top and bottom) that come from the heterogeneous spaces with multi-modalities (e.g., the visual modality and textual modality). Second, since different features (e.g., the color, style, and pattern) of fashion items may contribute differently to compatibility modeling, how to encode the confidence of different pairwise features presents a tough challenge. Third, how to jointly learn the latent representation of multi-modal data and the compatibility between complementary fashion items contributes to the last challenge. Toward this end, in this work, we present an end-to-end attention-based neural framework for the compatibility modeling, where we introduce a feature-level attention model to adaptively learn the confidence for different pairwise features.

The instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies of resulted bands (intrinsic mode functions, IMF) are then tracked by the direct quadrature method (DQ). In contrast to other approaches, DQ cancels the effect of amplitude modulation on frequency calculation. The dissociation between instantaneous amplitude and frequency information is therefore fully achieved to avoid features confusion.

Speci cally, research is focused on improving the SAR binary classi cation performance aspect of ATR, or the ability to accurately determine the class of a SAR target. The key to improving ATR classi cation performance lies in characterizing the salient target features. Salient features may be loosely de ned as the most consistently impactful parts of a SAR target contributing to e ective SAR ATR classi cation. To better understand the notion of salience, an investigation is conducted into the nature of saliency as applied to Air Force Research Lab's (AFRL) civilian vehicle (CV) data domes simulated phase history data set. After separating vehicles into two SAR data classes, sedan and SUV, frequency and polarization features are extracted from SAR data and formed into either 1D high range resolution (HRR) or 2D spectrum parted linked image test (SPLIT) feature vectors. A series of experiments comparing vehicle classes are designed and conducted to focus speci cally on the saliency e ects of various SAR collection parameters including azimuth angle, aperture size, elevation angle, and bandwidth. The popular kernel-based Bayesian Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) classi er is utilized for sparse identi cation of relevant vectors contributing most to the creation of a hyperplane decision boundary.

An understanding of how neuroticism influences responses to psychological distress may shed a light upon individual differences in emotion self-regulation. To study the causal relationship between neuroticism and psychophysiological signals, a selection of appropriate baseline signals as a reference signal is essential to compare to current experimental signals of interest. Thus, we present classification of neuroticism using psychophysiological signals obtained during a speaking task based on two different baseline measurements (eyes closed and eyes open). Eight healthy male participants consisting of four neurotic and four emotionally stable subjects were recruited based on Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) and Big Five Inventory (BFI) scoring system. Four features including mean EEG beta power, heart rate, skin conductance, and respiration rate were used for the classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In this paper, a sampling strategy over a large imbalanced dataset is proposed, in which the samples of the larger class are selected based on fuzzy logic. To further reduce the data size, the evolutionary computational method of CHC is employed. The evaluation is done by applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to train a classification model from the re-sampled training sets. From experimental results, it can be seen that our proposed method improves both the F-measure and AUC. The complexity of the classification model is also compared.

Most of existing methods employ a very coarse-grained type taxonomy, which is too general and not exact enough for many tasks. However, the performances of the methods drop sharply when we extend the type taxonomy to a fine-grained one with several hundreds of types. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid neural network model for type classification of entity mentions with a fine-grained taxonomy. There are four components in our model, namely, the entity mention component, the context component, the relation component, the already known type component, which are used to extract features from the target entity mention, context, relations and already known types of the entity mentions in surrounding context respectively. The learned features by the four components are concatenated and fed into a softmax layer to predict the type distribution. We carried out extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FIGER dataset. Moreover, we extracted larger datasets from Wikipedia and DBpedia.

So far, more attention has been paid on constructing new kernels and choosing suitable parameter values for a specific kernel function, but less on kernel selection. Furthermore, most of current kernel selection methods focus on seeking a best kernel with the highest classification accuracy via cross-validation, they are time consuming and ignore the differences among the number of support vectors and the CPU time of SVM with different kernels. Considering the tradeoff between classification success ratio and CPU time, there may be multiple kernel functions performing equally well on the same classification problem. Aiming to automatically select those appropriate kernel functions for a given data set, we propose a multi-label learning based kernel recommendation method built on the data characteristics. For each data set, the meta-knowledge data base is first created by extracting the feature vector of data characteristics and identifying the corresponding applicable kernel set. Then the kernel recommendation model is constructed on the generated meta-knowledge data base with the multi-label classification method. Finally, the appropriate kernel functions are recommended to a new data set by the recommendation model according to the characteristics of the new data set. Extensive experiments over 132 UCI benchmark data sets, with five different types of data set characteristics, eleven typical kernels (Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function, Sigmoidal function, Laplace, Multiquadric, Rational Quadratic, Spherical, Spline, Wave and Circular), and five multi-label classification methods demonstrate that, compared with the existing kernel selection methods and the most widely used RBF kernel function, SVM with the kernel function recommended by our proposed method achieved the highest classification performance.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4403820", "pubmed_id": "25893896", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0120455", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1974752961", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["207165665", "206787478", "15874442", "1845191", "117643475", "37723864", "15034664", "2378587", "2698102", "10039376", "207601736", "15234190", "11652139", "39809197", "1871891", "5894296", "10786968", "623918", "592356", "11462309", "681827", "27824921", "26328693", "2552688", "1008003", "11608263", "35959508", "13044872", "15676013", "2876102", "7498053", "2032493", "6898072", "2449067", "7916954", "14171756", "14363287", "121855448", "3711178", "205699441", "36698128", "15968876", "2351470", "15462094", "62727072", "15182383", "2884606", "11918446", "8668257", "120581754", "122415379", "207211581", "15136247", "1976599", "97681", "3162247", "6644398", "10350219", "5083193", "33296374", "14991300", "961425", "16552240", "3958369", "28637672", "53662922", "7553535"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9711595"}

For the CTC training, however, it is required to unroll (or unfold) the RNN by the length of an input sequence. This unrolling requires a lot of memory and hinders a small footprint implementation of online learning or adaptation. Furthermore, the length of training sequences is usually not uniform, which makes parallel training with multiple sequences inefficient on shared memory models such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm that enables unidirectional RNNs to learn sequences that are longer than the amount of unrolling. The RNNs can also be trained to process an infinitely long input sequence without pre-segmentation or external reset. Moreover, the proposed approach allows efficient parallel training on GPUs. For evaluation, phoneme recognition and end-to-end speech recognition examples are presented on the TIMIT and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpora, respectively. Our online model achieves 20.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the very long input sequence that is generated by concatenating all 192 utterances in the TIMIT core test set. On WSJ, a network can be trained with only 64 times of unrolling while sacrificing 4.5% relative word error rate (WER).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1511.06841", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2262659794", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61556494", "11760007", "12485056", "59636530", "14177763", "16227628", "5590763", "1921173", "61779829", "1166498", "1856462", "9901844", "14986843", "206741496", "2118350", "14832074", "1915014", "15353450", "202149403", "2618014", "7961699", "18470994", "12979634", "17719760", "7365802"], "inbound_citations": ["2181686", "15313157", "6680389", "49274645", "210968704", "211217929", "15673059", "53603131"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1003067"}

In particular, this work is focused on the use of these strategies for predicting mechanical properties, which are relevant for the design of polymeric materials. The methodology analysed in this study employs a feature learning method that uses a quantification process of 2D structural characterization of materials with the autoencoder method. Alternative QSPR models inferred for tensile strength at break (a well-known mechanical property of polymers) are presented. These alternative models are contrasted to QSPR models obtained by feature selection technique by using accuracy measures and a visual analytic tool. The results show evidence about the benefits of combining feature learning approaches with feature selection methods for the design of QSPR models.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29215989", "doi": "10.1515/jib-2016-286", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["214875496", "30285330", "96397166", "94907928", "43458369", "6621315"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33452969"}

In contrast to the existing approaches, which require tuples of corresponding images in different domains in the training set, CoGAN can learn a joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. It can learn a joint distribution with just samples drawn from the marginal distributions. This is achieved by enforcing a weight-sharing constraint that limits the network capacity and favors a joint distribution solution over a product of marginal distributions one. We apply CoGAN to several joint distribution learning tasks, including learning a joint distribution of color and depth images, and learning a joint distribution of face images with different attributes. For each task it successfully learns the joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. We also demonstrate its applications to domain adaptation and image transformation.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1606.07536", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue":

In this paper, we intend to classify motor imagery EEG signals by exploiting the fact that the space of SPD matrices endowed with Riemannian distance is a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. To alleviate the overfitting and heavy computation problems associated with conventional classification methods on high-dimensional manifold, we propose a framework for intrinsic sub-manifold learning from a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Considering a special case of SPD space, a simple yet efficient bilinear sub-manifold learning (BSML) algorithm is derived to learn the intrinsic sub-manifold by identifying a bilinear mapping that maximizes the preservation of the local geometry and global structure of the original manifold. Two BSML-based classification algorithms are further proposed to classify the data on a learned intrinsic sub-manifold. Experimental evaluation of the classification of EEG revealed that the BSML method extracts the intrinsic sub-manifold approximately $5\\times $ faster and with higher classification accuracy compared with competing algorithms. The BSML also exhibited strong robustness against a small training dataset, which often occurs in BCI studies.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27392361", "doi": "10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2587939", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2464293894", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13611222", "10908715", "9599623", "16581906", "423006", "7817555", "16112741", "9421114", "1536455", "6485120", "2599631", "123350066", "5667482", "2049761", "1810410", "14688376", "207082617", "12701432", "31293400", "20530661", "11846528", "8561242", "8025620", "117041671", "122720328", "6164529", "15664892", "9408688", "5523504", "10569926", "16768813", "16114059", "23288279", "906709", "18314042", "17491729"], "inbound_citations": ["53093595", "3764585", "59523783", "13857467", "202676395", "11462557", "201805787", "21696937", "210970764", "204229243", "204231953", "210995496", "52299697", "195064871", "211010747", "55037344"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206761269"}

Conventional algorithms tend to use signals from sensors and detect faults after incipience, consequent to which corrective measures can be taken for mitigation. From an alternate perspective, it may be visualized that when some of the state parameters of the system combine to form specific relationships, such adverse digressions are engendered. Therefore, identifying these combinatorial relationships immediately upon formation can help in mitigation of such adverse effects. The advent of IoT in industry helped bring real time data to computing platforms where Machine Learning techniques can potentially be developed to detect formation of such relationships. Traditional Neural Networks (NN) can be used as a Machine Learning tool, but they require lot of time for training, and moreover, because the industrial data comes with a significant noise component, further processing of the NN outputs are needed before they can be used for such prediction purposes. Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) require about two orders of magnitude less training time, but are even more susceptible to noise corruption than NN due to reasons discussed in this paper. In this work, a method is developed to first filter out noise from industrial sensory data in real time from its spectral content, and then its downstream use in ELMs designed in ensemble pattern is found to generate outputs for predicting adverse digressions that are at least as accurate as traditional neural networks but with significantly reduced training time.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/indicon.2017.8487562", "venue": "2017 14th IEEE India Council International Conference (INDICON)", "journal": "2017 14th IEEE India Council International Conference (INDICON)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2896320160", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27553925", "7443457", "5575228", "114402074", "116858", "23155638", "23155638", "206757279", "15037168", "15212478"], "inbound_citations": ["208629858", "59555239"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52964351"}

As an effective approach to solve graph mining problems, network embedding aims to learn a low-dimensional feature vector representation for each node of a given network.

In this paper, we propose a deep network embedding model to learn the low-dimensional node vector representations with structural balance preservation for the signed networks. The model employs a semisupervised stacked auto-encoder to reconstruct the adjacency connections of a given signed network. As the adjacency connections are overwhelmingly positive in the real-world signed networks, we impose a larger penalty to make the auto-encoder focus more on reconstructing the scarce negative links than the abundant positive links. In addition, to preserve the structural balance property of signed networks, we design the pairwise constraints to make the positively connected nodes much closer than the negatively connected nodes in the embedding space. Based on the network representations learned by the proposed model, we conduct link sign prediction and community detection in signed networks.

Many successful object detection systems use part-based model which trains several filters (classifiers) for each class to perform multiclass object detection. However, these methods have linear computational complexity in regard to the number of classes and may lead to huge computing time. To solve the problem, some works learn a codebook for the filters and conduct operations only on the codebook to make computational complexity sublinear in regard to the number of classes. But the past studies missed to consider filter characteristics, e.g., filters are weights trained by Support Vector Machine, and rather they applied method such as sparse coding for visual signals' optimization. This misuse results in huge accuracy loss when a large speedup is required. To remedy this shortcoming, we have developed a new method called Regularized Sparse Coding which is designed to reconstruct filter functionality. That is, it reconstructs the ability of filter to produce accurate score for classification. Our method can reconstruct filters by minimizing score map error, while sparse coding reconstructs filters by minimizing appearance error. This different optimization strategy makes our method be able to have small accuracy loss when a large speedup is achieved. On the ILSVRC 2013 dataset, which has 200 classes, this work represents a 16 times speedup using only 1.25% memory on single CPU with 0.04 mAP drop when compared with the original Deformable Part Model.

Three strategies can increase agricultural production: (1) expanding agriculture into natural ecosystems; (2) intensifying existing farmland; or (3) recultivating abandoned farmland. Because agricultural expansion entails substantial environmental trade-offs, intensification and recultivation are currently gaining increasing attention. Assessing where these strategies may be pursued, however, requires improved spatial information on land use intensity, including where farmland is active and fallow. We developed a framework to integrate optical and radar data in order to advance the mapping of three farmland management regimes: (1) large-scale, mechanized agriculture; (2) small-scale, subsistence agriculture; and (3) fallow or abandoned farmland. We applied this framework to our study area in western Ukraine, a region characterized by marked spatial heterogeneity in management intensity due to the legacies from Soviet land management, the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the recent integration of this region into world markets. We mapped land management regimes using a hierarchical, object-based framework. Image segmentation for delineating objects was performed by using the Superpixel Contour algorithm. We then applied Random Forest classification to map land management regimes and validated our map using randomly sampled in-situ data, obtained during an extensive field campaign. Our results showed that farmland management regimes were mapped reliably, resulting in a final map with an overall accuracy of 83.4%. Comparing our land management regimes map with a soil map revealed that most fallow land occurred on soils marginally suited for agriculture, but some areas within our study region contained considerable potential for recultivation. Overall, our study highlights the potential for an improved, more nuanced mapping of agricultural land use by combining imagery of different sensors.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs6065279", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2127247500", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128721279", "17727823", "21907725", "11996288", "154850375", "44009934", "6471216", "4346486", "17747414", "34293897", "128594026", "21846755", "15347659", "17643168", "154484385", "5963376", "154588794", "67783295", "55619952", "44383232", "131127469", "128817064", "53331762", "55431138", "129303286", "130216496", "130064193", "16171945", "129481234", "55845438", "7620585", "16238645", "29057737", "7935361", "129888771", "27328449", "140566109", "128415711", "86219373", "33636814", "134704846", "7900350", "34859513", "2849835", "84840505", "120753665", "39113503", "19327155", "10043864", "129864797", "128688797", "8615783", "129803305", "129787412", "52083947", "153717846", "52088087", "155613660", "130299359", "52088111", "154767932", "89141", "27545358", "28170349", "129022625", "128585803", "21916507", "2443126", "17790307", "16203715", "140670581", "380771", "123476171", "95480604", "21854740", "140668244", "40971331"], "inbound_citations": ["55388407", "16789883", "52060051", "4810687"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9475634"}

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of automating part of the coaching procedure on physical activity by providing personalized feedback throughout the day on a participant's progress in achieving a personal step goal. The gathered step count data was used to train eight different machine learning algorithms to make hourly estimations of the probability of achieving a personalized, daily steps threshold.

To demonstrate the practical usefulness of these models, we developed a proof-of-concept Web application that provides personalized feedback about whether a participant is expected to reach his or her daily threshold.

The new training algorithm is fast and simple. This is achieved by an over-complete wavelet transform that finds the optimal approximation of the support vectors. The presented derivation shows that the wavelet theory provides an upper bound on the distance between the decision function of the support vector machine and our classifier. The obtained classifier is fast, since a Haar wavelet approximation of the support vectors is used, enabling efficient integral image-based kernel evaluations. This provides a set of cascaded classifiers of increasing complexity for an early rejection of vectors easy to discriminate.

However, the predefined categories or apps descriptions are usually not very accurate to reflect the real functionalities of apps, thereby leading to misclassify the apps, which may cause serious security issues and unreliability problem in the app store. Therefore, the automatic app classification is an important demand to construct a secure, reliable, integrated, and easy to navigate app store. In this paper, we propose an effective method called AndroClass to automatically classify apps based on their real functionalities by using rich and comprehensive features representing the actual functionalities of the apps. AndroClass performs three steps of feature extraction, feature refinement, and classification. In the feature extraction step, we extract 14 various features for each app by utilizing a unified tool suite. In the feature refinement step, we apply Random Forest algorithm to refine the features. In the classification step, we combine refined features into a single one and AndroClass is equipped with K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Deep Neural Network to classify apps. On the contrary to the existing methods, all the utilized features in AndroClass are stable and clearly represent the actual functionalities of the app, AndroClass does not pose any issues to the user privacy, and our method can be applied to classify unreleased or newly released apps.

In this paper, We proposed a data-stream ensemble classifier for reacting to different types of concept drift, called Drift-detection based Incremental Ensemble (DIE).

In the chunk-based framework, a drift detector is used to monitor the dynamics of data distribution.

Data perturbation or distortion is a widely used approach for privacy protection. Either by adding noises or matrix decomposition methods, many algorithms were developed based on the simulation of attacker's behaviors. Most of them are complicated and computationally infeasible on dataset with huge attribute space. In addition, the real-world data tend to be inconsistent, re- dundant and consist of irrelevant part to target information. Executing algorithms on such data is costly and ineffective. Data preprocessing routines attempt to smooth out noise while identifying outliers, and correct inconsistencies in the data. One of the most important data preprocessing techniques is feature selection. In this paper, we intensively studied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based data distortion strategy and feature selection techniques, and conducted experiments to explore how feature selection approaches should be used and better serve for privacy preservation purpose. Sparsified Singular Value Decomposition (SSVD) and filter based feature selection are used for data distortion and reducing feature space. We propose a modified version of Exponential Threshold Strategy(ETS) as our threshold function for matrix sparsification. Some metrics are used to measure data distortion level.

This study presents two new extensions of Markov Chain (MC) methods, namely the Online-Markov Chains (O-MC) and Extreme Online-Markov Chains (EO-MC) methods to improve the prediction accuracy. The O-MC method has the advantage of the online implementation of the correct variable states, and the EO-MC method has the advantage of online updating the Markov Matrix ( MM ) along with the online implementation of the correct variable states. The new O-MC and the EO-MC methods were evaluated using short-term satellites signal predictions for six different case study rivers. The Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was used to measure the reliability of the new MC-based methods. Each model was developed 1000 times to calculate two indices, namely the 95 Percent Predicted Uncertainties ( 95PPU ) and average distance factor ( d-factor ). The performances of MC and two extensions of O-MC and EO-MC were also examined for cases where we lack the training data. The Training Percent ( TrPr ) of the entire dataset gradually decreased from 90% to 1%, and the performance of the models in producing accurate future signals in the non-observed dataset is calculated. The Input Variable Imitation ( IVI ) problem was considered for the MC-based methods, and the results were compared with the Linear Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression methods. The results showed that the performance of EO-MC and O-MC are better than the simple MC method. In addition, it is concluded that EO-MC and O-MC have very similar performance in the uncertainty analysis and both methods are robust techniques. The main advantage of EO-MC compared with the O-MC method is highlighted when the number of training samples are very low.

This event highlighted the importance of an operational sea-ice classification map for ice routing to serve ship navigation. In this paper, unprecedented Antarctic sea-ice classification algorithms from RADARSAT-2 satellite dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were developed using the conditional random fields (CRF) approach by including multiple features from sea-ice concentration, gray-level cooccurrence matrix textures, polarization ratio, backscatter coefficients, and intensity data.

Since the data used in this study are observational (i.e., collected outside the purview of a designed experiment), an information discovery approach is adopted for this study. ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: Random Forests, which are ensembles of individual trees grown by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this purpose. Specifically, conditional inference forests have been implemented. In each tree of the conditional inference forest, splits are based on how good the association is. Chi-square test statistics are used to measure the association. Apart from identifying the variables that improve classification accuracy, the methodology also clearly identifies the variables that are neutral to accuracy, and also those that decrease it. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The methodology is quite insightful in identifying the variables of interest in the database (e.g., alcohol/ drug use and higher posted speed limits contribute to severe crashes). Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of driver/passenger in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 years) increased the severity of injuries given a crash had occurred. A new variable, 'element' has been used in this study, which assigns crashes to segments, intersections, or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control, and presence of signals. ::: ::: ::: IMPACT ::: The authors were able to identify roadway locations where severe crashes tend to occur. For example, segments and access points were found to be riskier for single vehicle crashes. Higher skid resistance and k-factor also contributed toward increased severity of injuries in crashes.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19778656", "doi": "10.1016/j.jsr.2009.05.003", "venue": "Journal of safety research", "journal": "Journal of safety research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1994378967", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["24754541", "22301587", "111335326", "3592276", "20393499", "89141", "60993494", "2730735", "4670670", "18840463", "13301799", "25885839", "6074128", "125866813", "107556788", "110651455", "38601568", "153491219", "108052794", "8529157", "20268531", "111165897", "108966880", "39153954", "20265893"], "inbound_citations": ["85543229", "3824858", "61283", "111070645", "167214154", "2587560", "45208844", "110462200", "1081742", "12314270", "13925440", "16895686", "56231146", "114695687", "3296082", "145889"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1936061"}

For this aim, a novel method named as SVM\u2013FFA is developed by hybridizing the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with Firefly Algorithm (FFA) to predict the monthly mean horizontal global solar radiation using three meteorological parameters of sunshine duration ( n \u00af ), maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) as inputs. The predictions accuracy of the proposed SVM\u2013FFA model is validated compared to those of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP) models. The root mean square (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), correlation coefficient (r) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as reliable indicators to assess the models\u2019 performance. The attained results show that the developed SVM\u2013FFA model provides more precise predictions compared to ANN and GP models, with RMSE of 0.6988, R2 of 0.8024, r of 0.8956 and MAPE of 6.1768 in training phase while, RMSE value of 1.8661, R2 value of 0.7280, r value of 0.8532 and MAPE value of 11.5192 are obtained in the testing phase.

Constraints in the framework of reinforcement learning are dealt with by state-action veto policies. We propose a theoretical background for the hierarchy of training refinements, showing that the effective action repertoires learnt on the PCM are maximal, and that the PCM-optimal policy gives maximal state value functions. We apply the approach to learn the control of Linked Multicomponent Robotic Systems using Reinforcement Learning. The paradigmatic example is the transportation of a hose. The system has strong physical constraints and a large state space.

A number of automatic information extraction image classification algorithms have been developed over the years for flood mapping using optical remote sensing images. Most classification algorithms generally help in selecting a pixel in a particular class label with the greatest likelihood. However, these hard classification methods often fail to generate a reliable flood inundation mapping because of the presence of mixed pixels in the images. To solve the mixed pixel problem, advanced image processing techniques are adopted, and the linear spectral unmixing method is one of the most popular soft classification techniques used for mixed pixel analysis. The good performance of linear spectral unmixing depends on two important issues: the method of selecting endmembers and the method to model the endmembers for unmixing. This chapter presents an improvement in the adaptive selection of the endmember subset for each pixel in the spectral unmixing method for reliable flood mapping. Using a fixed set of endmembers for spectral unmixing all pixels in an entire image might cause overestimation of the endmember spectra residing in a mixed pixel and hence reduce the performance level of spectral unmixing. Compared to this, application of an estimated adaptive subset of endmembers for each pixel can decrease the residual error in unmixing results and provide a reliable output. In this chapter, it has also been proved that this proposed method can improve the accuracy of conventional linear unmixing methods and is also easy to apply. Three different linear spectral unmixing methods were applied to test the improvement in unmixing results.

In this article, we have identified different parameters or features from five different learning sectors or fields which can give an impact on the student's learning process. So, we have processed in a way that will find out the data mining model which can give better accuracy of student's performance and also can find out which parameters or features among the five fields are playing a great role in their academic results. Moreover, we can apply these features by inspiring good or average students to improve their learning process.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIEV.2019.8858551", "venue": "2019 Joint 8th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2019 3rd International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)", "journal": "2019 Joint 8th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2019 3rd International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2979629481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["64728308", "10479095", "59181428", "61446768", "111383032", "26220070", "44142439", "52901672", "52009301", "5022517"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204229580"}

However, this assumption is often untenable as the online social networks are quite sparse and a majority of users only have a small number of friends. Besides, explicit friends may not share similar interests because of the randomness in the process of building social networks. Therefore, discovering a number of reliable friends for each user plays an important role in advancing social recommendation. Unlike other studies which focus on extracting valuable explicit social links, our work pays attention to identifying reliable friends in both the observed and unobserved social networks. Concretely, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end social recommendation framework based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN). The framework is composed of two blocks: a generator that is used to produce friends that can possibly enhance the social recommendation model, and a discriminator that is responsible for assessing these generated friends and ranking the items according to both the current user and her friends' preferences. With the competition between the generator and the discriminator, our framework can dynamically and adaptively generate reliable friends who can perfectly predict the current user' preference at a specific time. As a result, the sparsity and unreliability problems of explicit social relations can be mitigated and the social recommendation performance is significantly improved.

However, when faced with imbalanced datasets where the number of negative instances far outnumbers the positive instances, the performance of SVM drops significantly (Wu & Chang, 2003). There are many applications in which instances belonging to one class are heavily outnumbered by instances belonging to another class. Such datasets are called imbalanced datasets, since the class distributions are not evenly balanced. Examples of these imbalanced datasets include the human genome dataset and network intrusion datasets. In the human genome dataset, only a small proportion of the DNA sequences represent genes, and the rest do not. In network intrusion datasets, most of the nodes in a network are benign; however, a small number may have been compromised. Other examples include detecting credit card fraud, where most transactions are legitimate, whereas a few are fraudulent; and face recognition datasets, where only some people on a watch list need to be flagged, but most do not. An imbalance of 100 to 1 exists in fraud detection domains, and it approaches 100,000 to 1 in other applications (Provost & Fawcett, 2001). Although it is crucial to detect the minority class in these datasets, most off-the-shelf machine learning (ML) algorithms fail miserably at this task. The reason for that is simple: Most ML algorithms are designed to minimize the classification error. They are designed to generalize from sample data and output the simplest hypothesis that best fits the data, based on the principle of Occam\u2019s razor. This principle is embedded in the inductive bias of many machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, which favour shorter trees over longer ones. With imbalanced data, the simplest hypothesis is often the one that classifies all the instances as the majority class. Consider the scenario where a network consists of 1000 nodes, 10 of which have been compromised by an attacker. If the ML algorithm classifies all of these nodes as uncompromised, it misclassifies only 10 out of 1000 nodes, resulting in a classification error of only 1%. In most cases, an accuracy of 99% is considered very good. However, such a classifier would be useless for detecting compromised nodes.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/8618", "venue": "Application of Machine Learning", "journal": "Application of Machine Learning", "mag_id": "1487191286", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["58675358"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60879690"}

Unlike previous works that simply aggregate or cascade classifiers for addressing image segmentation and labeling tasks, we propose to embed strong classifiers into a tree structure that allows bi-directional flow of information between its classifier nodes to gradually improve their performances. Our DMT is a generic classification model that inherently embeds different cascades of classifiers while enhancing learning transfer between them to boost up their classification accuracies. Specifically, each node in our DMT can nest a Structured Random Forest (SRF) classifier or a Bayesian Network (BN) classifier. The proposed SRF-BN DMT architecture has several appealing properties. First, while SRF operates at a patch-level (regular image region), BN operates at the super-pixel level (irregular image region), thereby enabling the DMT to integrate multi-level image knowledge in the learning process. Second, although BN is powerful in modeling dependencies between image elements (superpixels, edges) and their features, the learning of its structure and parameters is challenging. On the other hand, SRF may fail to accurately detect very irregular object boundaries. The proposed DMT robustly overcomes these limitations for both classifiers through the ascending and descending flow of contextual information between each parent node and its children nodes. Third, we train DMT using different scales for input patches and superpixels. Basically, as we go deeper along the tree edges nearing its leaf nodes, we progressively decrease the patch and superpixel sizes, producing segmentation maps that capture a coarse-to-fine image details. Last, DMT demonstrates its outperformance in comparison to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods for multi-labeling of brain images with gliomas.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.05.112", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2808341034", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52288752", "211075319", "54047619"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52172883"}

Here the underlying classification task of SVM is used as an optimization problem of DE, while t-SNE provides better ordering of genes for selection purpose. Generally, t-SNE is used to reorder the genes in such a way so that similar genes are grouped together and dissimilar genes are kept further apart.

A novel educational simulation was developed consisting of a virtual classroom with whiteboard where users can draw symbols.

Connectionist models have begun to explore the influence of the age/order of acquisition of the items (and also their frequency of encounter) (Ellis & Lambon Ralph, 2000; Lambon Ralph & Ehsan, 2006; Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002). We explored age-limited learning effects in a connectionist model similar to that used by Lambon Ralph and Ehsan (2006) but with the use of a frequency trajectory (Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002), which refers to changes in the frequency of the words over long periods of age, since frequency trajectory is thought to better index age-limited learning effects than traditional AoA measures (Bonin, Barry, Meot, & Chalard, 2004). Our simulations show that the influence of frequency trajectory varies as a function of the mappings between input and output units in a similar type of neural network to that used by Lambon Ralph and Ehsan (2006). Introduction An important issue in psychological science is to determine whether items (words, objects, faces, etc.) which are acquired early in life are processed faster and more accurately by adults than those which are acquired later in life, namely whether there is a late influence of early acquisitions. A large number of studies have convincingly shown that words acquired early in life are processed faster and more accurately than words acquired later in life (Johnston & Barry, 2006; Juhasz, 2005 for recent reviews) using age of acquisition (AoA) norms collected from either adult ratings or from children's performance. The so-called age-of-acquisition effects have been found in a large variety of tasks (e.g., object, face and action naming, word reading, lexical decision) and in different populations (e.g., children, young and old adults, aphasics). However, despite robust AoA effects in a wide variety of lexical tasks, there is a current debate as to whether the order of acquisition of the words is per se an important factor in determining the ease of processing the words in both normal and impaired adults or whether AoA measures actually underlie other hidden factors. It is plausible that the order of acquisition of the words is a factor which is directly responsible for the ease of processing the words, and indeed this is the crucial tenet of the \u201cAoA hypothesis\u201d. Recent attempts to independently manipulate this factor have shown a reliable influence on the learning of artificial patterns in laboratory settings (Stewart & Ellis, 2008). However, as far as the learning of the words of a language is concerned, there are obviously, factors other than the order in which the words and/or concepts were encountered also clearly underlie the speed and accuracy of acquisition (with the result that certain words are acquired before others). These factors are truly responsible for the AoA effects found in lexical processing in adults. Among these factors are (1) the frequency of encounter of the words (e.g., during certain period of life, during one's entire life) and (2) the kind of relationships (i,e., systematic, quasi-systematic, arbitrary that exists between different types of codes (e.g., between phonological and orthographic codes, between semantic codes and phonological codes). Frequency trajectories refer to the fact that some words are more frequent during certain periods of acquisition (e.g., \u201cdragon\u201d during childhood) than others (e.g., \u201ctax\u201d during adulthood) and the words which are frequently encountered are acquired earlier than those which are encountered less frequently (Bonin, Barry, Meot, & Chalard, 2004; Hazard, De Cara, & Chanquoy, in press; Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002). But as we shall explain, the question of whether words which have been frequently encountered during a period of acquisition are easier to process later in life than words encountered less frequently also depends on the kind of relationships that exists between different types of codes (and which have to be learned). In alphabetic languages such as English or French, there are quasi-systematic relationships between sound units and orthographic units, whereas the relationships between semantic units and phonological (or orthographic) units are arbitrary.

Since the specific characteristics of the model depend on the neuron, a computational method is required to fit models to electrophysiological (EP) recording. However, important drawbacks of these models are that they only work within the defined limits to fit the EP recordings presented. These limitations su ggest that the ideal would not be to fit existing models, but to construct a model for each kind of neurons. Recently, several labs around the world have approached the question about what constitutes a good neuron model by assessing it quality regarding to spike timing prediction or features of the voltage trace. This work describes a first effort to design a methodology that creates automatically SNMs using an Evolutionary Computation Strategy (ECS). This methodology generates a mathematical equation that reproduces the behavior of biological neurons. Creating a SNM to reproduce EP data is performed by maximizing a fitness function which measures the adequacy of the model to the data. This task is done by using Gene Expression Programming (GEP), an ECS that automatically creates computer programs such as conventional mathematical models, sophisticated nonlinear models, and so on.

Preface Now, water injection to stratum is the popular method to produce oil in more and more oil fields. Water-flooded zone identification of oil field is an important problem during development\u2019s middle-late period, and it is bursting to solve. Water-flooded zone identification mostly depends on log-curves which reflect physical and chemic character of stratum. It is a difficult problem of oil field geological analysis that how to carry out automatically identifying by using the information. The workload of manual identification is huge, and speed is so slow that it doesn\u2019t satisfy practical demand. The topmost identifying accuracy is between 70% and 80% because many conditions of subterranean affect Water-flooded zone identification . During oil field geological analysis, we often use the method of making cored well for knowing Waterflooded zone condition better, geological analysis according such as character of subterranean rock-core which is from cored well. But it\u2019s very expensive of making cored well\uff0cso the number of cored well\u2019s data are limited. Our task is how to reflect geometrical peculiarity of actual curve by the received data which are from limited log-curve information, and then obtain the correct rules and make use of it for the future analysis of geology. There are a lot of log-curve identifying methods [1] and we can use many transforms for getting features of these curves [2][3] . This article uses wavelet transform to dispose primal data, it can reduce the calculational complexity and reflect geometrical peculiarity of primal data better in some aspects, for example: wave crest and inflexion. In the reference [4], a model based on process neural network was proposed. The structure of process neural network is similar to traditional MP model, it contains three parts: adding weight\u3001polymerization and prompting operation constitutes. It is different from traditional nerve cell. The differences lie in that weights and inputs can be changed with the time in processing nerve cell and its polymerization operation includeing polymerizing many special inputs and accumulating time process. A generic study algorithm based on grads descending was proposed in the reference [5] which presents a training problem of process neural network for us. A model based on wavelet transform and process SVM [6][7] (Wavelet-SVM) for automatically identifying log-curve stratum is proposed, it\u2019s a improvement on traditional method.

The LULC maps and transition probabilities matrices (TPM) were built based on the manual classification of high-resolution aerial photos and multispectral Landsat images for the same years. We considered the maps and TPM constructed from the aerial photos as a control, and compared them to those constructed from the Landsat images classified with several methods: mean-shift segmentation followed by Random Forest classification methods, and three pixel-based methods of classification: K-means, ISODATA, and maximum likelihood. For each classification the TPM were compared to the TPM constructed from the aerial photos. The goodness of fit of all maps obtained with the pixel-based methods was insufficient for estimating the LULC TPM. The LULC map obtained with the object- based classification method fit well to that based on the aerial photos, but the estimates of TMP were qualitatively different from those constructed from the aerial photos. This article raises doubts regarding the adequacy of Landsat data and standard classification methods for establishing LULC CA model rules, and calls for the careful reexamination of the entire land-use CA framework. 1. Introduction Conceptual simplicity and the ability of explicit representation of landscapes and their changes make Cellular Automata (CA) a standard tool for simulating urban and regional land-use dynamics. Typically, the CA models focus on estimating the rules of the LULC changes and analysis of the simulation results. However, the models put aside the uncertainty of the LULC maps that are used for establishing the transition rules. The major source of data for the CA modeling is Remote Sensing (RS) multispectral imagery classified for establishing LULC dynamics. It is often reported that the CA models are quite successful in predicting LULC, with the high overall fit (80-90%) between the real LULC and model outputs. This is indeed true when the validation is based on comparing the entire modeled area. However, as far as initial area is excluded from the comparison, the spatial fit between the predicted and real changes drops down (Hagen-Zanker et al. 2005; Pontius and Petrova 2010). A hierarchy of reasons of limited capacity of the CA models for predicting LULC changes can be proposed: (1) CA framework as a whole is insufficient for predict", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21433/B3111b9432ds", "venue": "International Conference on GIScience Short Paper Proceedings", "journal": "International Conference on GIScience Short Paper Proceedings", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2626260579", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["39588751"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59320653"}

To evaluate the profiles we applied different hypothesis tests including t-test and Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test and also computed the AUC values of all single biomarkers. Not surprisingly, single markers sometimes show fairly good results, however, they also allowed for a significant number of false positive and false negative classifications. By combining filter feature selection techniques together with radial basis function kernel, Support Vector Machines evaluated by 10-fold Cross Validation, we achieved very high classification accuracy rates.

In order to obtain a suitable network architecture, Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (I-ELM) is a sort of ELM constructing SLFNs by adding hidden nodes one by one. Although kinds of I-ELM-class algorithms were proposed to improve the convergence rate or to obtain minimal training error, they do not change the construction way of I-ELM or face the over-fitting risk. Making the testing error converge quickly and stably therefore becomes an important issue. In this paper, we proposed a new incremental ELM which is referred to as Length-Changeable Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (LCI-ELM). It allows more than one hidden node to be added to the network and the existing network will be regarded as a whole in output weights tuning.

A spatial database was generated including a total of 92 landslide locations encompassing the same number of observed and detected landslides, which was divided into training (80%; 74 landslide locations) and validation (20%; 18 landslide locations) datasets. Results of the difference between observed and detected landslides using root mean square error (RMSE) indicated that only 16.3% error exists, which is fairly acceptable. The validation process was performed using statistical-based measures and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results of validation process indicated that the SVM model has the highest values of sensitivity (88.9%), specificity (77.8%), accuracy (83.3%), Kappa (0.663) and AUROC (84.5%), followed by the IOE model.

To facilitate the recognition process, motions are divided into three levels by duration and complexity. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is used to extract the feature vector of each motion matrix, and SVM(Support Vector Machine) is utilized to do the training and classification of the first level of motion(sub-motion). In motion recognition process, the sequence of recognized candidate sub-motions is analyzed by HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to gain certain robustness, then we recognize the second level of motions by pattern matching in this sequence. Finally a grammar-based motion synthesization is applied using motions as semantic terms to recognize the third level of motions.

Among these derivatives, the options are considered a simpler way for investing since the Black-Scholes (B-S) pricing model can be used to estimate their reasonable prices. However, the parameter \"volatility \u00b1 in the B-S model cannot be known in advance and needs be guessed based on the historical trading information regarding the options or the underlying assets. Hence, the problems of forecasting future volatilities had become an interesting and attractive research topic for both researchers and practioners. Among the previous researches, the artificial intelligent techniques had been extensively used and acquired satisfactory results. Therefore, the support vector regression (SVR) technique and krill herd (KH) optimization algorithm are utilized to develop an integrated approach for forecasting the volatilities more accurately in this study. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a case study aiming at forecasting the volatilities of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. According to the experimental results, the proposed integrated forecasting methodology can produce better forecasting performance, based on the RMSE, R2 or MAPE, than the forecasting models which are built solely based on the SVR. Therefore, it can conclude that the proposed integrated approach can really indeed improve the forecasting, and can be considered an effective and useful assistant tool for an investor to obtain more accurate estimation for the volatility thus helping his/her decision making.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ciis.2017.16", "venue": "2017 International Conference on Computing Intelligence and Information System (CIIS)", "journal": "2017 International Conference on Computing Intelligence and Information System (CIIS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2795281067", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206787478", "205285951", "743542", "120299694", "12154028", "54082334", "18435094", "122325097", "38469725", "84116315", "6636078", "8034569", "28637672", "19196574", "20792494"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4560693"}

Our starting point is the fact that some expressions, such as smiles, are very easily elicited, annotated, and automatically detected, while others are much harder to elicit and to annotate. We thus consider a novel problem: all AU models for the target subject are to be learnt using person-specific annotated data for a reference AU (AU12 in our case), and no data or little data regarding the target AU. In order to design such a model, we propose a novel Multi-Task Learning and the associated Transfer Learning framework, in which we consider both relations across subjects and AUs. That is to say, we consider a tensor structure among the tasks. Our approach hinges on learning the latent relations among tasks using one single reference AU, and then transferring these latent relations to other AUs. We show that we are able to effectively make use of the annotated data for AU12 when learning other person-specific AU models, even in the absence of data for the target task.

This research develops automatic methods for detecting brain imaging preclinical biomarkers for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) by considering the novel application of evolutionary algorithms. An additional novel element of this work is the use of evolutionary algorithms to both map and predict the functional connectivity in patients using rs-fMRI data. Specifically, Cartesian Genetic Programming was used to classify dynamic causal modelling data as well as timeseries data. The findings were validated using two other commonly used classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and by employing k-fold cross-validation. Across dynamic causal modelling and timeseries analyses, findings revealed maximum accuracies of 75.21% for early stage (prodromal) PD patients in which patients reveal no motor symptoms versus healthy controls, 85.87% for PD patients versus prodromal PD patients, and 92.09% for PD patients versus healthy controls. Prodromal PD patients were classified from healthy controls with high accuracy \u2013 this is notable and represents the key finding since current methods of diagnosing prodromal PD have low reliability and low accuracy. Furthermore, Cartesian Genetic Programming provided comparable performance accuracy relative to Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Nevertheless, evolutionary algorithms enable us to decode the classifier in terms of understanding the data inputs that are used, more easily than in Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.

Second, a new weighted strategy based on the proposed LOO error estimation is proposed. This strategy ranks the samples\u2019 importance by means of the LOO error of each new added sample and then assigns various weights.

Identification of LLD patients, who will develop cognitive decline, i.e., the early stage of dementia would help to implement interventions earlier. The purpose of this study was to assess whether structural brain MRI in LLD patients can predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia one year prior to the diagnosis. Methods LLD patients underwent brain MRI at baseline and repeated clinical assessment after one-year. Structural brain measurements were obtained using Freesurfer software (v 5.1) from the T1 brain MRI images. MRI-based Random Forest classifier was used to discriminate between LLD who developed MCI or dementia after one-year follow up and cognitively stable LLD. Additionally, a previously established Random Forest model trained on 185 patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease vs 225 cognitively normal elderly from the Alzheimer\u2019s disease Neuroimaging Initiative was tested on the LLD data set (ADNI model). Results MCI and dementia diagnoses were predicted in LLD patients with 76%/68%/84% accuracy/ sensitivity/specificity. Adding the baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores to the models improved accuracy/sensitivity/specificity to 81%/75%/86%. The best model predicted MCI status alone using MRI and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores with accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of 89%/85%/90%. The most important region for all the models was right ventral diencephalon, including hypothalamus. Its volume correlated negatively with the number of depressive episodes. ADNI model trained on AD vs Controls could predict MCI-DEM patients with 67% accuracy. Conclusion LDD patients developing MCI and dementia can be discriminated from LLD patients remaining cognitively stable with good accuracy based on baseline structural MRI alone. Baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score improves prediction accuracy. Ventral diencephalon, including the hypothalamus might play an important role in preservation of cognitive functions in LLD.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5288688", "pubmed_id": "28210220", "doi": "10.3389/fnagi.2017.00013", "venue": "Front.

The use of the resulting information is even more critical. In the model for describing a particular context property, the domain of interpretation for the property represents the values that it may assume. Hierarchical Formal Concept Analysis (HFCA) models the world of data through the use of contextual objects and attributes (tags) structured in contexts. To evaluate the significance of a concept in a context we compute the significance score and we learn high-dimensional binary feature vectors through the Neural Modeling Fields (NMF) algorithm. The adaptive evolution of context models describes dynamics with different complexity. Each dynamic mode is associated with a mode behavior, the set of trajectories that satisfies the dynamical laws of that mode in a context. A switching signal (an event) determines when a transition occurs between dynamic modes.
