A recent paper has proposed a novel meta-learning technique that uses a Weight Prediction Network to enable Super-Resolution on arbitrary scale factors using only a single neural network. In this paper, we propose a new network that combines that technique with SRGAN, a state-of-the-art GAN-based architecture, to achieve arbitrary scale, high fidelity Super-Resolution for medical images. By using this network to perform arbitrary scale magnifications on images from the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) dataset, we demonstrate that it is able to outperform traditional interpolation methods by up to 20$\\%$ on SSIM scores whilst retaining generalisability on brain MRI images. We show that performance across scales is not compromised, and that it is able to achieve competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods such as EDSR whilst being fifty times smaller than them.

The current paper investigates how people give route instructions about indoor environments they have learned through navigation. We present a computational model of route instruction following called Marco and investigate the following three questions: 1. How do quality and style vary in route instructions? 2. How well does Marco follow route instructions and how closely does the model\u2019s behavior correlate with human behavior? 3. Can Marco differentiate good versus bad instruc- tions, by both human performance and ratings? Humans possess the remarkable ability to give and follow natural language route instructions through large- scale spaces. In this process, a director describes the actions and observations along the route, recalling the environment\u2019s topology, metrical layout, and visual features. A follower interprets these descriptions, navigating by applying the instructions to the possibly unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, followers must account for mistakes, ambiguities, and omissions in the route description. To study how instructions are written and followed, we collected 756 free-form route instructions from six participants for 126 routes in three virtual environments. A second group of participants and a computational model (Marco) followed these instructions. Humans successfully reached the destina- tion on 68% of the instructions and Marco followed 61% of the instructions. Marco\u2019s performance was a strong predictor of human performance and ratings of individual instructions. Why are some route instructions reliable? Keywords Artificial Intelligence; Spatial Cognition; Natural Language Understanding; Cognitive architec- tures; Human experimentation; Symbolic computational modeling Knowledge representation Introduction Imagine while walking across a campus, a stranger approaches you to ask how to get to another location. The destination is not within sight, so you cannot simply point at the goal. Instead, you must reference your memory of routes between you and the goal. Once a route is selected, you need to access your knowledge of specific landmarks and distances to provide references for the follower . You translate this knowledge into a verbal description of the route. Remarkably, a short verbal description is often sufficient to guide a follower through an unfamiliar large-scale space. Despite directors\u2019 best efforts, not all instructions are perfectly clear and reliable for reaching the goal. Often instructions contain ambiguous information (e.g. which tree is \u201cthe oak tree\u201d), qualitative mistakes within the instruction (e.g. \u201cturn right\u201d where no right turn is possible) or metrical mistakes (e.g. \u201cgo forward 3 blocks\u201d when the distance is 4 blocks). Because of these failings, the follower must treat the instructions as guidance, not as strict commands. With all the potential for miscommunication arising from the complexity of giving and understanding route instructions, the human ability to provide instructions Though a large literature examines route instructions, there is no consensus about what differentiates good instructions from bad. Vanetti and Allen (1988) found spatial ability had a larger effect in the accuracy of sub- jects\u2019 described routes than verbal ability. Daniel et al. (2003) found \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cpoor\u201d, and \u201cskeletal\u201d instructions were differentiated by whether the proper action was associated with the proper landmark. Allen (2000) suggests descriptives clauses and action delimiters should be inserted at choice points and near the destination, instead of en-route. Lovelace et al. (1999) found good route instructions mentioned many landmarks along the paths, off the route, and at the choice points. Some of these studies rate route instructions sub- jectively (Vanetti and Allen, 1988; Lovelace et al., 1999; Tversky and Lee, 1999), but do not test if navigation success is affected. Others have participants follow a small number of participant- and experimenter-written instructions (Daniel et al., 2003; Allen, 2000). Our work implements a study suggested by Lovelace et al. (1999), where participants follow route instructions from different routes and directors in virtual reality. Computational models of route instructions Software systems that analyze or follow route in- structions can be distinguished by how they represent space. Freundschuh and Egenhofer (1997) survey a variety of spatial representation models and define broad categories based on (1) if the objects in the space are manipulable, (2) if the space requires locomotion to experience, and (3) the size, or scale, of the space. This work focuses on non-manipulable, large- scale spaces that cannot be experienced from any one", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "84212744", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16627690", "11562472", "37694758", "142171597", "30736797", "58470784", "117000098", "17316055", "598733", "1863523", "35465055", "144066945", "18056366", "143965532"], "inbound_citations": ["49380266", "144713", "59744142", "2220173"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1533890"}

In this paper, we develop a new clinical decision support system (CDSS) to diagnose Coronary Artery Diseases (CAD). According to CAD experts, Angiography is most accurate CAD diagnosis technique. However, it has many aftereffects and is very costly. Existing studies showed that CAD diagnosis requires heterogeneous patients traces from medical history while applying data mining techniques to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, an automatic approach to design CDSS for CAD assessment is proposed. The proposed diagnosis model is based on Random Forest algorithm, C5.0 decision tree algorithm and Fuzzy modeling. It consists of two stages: first, Random Forest algorithm is used to rank the features and a C5.0 decision tree based approach for crisp rule generation is developed. Then, we created the fuzzy inference system. The generation of fuzzy weighted rules is carried out automatically from the previous crisp rules. Moreover, a critical issue about the CDSS is that some values of the features are missing in most cases. A new method to deal with the problem of missing data, which allows evaluating the similarity despite the missing information, was proposed.

We aimed to detect subtle changes in the circulating lipid profile by shotgun lipidomics analyses and to associate them with four different insulin sensitivity indices. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The cross-sectional study comprised 90 men with a broad range of insulin sensitivity including normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 33), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 32) and newly detected T2D (n = 25). Prior to oral glucose challenge plasma was obtained and quantitatively analyzed for 198 lipid molecular species from 13 different lipid classes including triacylglycerls (TAGs), phosphatidylcholine plasmalogen/ether (PC O-s), sphingomyelins (SMs), and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). To identify a lipidomic signature of individual insulin sensitivity we applied three data mining approaches, namely least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forests (RF) for the following insulin sensitivity indices: homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glucose insulin sensitivity index (GSI), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and disposition index (DI). The LASSO procedure offers a high prediction accuracy and and an easier interpretability than SVR and RF. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: After LASSO selection, the plasma lipidome explained 3% (DI) to maximal 53% (HOMA-IR) variability of the sensitivity indexes.

In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach to detect malware by mining the patterns of Permissions and API Function Calls acquired and used by Android Apps. Based on static analysis of source code and resource files of Android Apps, binary and numerical features are extracted for qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

Besides standard kernels such as Gaussian (i.e., radial basis function, RBF) or polynomial kernels, there are also specific kernels tailored to consider structure in the data for similarity assessment. In this article, we will capture structure in data by means of probabilistic mixture density models, for example Gaussian mixtures in the case of real-valued input spaces. From the distance measures that are inherently contained in these models, e.g., Mahalanobis distances in the case of Gaussian mixtures, we derive a new kernel, the responsibility weighted Mahalanobis (RWM) kernel. Basically, this kernel emphasizes the influence of model components from which any two samples that are compared are assumed to originate (that is, the\"responsible\"model components). We will see that this kernel outperforms the RBF kernel and other kernels capturing structure in data (such as the LAP kernel in Laplacian SVM) in many applications where partially labeled data are available, i.e., for semi-supervised training of SVM. Other key advantages are that the RWM kernel can easily be used with standard SVM implementations and training algorithms such as sequential minimal optimization, and heuristics known for the parametrization of RBF kernels in a C-SVM can easily be transferred to this new kernel.

However, finding suitable features from the images are often challenging due to high intra-variability and inter-variability of the data. In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning algorithm using the convolutional autoencoder for detection of plant diseases. The use of convolutional autoencoder has two main advantages. First, the use of handcrafted features is not necessary as the network itself may learn to produce discriminative features.

This research addresses the problems associated with event-level intrusion detection and the large volumes of intrusion alerts by applying active learning and cyber situation awareness. This paper includes the results of two experiments using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The first experiment evaluated sampling approaches for querying the oracle, as part of active learning.

In most existing KG representation learning models, repeated calculations are performed by synthesizing a negative sample set with the correct sample set, which also leads to an increase in the amount of calculation. At the same time, because there are many-to-many situations for entities and relationships in the KG, the vector representation obtained when using the previous model for representation learning is not unique. So it leads to an increase in computational complexity.

Traditional methods such as signature-based ones cannot defend users from an increasing number of new types of malware or rapid malware behavior changes. In this paper, we propose a new Android malware detection approach based on deep learning and static analysis. Instead of using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) only, we further analyze the source code of Android applications and create their higher-level graphical semantics, which makes it harder for attackers to evade detection. In particular, we use a call graph from method invocations in an Android application to represent the application, and further analyze method attributes to form a structured Program Representation Graph (PRG) with node attributes. Then, we use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to yield a graph representation of the application by embedding the entire graph into a dense vector, and classify whether it is a malware or not. To efficiently train such a graph convolutional network, we propose a batch training scheme that allows multiple heterogeneous graphs to be input as a batch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use graph representation learning for malware detection.

In particular, this work discuses the low rank matrix modifications for componentwise polynomial kernels, which allow the factors of the modified kernel-matrix to be directly updated. The main concept refers to the use of a valid explicit feature map for polynomial kernels in an additive setting. By exploiting the structure of such feature map the model parameters of the classification/regression problem can be easily modified and updated when new variables are added. Therefore, the low rank updates constitute an algorithmic tool to efficiently obtain the model parameters once the system has been altered in some minimal sense. Such strategy allows, for instance, the development of algorithms for sequential variable ranking in high dimensional settings, while non-linearity is provided by the polynomial feature map.

However, there is still a lack of specific models providing explanations of how 1/\u0192 noise is generated in coupled brain-body-environment systems, since existing models and experiments typically target either externally observable behaviour or isolated neuronal systems but do not address the interplay between neuronal mechanisms and sensorimotor dynamics. We present a conceptual model of a minimal neurorobotic agent solving a behavioural task that makes it possible to relate mechanistic (neurodynamic) and behavioural levels of description. The model consists of a simulated robot controlled by a network of Kuramoto oscillators with homeostatic plasticity and the ability to develop behavioural preferences mediated by sensorimotor patterns. With only three oscillators, this simple model displays self-organized criticality in the form of robust 1/\u0192 noise and a wide multifractal spectrum. We show that the emergence of self-organized criticality and 1/\u0192 noise in our model is the result of three simultaneous conditions: a) non-linear interaction dynamics capable of generating stable collective patterns, b) internal plastic mechanisms modulating the sensorimotor flows, and c) strong sensorimotor coupling with the environment that induces transient metastable neurodynamic regimes. We carry out a number of experiments to show that both synaptic plasticity and strong sensorimotor coupling play a necessary role, as constituents of self-organized criticality, in the generation of 1/\u0192 noise. The experiments also shown to be useful to test the robustness of 1/\u0192 scaling comparing the results of different techniques.

This brings additional benefits such as visualization of data samples and reducing the storage cost, and it is more robust to overfitting since the number of estimated parameters is greatly reduced. The proposed method works in both the input and kernel induced-feature space, and the distance metric is found by a gradient descent procedure that involves an eigen-decomposition in each step.

This is the first approach to continuous sign video generation that does not use a classical graphical avatar. We evaluate the translation abilities of our approach on the PHOENIX14T Sign Language Translation dataset. We set a baseline for text-to-gloss translation, reporting a BLEU-4 score of 16.34/15.26 on dev/test sets. We further demonstrate the video generation capabilities of our approach for both multi-signer and high-definition settings qualitatively and quantitatively using broadcast quality assessment metrics.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11263-019-01281-2", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "journal": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2997573805", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10408622", "207654662", "11212020", "54614938", "4724109", "16224674", "8191987", "5590763", "5201925", "3116381", "21725973", "69855546", "7638125", "2953041", "14250790", "21944237", "60334259", "1033682", "1930231", "11460118", "19178535", "1915014", "6200260", "980236", "13895969", "9633464", "16943187", "61430723", "8785311", "37437102", "422509", "1998416", "30484693", "5092785", "16800093", "9531590", "12803511", "209672464", "8142135", "18500294", "11758569", "1515901", "208618902", "4667462", "52288950", "14989939", "13756489", "53040277", "41805341", "207761262", "7577075", "199412908"], "inbound_citations": ["214794987", "214728269"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209538936"}

Furthermore, alpine glaciers are recognized as sensitive indicators of climatic fluctuations. Monitoring glacier extent changes and glacier surface characteristics (i.e. snow, firn and bare ice coverage) is therefore important for both hydrological applications and climate change studies. ::: Satellite remote sensing data have been widely employed for glacier surface classification. Many approaches exploit optical data, such as from Landsat. Despite the intuitive visual interpretation of optical images and the demonstrated capability to discriminate glacial surface thanks to the combination of different bands, one of the main disadvantages of available high-resolution optical sensors is their dependence on cloud conditions and low revisit time frequency. Therefore, operational monitoring strategies relying only on optical data have serious limitations. ::: Since SAR data are insensitive to clouds, they are potentially a valid alternative to optical data for glacier monitoring. Compared to past SAR missions, the new Sentinel-1 mission provides much higher revisit time frequency (two acquisitions each 12 days) over the entire European Alps, and this number will be doubled once the Sentinel1-b will be in orbit (April 2016). ::: In this work we present a method for glacier surface classification by exploiting dual polarimetric Sentinel-1 data. The method consists of a supervised approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). In addition to the VV and VH signals, we tested the contribution of local incidence angle, extracted from a digital elevation model and orbital information, as auxiliary input feature in order to account for the topographic effects. By exploiting impossible temporal transition between different classes (e.g. if at a given date one pixel is classified as rock it cannot be classified as glacier ice in a following date) we here propose an innovative post classification correction based on SVM classification probabilities. Optical data, i.e. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, have been employed, when available, for training sample collection.

The networks can define relationships among input data that are not apparent when using other approaches, and they can use these relationships to improve accuracy. Thus, neural nets have substantial power to recognize patterns even in complex datasets. Neural network methodology has outperformed classical statistical methods in cases where the input variables are interrelated. Because clinical measurements usually derive from multiple interrelated systems it is evident that neural networks might be more accurate than classical methods in multivariate analysis of clinical data.

A short introduction to the basics of neural networks is given, and some practical issues in applying the networks are highlighted.

To achieve on-chip integration of the NLSVM classification engine with minimum area and energy consumption, the FE engine utilizes time division multiplexing (TDM)-BPF architecture.

In this paper, a novel prediction model is proposed for the prediction of hot spots at the protein-protein interaction interfaces based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a new way for feature selection.

Our major contribution was that the ELM and a new prediction model were introduced into the area of hot spots prediction, which could improve the prediction performance remarkably, when comparing with some traditional existing methods.

Abstract During the last years the amount of energy gained from renewable energy sources was steadily increasing and this is still under development. A big role is played by offshore wind parks, which use the wind energy over the see for electricity generation. In order to reduce the high maintaining costs of these plants, different online condition monitoring systems are currently being developed. Especially condition monitoring of gear-oils promises to have an important impact on such maintaining costs. A well-known off-line method for gear-oil quality monitoring is based on the evaluation of their Infrared (IR) spectra. The analysis of IR spectra, which is performed in specialized laboratories together with other chemical and mechanical tests, is a common tool for lubricant quality evaluation. Important oil parameters affect the IR spectra and can be therefore deduced and classified by spectral analysis. A significant parameter is the Total Acid Number (TAN). The importance of the TAN value lies in its relation with the oil\u2019s \u201cage\u201d. In this paper, a preliminary study of gear-oil classification by means of TAN in combination with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is presented. The Mid-Infrared-spectra (MIR-spectra) of three commercially used gear-oils, a mineral and two synthetic ones, were analyzed and classified according to the range of their TAN value. The classification was performed using up to five classes and tested using full cross validation. The classification results were compared using different kernel functions. The robustness against noise is tested by adding different noise levels to the spectra before classification. This latter leads to a first feasibility check for classifying spectra gained in field application, under rough conditions.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5162/sensoren2012/P5.2", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1872458748", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["121663095", "19700498", "15276012", "119730773", "961425", "2443126"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109755923"}

These techniques require only minimal human supervision and can easily be scaled and adapted to evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art GANs on large, popular datasets.

Until now, black-box attacks against neural networks have relied on transferability of adversarial examples.

In this paper, we introduce a direct attack against black-box neural networks, that uses another attacker neural network to learn to craft adversarial examples. We show that our attack is capable of crafting adversarial examples that are indistinguishable from the source input and are misclassified with overwhelming probability - reducing accuracy of the black-box neural network from 99.4% to 0.77% on the MNIST dataset, and from 91.4% to 6.8% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our attack can adapt and reduce the effectiveness of proposed defenses against adversarial examples, requires very little training data, and produces adversarial examples that can transfer to different machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbor. To demonstrate the practicality of our attack, we launch a live attack against a target black-box model hosted online by Amazon: the crafted adversarial examples reduce its accuracy from 91.8% to 61.3%.

The aim of the loyalty card entails large citizen participation, however, an active user base of only 20% is reached. Predictive techniques are employed to increase this number. Using spatial behavioral user information, a Naive Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine are used which result in models capable of predicting whether a user will actively use its card, whether a user will defect in the near future and which locations a user will visit. Also, a projection of spatial behavioral data onto even more fine-grained spatio-temporal data is performed. The results are promising: the best model achieves an AUC value of 92.5%, 85.5% and 88.12% (averaged over five locations) for the predictions, respectively. Moreover, as behavior is modeled in more detail, better predictions are made. Two main contributions are made in this study. First, as a theoretical contribution, fine-grained behavioral data contributes to a more sound decision-making process.

This paper presents a novel analytical approach to the assessment and, most importantly, the prediction of learning outcomes in SE teamwork based on data from our joint software engineering class concurrently taught at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Fulda University, Germany (Fulda). Our approach focuses on assessment and prediction of SE teamwork in terms of ability of student teams to apply best SE processes and develop SE products. It differs from existing work in the following aspects: a) it develops and uses only objective and quantitative measures of team activity from multiple sources, such as statistics of student time use, software engineering tool use, and instructor observations; b) it leverages powerful machine learning (ML) techniques applied to team activity measurements to identify quantitative and objective factors which can assess and predict learning of software engineering teamwork skills at the team level. In this paper we provide the following contributions: a) we present in detail for the first time the full team activity measurement data set we developed, consisting of over 40 objective and quantitative measures extracted from student teams working on class projects; b) we present a ML framework which applies the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to the team activity measurements and team outcomes, focusing on predicting teams that are likely to fail; c) we describe in detail our now fully implemented and operational data processing pipeline, consisting of data collection methods from multiple sources, ML training database creation, and ML analysis subsystems; and finally d) we present very preliminary results of ML analysis results based on the data from our joint software engineering classes in Fall 2012, and Spring 2013, with the data from 17 student teams.

Several methods have been proposed but many are of high complexity and require global knowledge of the network, which makes them less suitable for large-scale networks. The Label Propagation Algorithm initially assigns a distinct label to each node that iteratively updates its label with the one of the majority of its neighbors, until consensus is reached among all nodes in the network. Nodes sharing the same label are then grouped into communities. It runs in near linear time and is decentralized, but it gets easily stuck in local optima and often returns a single giant community. To overcome these problems we propose MemLPA, a variation of the classical Label Propagation Algorithm where each node implements a memory mechanism that allows them to \u201cremember\u201d about past states of the network and uses a decision rule that takes this information into account. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, on the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark and a set of real-world networks, that MemLPA outperforms other existing label propagation algorithms that implement memory and some of the well-known community detection algorithms.

An Efficient fraud detection methodology is therefore essential to maintain the reliability of the payment system. In this study, we perform a comparison study of credit card fraud detection by using various supervised and unsupervised approaches. Specifically, 6 supervised classification models, i.e., Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), as well as 4 unsupervised anomaly detection models, i.e., One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Auto-Encoder (AE), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), are explored in this study. We train all these models on a public credit card transaction dataset from Kaggle website, which contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The labels of the transactions are used for supervised learning models only. The performance of each model is evaluated through 5-fold cross validation in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Curves (AUROC). Within supervised approaches, XGB and RF obtain the best performance with AUROC = 0.989 and AUROC = 0.988, respectively. While for unsupervised approaches, RBM achieves the best performance with AUROC = 0.961, followed by GAN with AUROC = 0.954. The experimental results show that supervised models perform slightly better than unsupervised models in this study. Anyway, unsupervised approaches are still promising for credit card fraud transaction detection due to the insufficient annotation and the data imbalance issue in real-world applications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.10604", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2941458981", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["575430", "206787478", "34568689", "32995452", "207627753", "5631993", "46594693", "192654287", "17427022", "168696645", "8435923", "59965148", "4747216"], "inbound_citations": ["211171813", "213005876", "204009140", "209456030", "202781755"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129945606"}

During the translation process, and particularly during phrase composition, MT systems may exhibit several issues, including failure to produce high quality translations, increased time consumption, diminished linguistic precision and complexity. This research introduces an optimized cognitive assisted statistical MT process that is intended to reduce these difficulties. This process uses a supervised machine learning technique (OCSMT-SMT) for natural language processing that is intended to translate phrases with a higher degree of precision than other Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor MT techniques. The method introduced here uses semantic operations to examine the collected messages that are processed in network and obtained results have been stored in the memory to get the exact translation which helps to learn phrase semantics using MT. The OCSMT-SMT approach enables smarter, faster decision making regarding phrase translations, which greatly reduces translation time. The efficiency of this approach is evaluated using the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) and Better Evaluation as Ranking (BEER) metrics for English language phrase datasets in English language.

Despite Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) having been used extensively in radar image classification in recent years, their performance could not be fully implemented in the radar field because of the deficiency of the training data set. This is a key issue because of the extremely high labor and monetary costs involved in obtaining radar images. As such, attempts have been made to resolve this issue via the production of radar data by simulation or by the use of transfer learning. In this letter, we propose the use of GANs to produce a large number of micro-Doppler signatures with which to increase the training data set. Once the GANs are trained, a large amount of similar data, with the same distribution as the original data, can be easily generated. The generated fake micro-Doppler images can then be included in the DCNN training process. The proposed method is applied to classifying human activities measured by the Doppler radar.

As the network can learn great feature representation of dermoscopic images automatically in an unsupervised way, supervised learning could make it more promising. In particular, we explore an encoder-decoder network concatenating residual blocks and atrous convolution as the generator to generate the segmentation masks. This generator can obtain deep representation and preserve fine-grained information. The decision of the discriminator is very important to optimize a network. To enhance the reliability of the discrimination, two discriminators are applied to distinguish generated masks from ground truth jointly.

Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. 'Un-trained' behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary values and coarse global controls.

Most lymphoma detection in PET are based on machine learning technique which requires a large learning database. However, it is difficult to acquire such a large standard database in medical field. In our previous work, a new approach which combines an anatomical atlas obtained in CT with CRFs (Conditional Random Fields) in PET is proposed and is proved to have good results, however it is very time consuming due to the fully connection of each voxel in 3D. To cope with this problem, we proposed a method that combines supervoxel and CRFs to accelerate the progress. Our method consists of 3 steps. First, we apply the supervoxel on the PET image to group the voxels into supervoxels. Then, an anatomic atlas is applied on CT to remove the organs having hyper-fixation in PET. Finally, CRFs will detect lymphoma regions in PET.

Available microarray datasets for classifying cancer types generally have a fairly small sample size compared to the large number of genes involved. This fact is known as a curse of dimensionality, which is a challenging problem. Gene selection is a promising approach that addresses this problem and plays an important role in the development of efficient cancer classification due to the fact that only a small number of genes are related to the classification problem. Gene selection addresses many problems in microarray datasets such as reducing the number of irrelevant and noisy genes, and selecting the most related genes to improve the classification results.MethodsAn innovative Gene Selection Programming (GSP) method is proposed to select relevant genes for effective and efficient cancer classification. GSP is based on Gene Expression Programming (GEP) method with a new defined population initialization algorithm, a new fitness function definition, and improved mutation and recombination operators. . Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel serves as a classifier of the GSP.ResultsExperimental results on ten microarray cancer datasets demonstrate that Gene Selection Programming (GSP) is effective and efficient in eliminating irrelevant and redundant genes/features from microarray datasets. The comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with other methods show that GSP gives a better compromise in terms of all three evaluation criteria, i.e., classification accuracy, number of selected genes, and computational cost. The gene set selected by GSP has shown its superior performances in cancer classification compared to those selected by the up-to-date representative gene selection methods.ConclusionGene subset selected by GSP can achieve a higher classification accuracy with less processing time.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6334429", "pubmed_id": "30646919", "doi": "10.1186/s12920-018-0447-6", "venue": "BMC Medical Genomics", "journal": "BMC Medical Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2935789419", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["29970363", "19401882", "34197874", "298423", "42278384", "6962146", "9845221", "5987890", "14702825", "11866010", "52299573", "11049468", "15792117", "2480719", "35455559", "6379724", "35421022", "3286332", "32286411", "27641839", "3152133", "15870327", "4587511", "215197657", "26158812", "3525957", "16853937", "4580418", "43526814", "2211307", "70004269", "5083193", "14167535", "5303255", "938257", "46448559", "12313403", "4419580", "9291937", "2914506", "22529915", "86730427", "10205866", "10570640", "10253140"], "inbound_citations": ["201835396", "208302566", "195192814", "215438972"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58009936"}

Feature engineering has a focus to obtain the datasets of different dimensions with significant features, using feature selection methods of backward elimination, chi2, and information gain scores. Different supervised machine learning models are applied on the feature-engineered datasets to demonstrate the adaptability of datasets for machine learning under optimal tuning of parameters within given sets of values. The results show that substantial feature reduction is possible to make DDoS detection faster and optimized with minimal performance hit. The paper proposes a strategic-level framework which incorporates the necessary elements of feature engineering and machine learning with a defined flow of experimentation. The models are also validated with cross-validation and evaluated for area-under-curve analyses. It provides comprehensive solutions which can be trusted to avoid the overfitting and collinearity problems of data while detecting DDoS attacks. In the case study of DDoS datasets, K-nearest neighbors algorithm overall exhibits the best performance followed by support vector machine, whereas low-dimensional datasets of discrete feature types perform better under the Random Forest model as compared to high dimensions with numerical features. The accuracy scores of dataset with the lowest number of features remain competitive with other datasets under all machine learning models, leading to a substantially reduced processing overhead.

[1] Methods of thus-defined drug design are well established in the early stages of drug discovery and focus mainly on identifying new chemical entities (NCEs) \u2013 molecules with desired biological activity. Along with activity, however, drugs must possess acceptable ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, and Toxicity) properties. Although a few recent trends push ADMET optimization into drug design, these properties are still largely neglected until the lead optimization phase occurring later in drug discovery when the available chemical space is already narrowed by affinity and selectivity concerns. Usually one group of drug discovery researchers hands out lead molecules to a separate group of drug development scientists: \u201cOur job is done, here are the active molecules. Now you worry about their other properties.\u201d This separation could, and often does, lead to frustrating failures where all the lead compounds may, for example, turn out to be insoluble in water, impermeable via the intended route of administration, unacceptably metabolized by enzymes common to co-medications, or produce unacceptable adverse effects. All the effort and cost of discovering them would then be wasted. Authors of this article strongly believe in \u201cADMET design\u201d \u2013 a paradigm where ADMET properties are included in the earliest stages of drug discovery and treated on equal footing with biological efficacy. This multidimensional search and optimization should be a normal function of the team of discovery chemists and other pharmaceutical scientists. The difficulty is that humans are not well-adapted to thinking in more than a few dimensions at once. In silico approaches are the solution as they facilitate integration of multiple variables and the most efficient use of experimental data. In the following sections we focus on machine learning approaches, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [2] or Support Vector Machines (SVM) [3], to QSAR/QSPR modeling [4] of ADMET properties. In QSAR/QSPR, chemical structures are encoded by calculated values of molecular descriptors serving as inputs to mathematical predictive models. ANN models, in particular, have been determined to be superior predictors over other methods. [5] Training several ANN or SVM and taking an arithmetic average of their outputs as the final answer usually enhances accuracy of prediction and is known as ANN Ensemble (ANNE) or SVM Ensemble (SVME) approaches. [6] Some researchers regard these techniques as \u201cblack boxes\u201d meaning that although ANNE or SVME models can produce numerical outputs, their internal complexity precludes any descriptive interpretation of these results. Contrary to these stereotypical beliefs, predictive mathematical models of this type are quite interpretable and thus amenable to a direct use in drug design.

Most of the existing methods mainly focus on direct relationships between entities and do not reflect the semantics of multi-hop relation paths. Although a few methods have studied the problem of multi-hop path-based representation learning, they fail to distinguish reliable relation paths among a majority of meaningless relation paths. In this paper, we propose a reliable path-based knowledge graph representation learning method, called RKRL. Specifically, we combine the representations of intermediate entities and relations on relation paths to learn more meaningful knowledge representations. Also, we present a reliable knowledge graph path ranking method to avoid the unnecessary computation of unreliable paths and find semantically valid relation paths.

However, these tasks require large sets of annotated data to achieve such performance. In particular, we focus on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task on clinical notes, which is one of the most fundamental and critical problems for medical text analysis. Our work centers on effectively adapting these neural architectures towards low-resource settings using parameter transfer methods. We complement a standard hierarchical NER model with a general transfer learning framework, the Tunable Transfer Network (TTN) consisting of parameter sharing between the source and target tasks, and showcase scores significantly above the baseline architecture. Our best TTN model achieves 2-5% improvement over pre-trained language model BERT as well as its multi task extension MT-DNN in low resource settings.

To mitigate the problem of exhaustively searching for model optimization, we propose the Dynamic Transfer Networks (DTN), a gated architecture which learns the appropriate parameter sharing scheme between source and target datasets.

However, non-standardized imaging protocols are commonplace, which poses a fundamental challenge in large-scale cross-center CT image analysis. One approach to address the problem is to standardize and normalize CT images using image synthesis algorithms including generative adversarial network (GAN) models. GAN learns the data distribution of training images and generate synthesized images under the same distribution. However, existing GAN models are not directly applicable to this task mainly due to the lack of constraints on the mode of data to generate. Furthermore, they treat every image equally, but in real applications, certain images are more difficult to standardize than the others. All these may lead to the lack-of-detail problem in CT image synthesis. We present a new GAN model called GANai to mitigate the differences in radiomic features across CT images captured using non-standard imaging protocols. Given source images, GANai composes new images by specifying a high-level goal that the image features of the synthesized images should be similar to those of the standard images. GANai introduces a new alternative improvement training strategy to alternatively and gradually improve GAN model performance. The new training strategy enables a series of technical improvements, including phase-specific loss functions, phase-specific training data, and the adoption of ensemble learning, leading to better model performance. The experimental results show that efficiency and stability of GAN models have been much improved in GANai and our model is significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art image synthesis algorithms on CT image standardization.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICHI.2019.8904763", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2990625787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["118047194", "135939765", "19828140", "3679118", "12256959", "3725129", "207569482", "20638476", "28771334", "6278208", "1563370", "60845912", "24005817", "59235463", "206395074", "54119578", "1033682", "12803511", "6200260", "8758543", "6635779", "1409719", "14984990", "52154773", "34517595", "23354926", "205128181", "21456555", "24258698", "3767412", "11758569", "15876696", "8239952", "206770979", "4025915", "16991836", "7208970", "16367617", "3719281", "8469530", "873046", "120349231", "3068944", "6287870", "1282515", "1687220", "121530032", "44988345", "10894094", "11252052", "5808102"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208212107"}

Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a potential solution to this as it performs well with monophone labels. We investigate multilingual CTC training in the context of adaptation and regularisation techniques that have been shown to be beneficial in more conventional contexts. The multilingual model is trained to model a universal International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)-based phone set using the CTC loss function. Learning Hidden Unit Contribution (LHUC) is investigated to perform language adaptive training. During cross-lingual adaptation, the idea of extending the multilingual output layer to new phonemes is introduced and investigated. In addition, dropout during multilingual training and cross-lingual adaptation is also studied and tested in order to mitigate the overfitting problem. Experiments show that the performance of the universal phoneme-based CTC system can be improved by applying dropout and LHUC and it is extensible to new phonemes during cross-lingual adaptation.

Connectionist models for recognizing structural features were investigated, leading to the conclusion that the cognitive system probably requires knowledge functionally equivalent to grammatical rules. Data from information-processing experiments indicated that (a) judgments about the application of an algebraic operator are influenced by low-level features recognized before a completely parsed representation is formed; and (b) recognition of individual characters in expressions is not facilicated by syntactically correct contexts, as it is by lexical contexts in letter recognition, but information about the algebraic categories of characters is obtained early in processing from the syntactic context.

It is believed that this innovative research will lead to lifesaving treatments in the coming years. As part of their work, stem cell researchers must first determine which of their stem cell colonies are of sufficiently high quality to be suitable for experimental studies and therapeutic treatments. Since colony texture is a major discriminating feature in determining quality, we introduce a non-invasive, semi-automated texture-based stem cell colony classification methodology to aid researchers in colony quality control. We first consider the general problem of textural image segmentation. In a new approach to this problem, we characterize image texture by the subband energies of the image's wavelet decomposition, and we employ a non-parametric support vector machine to perform the classification that yields the segmentation. We also adapt a parametric wavelet-based classifier that utilizes the Kullback-Leibler distance. We apply both methods to a set of benchmark textural images, report low segmentation error rates and comment on the applicability of and tradeoffs between the non-parametric and parametric segmentation methods. We then apply the two classifiers to the segmentation of stem cell colony images into regions of varying quality. This provides stem cell researchers with a rich set of descriptive graphical representations of their colonies to aid in quality control. From these graphical representations, we extract colony-wise textural features to which we add colony-wise border features. Taken together, these features characterize overall colony quality. Using these features as inputs to a multiclass support vector machine, we successfully categorize full stem cell colonies into several quality categories.

Insolvency prediction and credit rating are challenging tasks used to evaluate commercial enterprises based on qualitative and quantitative attributes. One way to approach this task is machine learning whereby hypotheses are trained on sample data. The advantages are the automatization of the process obviating the need of human knowledge and thus, its high level objectivity. Nevertheless, this approach does not claim to be perfect as it does not completely replace human knowledge. Hence, these hypotheses are intended to be used as decision support for financial experts and thus, offer an advantage over black box hypotheses.We demonstrate how easily interpretable white box hypotheses (Decision Trees (DTs) and Disjunctive Normal Forms (DNFs)) are not inferior to more difficult interpretable gray box hypotheses (Random Forests (RFs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)) or even non-interpretable black box hypotheses (Support Vector Machines (SVMs)). We calculate DTs by means of Quinlans famous C4.5 algorithm. For DNFs, we developed an algorithm we call threshold heuristic. In our case study, a database with financial statements of 5152 enterprises is used to evaluate the performance in insolvency prediction for all classifiers. A common problem in insolvency prediction is extremely imbalanced data because naturally there are very few insolvent enterprises. Therefore we apply an asymmetric bagging method which increases the performance with extremely imbalanced data sets.In our case study, interpretable hypotheses perform better than other hypotheses. DTs have a better \u03b2-error, whereas DNFs outperform DTs with respect to the \u03b1-error. We compared both hypothesis classes and exemplary hypotheses. Both are interpretable in different ways leaving the choice to preference. This leads to the conclusion that interpretable threshold based methods are appropriate for classification problems in finance.

Hence, the application of nonlinear time series analysis to EEG signals could be useful to study the dynamical nature and variability of the brain signals. In this paper, we propose a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique for the automated identification of normal and alcoholic EEG signals using nonlinear features. We first extract nonlinear features such as Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), Sample Entropy (SampEn), and four other Higher Order Spectra (HOS) features, and then use them to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier of varying kernel functions: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order polynomials and a Radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Our results indicate that these nonlinear measures are good discriminators of normal and alcoholic EEG signals. The SVM classifier with a polynomial kernel of order 1 could distinguish the two classes with an accuracy of 91.7%, sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 93.3%.

In RC framework, a sparse interconnected hidden layer called reservoir, is the only training-required component that the simple linear regression method is capable to train it. This advantage makes the RC easier to implement and apply to engineering application than other RNNs. Recently, many studies have been focused on optimizing the performance of RC via learning algorithms or topological structures, which have been demonstrated critical to RC. In this paper, we propose a novel reservoir network with multi-clustered structure which is organized according to a developmental time windows algorithm. Experimental results showed that the model can significantly reduce the computational errors and standard deviation of the errors on the numeric prediction benchmark of Mackey-Glass chaotic time series.

In this way, each 3D MRI volume is divided into 2D image slices and a pre-trained 2D convolutional neural network can be re-trained to classify image slices independently. One issue here, however, is that the 2D convolutional neural network would not be able to consider the relationship between 2D image slices in an MRI volume and make decisions on them independently.

With the increasing scale and complexity of engineering problems, popular metamodeling techniques including artificial neural network (ANN), Polynomial regression (PR), Kriging (KG), radial basis functions (RBF), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) face difficulties in solving highly nonlinear problems, such as the crashworthiness design. Therefore, in this work, we integrate the least support vector regression (LSSVR) with the mode pursuing sampling (MPS) optimization method and applied the integrated approach for crashworthiness design. The MPS is used for generating new samples which are concentrated near the current local minima at each iteration and yet still statistically cover the entire design space. The LSSVR is used for establishing a more robust metamodel from noisy data. Therefore, the proposed method integrates the advantages of both the LSSVR and MPS to more efficiently achieve reasonably accurate results. In order to verify the proposed method, well-known highly nonlinear functions are used for testing. Finally, the proposed method is applied to three typical crashworthiness optimization cases.

The strategy is based on a data-driven approach which exploits an offline\u2013online decomposition. A synthetic dataset is constructed offline by solving a parametric time-dependent partial differential equation for multiple input parameters, sampled from their probability distributions of natural variation. The collected time-signals, extracted at sensor locations, are used to train classifiers at such sensor locations, thus constructing multiple databases of healthy configurations. These datasets are then used to train one class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVMs) to detect anomalies. During the online stage, a new measurement, possibly obtained from a damaged configuration, is evaluated using the classifiers. Information on damage is provided in a hierarchical manner: first, using a binary feedback, the entire structure response is either classified as inlier (healthy) or outlier (damaged). Then, for the outliers, we exploit the outputs of multiple classifiers to retrieve information both on the severity and the spatial location of the damages. Because of the large number of signals needed to construct the datasets offline, a model order reduction strategy is implemented to reduce the computational burden.

Hence, the critical need for novel approaches to handle multiple correlated exposures. Methods We propose a novel approach using the G-formula, a maximum likelihood-based substitution estimator, combined with an ensemble learning technique (i.e. SuperLearner) to infer causal effect estimates for a multi-pollutant mixture. We simulated four continuous outcomes from real data on 5 correlated exposures under four exposure-response relationships with increasing complexity and 500 replications. The first simulated exposure-response was generated as a linear function depending on two exposures; the second was based on a univariate nonlinear exposure-response relationship; the third was generated as a linear exposure-response relationship depending on two exposures and their interaction; the fourth simulation was based on a non-linear exposure-response relationship with an effect modification by sex and a linear relationship with a second exposure. We assessed the method based on its predictive performance (Minimum Square error [MSE]), its ability to detect the true predictors and interactions (i.e. false discovery proportion, sensitivity), and its bias. We compared the method with generalized linear and additive models, elastic net, random forests, and Extreme gradient boosting. Finally, we reconstructed the exposure-response relationships and developed a toolbox for interactions visualization using individual conditional expectations. Results The proposed method yielded the best average MSE across all the scenarios, and was therefore able to adapt to the true underlying structure of the data. The method succeeded to detect the true predictors and interactions, and was less biased in all the scenarios. Finally, we could correctly reconstruct the exposure-response relationships in all the simulations.

Typically, for each action unit (AU) or other expression, the peak frames are selected as positive class and the negative samples are selected from other AUs. This approach suffers from at least two drawbacks. One, because many state of the art classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), fail to scale well with increases in the number of training samples (e.g. for the worse case in SVM), it may be infeasible to use all potential training data. Two, it often is unclear how best to choose the positive and negative samples. If we only label the peaks as positive samples, a large imbalance will result between positive and negative samples, especially for infrequent AU. On the other hand, if all frames from onset to offset are labeled as positive, many may differ minimally or not at all from the negative class. Frames near onsets and offsets often differ little from those that precede them. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Cascades with Bidirectional Bootstrapping (DCBB) to address these issues.

Despite fishery monitoring, a considerable amount of captures escapes ICCAT control. In the Mediterranean Sea, the purse seine fishery supports ABFT farming, a capture-based aquaculture activity that involves catching fish from the wild and rearing them in sea cages for a few months. The first spine of the cranial dorsal fin undergoes a continuous bone remodeling process consisting in old bone (primary bone) resorption and new bone (secondary bone) apposition. A marked increase of spine bone resorption was shown in captive-reared ABFT with respect to wild specimens. In this paper, the Random Forest (RF), a Computer Aided Detection system, was applied to distinguish captive-reared from wild ABFT based on fish age, fish fork length, total surface of spine cross section, and surface of remodeled bone tissue in the spine cross section (sum of reabsorbed bone tissue and secondary cancellous bone). The RF system was also compared to the Logistic Regression method (LR). The percentages of properly classified animals, either wild or captive-reared, with respect to the overall number of animals, i.e. accuracy , was 95.3 \u00b1 2.6% and 79.0 \u00b1 5.1% for RF and LR, respectively. The percentages of the properly classified captive-reared specimens, i.e. sensitivity , were 93.5 \u00b1 3.1% and 75.8 \u00b1 5.3% for RF and LR, respectively. The percentages of the properly classified wild specimens was 96.7 \u00b1 2.2% and 81.4 \u00b1 4.9%, for RF and LR, respectively.

This is in part the result of the inevitable imperfections due to human error, lack of quality during the design and coding of software, and the increasing need to reduce faults to improve customer satisfaction in a competitive marketplace. Given the cost and importance of removing errors improvements in fault detection and removal can be of significant benefit. The earlier in the development process faults can be found, the less it costs to correct them and the less likely other faults are to develop. This research aims to make the testing process more efficient and effective by identifying those software modules most likely to contain faults, allowing testing efforts to be carefully targeted. This is done with the use of machine learning algorithms which use examples of fault prone and not fault prone modules to develop predictive models of quality. In order to learn the numerical mapping between module and classification, a module is represented in terms of software metrics. A difficulty in this sort of problem is sourcing software engineering data of adequate quality. In this work, data is obtained from two sources, the NASA Metrics Data Program, and the open source Eclipse project. Feature selection before learning is applied, and in this area a number of different feature selection methods are applied to find which work best. Two machine learning algorithms are applied to the data - Naive Bayes and the Support Vector Machine - and predictive results are compared to those of previous efforts and found to be superior on selected data sets and comparable on others. In addition, a new classification method is proposed, Rank Sum, in which a ranking abstraction is laid over bin densities for each class, and a classification is determined based on the sum of ranks over features. A novel extension of this method is also described based on an observed polarising of points by class when rank sum is applied to training data to convert it into 2D rank sum space. SVM is applied to this transformed data to produce models the parameters of which can be set according to trade-off curves to obtain a particular performance trade-off.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "86249441", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59790317"}

The work is based on the Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) canine model, in which 3 phases of canine growth and/or dystrophy development are identified: the first phase (0\u20134 months of age), the second phase (from over 4 to 6 months), and the third phase (from over 6 months to death). Two differentiation problems are posed: (i) the first phase vs. the second phase and (ii) the second phase vs. the third phase. Textural features are derived from T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. In total, 37 features provided by 8 different TA methods (statistical, filter-based, and model-based) have been tested. The work focuses on finding such textural features that evolve along with the dog\u2019s growth. These features are indicated by means of statistical analyses and eliminated from further investigation, as they may disturb the correct assessment of response to treatment in dystrophy. The relative importance of each remaining feature is then assessed with the use of the Monte Carlo (MC) procedure. Furthermore, feature selection based on the MC procedure is employed to find the optimal subset of age-independent features. Finally, three classifiers are used for evaluating different sets of textural features: Adaptive Boosting (AB), back-propagation Neural Network (NN), and nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVM).

However, most existing approaches rely on supervised machine learning (ML) and substantial labeled data that are expensive to develop and apply to different sub-fields of biomedicine. Recent research shows that minimal supervision is sufficient for fairly accurate information structure analysis of biomedical abstracts. However, is it realistic for full articles given their high linguistic and informational complexity? We introduce and release a novel corpus of 50 biomedical articles annotated according to the Argumentative Zoning (AZ) scheme, and investigate active learning with one of the most widely used ML models\u2014Support Vector Machines (SVM)\u2014on this corpus. Additionally, we introduce two novel applications that use AZ to support real-life literature review in biomedicine via question answering and summarization. ::: ::: Results: We show that active learning with SVM trained on 500 labeled sentences (6% of the corpus) performs surprisingly well with the accuracy of 82%, just 2% lower than fully supervised learning. In our question answering task, biomedical researchers find relevant information significantly faster from AZ-annotated than unannotated articles. In the summarization task, sentences extracted from particular zones are significantly more similar to gold standard summaries than those extracted from particular sections of full articles. These results demonstrate that active learning of full articles\u2019 information structure is indeed realistic and the accuracy is high enough to support real-life literature review in biomedicine. ::: ::: Availability: The annotated corpus, our AZ classifier and the two novel applications are available at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~yg244/12bioinfo.html. ::: ::: Contact: yg244@cam.ac.uk", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23564844", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btt163", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2138250184", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["30353758", "14085659", "14327960", "1851226", "961425", "144565557", "4936662", "313022", "14201460", "9156999", "909276", "12569302", "7155638", "2222590", "915058", "3956381", "964287", "927278", "46226024", "1802184", "2664810", "4518499", "37167089", "56563878", "1530308", "13537797", "38833768", "17101851", "7869993", "4068646", "195703876", "12054082", "18875330", "1500891", "1419672", "53662922", "7664224"], "inbound_citations": ["51918722", "58636568", "12123445", "1563223", "72938933", "23846101", "6566502", "198978291", "14965114", "6004072", "6491511"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:689719"}

With only two algorithmic parameters, they are relatively easier to implement. Existing literature suggests that the performance of random forests is insensitive to changing algorithmic parameters. However, this was largely based on the classifier\u2019s accuracy that does not necessarily represent the resulting thematic map accuracy. The current study extends beyond the classifier\u2019s accuracy assessment and investigate how the algorithmic parameters could affect the resulting thematic map accuracy by random forests. A set of random forest models with different parameter settings was carefully constructed and then used to classify a satellite image into multiple land cover categories. Both the classifier\u2019s accuracy and the map accuracy were assessed. The results reveal that these parameters can affect the map accuracy up to 9~16 percent for some classes, although their impact on the classifier\u2019s accuracy was quite limited. A careful parameterization prioritizing thematic map accuracy can help improve the performance of random forests in image classification, especially for spectrally complex land cover classes.

Mathematical optimization techniques were used to find the model parameters, such as connection strengths, that produced the best quantitative fits of reaction time and event-related potential data obtained in our previous work. Of the several architectures tested, two produced excellent quantitative fits of the experimental data. One involved an unexpected pain stimulus activating somatic threat detectors in the dorsal posterior insula. This threat detector activity was monitored by the medial prefrontal cortex, which in turn evoked a phasic response in the locus coeruleus. The locus coeruleus phasic response resulted in a facilitation of the cortical areas involved in decision and response processes time-locked to the painful stimulus. The second architecture involved the presence of pain causing an increase in general arousal. The increase in arousal was mediated by locus coeruleus tonic activity, which facilitated responses in the cortical areas mediating the sensory, decision, and response processes involved in the task.

Because dense motion contains more dynamic information for consecutive frames than pixels, it is beneficial for the task of video recognition. Correspondingly, we introduce motion superpixels in motion space, which are independently constructed per frame using superpixels extracted via energy driven sampling (SEEDS) and temporally tracked based on the nearest neighbourhood within consecutive flow fields. To define temporal information features, we track superpixels based on its central masses and descript the evolution of three motion based features namely histogram of flow (HOF), neighbourhood correlations, and centre of mass itself. Furthermore, we use the integrations of wavelet packet decomposition coefficients to achieve invariant scale and translation of sampled subsequences within a video sequence while also enrich features.

Second, a robust image gradient is computed over the hyper-spherical representation allowing an image segmentation that identifies major crop plots. Third, feature selection is achieved by a greedy wrapper approach. Finally, a classifier is trained and tested on the selected image pixel features. The classifiers used for feature selection and final classification are Single Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFN) trained with either the ELM or the incremental OP-ELM.

In the fraud detection task, typically the available datasets for ML training present some peculiarities, such as the unavoidable condition of a strong class imbalance, the existence of unlabeled transactions, and the large number of records that must be processed. The present paper aims to propose a methodology for automatic detection of fraudulent transactions, that tackle all these problems. The methodology is based on a Balanced Random Forest, that can be used in supervised and semi-supervised scenarios through a co-training approach. Two different schemes for the co-training approach are tested, in order to overcome the class imbalance problem. Moreover, a Spark platform and Hadoop file system support our solution, in order to enable the scalability of the proposed solution.

Facial neuromuscular signal has recently drawn the researchers' attention to its outstanding potential as an efficient medium for Muscle Computer Interface (MuCI) applications. The proper analysis of such electromyogram (EMG) signals is essential in designing the interfaces. In this article, a multiclass least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed for classification of different facial gestures EMG signals. EMG signals were captured through three bi-polar electrodes from ten participants while gesturing ten different facial states. EMGs were filtered and segmented into non-overlapped windows from which root mean square (RMS) features were extracted and then fed to the classifier. For the purpose of classification, different models of LS-SVM were constructed while tuning the kernel parameters automatically and manually. In the automatic mode, 48 models were formed while parameters of linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels were tuned using different optimization techniques, cost functions and encoding schemes. In the manual mode, 8 models were shaped by means of the considered kernel functions and encoding schemes. In order to find the best model with a reliable performance, constructed models were evaluated and compared in terms of classification accuracy and computational cost. Results reported that the model including RBF kernel which was tuned manually and encoded by one-versus-all scheme provided the highest classification accuracy (93.10%) and consumed 0.98s for training.

In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of \"posterior collapse\" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.00937", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963799213,2949201917,2752796333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["9176830", "18406556", "748227", "5002792", "2194647", "10020949", "2659157", "1033682", "7441501", "14576846", "17306137", "16496273", "6200260", "2428314", "6628106", "211227", "14307651", "14254027", "1981188", "5859948", "8142135", "2191379", "12554042", "16895865", "877639", "16660179", "9166388", "8394195", "6254678", "14989939", "17804904", "1169492", "1696516"], "inbound_citations": ["131777066", "209405121", "86642027", "59287964", "198952476", "215416299", "211252790", "145970564", "202720023", "212414654", "210932538", "208158188", "210867807", "62841605", "211532294", "211532737", "207915608", "59606253", "210164593", "48356743", "203194305", "201669150", "195874155", "211132970", "71150652", "210115367", "37808701", "211082564", "52036885", "5062433", "173990774", "202741916", "202542540", "49742003", "174800475", "197660133", "199554907", "52979270", "211817834", "214584817", "173990382", "52281600", "211096668", "125943823", "203641795", "52011389", "211258728", "53500372", "88517649", "211069397", "215548964", "52978953", "145984813", "159040946", "119116583", "214623276", "52281710", "85529456", "11374142", "209335881", "68152956", "203951486", "211204894", "211990641", "3298378", "208310342", "52286437", "51923049", "195820291", "59291933", "51930417", "54444726", "59524285", "202537332", "54003203", "196623666", "4422410", "167217828", "202537616", "209517233", "102352195", "184486972", "209484323", "51871648", "59553574", "209515909", "209457625", "211171721", "211096566", "204512445", "4677131", "53647803", "207853441", "208158120", "204907056", "49317433", "174798083", "56170176", "204852021", "53116019", "199442417", "211171717", "210888803", "208909731", "4425995", "208076048", "210882807", "211204720", "166228068", "202540700", "207870083", "214802456", "209140267", "44089406", "49473209", "211132814", "59222852", "56169317", "67877011", "53610915", "211988374", "202777021", "202777813", "202749985", "207983839", "203610478", "53714190", "53535787", "209531910", "167217323", "213234420", "170078852", "5041003", "140213191", "209515905", "208208788", "54481607", "210164771", "52271846", "157062725", "43920427", "46949741", "49876500", "210875342", "195350752", "212737075", "198229610", "52901292", "208202182", "4554108", "4696813", "202862718", "85529811", "209070068", "13692090", "204950512", "67925860", "57573785", "53280207", "174798398", "202565545", "102353397", "83458719", "209386397", "71145771", "59523659", "75135033", "49671976", "214620795", "195316979", "207880655", "167217584", "203836913", "4314399", "160009646", "195069189", "211298697", "173188045", "203591966", "203902620", "118648620", "53297223", "213175447", "203626530", "210939217", "211096800"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20282961"}

Thereafter, it will allow decision makers in charge of water resource management to predict its quality deterioration and anticipate any consequence on human health. To this end, Prognostics and Health Management, which is usually applied on industrial systems, has been transposed to water to continuously monitor it, detect and predict anomalous cases. Due to a high rate of missing values, a model selection method for multiple imputation has been implemented in order to reduce the induced uncertainty of the observations, while a dimensionality reduction method has been performed to mitigate the noise induced by the large amount of parameters of interest (more than fifty). To process the detection, unsupervised and supervised learning methods have been combined, which allowed to determine four classes of water quality and to provide relevant insights on the anomalous cases. Finally, the homogeneity of the resulting classes has been evaluated using a Support Vector Machine classifier.

In spite of the efficiency of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for modeling nonlinear and complicated rainfall-runoff (R-R) process, they suffer from some drawbacks. Support Vector Regression (SVR) model has appeared to be a powerful alternative to reduce some of these drawbacks while retaining many strengths of ANNs. In this paper, to form a new rainfall-runoff model called SVR-GANN, a SVR model is combined with a geomorphologic-based ANN model. The GANN is a three-layer perceptron model, in which the number of hidden neurons is equal to the number of possible flow paths within a watershed and the connection weights between hidden layer and output layer are specified by flow path probabilities which are not updated during the training process. The capabilities of the proposed SVR-GANN model in simulating the daily runoff is investigated in a case study of three sub-basins located in a semi-arid region in Iran.

Type-2 fuzzy sets have been shown to be a more promising method to manifest the uncertainties. Kernel design is a key component for many kernel-based methods. By integrating the kernel design with type-2 fuzzy sets, a systematic design methodology of IT2FK-SVM classification for scene images is presented to improve robustness and selectivity in the humanoid robot vision, which involves feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and classifier learning. Firstly, scene images are represented as high dimensional vector extracted from intensity, edge and orientation feature maps by biological-vision feature extraction method. Furthermore, a novel three-domain Fuzzy Kernel-based Principal Component Analysis (3DFK-PCA) method is proposed to select the prominent variables from the high-dimensional scene image representation. Finally, an IT2FM SVM classifier is developed for the comprehensive learning of scene images in complex environment. Different noisy, different view angle, and variations in lighting condition can be taken as the uncertainties in scene images. Compare to the traditional SVM classifier with RBF kernel, MLP kernel, and the Weighted Kernel (WK), respectively, the proposed method performs much better than conventional WK method due to its integration of IT2FK, and WK method performs better than the single kernel methods (SVM classifier with RBF kernel or MLP kernel). IT2FK-SVM is able to deal with uncertainties when scene images are corrupted by various noises and captured by different view angles.

Community detection has been getting lots of attention and interest in recent years. The application for such knowledge goes from target marketing to biology, social studies, and physics. The existing algorithms either lack accuracy or are too slow for Big Data graphs. Due to the rise of Big Data graphs, such solutions prove impractical for real-world datasets. In this study, we change the feed system for the Label Propagation algorithm from a random method to a degree-based system. In addition, we introduce a new convergence method that checks the membership for every node and flags them as converged when they meet the requirement. The main contributions of this work are twofold: (i) we optimize the Label Propagation algorithm, improving the accuracy by a factor of two. The results depend on the complexity of the graph; i.e. the denser a graph structure is, the better result the algorithm will achieve. (ii) We solved the inconsistency of identified communities of Label Propagation algorithm. The results are depicted using two well-known metrics known as the Normalized Mutual Information and the Adjusted Rand Index.

Traditional methods such as the Kalman filter require significant characterization testing, model development, and filter design and tuning efforts which must be tailored to each battery type. To help solve this problem, this work proposes a novel method to address SOC estimation using a deep neural network (DNN) with Transfer Learning (TL). Transfer learning is a method that uses the learnable parameters from a trained DNN to help train another DNN.

Since the kernel matrix is positive semidefinite, the dimension of the decomposed matrix can be reduced by decomposition (factorization) methods. The performance of the proposed method depends on the dimension of the decomposed matrix. Experimental results show that the proposed method is much faster than the quadratic programming solver LOQO if the dimension of the decomposed matrix is small enough compared to that of the kernel matrix. The proposed method is also faster than the method proposed in (S. Fine and K. Scheinberg, 2001) for both low-rank and full-rank kernel matrices.

An ontology is seen as a knowledge management structure that represents domain knowledge in a machine interpretable format. It describes concepts and relationships within a particular domain, in our case, the domain of musical instruments. However, the different tasks of ontology engineering including manual annotation, hierarchical structuring and organization of data can be laborious and challenging. For these reasons, we investigate how the process of creating ontologies can be made less dependent on human supervision by exploring concept analysis techniques in a Semantic Web environment. In this study, various musical instruments, from wind to string families, are classified using timbre features extracted from audio. To obtain models of the analysed instrument recordings, we use K-means clustering to determine an optimised codebook of Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs), or Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Two classification techniques based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were tested. Then, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is used to automatically build the hierarchical structure of musical instrument ontologies. Finally, the generated ontologies are expressed using the Ontology Web Language (OWL). System performance was evaluated under natural recording conditions using databases of isolated notes and melodic phrases. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted with the feature and classifier attributes as independent variables and the musical instrument recognition F-measure as dependent variable. Based on these statistical analyses, a detailed comparison between musical instrument recognition models is made to investigate their effects on the automatic ontology generation system. The proposed system is general and also applicable to other research fields that are related to ontologies and the Semantic Web.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TASL.2013.2263801", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1997539057", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15617187", "60638118", "15097681", "53838059", "109044391", "496500", "15921882", "3142848", "15780856", "43132844", "117000697", "6168648", "10742431", "41884696", "18305626", "17084602", "15210935", "14434192", "28114065", "13528495", "60623021", "18530691", "59972536", "16872686", "11423335", "107219832", "17797176", "122415379", "143664671", "123217261", "3262032", "18401118", "15121799", "60827152"], "inbound_citations": ["54460301", "49298988", "52304083", "20148584", "59599951", "37525882", "57191321", "53280116", "58007401", "201907220", "12340050", "2905112"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14100887"}

Motivated by the upcoming issues associated with data stream applications, such as concept drift and the velocity into which data needs to be processed, several methods have been proposed in the literature, most of them resulting from adaptations of traditional algorithms. Such methods are forced to satisfy hard requirements of restricted memory and processing time, while keeping track of the performance at the same time. In the classification context, ensembles are an effective and elegant way to handle this task. And mostly, the bottleneck of processing time and memory of an ensemble relies on the employed base learner and on the ensemble updating policy. This paper addresses both issues by proposing: 1) a fast base learning algorithm, which relies on discretizing every attribute range into disjoint intervals and associating, to each of them, a posterior probability relating it to a class; and 2) a static ensemble that comprises such base learners and handles concept drift without replacing base learners.

In contrast, a new generation of techniques is emerging where predictive models can take advantage of previous experience to leverage information from similar tasks. The new emerging area is referred to as transfer learning. In this paper, I briefly describe the motivation behind the use of transfer learning techniques, and explain how such techniques can be used to solve popular problems in astronomy. As an example, a prevalent problem in astronomy is to estimate the class of an object (e.g., Supernova Ia) using a generation of photometric light-curve datasets where data abounds, but class labels are scarce; such analysis can benefit from spectroscopic data where class labels are known with high confidence, but the data sample is small. Transfer learning provides a robust and practical solution to leverage information from one domain to improve the accuracy of a model built on a different domain. In the example above, transfer learning would look to overcome the difficulty in the compatibility of models between spectroscopic data and photometric data, since data properties such as size, class priors, and underlying distributions, are all expected to be significantly different.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1812.10403", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/1085/5/052014", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963230326,2952751097,2897562353", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["207159620", "8577357", "2497886", "108301245", "196041362", "15652752", "740063", "61294087", "119232259", "7831590", "9238949"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33854685"}

The interest in assistive technologies for supporting people at home is constantly increasing, both in academia and industry. In this context, the authors propose a fall classification system based on an innovative acoustic sensor that operates similarly to stethoscopes and captures the acoustic waves transmitted through the floor. The sensor is designed to minimize the impact of aerial sounds in recordings, thus allowing a more focused acoustic description of fall events. The audio signals acquired by means of the sensor are processed by a fall recognition algorithm based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Supervectors and Support Vector Machines to discriminate among different types of fall events. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated against a specific audio corpus comprising falls of a human mimicking doll and of everyday objects. The results showed that the floor sensor significantly improves the performance respect to an aerial microphone: in particular, the F1-Measure is 6.50% higher in clean conditions and 8.76% higher in mismatched noisy conditions.

Hidden neurons number, one of the parameters in the calculations is discussed and its role is examined. The importance of the appropriate selection of this value will not only be emphasized but also a new method will be proposed for proper selection.

This problem has been traditionally addressed through the textual query. In other words, information retrieval techniques will be exploited based on the textual similarity between queries and textual representation of software artifacts, which is generated by collecting words from comments, identifiers, and descriptions of programs. However, in addition to these semantic information, there are rich information embedded in source codes themselves. These source codes, if analyzed properly, can be a rich source for enhancing the efforts of software artifact retrieval. To this end, in this paper, we develop a feature extraction method on source codes. Specifically, this method can capture both the inherent information in the source codes and the semantic information hidden in the comments, descriptions, and identifiers of the source codes. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous metric learning approach, which allows to integrate code features and text features into the same latent semantic space. This, in turn, can help to measure the artifact similarity by exploiting the joint power of both code and text features.

However, liver surgery is still associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality, especially in extended resections. We analyzed a large liver surgery database to investigate whether laboratory parameters like haemoglobin, leucocytes, bilirubin, haematocrit and lactate might be relevant preoperative predictors. It is not uncommon to observe missing values in such data. This also holds for many other data sources and research fields. For analysis, one can make use of imputation methods or approaches that are able to deal with missing values in the predictor variables. A representative of the latter are Random Forests which also provide variable importance measures to assess a variable's relevance for prediction. Applied to the liver surgery data, we observed divergent results for the laboratory parameters, depending on the method used to cope with missing values. We therefore performed an extensive simulation study to investigate the properties of each approach. Findings and recommendations: Complete case analysis should not be used as it distorts the relevance of completely observed variables in an undesirable way. The estimation of a variable's importance by a self-contained measure that can deal with missing values appropriately reflects the decreased relevance of variables with missing values. It can therefore be used to obtain insight into Random Forests which are commonly fit without preprocessing of missing values in the data. By contrast, multiple imputation allows for the assessment of a variable's relevance one would potentially observe in complete-data situations, if imputation performs well. For the laboratory data, lactate and bilirubin seem to be associated with the risk of liver failure and postoperative complications. These relations should be investigated by future studies in more detail. However, it is important to carefully consider the method used for analysis when there are missing values in the predictor variables.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24914728", "doi": "10.1515/ijb-2013-0038", "venue": null, "journal": "The International Journal of Biostatistics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "31913789", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["879148", "42445089", "23583962", "24656776", "205511538", "10858288", "89141", "27885544", "17483159", "3626971", "15880873", "8680614", "2827580", "15245447", "27768367", "13290470", "5951627", "1215790", "634847", "41440816", "1799784", "7034396", "37379599", "38075961", "10975020", "123227007", "123682548", "167798727", "801332", "1659339", "123170496", "15640743", "16120223", "23580997", "60993494", "207738357", "46648703", "115301551", "2530461", "3288343", "8529157", "88517140", "214750992", "120844501", "122665203", "17457443", "18600099", "8397120", "6258394", "16120223"], "inbound_citations": ["7436443"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8997009"}

We specifically target the segmentation of precancerous lesions in a NCI/NLM archive of 60,000 cervigrams. Due to large variations in image appearance in the archive, color and texture features of a tissue type in one image often overlap with that of a different tissue type in another image. This makes reliable tissue segmentation in a large number of images a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose the use of powerful machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) to learn, from a database with ground truth annotations, critical visual signs that correlate with important tissue types and to use the learned classifier for tissue segmentation in unseen images. In our experiments, SVM performs better than un-supervised methods such as Gaussian Mixture clustering, but it does not scale very well to large training sets and does not always guarantee improved performance given more training data. To address this problem, we combine SVM and clustering so that the features we extracted for classification are features of clusters returned by the mean-shift clustering algorithm. Compared to classification using individual pixel features, classification by cluster features greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus it is more efficient while producing results with comparable accuracy.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.771088", "venue": "SPIE Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2591175148,2046444175", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14227898", "28637672", "691081", "5646544", "2474873", "3025202", "59718844"], "inbound_citations": ["14096409", "15806774", "6280724", "4330181", "987332", "11242616", "24964034", "11418448", "11388609", "49568881", "6751950", "214623801", "13856501", "6291524", "14189168", "214632954", "1139782", "11946933", "17647036", "21588294", "6845791", "10266303", "826167", "13844157"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13802646"}

Important approaches in virtual screening have been through docking studies and using classification techniques.

To aid the radiologists, computer aided diagnosis provides a second opinion for the detection and classification of breast cancer. In this paper, two texture feature extraction methods using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) have been proposed to classify the masses in mammogram images into benign or malignant. The first feature extraction method is based on Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD). On performing BEMD on Region of Interest (ROI) of mammogram image, the ROI is decomposed into a set of different frequency components called Bi-dimensional Intrinsic Mode Functions (BIMFs). Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRM) features are extracted from these BIMFs and are given as input to the classifier for classification into benign or malignant. Due to the mode mixing problem that exists in BEMD, BIMFs obtained from BEMD are less orthogonal to each other. To overcome this drawback, the second feature extraction method called Modified Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (MBEMD) is proposed. The BIMFs are extracted by employing the proposed MBEMD on mammogram ROI. Features are extracted in a similar way as BEMD method. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers are used for the classification of mammogram mass. The classification accuracy of 88.8%, 96.2% and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) of 0.9, 0.96 are obtained with SVM classifier for BEMD, proposed MBEMD based features respectively.

Plant geometric features that are essential for understanding plant growth can be obtained from the point cloud built using three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of plant imagery data. A key task in the data processing pipeline is the automated and accurate segmentation of individual plants. Machine learning is a promising approach due to its strong ability in the extraction of details from images and has been successfully applied in plant leaf segmentation from two-dimensional (2D) images. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the performance of three machine learning methods, i.e. boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-means clustering, in the segmentation of non-overlapped and overlapped soybean plants at early growth stages using 3D point cloud. Images of 75 soybean plants at two growth stages in a greenhouse were collected using an image-based high-throughput phenotyping platform and were used to develop 3D point cloud using the Structure from Motion (SfM) method. Plant features including position (coordinate x, y, and z), and color (Red, Green, Blue, hue, saturation and Triangular Greenness Index) were used for background removal and the separation of non-overlapped plants. A Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor was used for the separation of overlapped plants. The percentage of mismatched points between manual and automated segmentation was calculated and results showed that K-means clustering had the least mean error rates (0.36% and 0.20%) for the background removal and the non-overlapped plant separation. The least mean error rate for the separation of overlapped plants was 2.57% using SVM with labeled HOG descriptor. The developed image segmentation pipeline was evaluated in a case study where 69 plants at different growth stages were continuously monitored.

In addition, spectral bands are usually highly correlated and contain data redundancies. To address these limitations, a multiple classification system based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is proposed to classify hyperspectral data. In this method, the data sets are first split into several band clusters based on the similarities between the contiguous bands. Next, the most useful bands in each cluster are determined using a band selection technique. Using an AdaBoost classification system, each band cluster is classified with an SVM, and a final decision is made by combining the outputs of each boosting step using the weights obtained from the AdaBoost processing. The obtained results are compared with a standard SVM applied on a feature set containing all the selected bands from different clusters and a standard SVM applied on all the spectral bands in terms of overall and single class accuracies and training times. In addition to this, the capability of AdaBoost to combine the decisions of component classifier is compared with majority voting classifier fusion method.

Therefore, our work proposes the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for trading strategies calibration and aggregation. To this purpose, we provide a full methodology on: (i) the training and selection of a cGAN for time series data; (ii) how each sample is used for strategies calibration; and (iii) how all generated samples can be used for ensemble modelling. To provide evidence that our approach is well grounded, we have designed an experiment with multiple trading strategies, encompassing 579 assets. We compared cGAN with an ensemble scheme and model validation methods, both suited for time series.

Such attacks have definite signature for instance specific ports or RTT. Hence such attacks can be detected by cross verifying current communication signature with attack signatures. However attack signatures are evolutionary. Therefore using a string matching technique is neither robust nor fast. Hence several machine learning techniques are developed which are mainly based on classifier. These classifiers lack generalization capabilities which result in less performance leading to high false positives. However a specific attack can have wide range of signatures and a signature may of wide range of attacks. Therefore conventional classifiers like Neural Network needs frequent training when a new signature is discovered. Again discovery of such new signature also needs a regression with existing signature database. In order to avoid exploding the training nodes of Neural Network, it is important that a benchmark is set of introduce new nodes. In this paper we use Artificial Immune System mark the signatures as genes. A packet or network level signature is verified for closeness with existing model. In case of significant diversification is detected, the signature is marked as new which is regressed with the existing signature model to automate the grouping of the signature. Signature similar to existing ones is subjected to regression using PLS method and is then classified by neural network. This paper evaluates the performance of technique using the publicly available KDD Cup dataset and compares the result with conventional Neural Network Based Classifier, Support Vector Machine based Classifier, pure regression based technique and conventional string matching technique. Further we investigate the real time applicability of the technique by using PLS Regression to detect anomaly in CIT college router dataset. We consider that the connections by peer clients should only be accessing internet. Other activities like using Bittorrent are considered as anomaly. First we take router log and extract the features. We then select a specific data row and classify it using auto regression.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17148/IJARCCE.2014.31226", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering", "mag_id": "2335494429", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59062831"}

This paper presents a method for learning discrete exponential family models using the Bethe approximation to the MLE. Remarkably, this problem also reduces to iterative (MAP) decoding. This connection emerges by combining the Bethe approximation with a Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm on a convex dual objective which circumvents the intractable partition function.

This work deals with the development of a high-level classification framework which combines parameters optimization of a single classifier with classifiers ensemble optimization, through meta-heuristics.

Although the global ocean is a net CO 2 sink, regional fluctuations in the CO 2 partial pressures can have potential consequences on the universal trend. Being one of the least sampled oceanic region, the chief elements regulating the Bay of Bengal (BoB) partial pressures are yet to be understood. An attempt has been made to analyse the significance of biological and chemical properties in defining the spatial distribution of the sea surface partial pressures as well as the influence of monsoonal river influx in BoB. Results revealed an equal importance of the chemical and biological factors on the partial pressure distribution. The Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms developed from Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) showed to give better output in the post monsoon, while they tend to underestimate the values in the pre-monsoon season due to interference by biological factors.

Monthly solar irradiation on rooftops, freely accessible from www.ge.ch/sitg using GIS LiDAR data (resolution 50cm by 50cm), is used in the analysis.

We rank the roofs based on the complexity of their shape, useful area for PV, and potential for receiving solar energy. The results show that for most roof shapes the ratio between useful roof areas and building footprint area is close to one, the main exception being gable where the ratio is 1.18, suggesting that footprint is a good measure of useful PV roof area. The flat roof has the second highest useful roof area for PV (complex roof being the highest) and the highest PV potential (in GWh). By contrast, hip roof has the lowest PV potential.

This paper presents a new concept of high GVF measurement using a Terahertz-based imaging system.

The recent availability of low cost THz imaging systems that can generate two dimensional (2D) images at more than 100 frames/seconds make them well suitable for flow metering applications. Two different Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were assessed using an inhouse multiphase flow loop. The corresponding results reveal that while ANN and SVM yield very accurate results, the SVM technique performed slightly better where a maximal error of 0.46 % for GVF in the GVF range from 80 to 100% could be achieved.

Among these available energy resources, the use of wind energy is growing rapidly to generate and supply electricity as grid connected or stand alone mode. To generate electric power from such non-conventional sources, self-excited induction generator (SEIG) is found to be a suitable option for either using in grid connected mode or isolated mode. Selection of SEIG in these areas depends on its advantages such as low cost, less maintenance, and absence of DC excitation. High maintenance and installation costs including transmission losses of conventional power supply to remote or isolated place by means of power grid can be reduced by installing stand-alone wind driven SEIG system at those places. In the year of 1935, self-excitation concept in squirrel cage induction machine with capacitors at their stator terminals was introduced by Basset and Potter. But the problems associated with SEIG are its poor voltage and frequency regulation under load and prime mover speed perturbations which put a limit on the use of SEIG for a long time. By controlling active and reactive power accurately, it is possible to regulate frequency and voltage of SEIG terminal during load and speed perturbations. Various efforts have been put by researchers in developing SEIG voltage and frequency controller but these control schemes demand multiple sensors along with complex electronic circuits.This dissertation presents some studies and development of new voltage controller of the SEIG system for balanced resistive, R \u2212 L and induction motor (IM) load that is used in isolated or remote areas. So in this context, an attempt is taken to develop an optimized voltage controller for SEIG using Generalized Impedance Controller (GIC) with a single closed loop. Stable zones of proportional and integral gains for GIC based SEIG system are computed along with parameter evaluation of the GIC based SEIG system. Further, Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) technique is used to compute the optimal values of proportional and integral gains within the stable zone. The research work on SEIG system is extended to develop a voltage controller for SEIG with minimum number of sensors to make the system less complex and cost effective. Here, a voltage peak computation technique is developed using Hilbert Transform and computational efficient COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) which requires only one voltage sensor and processed to control SEIG voltage for GIC based SEIG system. This voltage control scheme is implemented on commercially available TMS320F2812 DSP processor and performed laboratory experiment to study the performance of GIC based SEIG system during load switching. The work of this thesis is not confined only to study an optimal and simple voltage controller for SEIG system but also extended to investigate the fault identification methodologies of SEIG system. Here, the features of non-stationary SEIG signal with faults are extracted using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Further, different classifiers such as MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) are used to identify faults of SEIG system. In this study, it is observed that LS-SVM among above classifiers provides higher classification accuracy of 99.25%.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2522250544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114299472"}

Although many related action recognition algorithms have been proposed, similar environments conditions are often required in the training and testing stages, which limits the application of the related technologies. In order to accelerate the generalization of action recognition, in this paper, the cross-domain action recognition problem are explored by three different kinds of aspects: 1) feature learning , hand-crafted feature and deep learning feature are extracted, respectively, and then the generalization ability of them are assessed and discussed on controlled and uncontrolled environments, respectively; 2) unsupervised cross-domain learning, since it is difficult for us to obtain the labeled samples in the target domain, thus, unsupervised cross-domain learning methods can be borrowed. In order to discuss which one is suitable for open domain action recognition problem, thus, three kind of unsupervised cross-domain learning methods are assessed on open domain action recognition dataset, respectively; 3) supervised cross-domain learning, if there are some labeled samples in the target domain, but the number of them is very limited, thus, supervised cross-domain learning method should be a good choice, but, how do we make the decision for them? Therefore, these methods are also appraised on the same dataset. Moreover, we contribute a novel multi-view and multi-modality human action recognition dataset (abbreviated as \u201d $MMA$ \u201d). It consists of 7,080 action samples from 25 action categories, including 15 single-subject actions and 10 double-subject interactive actions in three views of two different scenarios, which can be utilized to simultaneously explore single-view learning, multi-view learning, multi-modality learning, and cross-domain learning problems. We further explore the same learning problems on the MMA dataset. The extensive experimental results on two different datasets show that the deep feature learning method has much better generalization ability than the hand-crafted feature, such as improved dense trajectory if there are enough labeled samples in the training dataset to be used to fine-tune the network, and both unsupervised cross-domain learning method and supervised cross-domain learning method can improve the performance, but the latter can obtain much bigger improvement, in other words, the labeled samples in the target domain are very helpful.

However, for concrete data processing tasks the currently standardized role classes are not sufficient to unambiguously express the meaning of various vendor or application specific concepts, while user-defined role classes rely on hand wired semantics encoded in dedicated software, e.g. importer/exporters.

Recently, due to the rapid development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), there has been significant progress in the field. However, almost all existing GAN-based works are prone to address the mapping from human motions to video scenes, with scene appearances are encoded individually in the trained models. Therefore, each trained model can only generate videos with a specific scene appearance, new models are required to be trained to generate new appearances. Besides, existing works lack the capability of appearance control. For example, users have to provide video records of wearing new clothes or performing in new backgrounds to enable clothes or background changing in their synthetic videos, which greatly limits the application flexibility. In this paper, we propose GAC-GAN, a general method for appearance-controllable human video motion transfer. To enable general-purpose appearance synthesis, we propose to include appearance information in the conditioning inputs. Thus, once trained, our model can generate new appearances by altering the input appearance information. To achieve appearance control, we first obtain the appearance-controllable conditioning inputs and then utilize a two-stage GAC-GAN to generate the corresponding appearance-controllable outputs, where we utilize an ACGAN loss and a shadow extraction module for output foreground and background appearance control respectively. We further build a solo dance dataset containing a large number of dance videos for training and evaluation.

We also conduct a detailed analysis on various factors that affect the performance of decoding including beam size, label smoothing, softmax temperature, attention smoothing and coverage.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISCSLP.2018.8706686", "venue": "2018 11th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP)", "journal": "2018 11th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2944384275", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13412186", "11715509", "206514100", "6263878", "898670", "9901844", "206741496", "6028290", "18165915", "206742954", "28854814", "46757477", "13750656", "21713551", "11212020", "1921173", "11590585", "41638977", "14613630", "17986018", "11760007", "9854876", "206593880", "1687220", "9545399", "7200347", "146843", "3603249"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146119026"}

During the process of EEG analysis, feature extraction is one of the most critical technical aspect. Traditional EEG feature extraction methods are mainly based on single domain analysis. However, due to the highly non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of the EEG, it is difficult to extract comprehensive information only from single domain analysis. In the present study, a novel feature extraction method was proposed based on the multi-domain analysis of the EEG. Fifteen characteristic parameters were extracted based on the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA), visibility graph algorithm (VGA), frequency analysis and nonlinear analysis. Ten optimal parameters of the fifteen parameters were selected by the genetic algorithm (GA). Then the Least Squares-Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) were used to classify the sleep states. The cross validation results demonstrated that multi-domain feature extraction method can obtain more useful information in the EEG signal.

This study included two parts, single point downscaling and regional downscaling, monthly rainfall observation from only Yi-Lan weather station was used for the former, and weekly rainfall observation from 24 rainfall stations located at Yi-Lan region were used for the latter. The space-time variations of climate variables and monsoon features among the season lead to distinct local rainfall patterns in study area. Hence, this study combined EOF method and K-means clustering to classify a year into four seasons, which were mei-yu season (April to June), typhoon season (July to August), transition season (September to November), and northeastern monsoon season (December to March). Downscaling model was then established base on this classification. To establish the nonlinear relationship between large scale climate variables and the local regional rainfall, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) method were mainly used. The EOF method was used not only to reduce the data dimension of the space-time climate variables and local region rainfall observation, but to identify the most important spatial patterns of each climate variables and local rainfall during the study period. This approach is expected to add some real physical meaning in statistical downscaling method. In results, the model performed well in only mei-yu season, but not quite well in typhoon and transition seasons. Also, in the GCM future scenario, it shows that the rainfall significant increase in mei-yu and transition season, decrease in typhoon and northeastern monsoon season, but not significant. Though the model performance in transition season is not quite well, the model could still indicate that trend of rainfall in this season will apparently increase.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.6342/NTU.2011.01995", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210059256"}

One key issue with ECOC-based multi-class classifier is how to construct effective binary classifiers. Besides applying ECOC to multi-view face detection, this paper emphasizes on designing efficient binary classifiers by learning informative features through minimizing the error rate of the ensemble ECOC multi-class classifier. Aiming at designing efficient binary classifiers, we employ spatial histograms as the representation, which provide an over-complete set of optional features that can be efficiently computed from the original images.

Although exiting HIN embedding methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they still face a few major weaknesses. Most importantly, they usually adopt negative sampling to randomly select nodes from the network, and they do not learn the underlying distribution for more robust embedding. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GAN), we develop a novel framework HeGAN for HIN embedding, which trains both a discriminator and a generator in a minimax game. Compared to existing HIN embedding methods, our generator would learn the node distribution to generate better negative samples. Compared to GANs on homogeneous networks, our discriminator and generator are designed to be relation-aware in order to capture the rich semantics on HINs.

However, this process assumes that past explanations are well understood and provide good \u201clessons\u201d to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Instead, it is reasonable to assume that the reasoner would have gaps in its knowledge base. By reasoning about a new situation, the reasoner should be able to fill in these gaps as new information came in, reorganize its explanations in memory, and gradually evolve a better understanding of its domain. We present a story understanding program that retrieves past explanations from situations already in memory, and uses them to build explanations to understand novel stories about terrorism. In doing so, the system refines its understanding of the domain by filling in gaps in these explanations, by elaborating the explanations, or by learning new indices for the explanations.

Satellite images have proven their high potential for mapping crop areas at large scales, even at the crop-species level, when a classifier is calibrated on the same image with reference data corresponding to the same period. For operational monitoring purposes, however, it is critical to develop generalized classification methodologies applicable to large scales and different years. Generalized classifiers were presented in this study as follows: a) simple cross-year calibration and application (M1); b) multiyear calibrations (M2); and c) map updating through change detection with multiyear calibrations (M3). These three methods were developed in a classical frame of object-based classifications for a time series of Landsat images with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Therein, we tested these methods for sugarcane classification in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, as sugarcane is an economically important crop that has developed substantially in the past decades. Eight years of sugarcane reference maps were used to calibrate and validate the classifiers at four different sites. The cross-year application of M1 provided a low average accuracy Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.84, while it was, on average, 0.94 for the classical same-year calibration. When the classifier was trained on a multiyear dataset (M2), the accuracies achieved average values of 0.91 in independent years.

Furthermore, fast visual tracking can be achieved by using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The developed tracking algorithm is based on bootstrap particle filter.

Its ability to deal with high-dimensional data makes this algorithm especially useful for studies in neuroimaging and bioinformatics. Despite its popularity and wide use, feature selection in Random Forest still lacks a crucial ingredient: false positive rate control. To date there is no efficient, principled and computationally light-weight solution to this shortcoming. As a result, researchers using Random Forest for feature selection have to resort to using heuristically set thresholds on feature rankings. This article builds an approximate probabilistic model for the feature selection process in random forest training, which allows us to compute an estimated false positive rate for a given threshold on selection frequency. Hence, it presents a principled way to determine thresholds for the selection of relevant features without any additional computational load. Experimental analysis with synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can limit false positive rates on the order of the desired values and keep false negative rates low. Results show that this holds even in the presence of a complex correlation structure between features.

The key feature of PU learning is that there is no labeled negative training data, which makes the traditional classification techniques inapplicable. Similar to the idea of Biased-SVM which is one of the most famous classifier, a biased least squares support vector machine classifier (Biased-LSSVM) is proposed for PU learning in this paper. More specifically, we take unlabeled examples as negative examples with noise and build a least squares support vector machine classifier using two penalty parametersandto weight misclassification errors of positive and negative examples respectively. As we pay more attention to classify as many as positive examples correctly in PU learning, the relationship of parametersandis. Compared with Biased-SVM, the proposed classifier has three advantages. First, Biased-LSSVM can reflect the class labels of all examples more sufficiently and accurately than Biased-SVM. Second, Biased-LSSVM is more stable than Biased-SVM because the performance of Biased-LSSVM changes less than that of Biased-SVM over a wide ratio of positive examples in unlabeled examples. Finally, the time complexity of Biased-LSSVM is lower than that of Biased-SVM, where Biased-LSSVM only need to solve liner equations and Biased-SVM is a quadratic programming. The Experiments on two real applications, text classification and bioinformatics classification verify the above opinions and show that Biased-LSSVM is more effective than Biased-SVM and other popular methods, such as EB-SVM, ROC-SVM and S-EM.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4304/jsw.9.6.1494-1502", "venue": "JSW", "journal": "JSW", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2412480350,2026906501", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18818687", "14200393", "45767512", "2748729", "1720166", "7079167", "12046761", "38568170", "3938118", "4095446", "10108738", "371647", "14322823", "559207", "559207", "6011427", "3565552", "1065197", "63613167", "52874011", "2427083", "10194797", "20126399", "36032096", "30541557"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15783750"}

Binary models are easier to develop, but result in text that is potentially less informative. We investigated whether building a multiclass de-identification is worth the extra effort. Methods: Using the 2014 i2b2 dataset, we compared the accuracy and impact on document readability of two models. In the first experiment, we generated one binary and two multiclass versions trained with the same machine-learning algorithm Conditional Random Field (CRF). Accuracy (recall, precision, f-score) and secondary metrics (e.g, training time, testing time, minimum memory required) were measured. In the second experiment, three reviewers accessed the readability of two redacted documents using the binary and multiclass methods.

The use of satellite remote sensing to map mangroves has become widespread as it can provide accurate, efficient, and repeatable assessments. Traditional remote sensing approaches have failed to accurately map fringe mangroves and true mangrove species due to relatively coarse spatial resolution and/or spectral confusion with landward vegetation. This study demonstrates the use of the new Worldview-2 sensor, Object-based image analysis (OBIA), and support vector machine (SVM) classification to overcome both of these limitations. An exploratory spectral separability showed that individual mangrove species could not be spectrally separated, but a distinction between true and associate mangrove species could be made. An OBIA classification was used that combined a decision-tree classification with the machine-learning SVM classification. Results showed an overall accuracy greater than 94% (kappa = 0.863) for classifying true mangroves species and other dense coastal vegetation at the object level.

The classical linear regression analysis between PTH and phosphate shows a correlation coefficient is 0.27, p<0.001, the possibility to predict PTH changes from phosphate modification is marginal. Alternatively, RF assumes that changes in phosphate will cause modifications in other associated variables (calcium and others) that may also affect PTH values. Using RF the correlation coefficient between changes in serum PTH and phosphate is 0.77, p<0.001; thus, the power of prediction is markedly increased. The effect of therapy on biochemical variables was also analyzed using this RF. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our results suggest that the analysis of the complex interactions between mineral metabolism parameters in CKD-MBD may demand a more advanced data analysis system such as RF.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4726537", "pubmed_id": "26808154", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0146801", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2416395502", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5922398", "24011816", "19187963", "41574908", "11244581", "153310", "2760786", "32569874", "9121488", "10273382", "19784926", "25831174", "37718537", "89141", "14864905", "10951224", "25307913", "7642182", "189907550", "41337204", "6038636", "7222104", "19047467", "19471943"], "inbound_citations": ["10493031", "133605522"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15413786"}

Past and pres ent sequential architectures, desp ite the rapid advances in computing technology, have yet to prov ide such processing power and to offer a holistic so lution to the problem. This paper presents a fresh attempt in formulating alternative techniques for grammar learning, based upon the parallel and distributed model of connectionism , to facilitate the more cognitively demanding task of pattern understanding. The proposed method has been compared with the contemporary approach of shape modelling based on level sets, and demonstrated its potential as a prototype for constructing robust networks on high pe rformance parallel platforms. Keywords: Connectionism, concurrent architectures, syntactic pattern recognition, grammars learning, dynamic networks. 1. INTRODUCTION Most artificial intelligent systems store a nd manipulate a large amount of knowledge without any rega rd for the physical processing architecture. This knowledge is encoded in the system in a formal language and operated on by an interpreter, commonly known as the inference engine , which processes the known facts of the environment with the knowledge base to form inferences. In contrast, a person's common sense knowledge involves a great variety of different types of knowledge and this requires significantly more complex management systems. Here the structures used to represent knowledge are symbolic and, as such, form high-order hierar chies which influence what can be represented and what the system can achieve. Indeed, many researchers believe that the manipulation of symbolic struc tures is the only route to truly intelligent systems; the symbols form a processing level within all the other ment al levels and it is within this level that true intelligence emerges. Pattern recognition, for example, which deduces a structure from a few known facts, is frequently, and perhaps rather expertly, performed by people. Whilst many advances have been made in computational intelligence over the past two decades with highly hierarchical knowledge structures, they all suffer a common handicap ; i.e. a severe limitation to the amount of knowledge that can be processed in a given time by serial computers. Furthermore as the knowledge base grows so does the algorithmic complexity required to proce ss the knowledge [6]. This is particularly due to the sequential model of computation to which researchers have long grown accustomed since the advent of digital computers. Indeed the exponential growth of processing powers demanded by even some of the simplest opera tions is indicative of the largely sequential nature of the search algorithms and large data structures being searche d. We argue that, until recen tly, sequential architectures have been severely (and largely) limited by th eir physical organizations. These limitations have been a key motivation for this work on the development of a fundamentally new approach to grammatical inference based on connectionism [8]. The research began its studies for symbol processing with the pr oblem of learning 2-D geometri c structures on an image grid, regardless of their position and size [7], and, perhaps most im portantly, is reasonably insensitiv e to noise and the (often) incomplete data as in real scenarios. The co nnectionist approach adopted here is not merely a knowled ge representation, but also a bona-fide parallel architecture that performs its own parsing and learni ng concurrently [9]. Computationally, this has several major advantages; firs tly, the connectionist model which makes use of a massive network of parallel and distributed computational elements lends itself naturally to implementations on (physical) parallel platforms. Secondly, by removing the traditionally sequential notion of traversal we have made it possible to parse a whole pattern concurrently, and more efficiently. Thirdly, there is little need for parallelisation or optimisation, even on parallel platforms, as the technique itself is inherently parallel. Fourthly, such parallel parsing is inherently more error-tolerant", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.806035", "venue": "Electronic Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2061416339", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9129060", "13128194", "14929019", "6521345", "13320516", "55733850", "29450111", "10127893", "33388965", "10143244", "39344060", "3055411"], "inbound_citations": ["9759092"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32806156"}

Electroencephalography (EEGs) are obtained from 22 subjects with epileptic seizure and non-epileptic seizure states recorded using 23 channels with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz. The functional connectivity of the brain region can be exacted from the features obtained from EEG signals by measuring phase locking value (PLV). The neuronal connection in the brain can be expressed in terms of phase synchrony. Despite of the fact that brain states should be characterize independently based upon its extracted features. Therefore, a novel functional connectivity index (FCI) feature is proposed, namely Bi-Spectral Phase Concurrence Index (BSPCI). It is used to represent the spectral information with third cumulant order correlation functions of the EEG signal. In this paper, three FCI features were measured namely, the magnitude's mean of the bi-spectral, the normalized entropy of bi-spectrum (NE1) and the normalized entropy of squared bi-spectrum (NE2) from the BSPCI. Rank sum test based on the Wilcoxon approach is used to find the set of statistical difference between quantitative features extracted from EEG signals. The results provide evidence that the FCI will have an impact in separating the difference among seizure states of various epileptic seizure patients. On the part of reducing a large number of the feature vector, feature selection is performed by utilizing the sequential forward selection method. PLV is measured for quantifying the obtained phase synchrony of EEG signal.

To evaluate and improve the effectiveness of watermark, watermark removal attracts increasing attention and becomes a hot research top. Current methods cast the watermark removal as an image-to-image translation problem where the encode-decode architectures with pixel-wise loss are adopted to transfer the transparent watermarked pixels into unmarked pixels. However, when a number of realistic images are presented, the watermarks are more likely to be unknown and diverse (i.e., the watermarks might be opaque or semi-transparent; the category and pattern of watermarks are unknown). When applying existing methods to the real-world scenarios, they mostly can not satisfactorily reconstruct the hidden information obscured under the complex and various watermarks (i.e., the residual watermark traces remain and the reconstructed images lack reality). To address this difficulty, in this paper, we present a new watermark processing framework using the conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for visible watermark removal in the real-world application. The proposed method enables the watermark removal solution to be more closed to the photo-realistic reconstruction using a patch-based discriminator conditioned on the watermarked images, which is adversarially trained to differentiate the difference between the recovered images and original watermark-free images. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale visible watermark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and clearly indicate that our proposed approach can produce more photo-realistic and convincing results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.12845", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-34120-6_28", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2991138664,2947939518", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["206766608", "53222359", "7971140", "1033682", "6200260", "980236", "6628106", "211227", "12803511", "33854796", "35174576", "3719281", "68387", "14124313", "44166086"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:170079175"}

Approach: Asymmetric bagging and feature selection was introduced into the problem and Asymmetric Bagging of Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM) was proposed on predicting drug activities to treat unbalanced problem. At the same time, features extracted from structures of drug molecules affected prediction accuracy of QSAR models. Hybrid algorithm named SPRAG was proposed, which applied an embedded feature selection method to remove redundant and irrelevant features for AB-SVM. Results: Numerical experimental results on a data set of molecular activities showed that AB-SVM improved AUC and sensitivity values of molecular activities and SPRAG with feature selection further helps to improve prediction ability.

Different from existing works, as micro-video inherits the characteristics of social platforms, we simultaneously incorporate multi-source content data of items and multi-networks of users to learn user and item representations for recommendation. This information can be complementary to each other in a way that multi-modality data can bridge the semantic gap among items, while multi-type user networks, such as following and reposting, are able to propagate the preferences among users. Furthermore, to discover the hidden categories of micro-videos that properly match users\u2019 interests, we interactively learn the user\u2013item representations and perform the hidden item category clustering. The resulted categorical representations are interacted with user representations to model user preferences at different levels of hierarchies. Finally, multi-source content item data, multi-type user networks and hidden item categories are jointly modelled in a unified recommender, and the parameters of the model are collaboratively learned to boost the recommendation performance.

However, the heterogeneous nature of this information makes it difficult for recommender systems to leverage in a unified framework to boost the performance. Recently, the rapid development of representation learning techniques provides an approach to this problem. By translating the various information sources into a unified representation space, it becomes possible to integrate heterogeneous information for informed recommendation. In this work, we propose a Joint Representation Learning (JRL) framework for top-N recommendation. In this framework, each type of information source (review text, product image, numerical rating, etc) is adopted to learn the corresponding user and item representations based on available (deep) representation learning architectures. Representations from different sources are integrated with an extra layer to obtain the joint representations for users and items. In the end, both the per-source and the joint representations are trained as a whole using pair-wise learning to rank for top-N recommendation. We analyze how information propagates among different information sources in a gradient-descent learning paradigm, based on which we further propose an extendable version of the JRL framework (eJRL), which is rigorously extendable to new information sources to avoid model re-training in practice.

Learning algorithms thus benefit from having separate policies for these tasks, and from knowing when each one is appropriate.

While many methods work well in interleaved tasks, blended tasks are difficult for methods with strict, human-specified task divisions, such as Multitask Learning. In such problems, task divisions should be discovered automatically. To demonstrate the power of this approach, the MM-NEAT neuroevolution framework is applied in this paper to two variants of the challenging video game of Ms. Pac-Man. In the simplified interleaved version of the game, the results demonstrate when and why such machine-discovered task divisions are useful.

Methods/ Statistical Analysis: Usually, the selections of classification techniques, such as, Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Lazy Classifiers (LC), Support Vector Machine, etc., depend on the type and nature of the attributes in the data set. The wrong selection of classification technique can certainly lead to wrong results and poor performance. This concept is the motivation behind this study. Usually the data set consists of nominal attributes, numeric attributes or mix attributes (both numeric and nominal attribute). In this paper, different types of data sets are applied on three most popular classification techniques, such as, NB, DT, and LC, to evaluate their performances. Findings: The result reveals that NB classifier performs well on both mix attribute data and numeric data but decision tree classifier performs better on nominal attribute data.

A main challenge we address is the extraction of informative features from raw mouse tracking data. We do so in two complementary ways: First, we manually construct expert-recommended informative features, aiming to identify abnormalities in motor behaviors. Second, we use an unsupervised representation learning technique to map these raw data to high-level features. Using all the extracted features, a Random Forest classifier is then used to distinguish PD patients from controls, achieving an AUC of 0.92, while results using only expert-generated or auto-generated features are 0.87 and 0.83, respectively.

Therefore, early detection and timely management is required to alleviate ecosystem consequences of invasion. Integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data can deliver spatially explicit information on invader occurrence and ecosystem transformations even at early stages of invasion. However, relevant \u201cmodel invaders\u201d and well-characterized ecosystems need to be identified to both increase predictive power of invasion theory and prioritize management. In addition, there is still a knowledge gap regarding sensor-based approaches that are valid in space and time to assess the impact of invasive engineers on ecosystem functioning as well as the potential to induce regime shifts. In this study, occurrence and spatio-temporal impact of the invasive N2-fixing shrub, Acacia longifolia, was assessed in a heterogeneous, Mediterranean dune ecosystem. The invader was mapped using vegetation indices derived from airborne hyperspectral images as well as airborne LiDAR data using Random Forest classification with a Sensitivity of 0.79, a Positive Predicted Value (PPV) of 0.81, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.77. Invaded sites varied between early stages with low cover, where isolated patches were detected, to heavily infested A. longifolia thickets. Analysis of historical images showed that the invader could establish under the harsh conditions of open dune plains, possibly triggered by human interference. The recently developed Near-Infrared Vegetation Index (NIRV), which is related to Gross Primary Production (GPP), increased linearly and significantly with increasing invader cover. This indicated a GPP-related regime shift induced by the invader, changing ecosystem productivity representative of open shrublands to that of forests. Such a shift could even be identified at early stages of invasion. Thus, the NIRV index may provide an appropriate sensor-based \u201cmodel metric\u201d to assess impacts of invasive engineers.

In contrast to many related approaches, knowledge about the persons in a given video is not assumed in advance. Adaboost is employed after an initial clustering of faces to select the best features describing a person?s face.

Parsing of input text of any human language is a part of NLP. This parsing technique requires processing of text on a word by word basis. To process any individual word especially in Sanskrit and all Dravidian languages, Sandhi splitting is a major task. Sandhi is also called Morphophonemics concerned with changes that occur when two words or separate morphemes come together to form a new word. Exact splitting point is essential for text processing tasks such as POS tagging and in turn parsing. We have adopted a novel approach to internal Sandhi splitting technique on Kannada language. Each Kannada word is split into morphemes according to valid morph patterns. After the division of each word into lexical morphemes, we have manually tagged each split word into root-begins, root-continuous and suffix. This work has been done on Kannada language. We have trained the system with a list of 1000 tagged words using a CRF (Conditional Random Fields) tool and nearly 400 raw split words (untagged words) are given as input to the CRF tool. The system generates a list of tagged split words for the given input according to the trained data. The system output has been compared with the manually tagged data. We have verified the data using 5 fold test, which takes five different combinations of trained data (1000 words) and test data (400 words). The average Precision, Recall and F-Measure of Tagging accuracy of CRF model for Kannada corpus in 5 fold test are nearly equal to 98.08, 92.91 and 95.43.

Conventional caricature generation approaches mainly use low-level geometric transformations such as image warping to generate exaggerated images, which lack richness and diversity in terms of content and style. The recent progress in generative adversarial networks (GANs) makes it possible to learn an image-to-image transformation from data, so that richer contents and styles can be generated. However, directly applying the GAN-based models to this task leads to unsatisfactory results because there is a large variance in the caricature distribution. Moreover, some models require strictly paired training data which largely limits their usage scenarios. In this paper, we propose CariGAN overcome these problems. Instead of training on paired data, CariGAN learns transformations only from weakly paired images. Specifically, to enforce reasonable exaggeration and facial deformation, facial landmarks are adopted as an additional condition to constrain the generated image. Furthermore, an attention mechanism is introduced to encourage our model to focus on the key facial parts so that more vivid details in these regions can be generated. Finally, a Diversity Loss is proposed to encourage the model to produce diverse results to help alleviate the `mode collapse' problem of the conventional GAN-based models. Extensive experiments on a new large-scale `WebCaricature' dataset show that the proposed CariGAN can generate more plausible caricatures with larger diversity compared with the state-of-the-art models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.00445", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2899128781", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10813652", "12665596", "2057420", "44220142", "9957731", "201767411", "7665292", "10319651", "5002792", "84591", "39082954", "5906785", "5216145", "1033682", "6447277", "4883312", "17602020", "5808102", "6200260", "45987025", "8239952", "60796138", "8785311", "4591836", "11158971", "15864069", "1573008", "30484693", "3355038", "205514", "3345317", "12803511", "3366315", "2959122", "11758569", "1563370", "6016920", "6230637", "21011865", "1504491", "14083350", "16432499", "1082740", "11495787", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["53998398", "210023631", "212725373", "210164394", "214641314", "53751435"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53185647"}

Motor Imagery EEG (MI-EEG) not only has a close correlation with the human imagination and movement intention but also contains a large amount of physiological or disease information. As a result, it has been fully studied in the field of rehabilitation. To correctly interpret and accurately extract the features of MI-EEG signals, many nonlinear dynamic methods based on entropy, such as Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), Fuzzy Entropy (FE), and Permutation Entropy (PE), have been proposed and exploited continuously in recent years. However, these entropy-based methods can only measure the complexity of MI-EEG based on a single scale and therefore fail to account for the multiscale property inherent in MI-EEG. To solve this problem, Multiscale Sample Entropy (MSE), Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MPE), and Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy (MFE) are developed by introducing scale factor. However, MFE has not been widely used in analysis of MI-EEG, and the same parameter values are employed when the MFE method is used to calculate the fuzzy entropy values on multiple scales. Actually, each coarse-grained MI-EEG carries the characteristic information of the original signal on different scale factors. It is necessary to optimize MFE parameters to discover more feature information. In this paper, the parameters of MFE are optimized independently for each scale factor, and the improved MFE (IMFE) is applied to the feature extraction of MI-EEG. Based on the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon, IMFE features from multi channels are fused organically to construct the feature vector. Experiments are conducted on a public dataset by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. The experiment results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed method yields relatively high classification accuracy compared with other entropy-based and classical time\u2013frequency\u2013space feature extraction methods.

The wavelet analysis-support vector machine coupled model (WA-SVM) was evaluated for 1, 3 and 6 months ahead rainfall forecasting. The coupled model was obtained by combining the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Monthly rainfall data from the Qilian, Yeniugou and Tuole stations in Qilian Mountains, China were used to optimize the model. By comparing the model output with the observed data on the basis of the coefficient of correlation (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), it was found that the performances of WA-SVM models for 1, 3 and 6-month ahead rainfall forecasting were good, and the models have forecasted the rainfall values with reasonable accuracy in all the statistical indices during testing period. Relative to the performance of regular SVM models, we show that the WA-SVM model demonstrates superior accuracy among the SVM models in forecasting rainfall at all tested lead times, probably due to a wavelet transform effect on the SVM predictive ability. The WA-SVM model was also compared with conventional ANN models, and the WA-SVM model was found to be significantly superior.

The Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is a recently proposed continuous metaheuristic that was claimed to give promising results. However, its potential in binary problems has been vaguely investigated. The use of mapping techniques to adapt metaheuristics to handle binary optimisation problems is a widely-used approach, but these techniques are still fuzzy and misunderstood, since no work thoroughly studied them for a given problem or algorithm. This paper conducts a consistent and systematic study to assess the efficiency of the FPA and the common mapping techniques. This is done through proposing four Binary variants of the FPA (BFPA) that have been got by applying the principal mapping techniques existing in the literature. As benchmark problem; an NP-hard binary one in advanced cellular networks, the Antenna Positioning Problem (APP), is used. In order to assess the scalability, efficiency and robustness of the proposed BFPAs, the experiments have been carried out on realistic, synthetic and random data with different dimensions, and several statistical tests have been carried. Two of the top-ranked algorithms designed to solve the APP; the Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) and the Differential Evolution algorithm (DE), are taken as a comparison basis. The results showed that the normalisation and angle modulation are the best mapping techniques. The experiments also showed that the BFPAs have some shortcomings but, they could outperform the PBIL in 4 out of 13 instances and the DE in 6 out of 13 instances and no statistical difference was found in the remaining instances. Besides, the BFPAs outperformed or gave competitive technical results compared to the PBIL and DE in all problem instances.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2016.05.051", "venue": "Appl.

In our study, information regarding the potential of machine learning and data mining within a large set of horses and breeds is presented. The individual assignment methods and factors influencing the success rate of the procedure are compared at the Czech population scale. The fixation index values ranged from 0.057 (HMS1) to 0.144 (HTG6), and the overall genetic differentiation amounted to 8.9% among the breeds. The highest genetic divergence (FST = 0.378) was established between the Friesian and Equus przewalskii; the highest degree of gene migration was obtained between the Czech and Bavarian Warmblood (Nm = 14,302); and the overall global heterozygote deficit across the populations was 10.4%. The eight standard methods (Bayesian, frequency, and distance) using GeneClass software and almost all mainstream classification algorithms (Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, IB1, IB5, KStar, JRip, J48, Random Forest, Random Tree, PART, MLP, and SVM) from the WEKA machine learning workbench were compared by utilizing 314,874 real allelic data sets. The Bayesian method (GeneClass, 89.9%) and Bayesian network algorithm (WEKA, 84.8%) outperformed the other techniques. The breed genomic prediction accuracy reached the highest value in the cold-blooded horses. The overall proportion of individuals correctly assigned to a population depended mainly on the breed number and genetic divergence. These statistical tools could be used to assess breed traceability systems, and they exhibit the potential to assist managers in decision-making as regards breeding and registration.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30963515", "doi": "10.1007/s13353-019-00495-x", "venue": "Journal of Applied Genetics", "journal": "Journal of Applied Genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2937145489", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["85974802", "10065643", "34849608", "10137094", "22335287", "55639915", "20874178", "90025234", "25541557", "11662278", "40172118", "45765028", "2769148", "24754166", "55212907", "19375743", "19567426", "42406954", "29588357", "34590303", "3279959", "27383197", "25776992", "83888000", "39503469", "20880072", "20329581"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:102353575"}

The edge weights between a topic and a text document represent level of \"affinity\" between them.

This significantly minimizes the level of supervision needed as only a few topics are observed to be enough for achieving sufficiently high accuracy. The Label Propagation Algorithm is employed on this enriched graph to propagate labels among the nodes.

In this work we address this problem by super-resolving document images using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We propose a super resolution based preprocessing step that can enhance the accuracies of the OCRs (including the commercial ones). Our method is specially suited for printed document images. We validate the utility in wide variety of document images (where fonts, styles, and languages vary) without any pre-processing step to adapt across situations.

In this paper, we proposed a new method for predicting the cooling load of commercial buildings. The proposed approach employs a Bayesian Network model to relate the cooling load to outdoor weather conditions and internal building activities. The proposed method is computationally efficient and implementable for use in real buildings, as it does not involve sophisticated mathematical theories. In this paper, we described the proposed method and demonstrated its use via a case study. In this case study, we considered three candidate models for cooling load prediction and they are the proposed Bayesian Network model, a Support Vector Machine model, and an Artificial Neural Network model. We trained the three models with fourteen different training data datasets, each of which had varying amounts and quality of data that were sampled on-site. The prediction results for a testing week shows that the Bayesian Network model achieves similar accuracy as the Support Vector Machine model but better accuracy than the Artificial Neural Network model.

The results also suggest that all three models will have much larger prediction deviations if the testing data points are not covered by the training dataset for the studied case (The maximum absolute deviation of the predictions that are not covered by the training dataset can be up to seven times larger than that of the predictions covered by the training dataset).

Two long term goals for psychological research are to understand how these theories are mentally represented, and how they are acquired. We argue that the language of thought hypothesis can help to address both questions. First, compositional languages can capture the content of intuitive theories. Second, any compositional language will generate an account of theory learning which predicts that theories with short descriptions tend to be preferred. We describe a computational framework that captures both ideas, and compare its predictions to behavioral data from a simple theory learning task. Any comprehensive account of human knowledge must acknowledge two principles. First, everyday knowledge is more than a list of isolated facts, and much of it appears to be organized into richly structured systems that are sometimes called intuitive theories. Even young children, for instance, have systematic beliefs about domains including folk physics, folk biology, and folk psychology [10]. Second, some aspects of these theories appear to be learned. Developmental psychologists have explored how intuitive theories emerge over the first decade of life, and at least some of these changes appear to result from learning. Although theory learning raises some challenging problems, two computational principles that may support this ability have been known for many years. First, a theory-learning system must be able to represent the content of any theory that it acquires. A learner that cannot represent a given system of concepts is clearly unable to learn this system from data. Second, there will always be many systems of concepts that are compatible with any given data set, and a learner must rely on some a priori ordering of the set of possible theories to decide which candidate is best [5, 9]. Loosely speaking, this ordering can be identified with a simplicity measure, or a prior distribution over the space of possible theories. There is at least one natural way to connect these two computational principles. Suppose that intuitive theories are represented in a \u201clanguage of thought:\u201d a language that allows complex concepts to be represented as combinations of simpler concepts [5]. A compositional language provides a straightforward way to construct sophisticated theories, but also provides a natural ordering over the resulting space of theories: the a priori probability of a theory can be identified with its length in this representation language [3, 7]. Combining this prior distribution with an engine for Bayesian inference immediately leads to a computational account of how theories might be learned. There may be other ways to explain how people represent and acquire complex systems of knowledge, but it is striking that the \u201clanguage of thought\u201d hypothesis can help to explain both knowledge representation and learning. This paper describes a computational framework that helps to explain how theories are acquired, and that can be used to evaluate different proposals about the language of thought. Our approach builds on previous discussions of concept learning that have explored the link between compositional representations and inductive inference. Two recent approaches propose that concepts are represented in a form of propositional logic, and that the a priori plausibility of an inductive hypothesis is related to the length of its representation in this language [4, 6]. Our approach is similar in spirit, but is motivated in part by the need for languages that are richer than propositional logic. The framework we present is extremely general, and is compatible with virtually any representation language, including various forms of predicate logic. Methods for learning predicate logic theories have previously been explored in the field of Inductive Logic Programming, and we recently proposed a theory-learning model that is inspired by this tradition [7]. Our current approach is motivated by similar goals, but is better able to account for the discovery of abstract theoretical laws. The next section describes our computational framework, and introduces a specific logical language that we will consider throughout. Our framework allows relatively sophisticated theories to be represented and learned, but we evaluate it here by applying it to a simple learning problem, and comparing its predictions with human inductive inferences. A Bayesian approach to theory discovery Suppose that a learner observes some of the relationships that hold among a fixed, finite set of entities, and wishes to discover a theory that accounts for these data. Suppose, for instance, that the entities are thirteen adults from a remote tribe (a through m), and that the data specify that the spouse relation (S(\u00b7, \u00b7)) is true of some pairs (Figure 1). One candidate theory states that S(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a symmetric relation, that some of the individuals are male (M(\u00b7)), that marriages are permitted only between males and non-males, and that males may take multiple spouses but non-males may have only one spouse (Figure 1b). Other theories are possible, including the theory which states only that S(\u00b7, \u00b7) is symmetric. Accounts of theory learning should distinguish between at least three kinds of entities: theories, models, and data. A theory is a set of statements that captures constraints on the possible configurations of the world. For instance, the theory in Figure 1b rules out configurations where the spouse", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["1214793", "10095775", "6957154", "14829127", "34910792"], "inbound_citations": ["7932113", "7676027", "15763448", "29166253", "10138677", "7586912", "8903199", "51764369", "13500499", "14474967", "212598296", "11081620", "540206", "1254710", "18245695", "51273294"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5878899"}

Over the past decade, robust subspace learning based methods addressed the moving objects detection problem with excellent performance. However, the moving objects detected by these methods are incomplete, unable to generate the occluded parts. Indeed, complete or occlusion-free moving object detection is still challenging for these methods. In the current work, we address this challenge by proposing a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) conditioned on non-occluded moving object pixels during training. It therefore learns the subspace spanned by the moving objects covering all the dynamic variations and semantic information.

Based on complex ecological databases, computationally advanced species distribution models can provide great progress for solving this ecological problem. However, current lack of knowledge about the ecological relationships that drive species distributions reduces the capacity for classical statistical approaches to produce accurate predictive maps. Advancements in machine learning, like classification and bagging algorithms, provide a powerful tool for quickly building accurate predictive models of species distributions even when little ecological knowledge is readily available. Such approaches are also well known for their robustness when dealing with large data sets that have low quality. Here, we used Random Forests (Salford System\u2019s Ltd. and R language), a highly accurate bagging classification algorithm originally developed by L. Breiman and A. Cutler, to build multi-species avian distribution models using data collected as part of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Long-term Ecological Monitoring Program (LTEMP). Distribution maps are a useful monitoring metric because they can be used to document range expansions or contractions and can also be linked to population estimates. We utilized variable radius point count data collected in 2004 and 2006 at 255 points arranged in a 4.8 km resolution, systematic grid spanning the 7722 km2 spatial extent of Alaska\u2019s Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. We built distribution models for 40 bird species that are present within 200m of 2\u201356% of the sampling points resulting in models that represent species which are both rare and common on the landscape. All models were built using a common set of 157 environmental predictor variables representing topographical features, climatic space, vegetation, anthropogenic variables, spatial structure, and 5 randomly generated neutral landscape variables for quality assessment. Models with that many predictors have not been used before in avian modeling, but are commonly used in similar types of applications in commercial disciplines. Random Forests produced strong models (ROC >0.8) for 16 bird species, marginal models (0.7 >ROC <0.8) for 13 species, and weak models (ROC <0.7) for 11 species. The ability of Random Forests to provide accurate predictive models was independent of how common or rare a bird was on the landscape. Random Forests did not rank any of the 5 neutral landscape variables as important for any of the 41 bird species. We argue that for inventory and monitoring programs the interpretive focus and confidence in reliability should be placed in the predictive ability of the map, and not in the assumed ecological meaning of the predictors or their linear relationships to the response variable. Given this focus, computer learning algorithms would provide a very powerful, cost-saving approach for building reliable predictions of species occurrence on the landscape given the current lack of knowledge on the ecological drivers for many species. Land management agencies need reliable predictions of current species distributions in order to detect and understand how climate change and other landscape drivers will affect future biodiversity.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-78534-7_9", "venue": "Applications of Computational Intelligence in Biology", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1571991676", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["140599977", "8338177", "91146873", "73679041", "8629204", "40380942", "18040154", "63211430", "16123424", "19357818", "135230623", "57757891", "14538686"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42805508"}

It aims at assigning a label to each image pixel and needs significant number of pixellevel annotated data, which is often unavailable. To address this lack, in this paper, we leverage, on one hand, massive amount of available unlabeled or weakly labeled data, and on the other hand, non-real images created through Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we propose a semi-supervised framework ,based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which consists of a generator network to provide extra training examples to a multi-class classifier, acting as discriminator in the GAN framework, that assigns sample a label y from the K possible classes or marks it as a fake sample (extra class). The underlying idea is that adding large fake visual data forces real samples to be close in the feature space, enabling a bottom-up clustering process, which, in turn, improves multiclass pixel classification. To ensure higher quality of generated images for GANs with consequent improved pixel classification, we extend the above framework by adding weakly annotated data, i.e., we provide class level information to the generator. We tested our approaches on several challenging benchmarking visual datasets, i.e. PASCAL, SiftFLow, Stanford and CamVid, achieving competitive performance also compared to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1703.09695", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2603089249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206766608", "13813737", "1996665", "1613420", "63925014", "206765110", "1033682", "17448963", "1281207", "11816781", "17206794", "56507745", "16991836", "12803511", "6371883", "623137", "3035960", "6679306", "11758569", "1687220", "15939599", "16737710", "6230637", "15038672", "40821847", "9901727", "1309931"], "inbound_citations": ["49656491", "53232701", "6385314", "197679574", "3456798", "57189209", "210693731", "53850453", "85543383", "202541709", "52896796", "52155996", "198162144", "201809922", "53038351", "3947701", "210985839", "211836243", "145827071", "201878896", "1407794", "3680335", "198355884", "198895255", "198181243", "202719505", "3991336"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9775470"}

General supervised metric learning methods are designed to learn a discriminative metric that can pull all the within-class data points close enough, while pushing all the data points with different class labels far away. In this paper, we propose a Discriminative Low-rank Metric Learning method (DLML), where the metric matrix and data representation coefficients are both constrained to be low-rank. Therefore, our approach can not only dig out the redundant features with a low-rank metric, but also discover the global data structure by seeking a low-rank representation. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised regularizer to preserve more discriminative information. Different from traditional metric learning methods, our approach aims to seek low-rank metric matrix and low-rank representation in a discriminative low-dimensional subspace at the same time.

Unilaterally affected patients underwent barefoot 3D-gait analyses. Gait pattern clusters were created based on the ankle and knee angle and ankle moment shown in midstance of the affected limb. Impairment clusters were created based on plantarflexor and knee-extensor strength, and ankle and knee joint range-of-motion. The association between gait patterns and underlying impairments were examined descriptively. The Random Forest Algorithm and regression analyses were used to predict gait patterns and parameters. Seven gait patterns in 73 polio survivors were identified, with two dominant patterns: one with a mildly/non-deviant ankle angle, ankle moment and knee angle (n = 23), and one with a strongly deviant ankle angle and a mildly/non-deviant ankle moment and knee angle (n = 18). Gait pattern prediction from underlying impairments was 49% accurate with best prediction performance for the second dominant gait pattern (sensitivity 78% and positive predictive value 74%). The underlying impairments explained between 20 and 32% of the variance in individual gait parameters. Polio survivors with calf muscle weakness who present a similar impairment profile do not necessarily walk the same. From physical examination alone, the gait pattern nor the individual gait parameters could be accurately predicted.

The importance of kernel has motivated many studies on its composition. It\u2019s well-known that reproducing kernel (R.K) is a useful kernel function which possesses many properties, e.g. positive definiteness, reproducing property and composing complex R.K by simple operation. There are two popular ways to compute the R.K with explicit form. One is to construct and solve a specific differential equation with boundary value whose handicap is incapable of obtaining a unified form of R.K. The other is using a piecewise integral of the Green function associated with a differential operator L. The latter benefits the computation of a R.K with a unified explicit form and theoretical analysis, whereas there are relatively later studies and fewer practical computations. In this paper, a new algorithm for computing a R.K is presented. It can obtain the unified explicit form of R.K in general reproducing kernel Hilbert space. It avoids constructing and solving the complex differential equations manually and benefits an automatic, flexible and rigorous computation for more general RKHS. In order to validate that the R.K computed by the algorithm can be used in SVM well, some illustrative examples and a comparison between R.K and Gaussian kernel (RBF) in support vector regression are presented. The result shows that the performance of R.K is close or slightly superior to that of RBF.

We employ transition-based parsing with models learned using Support Vector Machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), and our experiments are carried out on French. Transition-based parsing is very fast due to the computational efficiency of its underlying algorithms, which are based on a local optimization of attachment decisions. Our first research thread is thus to increase the syntactic context used. From the arc-eager transition system (Nivre, 2008) we propose a variant that simultaneously considers multiple candidate governors for right-directed attachments. We also test parse correction, inspired by Hall and Novak (2005), which revises each attachment in a parse by considering multiple alternative governors in the local syntactic neighborhood. We find that multiple-candidate approaches slightly improve parsing accuracy overall as well as for prepositional phrase attachment and coordination, two linguistic phenomena that exhibit high syntactic ambiguity. Our second research thread explores semi-supervised approaches for improving parsing accuracy and coverage. We test self-training within the journalistic domain as well as for adaptation to the medical domain, using a two-stage parsing approach based on that of McClosky et al. (2006). We then turn to lexical modeling over a large corpus: we model generalized lexical classes to reduce data sparseness, and prepositional phrase attachment preference to improve disambiguation. We find that semi-supervised approaches can sometimes improve parsing accuracy and coverage, without increasing time complexity.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "410894260", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29872247"}

Since these annoying artifacts greatly decrease image visual quality, deblurring algorithms have been proposed from various aspects. However, most energy-optimization-based algorithms rely heavily on blur kernel priors, and some learning-based methods either adopt pixel-wise loss function or ignore global structural information. Therefore, we propose an image deblurring algorithm based on a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN), in which the scale-recurrent generator extracts sequence spatio\u2013temporal features and reconstructs sharp images in a coarse-to-fine scheme. To thoroughly evaluate the global and local generator performance, we further propose a receptive field recurrent discriminator. Besides, the discriminator takes blurry images as conditions, which helps to differentiate reconstructed images from real sharp ones. Last but not least, since the gradients are vanishing when training the generator with the output of the discriminator, a progressive loss function is proposed to enhance the gradients in back propagation and to take full advantage of discriminative features.

It is the major contributor to overall global burden of disease. Any deterioration in brain functioning is reflected in Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG signals are highly complex, nonstationary and nonlinear. So, it is very difficult to analyze visually and identify changes in the waveform in order to classify MDD and normal subjects. Thus, computerized quantitative EEG is used for the analysis of signals. Support Vector Machine (SVM) using band power feature reported an accuracy of 98.33% and using Kernel Eigen-Filter-Bank Common Spatial Patterns (KEFB-CSP) gave an accuracy of 91.67% [1, 2]. Logistic Regression (LR) using band power feature reported an accuracy of 98.33%, using 4 nonlinear features combination provided an accuracy of 90%, using wavelet transform provided an accuracy of 87.5% and using only alpha power gave an accuracy of 73.3% [1, 3, 4]. Naive Bayesian (NB) using band power feature provided an accuracy of 96.8% [1]. Artificial Neural Network using Relative Wavelet Energy (RWE) reported an accuracy of 98.11%, using power spectrum feature gave accuracy of 84% and using Lep\u2013Ziv complexity accuracy of 60\u201380% was reported [5, 6, 7]. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) reported an accuracy of 91.2% using SASI (Spectral Asymmetry Index) and DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) [8]. Decision Tree provided an accuracy of 80% using EEG band power as feature [9]. The study reveals that, in general, high classification accuracy is achieved by SVM, LR and ANN and highest classification accuracy of 98.33% is achieved by SVM. Highest accuracy is achieved by SVM because it is more robust and computationally more efficient due to maximal margin gap between separating hyper planes and kernel trick. The study gives some ideas which could be helpful for guiding and improving future researches. Since linear and nonlinear method for feature extraction are both equally efficient. So any of the linear/nonlinear feature can be used. For feature selection and reduction, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can be used. Since SVM, LR and ANN give high classification accuracy and any of them can be used or any hybrid technique like GA-SVM, GA-ANN can be used. This chapter compares various EEG signal analysis techniques, compares their accuracy and methodology used and finally recommends the most suitable technique based on the accuracy for detection of depression.

{"paper_id": "14476900", "title": "Grammar-based Natural Language Understanding", "authors": [{"first": "Gertjan", "middle": ["van"], "last": "Noord", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This chapter describes the grammar-based natural language understanding (NLU) component of the OVIS system. The NLU component receives its input from the speech recognizer and passes the result of linguistic analysis on to the pragmatic interpretation component. The output of the speech recognizer is a word graph, which represents all different hypotheses for the spoken input from the user. Linguistic analysis of such a structure is more complicated than analysis for a single input sentence (cf. linguistic analysis for written input), as we will show later. The interface between the NLU component and the Dialogue Manager is defined by a special interface language, called the Update Language, described elsewhere. In the design of the NLU component, the following problems must be addressed. Firstly, a NLU component will be faced with ambiguity. The combination of lexical and structural ambiguities often leads to an enormous amount of possible readings for an input utterance. In ovis this problem is even more acute because of the use of word graphs. Techniques must be available to be able to deal with large numbers of analyses, and to be able to choose the most appropriate reading from such a set of candidate analyses. While the system must somehow deal with large numbers of analyses, many of which may eventually turn out to be useless, another requirement is that the system should be robust, i.e. it should do something useful even if something happens that the system didn\u2019t expect, or if something goes wrong. For example, the input utterance may contain disfluencies or ungrammaticalities. Or the speech recognition component may have failed to recognize part of the user utterance. In such cases, a linguistic analysis component might proceed by computing a partial analysis of the input. NLU needs to be robust for three reasons. Firstly, it is quite difficult to anticipate in the grammar all linguistic constructions that might occur. This is one of the traditional problems for grammar-based NLU. Secondly, spoken language is full of hesitations, corrections, false starts etc. which are not always easy to detect. The third reason is that the utterance that was actually spoken is not guaranteed to be a path in the word graph, due to limitations of state-ofthe-art speech recognition, as well as external factors such as background noise, etc.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "44692324", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["57821518", "67173545", "13841533", "14287805", "2941443", "35664", "31901407", "232808", "199661584", "33098449", "14801993", "57374637", "2133116", "126407971", "14500645", "13350536", "7742946", "16274802", "1566316", "361255", "195703846", "14241519", "59810543", "2271481", "1507164", "17265192", "1104817", "17265192", "53852921"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14476900"}

At the same time, the involvement of Digital Imaging and Communications in ::: Medicine (DICOM) which is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging also encourages precisely the need for image processing in the networks. The evolution of cloud computing and its rapid ::: growth also transform the healthcare system to be easily accessible and faster in processing different services. ::: Our Contributions - In our research, we have focussed on two important aspects. 1) Brain MR Image segmentation using Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA). 2) Performance Evaluation of the proposed algorithm by implementing using Apache Hadoop and Spark in Cloud Services provided by AWS. ::: The first part comprises of various activities accomplished in a particular sequence, i) Pre-processing of the brain MR images, ii) Segmentation of the tumour from MR ::: image, iii) Classification of the tumor. The segmentation process starts with pre-processing of the brain MR image to ::: remove the noise without losing the quality of the images. Therefore, the images become suitable for segmentation with optimum accuracy. Then, the segmentation is carried out using the PGA which has been proved as an efficient methodology in the literature when the search space is huge and complex. The migration operatorwhich has been estimated as one of the important operators is averaged with the ::: proposed methodology to increase the segmentation accuracy. Afterwards, classification of the images is done with Support Vector Machine using the features such as shape and texture to find whether the input image comprises either ::: benign or malignant tumour or not. The Comparative analysis is done on the classified images are examined in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The details are given in the synopsis document. The second part starts with the implementation of the formerly said algorithm and ::: deploying it on cloud-based Apache Hadoop and Spark and the execution time has gone down significantly. We have chosen Apache Spark for partitioning the huge amount of data and to parallelize the tasks so that we can speed up the process of arriving at the result. The execution time is calculated for different sizes of data 2GB, 4GB, 6GB, 8GB ::: and 10GB of image data respectively in Hadoop and Spark. The same sets of data are executed with single, two, three, four and five clusters using Hadoop in Amazon Web Services. Execution time is noted down for each category of clusters ::: count. The same procedure is repeated for Spark and the execution time is recorded for the same set of clusters. The comparison of the execution time in Hadoop and Spark using the proposed algorithm is analysed at the end of the research work.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2556350762", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63251232"}

The solutions of the final best population provides different diverse set of classifiers; some are effective with respect to recall whereas some are effective with respect to precision. In the second stage we propose a novel technique for classifier ensemble for combining these classifiers. The approach is very general and can be applied for any classification problem.

With the advancement in satellite imagery as well as cloud storage and computing, the capability now exists to conduct planetary-scale analysis, including mapping of rangeland indicators. Combined with recent investments in the collection of large amounts of in situ data in the western U.S., new approaches using machine learning can enable prediction of surface conditions at times and places when no in situ data are available. However, little analysis has yet been done on how the temporal relevancy of training data influences model performance. Here, we have leveraged the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest, after comparison with other candidates) to identify the potential impact of different sampling times (across months and years) on estimation of rangeland indicators from the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs. Our results indicate that temporally relevant training data improves predictions, though the training data need not be from the exact same month and year for a prediction to be temporally relevant. Moreover, inclusion of training data from the time when predictions are desired leads to lower prediction error but the addition of training data from other times does not contribute to overall model error. Using all of the available training data can lead to biases, toward the mean, for times when indicator values are especially high or low. However, for mapping purposes, limiting training data to just the time when predictions are desired can lead to poor predictions of values outside the spatial range of the training data for that period. We conclude that the best Random Forest prediction maps will use training data from all possible times with the understanding that estimates at the extremes will be biased.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2019.111521", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2987982347", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210271640"}

However, several standard learning algorithms, such as kernel-based algorithms, e.g., Support Vector Machines, Kernel Ridge Regression, Kernel PCA, do not easily scale to such orders of magnitude. This thesis focuses on sampling-based matrix approximation techniques that help scale kernel-based algorithms to large-scale datasets. We address several fundamental theoretical and empirical questions including: (1) What approximation should be used? We discuss two common sampling-based methods, providing novel theoretical insights regarding their suitability for various applications and experimental results motivated by this theory. Our results show that one of these methods, the Nystrom method, is superior in the context of large-scale learning. (2) Do these approximations work in practice? We show the effectiveness of approximation techniques on a variety of problems. In the largest study to-date for manifold learning, we use the Nystrom method to extract low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data to effectively cluster face images. We also report good empirical results for Kernel Ridge Regression and Kernel Logistic Regression. (3) How should we sample columns? A key aspect of sampling-based algorithms is the distribution according to which columns are sampled. We study both fixed and adaptive sampling schemes as well as a promising ensemble technique that can be easily parallelized and generates superior approximations, both in theory and in practice. (4) How well do these approximations work in theory? We provide theoretical analyses of the Nystrom method to understand when this technique should be used. We present guarantees on approximation accuracy based on various matrix properties and analyze the effect of matrix approximation on actual kernel-based algorithms. ::: This work has important consequences for the machine learning community since it extends to large-scale applications the benefits of kernel-based algorithms.

The classical robot control implementation involves an expensive key step of model-based programming. An intuitive way to reduce this expensive exercise is to replace programming with machine learning of robot actions from demonstration where a (learner) robot learns an action by observing a demonstrator robot performing the same. To achieve this learning from demonstration (LFD) different machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Genetic Algorithms, Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines, etc. can be used. This piece of work focuses exclusively on ANNs. Since ANNs have many standard architectural variations divided into two basic computational categories namely the recurrent networks and feed-forward networks, representative networks from each have been selected for study, i.e. Feed Forward Multilayer Perceptron (FF) network for feed-forward networks category and Elman (EL), and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Model (NARX) networks for the recurrent networks category. The main objective of this work is to identify the most suitable neural architecture for application of LFD in learning different robot actions. The sensor and actuator streams of demonstrated action are used as training data for ANN learning. Consequently, the learning capability is measured by comparing the error between demonstrator and corresponding learner streams. To achieve fairness in comparison three steps have been taken. First, Dynamic Time Warping is used to measure the error between demonstrator and learner streams, which gives resilience against translation in time. Second, comparison statistics are drawn between the best, instead of weight-equal, configurations of competing architectures so that learning capability of any architecture is not forced handicap. Third, each configuration's error is calculated as the average of ten trials of all possible learning sequences with random weight initialization so that the error value is independent of a particular sequence of learning or a particular set of initial weights.

In the event of a radiological event, individuals with underlying medical conditions could present with similar symptoms to radiation poisoning, prominently nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and fever. Metabolomics of radiation exposure in mice has provided valuable biomarkers, and in this study we aimed to identify biomarkers of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure to compare and contrast with ionizing radiation. LPS treatment leads to a severe inflammatory response and a cytokine storm, events similar to radiation exposure, and LPS exposure can recapitulate many of the responses seen in sepsis. Urine from control mice, LPS-treated mice, and mice irradiated with 3, 8 and 15 Gy of \u03b3 rays was analyzed by LCMS, and markers were extracted using SIMCA-P(+) and Random Forests. Markers were validated through tandem mass spectrometry against pure chemicals. Five metabolites, cytosine, cortisol, adenine, O-propanoylcarnitine and isethionic acid, showed increased excretion at 24 h after LPS treatment (P < 0.0001, 0.0393, 0.0393, <0.0001 and 0.0004, respectively). Of these, cytosine, adenine and O-propanoylcarnitine showed specificity to LPS treatment when compared to radiation. On the other hand, increased excretion of cortisol after LPS and radiation treatments indicated a rapid systemic response to inflammatory agents. Isethionic acid excretion, however, showed elevated levels not only after LPS treatment but also after a very high dose of radiation (15 Gy), while additional metabolites showed responsiveness to radiation but not LPS. Metabolomics therefore has the potential to distinguish between different inflammatory responses based on differential ion signatures.

Spin-based devices have shown great promise in enabling high-density, energy-efficient memory. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a many-core domain-specific processor for Recognition and Data Mining (RM) using spin-based memory. The RM processor has a two-level on-chip memory hierarchy consisting of a streaming access first-level memory and a random access second-level memory. Based on the memory access characteristics, we suggest the use of Domain Wall Memory (DWM) and Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT MRAM) to realize the first and second levels, respectively. We develop architectural models of DWM and STT MRAM, and use them to evaluate the proposed design and explore various architectural tradeoffs in the RM processor. We evaluate the proposed design by comparing it to a CMOS based design at the same 45nm technology node. For three representative RM algorithms (Support Vector Machines, k-means clustering, and GLVQ classification), the iso-area spin memory based design achieves an energy-delay product improvement of 1.5X -- 3X.

Recently studies have argued on the adequacy of a single representation and proposed context-sensitive approaches, which are capable of extracting multiple node representations for different contexts. This proved to be highly effective in applications such as link prediction and ranking. However, most of these methods rely on additional textual features that require complex and expensive RNNs or CNNs to capture high-level features or rely on a community detection algorithm to identify multiple contexts of a node. In this study we show that in-order to extract high-quality context-sensitive node representations it is not needed to rely on supplementary node features, nor to employ computationally heavy and complex models.

Methods: A lesion mapping was carried out by an experienced neurologist for Turbo Inversion Recovery Magnitude (TIRM) images of individual subjects. Combining this mapping with templates from a neuroanatomic atlas, the TIRM images were segmented into three areas of homogenous tissue types (Lesions, NAGM, and NAWM) after spatial standardization. For each area, a linear Support Vector Machine algorithm was used in multiple local classification analyses to determine the diagnostic accuracy in separating MS patients from healthy controls based on voxel tissue intensity patterns extracted from small spherical subregions of these larger areas. To control for covariates, we also excluded group-specific biases in deformation fields as a potential source of information. Results: Among regions containing lesions a posterior parietal WM area was maximally informative about the clinical status (96% accuracy, p,10 213 ). Cerebellar regions were maximally informative among NAGM areas (84% accuracy, p,10 27 ). A posterior brain region was maximally informative among NAWM areas (91% accuracy, p,10 210 ). Interpretation: We identified regions indicating MS in lesioned, but also NAGM, and NAWM areas.

However, some improvements are still needed to extend the lifetime of these systems. The discipline of PHM (Prognostic and health management) seems like a great solution to help against this problem. The objective is to predict the evolution of the behavior of a system using algorithms to estimate in advance when a fault occurs. This knowledge of the default before its occurrence allows to anticipate a decision, often by using a fault-tolerant control. Different methodologies exist to make a prognostic algorithm: model based, data based or a hybridization between these two previous methodologies. This paper will focus on the data based prognosis, mainly due to the fact that all of the phenomena involved in the degradation of a PEMFC are not yet fully known, thus not yet modeled. The first innovation of this paper concern the use of a new neural network paradigm, the Echo State Network, which is a part of Reservoir Computing methods. This new paradigm gives very interesting results, with a mean average percentage error less than 5% in our study case.

The correlation coefficients (r) of SSC and firmness were 0.8560 and 0.8452, respectively. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of SSC and firmness were 0.4648 and 1.0041, respectively. The overall results showed that SPA can fast and effectively select the optimal wavelengths. The selecting process is simple and does not need abundant parameter debugging. The prediction performance of SPA-LS-SVM model is better than conventional linear PLS model because SPA-LS-SVM model can enough use the linear and non-linear information in pear.

As fish gills are a good biomarker for assessing water quality, the proposed system uses fish gills microscopic images in order to detect water pollution.

Since the shape is the main characteristic of fish gills microscopic images, the proposed system uses shape feature based on edge detection and wavelets transform for classifying the water-quality degree. Furthermore, it implemented Principal Components Analysis (PCA) along with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms for feature extraction and water quality degree classification. The datasets used for experiments were constructed based on real sample images for fish gills.

Vehicle counts and velocities of different car classes are the essential data basis for almost every traffic model. Especially during mass events or catastrophes conventional detection systems do not meet the demands. Thus a more flexible detector has to be used like an airborne camera system. In this paper a combination of a fast edge-based hypothesis generation and a more reliable hypothesis verification using a Support Vector Machine is presented. Due to image sizes of more than 20 megapixels at first the region of interest has to be preselected using a street database. Afterwards the first detection stage of the algorithm generates object hypotheses using especially shaped edge filters. The second detection stage verifies them by extracting the SURF-descriptor of each hypothesis. A Support Vector Machine is used to decide whether the object's descriptor represents a vehicle. It will be shown how the verification stage improves the detection reliability by discarding false positives while preselection and hypothesis generation provides less computation time.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/FISTS.2011.5973598", "venue": "2011 IEEE Forum on Integrated and Sustainable Transportation Systems", "journal": "2011 IEEE Forum on Integrated and Sustainable Transportation Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2160265389", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["18899962", "26644360", "9082654", "15931817", "34669177", "206051397", "461853", "194951"], "inbound_citations": ["123356760"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18279457"}

Current autosegmental approaches successfully capture the intuition that vowel harmony is a dynamic process involving the interaction of a sequence of vowels; still, no theoretical analysis has offered a non-stipulative account of the inconsistent behavior of the so-called \u2018transparent\u2019, or disharmonic, segments. This paper proposes a connectionist processing account of the vowel harmony phenomenon, using data from Hungarian. The strength of this account is that it demonstrates that the same general principle of assimilation which underlies the behavior of the \u2018harmonic\u2019 forms accounts as well for the apparently exceptional \u2018transparent\u2019 cases, without stipulation. The account proceeds in three steps. After presenting the data and current theoretical analyses, the paper describes the model of sequential processing introduced by Jordan (1986), and motivates this as a model of assimilation processes in phonology. The paper then presents the results of a series of parametric studies that were run with this model, using arbitrary bit patterns as stimuli. These results establish certain conditions on assimilation in a network of this type. Finally, these findings are related to the Hungarian data, where the same conditions are shown to predict the correct pattern of behavior for both harmonic and transparent vowels.", "year": 1990, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-94-011-2624-3_14", "venue": null, "journal": "Connection Science", "mag_id": "2098038559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62687943"}

The aims of this paper are to identify issues of the proposed approach demanding further study and to raise the question of how to efficiently incorporate quality indicators, such as the hypervolume into the surrogate model.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1830761.1830839", "venue": "GECCO '10", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2207859038", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12080204", "16952440", "2110475", "15480929", "14335033"], "inbound_citations": ["415467", "110324179", "933545"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15408853"}

However, the online measure device is extremely expensive, and these devices are hard to protect. Meanwhile, there is a delay for these online measure devices. Therefore, the soft sensor technology plays a vital role in measuring the key process variables. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an efficient and simple single layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs) to building an exact soft sensor model. However, unsuitable selected hidden nodes and random parameters will greatly affect the performance of the ELM. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Self-Organizing Extreme Learning Machine (SOELM) algorithm constructed by the biological neuron-glia interaction principle to solve the issue of the ELM. Firstly, the weights between input layer nodes and the CNS are tuned iteratively by the Hebbian learning rule. Then the network structure is adjusted self-organizing by Mutual Information (MI) among different structures of networks. Secondly, the weights between the CNS and output layer nodes are obtained by the ELM. The experimental results based on different UCI data sets prove that the SOELM has a better generalization capability and stability than that of the ELM. Moreover, our proposed method is developed as a soft sensor model for accurately predicting the key variables of the Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) process.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2017.03.011", "venue": "Eng.

Two fundamental problems which are essential for cross-domain ground-based cloud classification are feature representation and similarity measurement. In this paper, we propose an effective feature representation called transfer of local features (TLF), and measurement method called discriminative metric learning (DML). The TLF is a generalized representation framework that can integrate various kinds of local features, e.g., local binary patterns (LBP), local ternary patterns (LTP) and completed LBP (CLBP). In order to handle domain shift, such as variations of illumination, image resolution, capturing location, occlusion and so on, the TLF mines the maximum response in regions to make a stable representation for domain variations. We also propose to learn a discriminant metric, simultaneously. We make use of sample pairs and the relationship among cloud classes to learn the distance metric. Furthermore, in order to improve the practicability of the proposed method, we replace the original cloud images with the convolutional activation maps which are then applied to TLF and DML. The proposed method has been validated on three cloud databases which are collected in China alone, provided by Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS), Meteorological Observation Centre (MOC), and Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP).

This requires past experiences to be encoded and retrieved alongside the contextual schemas in which they occurred. The complementary learning systems theory suggests that these schemas are acquired through gradual learning via the neocortex and rapid learning via the hippocampus. However, it has also been shown that new information matching a preexisting schema can bypass the gradual learning process and be acquired rapidly, suggesting that the separation of memories into schemas is useful for flexible learning. While there are theories of the role of schemas in memory consolidation, we lack a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying this function. For this reason, we created a biologically plausible neural network model of schema consolidation that studies several brain areas and their interactions. The model uses a rate-coded multilayer neural network with contrastive Hebbian learning to learn context-specific tasks. Our model suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex supports context-dependent behaviors by learning representations of schemas. Additionally, sparse random connections in the model from the ventral hippocampus to the hidden layers of the network gate neuronal activity depending on their involvement within the current schema, thus separating the representations of new and prior schemas. Contrastive Hebbian learning may function similarly to oscillations in the hippocampus, alternating between clamping and unclamping the output layer of the network to drive learning. Lastly, the model shows the vital role of neuromodulation, as a neuromodulatory area detects the certainty of whether new information is consistent with prior schemas and modulates the speed of memory encoding accordingly.

Thus our objectives were to determine the risk of aortic dissection based on initial cross-sectional imaging data and clinical variables and to isolate predictors of aortic intervention in those initially prescribed serial surveillance imaging. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: From January 1995 to January 2014, 1,181 patients with bicuspid aortic valve underwent cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to ascertain sinus or tubular ascending aortic diameter greater than or equal to 4.7 cm. Random Forest classification was used to identify risk factors for aortic dissection, and among patients undergoing surveillance, time-related analysis was used to identify risk factors for aortic intervention. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Prevalence of type A dissection that was detected by imaging or was found at operation or on follow-up was 5.3% (n = 63). Probability of type A dissection increased gradually at a sinus diameter of 5.0 cm--from 4.1% to 13% at 7.2 cm--and then increased steeply at an ascending aortic diameter of 5.3 cm--from 3.8% to 35% at 8.4 cm--corresponding to a cross-sectional area to height ratio of 10 cm(2)/m for sinuses of Valsalva and 13 cm(2)/m for the tubular ascending aorta. Cross-sectional area to height ratio was the best predictor of type A dissection (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Early prophylactic ascending aortic replacement in patients with bicuspid aortic valve should be considered at high-volume aortic centers to reduce the high risk of preventable type A dissection in those with aortas larger than approximately 5.0 cm or with a cross-sectional area to height ratio greater than approximately 10 cm(2)/m.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5166604", "pubmed_id": "26209494", "doi": "10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.04.126", "venue": "The Annals of thoracic surgery", "journal": "The Annals of thoracic surgery", "mag_id": "2116227411", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["160012585", "4882716", "2197187", "4037625", "51673372", "25756786", "3677329", "109940591", "47003017", "51660657", "3824415", "33745620", "59336047", "78093412", "4476029", "8345349", "3710178"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31887708"}

EchoPrint actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to \"illuminate\" the user's face and authenticates the user by the unique features extracted from the echoes bouncing off the 3D facial contour. To combat changes in phone-holding poses thus echoes, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to extract reliable acoustic features, which are further combined with visual facial landmark locations to feed a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for final authentication.

Rate-optimal procedures such as Tukey's median and other estimators based on statistical depth functions are impractical because of their computational intractability. In this paper, we establish an intriguing connection between f-GANs and various depth functions through the lens of f-Learning. Similar to the derivation of f-GAN, we show that these depth functions that lead to rate-optimal robust estimators can all be viewed as variational lower bounds of the total variation distance in the framework of f-Learning. This connection opens the door of computing robust estimators using tools developed for training GANs. In particular, we show that a JS-GAN that uses a neural network discriminator with at least one hidden layer is able to achieve the minimax rate of robust mean estimation under Huber's $\\epsilon$-contamination model. Interestingly, the hidden layers for the neural net structure in the discriminator class is shown to be necessary for robust estimation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1810.02030", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2895204589", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["117000403", "11168627", "2057420", "49473438", "14197727", "463216", "8248836", "11918854", "18596643", "3754949", "2450207", "44166256", "122558964", "121956954", "19028869", "9127770", "28477212", "88514453", "5575601", "1033682", "121454339", "49350351", "49671009", "5750830", "61818735", "536962", "3347065", "117427178", "31204957", "4053393", "116663483", "3366315", "121275223", "12435394", "1292495", "107645", "13663890", "122104450", "11758569", "38724501", "1687220", "115312154", "53590276", "59376554", "120539623"], "inbound_citations": ["148572056", "59600077", "209323956", "118649017", "67877082"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52918570"}

In this study, airborne lidar and plot-based data were collected from a 5 000 ha study site within Green Hills State Forest, a Pinus radiata D.Don plantation in southern New South Wales, Australia. A series of area-based lidar metrics were extracted and modelled against four inventory attributes (mean tree height, stem density, basal area and stand volume) obtained from 63 ground plots. For all response variables, regression tree models had the best model fit compared to Random Forest and Bayesian Model Averaging modelling techniques. The best regression tree models were based on the lidar metrics: the 5th and 95th height percentiles, minimum vegetation height, density of non-ground returns and a measure of spatial variation, the rumple index. All these metrics can be easily derived from the lidar data. The best regression tree models for each inventory attribute produced the following R2 values: for mean tree height (m), R2 = 0.94; stocking (trees ha-1), R2 = 0.85; basal area (m2 ha-1), R2 = 0.81 and for stand volume, R2 = 0.81 (m3 ha-1) while the corresponding relative RMSEs were 5.8%, 23.4%, 15.5% and 22.3%, respectively.

On the other hand, it has been proved that extending the feature space can effectively improve the classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposed a modified multi-classification algorithm called Feature-Extended Directed Acyclic Graph Least Square Twin Support Vector Machine (FEDAG-LSTSVM). The new algorithm combined all the initial features and their random combinations to establish coupling and redundancy for every feature, and then constructed the Separable Metric (SM) as classification measurement to arrange the structure sequencing of DAG-LSTSVM.

Thus, its failure will cause a significant portion of the network to fail. Overload is one of the common causes of failure since the controller is frequently invoked by new flows. Even through SDN controllers are often replicated, the significant recovery time can be an overkill for the availability of the entire network. In order to overcome the problem of the overloaded controller failure in SDN, this paper proposes a novel controller offload solution for failure mitigation based on a prediction module that anticipates the presence of a harmful long-term load. In fact, the long-standing load would eventually overwhelm the controller leading to a possible failure. To predict whether the load in the controller is short-term or long-term load, we used three different classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Support Vector Machine algorithm is applicable for detecting the type of load with an accuracy of 97.93% in a real-time scenario.

Traditionally, active-set methods have been used rather than interior point methods, due to the Hessian in the standard dual formulation being completely dense. But as active-set methods are essentially sequential, they may not be adequate for machine learning challenges of the future. Additionally, training time may be limited, or data may grow so large that cluster-computing approaches need to be considered. Interior point methods have the potential to answer these concerns directly. They scale efficiently, they can provide good early approximations, and they are suitable for parallel and multi-core environments. To apply them to SVM training, it is necessary to address directly the most computationally expensive aspect of the algorithm. We therefore present an exact reformulation of the standard linear SVM training optimization problem that exploits separability of terms in the objective. By so doing, per-iteration computational complexity is reduced from O (n3) to O (n). We show how this reformulation can be applied to many machine learning problems in the SVM family. Implementation issues relating to specializing the algorithm are explored through extensive numerical experiments. They show that the performance of our algorithm for large dense or noisy data sets is consistent and highly competitive, and in some cases can outperform all other approaches by a large margin. Unlike active set methods, performance is largely unaffected by noisy data. We also show how, by exploiting the block structure of the augmented system matrix, a hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation of the algorithm enables data and linear algebra computations to be efficiently partitioned amongst parallel processing nodes in a clustered computing environment. The applicability of our technique is extended to nonlinear SVMs by low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. We develop a heuristic designed to represent clusters using a small number of features.

During the last decade various methods have been proposed for that purpose. However, one important obstacle for making gene signatures a standard tool in clinics is the typical low reproducibility of signatures combined with the difficulty to achieve a clear biological interpretation. For that purpose in the last years there has been a growing interest in approaches that try to integrate information from molecular interaction networks. We here propose a technique that integrates network information as well as different kinds of experimental data (here exemplified by mRNA and miRNA expression) into one classifier. This is done by smoothing t-statistics of individual genes or miRNAs over the structure of a combined protein-protein interaction (PPI) and miRNA-target gene network. A permutation test is conducted to select features in a highly consistent manner, and subsequently a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained. Compared to several other competing methods our algorithm reveals an overall better prediction performance for early versus late disease relapse and a higher signature stability. Moreover, obtained gene lists can be clearly associated to biological knowledge, such as known disease genes and KEGG pathways. We demonstrate that our data integration strategy can improve classification performance compared to using a single data source only.

The approach is based on fractional coding where a variable is represented by two molecules. The synergy between fractional coding in molecular computing and stochastic logic implementations in electronic computing is key to translating known stochastic logic circuits to molecular computing. Although inspired by prior stochastic logic implementation of the RBF-SVM kernel, the proposed molecular reactions require non-obvious modifications. This paper introduces a new explicit bipolar-to-unipolar molecular converter for intermediate format conversion. Two designs are presented; one is based on the explicit and the other is based on implicit conversion from prior stochastic logic. When 5 support vectors are used, it is shown that the DNA RBF-SVM realized using the explicit format conversion has orders of magnitude less regression error than that based on implicit conversion.

However, the transition from GWAS findings to the underlying biology of various phenotypes remains challenging. As a result, due to its system-level interpretability, pathway analysis has become a popular tool for gaining insights on the underlying biology from high-throughput genetic association data. In pathway analyses, gene sets representing particular biological processes are tested for significant associations with a given phenotype. Most existing pathway analysis approaches rely on single-marker statistics and assume that pathways are independent of each other. As biological systems are driven by complex biomolecular interactions, embracing the complex relationships between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and pathways needs to be addressed. To incorporate the complexity of gene-gene interactions and pathway-pathway relationships, we propose a system-level pathway analysis approach, synthetic feature random forest (SF-RF), which is designed to detect pathway-phenotype associations without making assumptions about the relationships among SNPs or pathways. In our approach, the genotypes of SNPs in a particular pathway are aggregated into a synthetic feature representing that pathway via Random Forest (RF). Multiple synthetic features are analyzed using RF simultaneously and the significance of a synthetic feature indicates the significance of the corresponding pathway. We further complement SF-RF with pathway-based Statistical Epistasis Network (SEN) analysis that evaluates interactions among pathways. By investigating the pathway SEN, we hope to gain additional insights into the genetic mechanisms contributing to the pathway-phenotype association. We apply SF-RF to a population-based genetic study of bladder cancer and further investigate the mechanisms that help explain the pathway-phenotype associations using SEN.

The authors' work on automatic identification of kinematic and dynamic parameters, feedforward position control, stability in force control, and trajectory learning has significant implications for improving performance in future robot systems. All of the main ideas discussed in this book have been validated by experiments on a direct-drive robot arm.The book addresses the issues of building accurate robot models and of applying them for high performance control. It first describes how three sets of models - the kinematic model of the links and the inertial models of the links and of rigid-body loads - can be obtained automatically using experimental data. These models are then incorporated into position control, single trajectory learning, and force control. The MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm, on which these models were developed and applied to control, is one of the few manipulators currently suitable for testing such concepts.Contents: Introduction.

Traditional investigation method for plant community is mainly based on field sampling, which is limited by the data acquisition from complex terrain areas. In contrast, high-resolution remote sensing technique provides a convenient way to quickly access data in a large area. higher dimensional information is needed to distinguish more fine features. To overcome the shortcomings derived from the high dimensional features, which is caused by related data increasing, we choose the algorithm of projection pursuit learning network (PPLN) along with field samples of typical plant communities to realize a fast classification on the vegetation in the east of Shenzhen. Then, in the experiment, the spectral and texture information extracted from Pleiades images, and the terrain interpolated from topographic map are selected and used to build high dimensional features, which is crucial to the vegetation classification using remote sensing images. The learning network for projection pursuit is applied to discriminating the typical communities in both plantation and natural secondary forest in the study area. Compared with Maximum-likelihood classification (MLC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), PPLN can achieve more accurate results for plant community classification. As a conclusion, the plant community classification with PPLN meets the requirements of the investigation project, achieves the quick updating of some basic information related to forest resources, and looks forward to involve in some other ecological research as well.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127083", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2771330956", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208037931"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39383243"}

The software process model has a major impact on the quality of the overall system - the longer a defect remains in the system undetected, the harder it becomes to fix. However, predicting the quality of the software in the early phases would immensely assist developers in software maintenance and quality assurance activities, and to allocate effort and resources more efficiently. This paper presents an evaluation of eight machine learning techniques in the context of reliability and maintainability.

Software metrics are direct reflections of various characteristics of software and are used in our study as the major attributes for training the models for both defect and maintainability prediction.

At present, plant diseases are diagnosed by specialists and with the naked eyes. Presenting a simple, fast, cheap and accurate way for the diagnosis of plant diseases is necessary. In this paper, by using image processing and machine vision techniques, four methods for the diagnosis and classification of the diseases of corn leaf are presented. In the first method, the affected parts were separated from the healthy parts using the histogram adjustment; subsequently, a two-layer Perceptron Neural Network was used to categorize the final results and diagnose the disease type. The results indicate that Neural Network with an average of 65.15% is able to correctly diagnose the disease of the corn leaf. In the second method, different types of Laplacian filters, Canny and Sobel were applied on the leaves; after the separation of the affected parts, the classification and diagnosis phase were implemented. The results revealed that the algorithm with the accuracy of 67.94%, can correctly diagnose the disease. In the third method, using the analysis method of principal components, data dimension was reduced, and then was sent to the Support Vector Machine classifier for the diagnosis of the disease. This algorithm is able to correctly diagnose the disease with an accuracy of 75.28%. Furthermore, the algorithm is able to diagnose Class 5 and 4 diseases in a more accurate way. Finally, in the fourth method, a combination of Gabor filter and visual features was used in order to diagnose the type of disease.

One of the reasons is that, in such an environment, the discriminant information can not been extracted entirely due to the disturbances, non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity. In this paper, a method named Joint Fisher discriminant analysis (JFDA) is proposed to address the issues. First, JFDA removes outliers caused by disturbances according to the energy density of each datum. Then, for the non-Gaussianity and weakly nonlinearity, the novel scatter matrices are defined to extract both of the local and global discriminant information based on the manifold learning. Finally, the kernel JFDA (KJFDA) is investigated to hold the manifold assumption because the strongly nonlinearity may weaken the assumption and cause overlapping. The proposed method is applied to the Tennessee Eastman process (TEP).

In particular, disaster related applications (e.g., flood monitoring or rapid damage mapping), which are highly time- and data-critical, require methods that produce accurate cloud and cloud shadow masks in short time while being able to adapt to large variations in the target domain (induced by atmospheric conditions, different sensors, scene properties, etc.). In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to semantic segmentation of cloud and cloud shadow in single date images based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network that aims to fulfil these requirements. We train the network on a global database of Landsat OLI images for the segmentation of five classes (\u201cshadow\u201d, \u201ccloud\u201d, \u201cwater\u201d, \u201cland\u201d and \u201csnow/ice\u201d). We compare the results to state-of-the-art methods, proof the model's generalization ability across multiple satellite sensors (Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2) and show the influence of different training strategies and spectral band combinations on the performance of the segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms Fmask and a traditional Random Forest classifier on a globally distributed multi-sensor test dataset in terms of accuracy, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, Dice coefficient and inference speed. The results indicate that a reduced feature space composed solely of red, green, blue and near-infrared bands already produces good results for all tested sensors. If available, adding shortwave-infrared bands can increase the accuracy. Contrast and brightness augmentations of the training data further improve the segmentation performance. The best performing U-Net model achieves an accuracy of 0.89, Kappa of 0.82 and Dice coefficient of 0.85, while running the inference over 896 test image tiles with 44.8 s/megapixel (2.8 s/megapixel on GPU). The Random Forest classifier reaches an accuracy of 0.79, Kappa of 0.65 and Dice coefficient of 0.74 with 3.9 s/megapixel inference time (on CPU) on the same training and testing data.

Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) information is an important data source for modeling environmental variables, so it is essential to develop high quality LULC maps. The hundreds of continuous spectral bands gathered with hyperspectral sensors provide high spectral detail and consequently confirm hyperspectral remote sensing as an appropriate option for many LULC applications. Despite increased spectral detail, issues like high dimensionality, huge volume of data and redundant information, mean that hyperspectral image classification is a complex task. It is therefore essential to develop classification approaches that deals with these issues. Since classification results are directly dependent on the dataset used, it is fundamental to compare and validate the classification approaches in public datasets. With this in mind, aiming to provide a baseline, four classification models in the relatively new hyperspectral HyRANK dataset were evaluated. The classification models were defined with three well-known classification algorithms: Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). A classification model with SAM and another with RF were defined with the 176 surface reflectance bands. A dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis was carried out and a classification model with SVM and another with RF were defined using 14 principal components as features. The results show that SVM and RF algorithms outperformed by far the SAM in terms of accuracy, and that the RF is slightly better than the SVM in this respect. It is also possible to see from the results that the use of principal components as features provided an improvement in the accuracy of the RF and an improvement of 28% in the time spent fitting the classification model.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W13-1841-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2948545016", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128894589", "58374281", "5208463", "52874011", "21245572", "84179581", "128770475", "31039418", "122308290", "11625727", "61806713", "16371174", "48934438", "11110712", "134296492", "2357415", "10659969", "10605689", "124662551", "7780636", "14766564", "129234826"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195445871"}

However, pedestrian detection and tracking from the thermal images obtained from UAVs pose many challenges due to the low-resolution of imagery, platform motion, image instability and the relatively small size of the objects. This research tackles these challenges by proposing a pedestrian detection and tracking system. A two-stage blob-based approach is first developed for pedestrian detection. This approach first extracts pedestrian blobs using the regional gradient feature and geometric constraints filtering and then classifies the detected blobs by using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a hybrid descriptor, which sophisticatedly combines Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) features in order to achieve accurate detection. This research further proposes an approach for pedestrian tracking. This approach employs the feature tracker with the update of detected pedestrian location to track pedestrian objects from the registered videos and extracts the motion trajectory data. The proposed detection and tracking approaches have been evaluated by multiple different datasets, and the results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This research is expected to significantly benefit many transportation applications, such as the multimodal traffic performance measure, pedestrian behavior study and pedestrian-vehicle crash analysis.

The problem of simply nding a stable grasp is dicult enough, but to perform a useful grasp, we must also consider other aspects of the task: the object, its properties, and any task-related constraints. The choice of grasping region is highly dependent on the category of object, and the automated prediction of object category is the problem we focus on here. In this paper, we consider manifold information and semantic object parts in a graph kernel to predict categories of a large variety of household objects such as cups, pots, pans, bottles, and various tools. The similarity based category prediction is achieved by employing propagation kernels, a recently introduced graph kernel for partially labeled graphs, on graph representations of 3D point clouds of objects. Our work highlights the importance of moving towards the use of structured machine learning approaches in order to achieve the dream of autonomous and intelligent robot grasping: learning to map low-level visual features to good grasping points under consideration of object{task aordances and high-level world knowledge. We evaluate propagation kernels for object category prediction on a (synthetic) dataset of 41 objects with 11 categories and a dataset of 126 point clouds derived from laser range data with part labels estimated by a part detector.

Often times we may have multiple domains with little or no labeled data as targets waiting to be solved. Most existing efforts tackle target domains separately by modeling the `source-target' pairs without exploring the relatedness between them, which would cause loss of crucial information, thus failing to achieve optimal capability of knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach called Multi-Relevance Transfer Learning (MRTL) for this purpose, which can simultaneously transfer different knowledge from the source and exploits the shared common latent factors between target domains. Specifically, we formulate the problem as an optimization task based on a collective nonnegative matrix tri-factorization framework. The proposed approach achieves both source-target transfer and target-target leveraging by sharing multiple decomposed latent subspaces. Further, an alternative minimization learning algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee. Empirical study validates the performance and effectiveness of MRTL compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.03361", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2767790686", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15978939", "8226838", "7554099", "13456369", "165018", "7822049", "4962044", "719551", "15052554", "15036406", "14591650", "2095855", "13902032", "14655047", "59566327", "12308197", "1025328", "10115836", "27591975"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13077640"}

Therefore, reliable and accurate closure models for unresolved physics remains an important requirement for many computational physics problems, e.g., turbulence simulation. Recently, several researchers have adopted generative adversarial networks (GANs), a novel paradigm of training machine learning models, to generate solutions of PDEs-governed complex systems without having to numerically solve these PDEs. However, GANs are known to be difficult in training and likely to converge to local minima, where the generated samples do not capture the true statistics of the training data. In this work, we present a statistical constrained generative adversarial network by enforcing constraints of covariance from the training data, which results in an improved machine-learning-based emulator to capture the statistics of the training data generated by solving fully resolved PDEs. We show that such a statistical regularization leads to better performance compared to standard GANs, measured by (1) the constrained model's ability to more faithfully emulate certain physical properties of the system and (2) the significantly reduced (by up to 80%) training time to reach the solution. We exemplify this approach on the Rayleigh-Benard convection, a turbulent flow system that is an idealized model of the Earth's atmosphere. With the growth of high-fidelity simulation databases of physical systems, this work suggests great potential for being an alternative to the explicit modeling of closures or parameterizations for unresolved physics, which are known to be a major source of uncertainty in simulating multi-scale physical systems, e.g., turbulence or Earth's climate.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.06841", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jcp.2019.109209", "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Computational Physics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2946794331,2998567481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Physics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["73687397", "119085443", "125898515", "125730183", "49182888", "6975753", "54987390", "10567338", "10140273", "3694256", "3074096", "3457605", "7533448", "57379996", "51983709", "51970471", "4854885", "53013250", "30747077", "60565534", "206595056", "11758569", "60565534", "199442114", "53248119", "4084956", "11758569", "6936155", "55665811", "60261425", "6773019", "6287870", "10894094", "195345988", "2349418", "3662488", "131973152", "206403135", "125819907", "119244606", "118501064", "117283344"], "inbound_citations": ["211505847", "208076762", "212657607", "166228192", "209334471", "210903511", "195317092", "211010687", "211068821", "201657771", "202236953"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155100272"}

Clinical charge profiles predictions can provides relevant clinical knowledge for healthcare policy makers to effectively manage healthcare services and costs at the national, state, and local levels. Despite its solid mathematical foundation and promising experimental results, SVM is not favorable for large-scale data mining tasks since its training time complexity is at least quadratic to the number of samples. Furthermore, traditional SVM classification algorithms cannot build an effective SVM when different data distribution patterns are intermingled in a large dataset. In order to enhance SVM training for large, complex and noisy healthcare datasets, we propose the Multi-level Support Vector Machine (MLSVM) that organizes the dataset as clusters in a tree to produce better partitions for more effective SVM classification. The MLSVM model utilizes multiple SVMs, each of which learns the local data distribution patterns in a cluster efficiently. A decision fusion algorithm is used to generate an effective global decision that incorporates local SVM decisions at different levels of the tree. Consequently, MLSVM can handle complex and often conflicting data distributions in large datasets more effectively than the single-SVM based approaches and the multiple SVM systems. Both the combined 5x2-fold cross validation F test and the independent test show that classification performance of MLSVM is much superior to that of a CVM, ACSVM and CSVM based on three popular performance evaluation metrics. In this work, CSVM and MLSVM are parallelized to speed up the slow SVM training process for very large and complex datasets. Running time analysis shows that MLSVM can accelerate SVM's training process noticeably when the parallel algorithm is employed.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2011.08.036", "venue": "Expert Syst.

This scheme is feature based in the sense that features that are sensitive to embedding changes and being employed as means of steganalysis. The features are extracted in DCT domain. DCT domain features have extended DCT features and Markovian features merged together to eliminate the drawbacks of both. The blind steganalytic technique has a broad spectrum of analyzing different embedding techniques. The feature based steganalytic technique is used in the DCT domain to extract about 23 functionals and classify the dataset according to these functionals. The feature set can be increased to about 274 features by merging both DCT and Markovian features.

Once obtained the emotion topics, the appearing frequency of the corresponding emotion topics in a given image forms a histogram, which can be subsequently used in the scene categorization task via the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

To perform automated SVs assessment with concept drift using SVs' descriptions, we propose a systematic approach that combines both character and word features. The proposed approach is used to predict seven Vulnerability Characteristics (VCs). The optimal model of each VC is selected using our customized time-based cross-validation method from a list of eight NLP representations and six well-known Machine Learning models. We have used the proposed approach to conduct large-scale experiments on more than 100,000 SVs in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The results show that our approach can effectively tackle the concept drift issue of the SVs' descriptions reported from 2000 to 2018 in NVD even without retraining the model. In addition, our approach performs competitively compared to the existing word-only method.

We define new types of features critical to distinguish legitimate users from attackers and utilize Support Vector Machine (SVM) for user authentication. The features and data-driven models are specially designed to accommodate minor behavior variations that existing gesture authentication methods neglect. In addition, we use deep neural network approaches to efficiently identify the user based on his or her in-air-handwriting, which avoids expansive account database search methods employed by existing work. On a dataset collected by us with over 100 users, our prototype system achieves 0.1% and 0.5% best Equal Error Rate (EER) for user authentication, as well as 96.7% and 94.3% accuracy for user identification, using two types of gesture input devices. Compared to existing behavioral biometric systems using gesture and in-air-handwriting, our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Various approaches to the problem of mental representations have been formulated, in some sense alternative to classic approaches of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. We suggest that the problem of modelling the reference of mental symbols from a cognitive point of view requires the abandonment of a purely symbolic approach, and the adoption of a subsymbolic level of representation.

Also, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique is used to solve dimensionality problem of the extracted feature vectors and to increase the separability between classes, thus increasing the accuracy of the introduced system. The classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and minimum distance will be used to identify the Arabic sign characters. Experiments are conducted to check the performance of the proposed system and it showed that the accuracy of the obtained results is around 99%.

A modified version of the Schiminovich algorithm was used to classify articles in the data base, utilizing citations found in their bibliographies and a \u201ctriggering file\u201d of bibliographically related papers. Classes of articles were formed by comparing the citations in the articles with members of the triggering file. Those papers with similar citing patterns formed a group ; citations occurring sufficiently often within the papers of a group formed a bibliography . Bibliographies in turn became new triggering files in an iterative procedure. Results of this nontraditional method were compared with those of retrieval by standard American Institute of Physics (AIP) subject analysis of the same material. A combination of the two methods was also investigated to test the hypothesis that one could be used to augment or refine the other. Nine cooperating physicists defined queries in terms of (1) the AIP classification scheme and (2) a list of articles likely to be cited in current relevant literature. The data base was 18 months of 1971\u20131972 physics journal articles (AIP SPIN tapes). The chief means of evaluating the results of the three retrieval approaches was a comparison of recall and precision values obtained from relevance judgments by the physicists. Average precision for the AIP subject analysis was 17 per cent and for the citation processing 62 per cent. Based on an assumption of 100 per cent recall for the AIP analysis, average recall for the citation processing was 45 per cent. All but one physicist would prefer to have both the citation and subject approaches available for information retrieval. Sometimes, only a few relevant articles are desired; at other times comprehensiveness is necessary. However, if only one method were available, all except one participant would choose the subject approach. They felt that one must be able to retrieve all the relevant articles, even if that would mean examining 25\u201330 irrelevant notices for every relevant one.

The purpose of this research is to propose Disk Failure Prediction (DFP) models based on Random Forest (RF), Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and unsupervised K-means clustering, with a real-time Self-Monitoring System (SMS) built on a predictive model showing the most stable and reliable performance. The performance of the model were evaluation under various test cases such as providing samples of different sizes, taking timing into account and considering voting in the predicted result. The RF model performed best under this test cases with a maximum DFP rate of 99% with 0.01% False Alarm Rate (FAR) which is superior to state of the art model such as Decision Tree (DT).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2893070078,2977458177", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60463560", "98276971", "14153733", "89141", "15245447", "13617529", "7343126", "2757547", "28389458", "12370460", "207590254", "34484472", "39328486", "15539921", "17484973", "5621370", "50458504", "153819384", "2883483", "35418588", "29380901", "19175055", "4228443"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55005538"}

Compared with other classical models, these translation models achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a more flexible model named TransDR, which is an improvement of TransD. In TransDR, we use two vectors to represent each entity and three vectors to represent relation. Compared with TransD, TransDR adds another vector for each relation which could not only represent model more flexibly but also reduce the noise from other relation spaces.

However, the parameters for the image segmentation algorithms are often manually defined. Therefore, the generation of an ideal segmentation level is usually costly and user-depended. In this paper a strategy for a semi-automatic optimization of object-based classification of multitemporal data is introduced by using Random Forest (RF) and a novel segmentation algorithm. The Superpixel Contour (SPc) algorithm is used to generate a set of different levels of segmentation, using various combinations of parameters in a user-defined range. Finally, the best parameter combination is selected based on the cross-validation-like out-of-bag (OOB) error that is provided by RF. Therefore, the quality of the parameters and the corresponding segmentation level can be assessed in terms of the classification accuracy, without providing additional independent test data. To evaluate the potential of the proposed concept, we focus on land cover classification of two study areas, using multitemporal RapidEye and SPOT 5 images. A classification that is based on eCognition's widely used multiresolution segmentation algorithm (MRS) is used for comparison. Experimental results underline that the two segmentation algorithms SPc and MRS perform similar in terms of accuracy and visual interpretation. The proposed strategy that uses the OOB error for the selection of the ideal segmentation level provides similar classification accuracies, when compared to the results achieved by manual-based image segmentation. Overall, the proposed strategy is operational and easy to handle and thus economizes the findings of optimal segmentation parameters for the Superpixel Contour algorithm.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2253089", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2047825499", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["42733783", "28170349", "3202409", "13851032", "21846755", "54741771", "52063785", "215228801", "32616029", "54741771", "126672927", "122308050", "121381837", "128499985", "122741390", "8615783", "16808522", "62527324", "8156094", "29057737", "3139748", "31943706", "130352894", "9448631", "14080761", "10296432", "15866810", "21916507", "89141", "62739295", "120753665", "24807772", "129434024", "45944920", "17790307", "3077937", "18485838", "49229996", "129269179", "140543430"], "inbound_citations": ["24510900", "10204564", "12251336", "36176909", "27158599", "207909704", "121708919", "9475634", "14094076", "5730505", "126187675", "36853263", "55756704", "195792539", "16989605", "55552292", "36728963", "127233094", "16560581", "10887169", "52113883", "135284001", "127119944", "15022765", "210843081"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7935361"}

By adopting a convolutional long short-term memory network as its subcomponent, STCNet has a strong ability in modeling spatial-temporal dependencies. Besides, three kinds of cross-domain datasets are actively collected and modeled by STCNet to capture the external factors that affect traffic generation. As diversity and similarity coexist among cellular traffic from different city functional zones, a clustering algorithm is put forward to segment city areas into different groups, and consequently, a successive inter-cluster transfer learning strategy is designed to enhance knowledge reuse. In addition, the knowledge transferring among different kinds of cellular traffic is also explored with the proposed STCNet model. The effectiveness of STCNet is validated through real-world cellular traffic datasets using three kinds of evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that STCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.

This study presents a novel application of four advanced artificial intelligence models namely the Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for forecasting lake level fluctuation in Lake Huron utilizing historical datasets. The MPMR is a probabilistic framework that employed Mercer Kernels to achieve nonlinear regression models. The GPR, which is a probabilistic technique used tractable Bayesian framework for generalization of multivariate distribution of input samples to vast dimensional space. The ELM is a capable algorithm-based model for the implementation of the single-layer feed-forward neural network. The RVM demonstrate depends on the specification of the Bayesian method on a linear model with proper preceding that results in demonstration of sparse. The recommended techniques were tested to evaluate the current lake water-level trend monthly from the historical datasets at four previous time steps. The Lake Huron levels from 1918 to 1993 was managed for the training phase, and the rest of data (from 1994 to 2013) was used for testing. Considering the monthly and annually previous time steps, six models were introduced and found that the best results are achieved for a model with (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-12) as input combinations.

Moreover, the experimental results indicate that SVM-based feature selection yields the best performance for feature selection and that the SVM classifier outperforms the other techniques for Arabic sentiment-based classification.

In the GNG algorithm, the Minimum Description Length (MDL) measure as the cluster validity index is utilized for determining the optimal number of clusters (sub-regions). The capability of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by regionalizing drought severities for 40 synoptic weather stations in Iran. To fulfill this aim, first a clustering method is applied to form the sub-regions and then a heterogeneity measure is used to test the degree of heterogeneity of the delineated sub-regions.

Most fine-grained classification algorithms are data-hungry and time-consuming, on the contrary, humans have the ability to recognize different species with only a small number of samples. For example, a baby can identity different kinds of dogs with only few images. Therefore, in this paper, a fined-grained classification model which is based on meta learning is proposed, and it can be used for more accurate fined-grained classification with only a small number of data. Meta learning uses meta-learners to learn relative tasks so that they can handle with new tasks faster and better when facing new tasks. Specifically, our model uses a task learner to learn various tasks and update the parameters of meta learner at the same time. When facing a new task, meta learner can learn and adapt to new tasks more quickly. The key novelty of our model is an attention module which can enlarge the local area response of image.

Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), this paper presents a new model that is able to Turn Cross-view Hashing into single-view hashing (TUCH), thus enabling the information of image to be preserved as much as possible.

In this project, we design and implement a two-phase approach for leak event identification, which leverages dynamic data from multiple information sources including IoT sensing data (pressure values and/or flow rates), geophysical data (water systems), and human inputs (tweets posted on Twitter). In the approach, a high order Conditional Random Field (CRF) is constructed that enforces predictions based on IoT observations consistent with human inputs to improve the performance of event identifications. Considering the physical water network as a graph, a CRF model is built and learned by the Structured Support Vector Machine (SSVM) using node features such as water pressure and flow rate. After that, we built the high order CRF system by enforcing twitter leakage detection information. An optimal inference algorithm is proposed for the adapted high order CRF model.

To address this, we propose a DDML method to train a deep neural network to learn a set of hierarchical nonlinear transformations to project face pairs into the same latent feature space, under which the distance of each positive pair is reduced and that of each negative pair is enlarged. To better use the commonality of multiple feature descriptors to make all the features more robust for face and kinship verification, we develop a discriminative deep multi-metric learning method to jointly learn multiple neural networks, under which the correlation of different features of each sample is maximized, and the distance of each positive pair is reduced and that of each negative pair is enlarged.

The ability to predict stroke outcomes within the acute period of stroke would be essential for care planning and rehabilitation. The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC; clinicaltrials.gov NCT03153683) study collects arterial blood immediately distal and proximal to the intracranial thrombus at the time of mechanical thrombectomy. These blood samples are an innovative resource in evaluating acute gene expression changes at the time of ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to identify inflammatory genes and important immune factors during mechanical thrombectomy for emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) and which patient demographics were predictors for stroke outcomes (infarct and/or edema volume) in acute ischemic stroke patients. Methods: The BACTRAC study is a non-probability sampling of male and female subjects (\uf0b3 18 year old) treated with mechanical thrombectomy for ELVO. We evaluated 28 subjects (66 \uf0b1 15.48 years) relative concentrations of mRNA for gene expression in 84 inflammatory molecules in arterial blood distal and proximal to the intracranial thrombus who underwent thrombectomy. We used the machine learning method, Random Forest to predict which inflammatory genes and patient demographics were important features for infarct and edema volumes. To validate the overlapping genes with outcomes, we perform ordinary least squares regression analysis. Results: Machine learning analyses demonstrated that the genes and subject factors CCR4, IFNA2, IL-9, CXCL3, Age, T2DM, IL-7, CCL4, BMI, IL-5, CCR3, TNF\uf061, and IL-27 predicted infarct volume. The genes and subject factor IFNA2, IL-5, CCL11, IL-17C, CCR4, IL-9, IL-7, CCR3, IL-27, T2DM, and CSF2 predicted edema volume.

Such approaches are typically bootstarpped by manual or semi-automatic initialization in the first several frames. However, most adaptive tracking-bydetection methods focus on tracking of a single object or multiple unrelated objects. Although one can trivially engage several single object trackers to track multiple objects, such solution is frequently suboptimal because it does not utilize the inter-object constraints or the obejct layout information [2]. We propose in this paper an adaptive tracking-by-detection method for multiple objects, inspired by recent work in [1] and [2]. The constraints for structured Support Vector Machine (SVM) in [1] are modified to localize multiple objects simultaneously with both appearance and layout information. Moreover, additional binary constraints are introduced to detect the existences of respective objects and to prevent possible model drift. Thus the method can handle frequent occlusion in multiple object tracking, as well as objects entering or leaving the scene. Those binary constraints make the optimization problem significantly different from the original Structured SVM [3]. The inter-object constraints, embedded in a linear programming technique similar to [2] for optimal position assignment, are applied to diminish false detections. In single object tracking case, given a set of frames {x1,x2, . . . ,xn} indexed by time, and the corresponding set of labeling, i.e. bounding box, {y1,y2, . . . ,yn}, structured SVM tries to find a model f (x,y), such that the task of predicting object location in a testing frame x could be conquered by maximizing: f (x,y) = \u3008w,\u03a8(x|y)\u3009, (1)", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5244/C.26.48", "venue": "BMVC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2016830452", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206590783", "7920193", "10519006", "2267230", "10402359", "3263491", "823678", "11989316", "58579706", "9088971", "6821810", "27003726", "1606049", "927988", "632758", "1627809", "1089627", "16807045", "32640"], "inbound_citations": ["13380075", "198172353", "12315783", "63937571", "14088537"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1162580"}

However, the complexity of the training process makes the SVMs unsuitable for classifying large datasets. Examples of existing approaches to this problem are sampling of the input datasets or clustering of similar inputs. On the other hand, the Growing Neural Gas algorithm (GNG) is a robust tool for cluster analysis, capable of learning the topology of the data. It overcomes most of the common issues of clustering techniques such as predefined number of clusters or beforehand specified cluster radius. This paper presents a solution to the problem of classifying large datasets via learning of the data topology. The described algorithm combines the GNG algorithm with the SVM solver into a specific algorithm for classification of large datasets - the GNG-SVM framework. The input dataset is first preprocessed with the GNG algorithm. A new reduced training dataset is created from the extracted topological knowledge. Because the size of the dataset is significantly reduced, the training process of the SVM solver becomes substantially less memory demanding. The performance of the proposed GNG-SVM framework is tested on both synthetic and benchmark real world datasets.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178713", "venue": "2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "journal": "2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2160876557", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["140109802", "28637672", "194951", "9016542", "9032999", "7317620", "60565534", "59639035", "118035271", "58747689", "58153557", "8952183", "2959806", "2235233", "59758775", "15433082", "19004424", "14561315"], "inbound_citations": ["867381", "14262855"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6928800"}

Cancer incidence rate is growing at an alarming rate in Malaysia and the world as we know it. It is estimated that statistically one out of every four Malaysians will develop cancer by the age of 75. Conventional methods of diagnosing cancer rely solely on skilled physicians, with the help of medical imaging, to detect certain symptoms which usually appear in the late stage of cancer. Furthermore, biopsy examinations are highly invasive since tissue samples are required to be extracted from patients. There exist minimally invasive cancer biomarkers in forms of proteins from serum. Nevertheless, existing protein-based diagnosis techniques require labor-intensive analysis compounded by low diagnosis sensitivity. There have indeed been a number of studies to identify novel miRNA-based cancer biomarkers. However, the existing diagnosis techniques using miRNA suffer from low diagnosis accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The low diagnosis accuracy and sensitivity of the existing techniques stems from the fact that there is extremely low miRNA count in body fluids. There is also an inevitable problem of cross contamination between cells and exosomes in sample preparation steps. This paper proposes to circumvent these problems in data analysis stage with a machine learning technique called Random Forest. The proposed system achieved 93.48 % accuracy for gastric cancer and 100 % accuracy for ovarian cancer. The results are promising and encouraging.
