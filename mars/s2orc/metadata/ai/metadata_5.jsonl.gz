Many real-world complex systems exhibit community structure, where individuals with similar properties form a community. The identification of communities in a network is important for understanding the structure of said network, in a specific perspective. Thus, community detection in complex networks gained immense interest over the last decade. A lot of community detection methods were proposed, and one of them is the label propagation algorithm (LPA). The simplicity and time efficiency of the LPA make it a popular community detection method. However, the LPA suffers from instability detection due to randomness that is induced in the algorithm. The focus of this paper is to improve the stability and accuracy of the LPA, while retaining its simplicity. Our proposed algorithm will first detect the main communities in a network by using the number of mutual neighbouring nodes. Subsequently, nodes are added into communities by using a constrained LPA. Those constraints are then gradually relaxed until all nodes are assigned into groups. In order to refine the quality of the detected communities, nodes in communities can be switched to another community or removed from their current communities at various stages of the algorithm. We evaluated our algorithm on three types of benchmark networks, namely the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR), Relaxed Caveman (RC) and Girvan-Newman (GN) benchmarks. We also apply the present algorithm to some real-world networks of various sizes.

The collected data are usually sorted in Sinclair matrix, coherence or covariance matrices which are directly related to physical properties of natural media and backscattering mechanism. Additional information related to the nature of scattering medium can be exploited through polarimetric decomposition theorems. Accordingly, PolSAR image classification gains increasing attentions from remote sensing communities in recent years. However, the above polarimetric measurements or parameters cannot provide sufficient information for accurate PolSAR image classification in some scenarios, e.g. in complex urban areas where different scattering mediums may exhibit similar PolSAR response due to couples of unavoidable reasons. Inspired by the complementarity between spectral and spatial features bringing remarkable improvements in optical image classification, the complementary information between polarimetric and spatial features may also contribute to PolSAR image classification. Therefore, the roles of textural features such as contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity and local range, morphological profiles (MPs) in PolSAR image classification are investigated using two advanced ensemble learning (EL) classifiers: Random Forest and Rotation Forest.

Different from the existing SVM extensions such as thresholding and parameter tuning, ASVM employs a new objective that models the imbalance between the costs of false predictions from different classes in a novel way such that user tolerance on false-positive rate can be explicitly specified. Such a new objective formulation allows us of obtaining a lower false-positive rate without much degradation of the prediction accuracy or increase in training time. Furthermore, we show that the generalization ability is preserved with the new objective. We also study the effects of the parameters in ASVM objective and address some implementation issues related to the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) to cope with large-scale data.

The present study aimed at evaluating the performance of the S2-MSI imagery for estimating the growing stock volume of forest ecosystems. To do so we used 240 plots measured in two study areas in Italy. The imputation was carried out with eight k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) methods available in the open source YaImpute R package. In order to evaluate the S2-MSI performance we repeated the experimental protocol also with two other sets of images acquired by two well-known satellites equipped with multi spectral instruments: Landsat 8 OLI and RapidEye scanner. We found that S2 worked better than Landsat in 37.5% of the cases and in 62.5% of the cases better than RapidEye.

However, the majority of NLDR methods define object adjacencies using distance metrics that do not account for the quality of the features in the high-dimensional space. In this paper we present Boosted Spectral Embedding (BoSE), a variant of the traditional Spectral Embedding (SE) that utilizes a Boosted Distance Metric (BDM) to improve the low-dimensional representation of the data. Under the naive assumption that all features are equally important, SE uses the Euclidean distance metric to define object-distance relationships. However, the BDM selectively weights features via the AdaBoost algorithm such that the low-dimensional representation contains only the most discriminating features. In this work BoSE is evaluated against SE in the context of digitized histopathology images using (a) content-based image retrieval and (b) classification via Random Forest of the low-dimensional representation. Using images from a cohort of 58 prostate cancer patient studies, BoSE and SE separated benign and malignant samples with areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRCs) of 0.95 and 0.67 and classification accuracies using a Random Forest (RF) classifer were 0.93 and 0.79, respectively. For a cohort of 55 breast cancer studies, BoSE and SE performed comparably in terms of both RF accuracy and AUPRC.

It is also important to identify badly-predicted regions in a model so that some refinement measurements can be applied to it. We present two complementary techniques, FragQA and PosQA, to accurately predict local quality of a sequence\u2013structure (i.e. sequence\u2013template) alignment generated by comparative modeling (i.e. homology modeling and threading). FragQA and PosQA predict local quality from two different perspectives. Different from existing methods, FragQA directly predicts cRMSD between a continuously aligned fragment determined by an alignment and the corresponding fragment in the native structure, while PosQA predicts the quality of an individual aligned position. Both FragQA and PosQA use an SVM (Support Vector Machine) regression method to perform prediction using similar information extracted from a single given alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that FragQA performs well on predicting local fragment quality, and PosQA outperforms two top-notch methods, ProQres and ProQprof.

Digital mammography is a reliable tool to detect breast cancer at the early stage with no symptoms. The objective of this research work is to classify the microcalcification patterns into benign and malignant. Methods: In this research, a novel approach is proposed for classification of microcalcifications based on shift-invariant transform, Jacobi moments and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The Jacobi moments are used to extract orthogonal features from the location of microcalcifications based on orthogonal or weighted polynomial basis which uses recurrence relation to avoid the loss of precisions. The Jacobi features will be given as input to SVM classifier for classifying the mammogram images into normal and abnormal. The abnormality will be further classified into benign or malignant. Findings: The validity of the proposed approach is evaluated using MIAS database. In the process of mammogram enhancement, the experimental results shows that shift-invariant transform achieves better results than contourlet transform. The classification rate of proposed system is 98.65% for normal, 95.80% for benign and 93.35% for malignant accuracy. The performance of the proposed approaches measured by sensitivity, specificity and confusion matrix. The measurement of performance is 0.84 sensitivity and 0.95 specificity for stage1 and 0.85 sensitivity and 0.83 specificity for stage 2.

The first contribution of this thesis is in the domain of video segmentation wherein the objective is to obtain a dense and coherent spatio-temporal segmentation. We propose joining both spatial and temporal aspects of a video into a single notion Fiber. A fiber is a set of trajectories which are spatially connected by a mesh. Fibers are built by jointly assessing spatial and temporal aspects of the video. Compared to the state-of-the-art, a fiber based video segmentation presents advantages such as a natural spatio-temporal neighborhood accessor by a mesh, and temporal correspondences for most pixels in the video. Furthermore, this fiber-based segmentation is of quasi-linear complexity w.r.t. the number of pixels. The second contribution is in the realm of multiple object tracking. We proposed a tracking approach which utilizes cues from point tracks, kinematics of moving objects and global appearance of detections. Unification of all these cues is performed on a Conditional Random Field. Subsequently this model is optimized by a combination of message passing and an Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) variant to infer object-trajectories.

The work proposes a Support Vector Machine based regression system for identification and classification of five cotton leaf diseases i.e. Bacterial Blight, Alternaria, Gray Mildew, Cereospra, and Fusarium wilt. After disease detection, the name of a disease with its remedies will be provided to the farmers using android app. The Android App is also used to display the soil parameters values such as humidity, moisture and temperature along with the water level in a tank. By using Android app farmers can ON/OFF the relay to control the motor and sprinkler assembly according to need. All this leaf disease detection system and sensors for soil quality monitoring are interfaced using Raspberry Pi which make it independent and cost effective system. The overall classification accuracy of this proposed system is 83.26%.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/iceca.2017.8212855", "venue": "2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)", "journal": "2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2773601183", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["24879883", "22461966", "18113222", "8656983", "17860614", "5884429"], "inbound_citations": ["195698092", "201832479", "77391871", "67929785", "209450841", "108297598", "214602282"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24117570"}

Previous methods address this issue by simplifying the decision rule established after training, which risks a loss in generalization ability and imposes extra computation cost. This paper presents a novel optimal sparse LS-SVM whose decision rule is parameterized by the optimal set of training examples, in addition to having an optimal generalization capability. For a large number of classiffcation problems, the new LS-SVM requires a significantly reduced number of training samples, a property referred to as the sparseness of the solution. The training of the LS-SVM method is implemented using a modified two-stage regression algorithm. Experiments on two-spiral data confirms the advantages described.

Official information containing semantic building type is scarce, most often only available for urban areas and inhomogeneous. Hence, the present thesis presents two methodological approaches to conduct semantic classification of building types based on different available data sources to generate homogeneous information on semantic building types for large-scale applications. Based on the assumption that footprint data of buildings containing height information is available, the first framework evaluates the performance of semantic building type classification using the machine learning classifier Random Forest. Semantic classification is conducted for residential buildings, differentiating four semantic classes using morphometric and topological features: Single-Family Homes - Detached Buildings, Semi-Detached Buildings, Terraced Buildings, and Multi-Family Homes - Apartment Buildings. Several set-ups were carried out using different sets of features and applying the algorithm on data with different geographical, and hence structural, context. Classification results showing high accuracies for almost every employed set-up are promising. However, if no building footprint data is available another approach for semantic building type classification is presented. Using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks, a Deep Learning architecture, semantic segmentation of aerial images, based only on the spectral characteristics, is conducted. Three semantic classes are differentiated: Auxiliary Buildings, Non-Residential Buildings and Residential Buildings.

By treating the size of one-sided -insensitive tube as optimization variables with corresponding parameters s, we reformulate the original TSVR as a more sensible model.

It is evident that modern artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as artificial neural network, extreme learning machine, and support vector regression, are capable of providing reliable forecasting results for tunnel surface settlement. However, two limitations exist for the current forecasting techniques. First, the data provided by the construction company are usually univariate (i.e., containing only the settlement data). Second, the demand of tunnel surface settlement is immediate after the construction process begins. The number of training data samples is limited. Targeting at the above two limitations, in this study, a novel ensemble machine learning model is proposed to forecast tunnel surface settlement using univariate short period of real-world tunnel settlement data. The proposed Adaboost.RT framework fully utilizes existing data points with three base machine learning models and iteratively updates hyperparameters using current surface point locations.

INTRODUCTION Questions have been studied as part of the task of Question Answering in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). At the beginning, question answering research focused on answering questions from databases and knowledge representations [1], but in the past two decades has refocused on retrieving answers from text \u2013 e.g., in 1999 the evaluation of question-answering systems became part of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) series. Simultaneously, there has been a strand of research on advisory dialogue systems [2]. All the previous systems were primarily aimed at responding to the user\u2019s questions. Recently, there has been a broader transformation in the field of Natural Language Processing researches in Question Generation task. Since 2008, researchers from different communities, such as, Discourse Analysis, Dialogue Modeling, Formal Semantics, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Natural Language Generation, Natural Language Understanding, and Psycholinguistics, have met annually at the Question Generation workshop. AQG system would be useful for building an automated trainer for learners to ask better questions, and for building a better hint and question asking facilities in intelligent tutoring systems [3]. Another benefit of QG is that it can be a good tool to help in improving the quality of the Question Answering (QA) systems. Available studies revealed that humans were not very skilled in asking good questions. Therefore, they would benefit from automated QG systems to assist them in meeting their inquiry needs [4]. In this research, a survey about automatic question generation and different variety of work that has been done is discussed. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses the basic steps for automatic question generation systems; section 3 introduces two distinct taxonomies of questions, section 4 the state of the art in which a description of the previous work, finally section 5 introduces a conclusion with some remarks.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5120/18035-7636", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "mag_id": "2113905608", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["59483190"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41991251"}

However, despite extensive study, there are several major shortcomings with the existing approaches for distance metric learning that can significantly affect their application to medical image retrieval. In particular, ldquosimilarityrdquo can mean very different things in image retrieval: resemblance in visual appearance (e.g., two images that look like one another) or similarity in semantic annotation (e.g., two images of tumors that look quite different yet are both malignant). Current approaches for distance metric learning typically address only one goal without consideration of the other. This is problematic for medical image retrieval where the goal is to assist doctors in decision making. In these applications, given a query image, the goal is to retrieve similar images from a reference library whose semantic annotations could provide the medical professional with greater insight into the possible interpretations of the query image. If the system were to retrieve images that did not look like the query, then users would be less likely to trust the system; on the other hand, retrieving images that appear superficially similar to the query but are semantically unrelated is undesirable because that could lead users toward an incorrect diagnosis. Hence, learning a distance metric that preserves both visual resemblance and semantic similarity is important. We emphasize that, although our study is focused on medical image retrieval, the problem addressed in this work is critical to many image retrieval systems. We present a boosting framework for distance metric learning that aims to preserve both visual and semantic similarities. The boosting framework first learns a binary representation using side information, in the form of labeled pairs, and then computes the distance as a weighted Hamming distance using the learned binary representation. A boosting algorithm is presented to efficiently learn the distance function. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on a mammographic image reference library with an interactive search-assisted decision support (ISADS) system and on the medical image data set from ImageCLEF. Our results show that the boosting framework compares favorably to state-of-the-art approaches for distance metric learning in retrieval accuracy, with much lower computational cost. Additional evaluation with the COREL collection shows that our algorithm works well for regular image data sets.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19926897", "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2008.273", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2133126147", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3138956", "9123990", "10531091", "47325215", "9182542", "44934855", "29468414", "9608250", "48364123", "17118616", "12289342", "8713492", "17249182", "7347681", "21731877", "206941865", "850937", "2643381", "17819245", "2354883", "6865208", "1845522", "9678351", "1400289", "9851945", "8616518", "6302074", "8774006", "2654660", "1443391", "14273037", "8997397", "2105454", "9243067", "1479266", "6189800", "778934", "8118901", "126203650", "735750", "15481825", "125621430", "6561482", "2331306", "4470709", "15911134", "12341061", "6644398", "8494170", "13124709", "1239775", "18207090", "1643090", "10149378", "43847307"], "inbound_citations": ["62566222", "17571058", "883339", "5676638", "14307736", "8312957", "157611", "367711", "1398236", "36857073", "9658546", "9410918", "14935417", "21710230", "7844879", "211730664", "6129233", "899238", "7531963", "14170790", "4420861", "10398813", "20195364", "563968", "8024312", "16049217", "8050490", "37939100", "15521541", "8915514", "209339399", "183637", "54702209", "28618967", "10351844", "22541202", "13339237", "14208149", "18058643", "11535892", "331348", "119773802", "9518584", "2068992", "18877783", "62540581", "12738143", "14177354", "18991131", "53053181", "204734586", "62225657", "3030866", "6774108", "5862539", "9508255", "6912345", "5875651", "3517434", "18011134", "198981246", "2875192", "1555473", "12129752", "145022095", "12722895", "6547474", "87439540", "5862108", "8298005", "304433", "8662607", "139512663", "181489255", "81980496", "62138327", "17418277", "120308229", "17332930", "18571517", "12024480", "18040001", "210889718", "3606040", "197674299", "14064645", "1114382", "8737445", "6296632", "25999762", "8585493", "30490839", "533674", "1157342", "2814112", "12474988"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:401761"}

The availability of early predictions of WL may ease the adaptation of the dry-curing process to the characteristics of the thighs and increase the effectiveness of selective breeding in enhancing WL. Aims of this study were (i) to develop Bayesian and Random Forests (RFs) regression models for the prediction of ham WL during dry-curing using on-site infrared spectra of raw ham subcutaneous fat, carcass and raw ham traits as predictors and (ii) to estimate genetic parameters for WL and their predictions (P-WL). Visible-near infrared spectra were collected on the transversal section of the subcutaneous fat of raw hams. Carcass traits were carcass weight, carcass backfat depth, lean meat content and weight of raw hams. Raw ham traits included measures of ham subcutaneous fat depth and linear scores for round shape, subcutaneous fat thickness and marbling of the visible muscles of the thigh. Measures of WL were available for 1672 hams. The best prediction accuracies were those of a Bayesian regression model including the average spectrum, carcass and raw ham traits, with R2 values in validation of 0.46, 0.55 and 0.62, for WL at end of salting (23 days), resting (90 days) and curing (12 months), respectively. When WL at salting was used as an additional predictor of total WL, the R2 in validation was 0.67. Bayesian regressions were more accurate than RFs models in predicting all the investigated traits. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of genetic parameters for WL and P-WL at the end of curing were estimated through a bivariate animal model including 1672 measures of WL and 8819 P-WL records. Results evidenced that the traits are heritable (h2 \u00b1 SE was 0.27 \u00b1 0.04 for WL and 0.39 \u00b1 0.04 for P-WL), and the additive genetic correlation is positive and high (ra = 0.88 \u00b1 0.03). Prediction accuracy of ham WL is high enough to envisage a future use of prediction models in identifying batches of hams requiring an adaptation of the processing conditions to optimise results of the manufacturing process. The positive and high genetic correlation detected between WL and P-WL at the end of dry-curing, as well as the estimated heritability for P-WL, suggests that P-WL can be successfully used as an indicator trait of the measured WL in pig breeding programs.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32014075", "doi": "10.1017/S1751731120000026", "venue": "Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience", "journal": "Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience", "mag_id": "3004829654", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211023994"}

Diabetes and its associated sequela, i.e., comorbidity are associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications. As diabetes is characterized by an altered metabolism of key metabolites and regulatory pathways. Metabolic phenotyping can provide us with a better understanding of the unique set of regulatory perturbations that predispose to diabetes and its associated complication/comorbidities. Methodology The present study utilizes the analytical platform NMR spectroscopy coupled with Random Forest statistical analysis to identify the discriminatory metabolites in diabetes (DB = 38) vs. diabetes-related complication (DC = 35) along with the healthy control (HC = 50) subjects. A combined and pairwise analysis was performed to identify the discriminatory metabolites responsible for class separation. The perturbed metabolites were further rigorously validated using t-test, AUROC analysis to examine the statistical significance of the identified metabolites. Results The DB and DC patients were well discriminated from HC. However, 15 metabolites were found to be significantly perturbed in DC patients compared to DB, the identified panel of metabolites are TCA cycle (succinate, citrate), methylamine metabolism (trimethylamine, methylamine, betaine), -intermediates; energy metabolites (glucose, lactate, pyruvate); and amino acids (valine, arginine, glutamate, methionine, proline, and threonine).

Location: Cantabrian region, northern Spain. Methods: We mapped the riparian forests at a physiognomic and phytosociological level by delimiting riparian zones and generating vegetation distribution models based on remote sensing data (Landsat 8 OLI and LiDAR PNOA). We built virtual watersheds to define a spatial framework where the catchment environmental information can be specified for each river reach, in combination with the vegetation map. In order to determine the drivers that play a significant role in the observed spatial patterns in riparian forests, based on our data sets we modelled interactions between environmental information and riparian vegetation by using the Random Forest algorithm. Results: The modelling results obtained reliably reproduced the variation of riparian forest structure and composition across Cantabrian watersheds. The produced maps were highly accurate, with a more than 70% overall accuracy for forest occurrence. A clear differentiation between Eurosiberian (habitats 91E0 and 9160) and Mediterranean (92E0) riparian forests was shown on both sides of the mountain range. Topography and land use were the main drivers defining the distribution of riparian forest as a physiognomic unit. In turn, altitude, climate and percentage of pasture were the most relevant factors determining their composition (phytosociological approach). Conclusions: Our study confirms that anthropic control ultimately defines the distribution of vegetation in the riparian area at a regional to local scale.

Five healthy mongrel dogs underwent subserosal prepyloric implantation of two NGES electrode pairs.

Custom-designed implantable stimulator delivered NGES with 8-16 V (peak-to-peak) amplitudes, and 60-100% duty cycles. Normalized motility index (MI) was utilized to quantify the contractions recorded from the force transducer. The MI increased with increasing voltage amplitudes. However, it remained remarkably constant across all duty cycles when voltage was held constant.

In our study, we achieve this purpose by proposing robustified large margin support vector machines. The robustness of the proposed robust support vector classifiers (RSVC), which is interpreted from a weighted viewpoint in this work, is due to the use of nonconvex classification losses. Besides the robustness, we also show that the proposed RSCV is simultaneously smooth, which again benefits from using smooth classification losses. The idea of proposing RSVC comes from M-estimation in statistics since the proposed robust and smooth classification losses can be taken as one-sided cost functions in robust statistics. Its Fisher consistency property and generalization ability are also investigated. Besides the robustness and smoothness, another nice property of RSVC lies in the fact that its solution can be obtained by solving weighted squared hinge loss-based support vector machine problems iteratively. We further show that in each iteration, it is a quadratic programming problem in its dual space and can be solved by using state-of-the-art methods. We thus propose an iteratively reweighted type algorithm and provide a constructive proof of its convergence to a stationary point.

This study reports the use of the theory of relevance vector machine (RVM), a recent Bayesian machine-learning framework of statistical pattern recognition, for development of a fully probabilistic algorithm for autofluorescence diagnosis of early stage cancer of human oral cavity. It also presents a comparative evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy of the RVM algorithm with that based on support vector machine (SVM) that has recently received considerable attention for this purpose. ::: ::: ::: STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: The diagnostic algorithms were developed using in vivo autofluorescence spectral data acquired from human oral cavity with a N(2) laser-based portable fluorimeter. The spectral data of both patients as well as normal volunteers, enrolled at Out Patient department of the Govt. Cancer Hospital, Indore for screening of oral cavity, were used for this purpose. The patients selected had no prior confirmed malignancy and were diagnosed of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Grade-I on the basis of histopathology of biopsy taken from abnormal site subsequent to acquisition of spectra. Autofluorescence spectra were recorded from a total of 171 tissue sites from 16 patients and 154 healthy squamous tissue sites from 13 normal volunteers. Of 171 tissues sites from patients, 83 were SCC and the rest were contralateral uninvolved squamous tissue. Each site was treated separately and classified via the diagnostic algorithm developed. Instead of the spectral data from uninvolved sites of patients, the data from normal volunteers were used as the normal database for the development of diagnostic algorithms. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The diagnostic algorithms based on RVM were found to provide classification performance comparable to the state-of-the-art SVMs, while at the same time explicitly predicting the probability of class membership. The sensitivity and specificity towards cancer were up to 88% and 95% for the training set data based on leave- one-out cross validation and up to 91% and 96% for the validation set data. When implemented on the spectral data of the uninvolved oral cavity sites from the patients, it yielded a specificity of up to 91%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The Bayesian framework of RVM formulation makes it possible to predict the posterior probability of class membership in discriminating early SCC from the normal squamous tissue sites of the oral cavity in contrast to dichotomous classification provided by the non-Bayesian SVM. Such classification is very helpful in handling asymmetric misclassification costs like assigning different weights for having a false negative result for identifying cancer compared to false positive. The results further demonstrate that for comparable diagnostic performances, the RVM-based algorithms use significantly fewer kernel functions and do not need to estimate any hoc parameters associated with the learning or the optimization technique to be used.

Focusing on these two problems, this paper proposes a Shrunk Support Vector Clustering (SSVC) algorithm that makes an effort to address two difficulties simultaneously. In the optimization piece SSVC pursues a shrunk hypersphere in feature space that only dense-region data are included in. In the labeling piece of SSVC, a new labeling approach is designed to cluster support vectors firstly, and then label other data. The development of the shrunk hypersphere is implemented by optimizing a strongly convex objective, which can be converted to a linear equation system. A fast training method is given to reduce the heavy computation burden that is necessary in SVC to solve a quadratic optimization problem. The new labeling approach is based on geometric nature of the shrunk model and works in a simple but informed way. That removes the randomness encoded in SVC labeling piece and then improves clustering accuracy.

To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient RObust Semi-Supervised Ensemble Learning (ROSSEL) method, which generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data using a set of weak annotators, and combines them to approximate the ground-truth labels to assist semi-supervised learning. We formulate the weighted combination process as a multiple label kernel learning (MLKL) problem which can be solved efficiently.

However, their performance in preserving object boundaries is still not satisfactory. Visual mechanism theory indicates that image segmentation tasks require not only recognition, like DCNNs, but also local visual attention capability. Considering that superpixel is good at grasping detailed local structure, we propose a probabilistic superpixel-based dense conditional random field model (PSP-CRF) to refine label assignments as a post-processing optimization method. First, the well-known fully convolutional networks (FCN) and Deeplab-ResNet are employed to produce coarse prediction probabilistic maps at each pixel. Second, we construct a fully connected CRF model based on the PSP generated by the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm. In our approach, an effective refining algorithm with entropy is developed to convert the pixel-level appearance and position features to the normalized PSP, which works well for CRF. Third, our method optimizes the PSP-CRF to obtain the final label assignment results by employing a highly efficient mean field inference algorithm and some quadratic programming relaxation related algorithms.

Classical approaches such as one-against-one or one-againstall have been used to address the multi-class problem, but these approaches become less appealing when the number of classes in the training set is too large. Recent approaches use hierarchical based classification for the multi-class problems since they scale well with the number of classes. SVM based hierarchical classifiers involve the partition of data samples through a clustering algorithm, and classification performance of the overall system heavily depends on the generated clusters. The clustering methods such as k-means, kernel k-means, spherical shells and balanced subset clustering have been used for this goal, but their distance measures, which are used for partitioning the data samples, are not compatible with the SVM classification goal. This paper introduces a new distance measure for partition of data samples for SVM based hierarchical classification. Unlike other clustering methods used for this goal, our proposed method is suitable when SVMs are used as the base classifier.

First, pre-processed brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are modelled using Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for feature generation. Second, Fisher-Discriminant Ratio (FDR) is used to reveal distinctive feature(s). Third, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is used for Individual-level patient classification. The applicability of the proposed methodology has been demonstrated using 831 T1-weighted MRIs obtained from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. We have achieved classification accuracy of up to 97% for differential diagnosis of PD with confidence interval of 99.9%. This method is particularly suited for diagnosing patients in early stages of the disease, i.e., patients in age of 31- 60 years.

In addition, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has become one of the most popular frameworks for training machine learning models. Motivated by the huge success of GAN and deep learning on a wide range of fields, this paper explores an effective way to exploit both techniques into the collaborative filtering task for the accurate recommendation. We have noticed that the IRGAN and GraphGAN are pioneering methods that successfully apply GAN to recommender systems. However, we point out an issue regarding the employment of standard matrix factorization (MF) as their basic model, which is linear and unable to capture the non-linear, subtle latent factors underlying user-item interactions. Our proposed recommendation framework, named Collaborative Adversarial Autoencoders (CAAE), significantly extends the conventional IRGAN and GraphGAN as summarized below: 1) we use Autoencoder, which is one of the most successful deep neural networks, as our generator, instead of using the MF model; 2) we employ Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) as our discriminative model; and 3) we incorporate another generator model into our framework that focuses on generating negative items, which are items that a given user may not be interested in. We empirically test our framework using three real-life datasets along with four evaluation metrics. Owing to those extensions, our proposed framework not only produces considerably higher recommendation accuracy than the conventional GAN-based recommenders (i.e., IRGAN and GraphGAN), but also outperforms the other state-of-the-art top-N recommenders (i.e., BPR, PureSVD, and FISM).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905876", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2924526555", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14542261", "56507745", "6161478", "1915014", "11212020", "15874232", "14294589", "10050878", "12228599", "3821594", "22475926", "16274986", "4833213", "3352400", "22852474", "2202933", "3439214", "4117071", "3686035", "49313840", "3331356", "19140125", "65132009", "10795036", "41686541", "30045184", "27322633", "206784218", "126188224", "10894094", "9957731", "3074096", "19115634", "1658773", "8702168", "5575601", "57966281", "51615073", "15611570", "4422720", "17638609", "8750954", "207204749", "17323745", "56146087", "19112275", "14753641", "53035242", "53036664", "2610055"], "inbound_citations": ["203156913", "186206572"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:96431918"}

This paper presents an algorithm that provides a means to downscale and forecast dependent variables such as ET images. Using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and support vector machines (SVMs), the algorithm finds multiple relationships between inputs and outputs at all different spatial scales and uses these relationships to predict the output at the finest resolution. Decomposing and reconstructing processes are done by using 2-D DWT with basis functions that suit the physics of the property in question. Two-dimensional DWT for one level will result in one datum image (low-low-pass filter image) and three detail images (low-high, high-low, and high-high). The underlying relationship between the input variables and the output are learned by training an SVM on the datum images at the resolution of the output. The SVM is then applied on the detailed images to produce the detailed images of the output, which are needed to help downscale the output image to a higher resolution. In addition to being downscaled, the output image can be shifted ahead in time, providing a means for the algorithm to be used for forecasting.

However, demand for walk-in services is highly uncertain on an hourly, daily or weekly basis. Additionally, emergency needs of students should be met immediately before they become a catastrophic event. Thus, demand prediction becomes an important aspect to dynamically schedule counselors to deal with unexpected demand scenarios.

Among those classifiers, the extended belief rule-based system (EBRBS) has shown its potential in both big data and multiclass situations, while the time complexity and computing efficiency are two challenging issues to be handled in EBRBS. As such, three improvements of EBRBS are proposed first in this paper to decrease the time complexity and computing efficiency of EBRBS for multiclass classification under the assumption of large amount of data, including the strategy to skip rule weight calculation, a simplified evidential reasoning algorithm, and the domain division-based rule reduction method. This turns out to be a micro version of the EBRBS, called Micro-EBRBS. Moreover, one of commonly used cluster computing, named Apache Spark, is then applied to implement the parallel rule generation and inference schemes of the Micro-EBRBS for big data multiclass classification problems. The comparative analyses of experimental studies demonstrate that the Micro-EBRBS not only can obtain a desired accuracy but also has the comparatively better time complexity and computing efficiency than some popular classifiers, especially for multiclass classification problems.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSMC.2018.2872843", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2898095739", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["1177262", "205706783", "6709766", "19757821", "18777652", "37545280", "40389865", "214797870", "52075140", "35910031", "15616932", "13815610", "7649812", "2135598", "9947746", "118207751", "245500", "30495088", "52013564", "34695283", "4637075", "44188985", "1161456", "2529879", "2897001", "61720527", "46223238", "53689098", "20100554", "28849655", "27339334", "769224"], "inbound_citations": ["208946880", "210118201"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125122689"}

Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in the eastern United States, especially under a high emissions trajectory. On average, of the 125 species, approximately 88 species would gain and 26 species would lose at least 10% of their suitable habitat. The projected change in the center of gravity for each species distribution (i.e., mean center) between current and future habitat moves generally northeast, with 81 species habitat centers potentially moving over 100 km under RCP 8.5.

It is believed that ILs can be applied to capture CO 2 and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. In this communication, the predictive capability of the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), and Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBF-ANN) has been evaluated for estimating carbon dioxide solubility in 67 different ILs as a function of the operational temperature (T), pressure (P) accompanied with the properties of ILs including the critical temperature (T c ), critical pressure (P c ) and, acentric factor (\u03c9). In this regard, an extensive data bank containing 5368 data gathered from the literature was employed. Results obtained from the LSSVM approach indicate its satisfactory predictions than other strategies. Moreover, an outlier analysis was utilized to detect suspected data points. Obtained values of R-squared (R 2 ), Mean Squared Error (MSE) were 0.9942 & 0.00035, 0.9135 & 0.004883, 0.9135 & 0.004883, and 0.9135 & 0.004883 for the LSSVM, ANFIS, MLP-ANN, and RBF-ANN respectively. Accordingly, the LSSVM strategy was introduced as a great tool for estimating CO 2 solubility in such ionic liquids, which is easy to apply and can avoid time-consuming experimental measurement and expensive experimental apparatuses as well as complicated interpretation procedures. In addition, it can help chemists and chemical engineers to have a low parameter model with satisfactory results for the estimation of CO 2 solubility in ILs.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijggc.2016.12.009", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control", "mag_id": "2573471634", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4935697", "199491582", "211144813", "103038539"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:100462505"}

Fractal features refers to the geometry of the skin lesion and its analysis quantifies complex shapes of the tumor.

Fractal dimensions are calculated on these images as it has been already experimentally proven that most of the information about the malignancy of the tumor is contained in the contours of the tumor shape. Fractal analysis helps in differentiating malignant tumor from a benign tumor. The texture and fractal feature analysis is done with the help of Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) technique.

The algorithm builds upon previous work on long-memory detection in EM measurements by fusing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with well-deployed power law fit tests and Rescaled-Range (R/S) time-series variability methods. To apply the algorithm, fractal power law in the wavelet domain is assessed so as to identify fractional Brownian motion (fBm) segments of continuously monitored pre-earthquake EM activity. The selected segments are then further processed through R/S Analysis in order to further refine the detection of prominent fBm behaviour. The combined output of the two methods is used to train a SVM classifier which is subsequently employed to verify similar fBm states in existing EM data and to allow for rapid fBm detection in large data sequences of unprocessed or newly incoming EM readings. The SVM classifier is added in a modular fashion, on top of pre-earthquake monitoring algorithms, and can be trained with a small fraction of a huge available dataset of EM readings. Three earthquake events in Greece, corresponding to different time occurrences and geographic locations, were investigated. For each of the three earthquakes, data collected by a nearby EM measurement station one month prior to the peak event were analysed by the proposed method. The results yielded an overall accuracy rate of at least 90% for the detection of specific, prominent fBm segments despite the fact that the fBm profile in the three investigated earthquake sequences was very different.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4172/2157-7617.1000263", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Earth Science & Climatic Change", "mag_id": "2332879649", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:87223317"}

For that, a wireless sensor network consisting of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, often called nodes or beacons must be employed in an area of interest in which their positions are not considered known. Beacons transmit and receive BLE signals and they report the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of them, counted in decibels. The RSS data can be explored in search of patterns that can classify presence versus non-presence of people near a wireless sensor network. Machine Learning and Signal Processing techniques are used to tackle the classification problem of Passive Presence Detection. Specifically, Random Forests and two versions of a Sparse Representationbased classification model are employed. Random Forests create an ensemble of classification trees, based on random features. Each of the trees votes for a class. The Sparse representation-based classifier exploits the theory of compressed sensing to find sparse representations of the RSS data, i.e new data matrices which contain only a few non-zero elements. Compressed sensing states that if a data set has a sparse representation in some overcomplete basis, then a high quality reconstruction is possible with much fewer measurements than we would normally need. This method finds an overcomplete basis for each class and classifies the input data based on the most accurate reconstruction. Two data sets were used under various experimental settings to verify the efficacy of the proposed methods.

Current algorithms are already quite good at learning to recognize handwritten digits, which enables to use them for sorting letters and reading personal checks. Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents, and have been extensively used in many fields due to their ability to approximate complex nonlinear mappings directly from the input sample. Different variations of Multi-Layer Neural Networks (MLNN), using back propagation training algorithm, yield a very high recognition rates on handwritten digits benchmarks, but lacks the aspect of speed in training time. Learning time is an important factor while designing any computational intelligent algorithm for classifications, especially when online improving by adapting new samples is needed. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been proposed as an alternative ANN, which significantly reduce the amount of time needed to train a MLNN and has been widely used for many applications. The ELM analytical process of learning reduces the time of learning comparing to back propagation by avoiding the process of iterative learning. In this paper, we present a process which boosts few Extreme learning machines using Ada-boosting in order to improve the recognition rates iteratively.

The classification scheme is the combination of embedded linguistic feature creation and tuning algorithm, feature selection, and rule-based classification in one neural network framework. The adjustable linguistic features are embedded in the network structure via fuzzy membership functions. The network performs the classification task on the high dimensional DLBCL microarray dataset either by the direct calculation or by the rule-based approach. The 10-fold cross validation is applied to ensure the validity of the results. Very good results from both direct calculation and logical rules are achieved.

We explore the effect that different training sets have on SISR with the network, Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN).

We find that curated training sets that contain objects in the test ontology perform better on both computer vision tasks while having a complex distribution of images allows object detection models to perform better.

Supervised classification is performed with the pre and post event of the study area with Random Forest classifier. To avoid the misclassification of more features more than 200 training pixels (includes water and non-water samples) from permanent water bodies and other surface features were considered. Improved classification performed with Random Forest Classifier with more number of decision trees. From this study, it is found that SLC data for water pixels classification is giving promising results in comparison with GRD data due to complex phase information of SLC data in extracting more feature information than GRD data.

Three applications of small-signal neural models are shown. First, some of the properties of cortical neurons described by Izhikevich are explained intuitively through small-signal analysis. Second, we use small-signal models for deriving parameters for a simple neural model (such as resonate and fire) from a more complicated but biophysically relevant one like Morris-Lecar. We show similarity in the subthreshold behavior of the simple and complicated model when they are close to a Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node bifurcation.

So far, none of them has achieved sufficient accuracy to be adopted into routine clinical practice. We propose a novel classification technique to address a simpler problem, which is the diagnosis of intracranial hypertension (IH). Our goal is to diagnose IH of head-injured patients based on a full set of morphological features extracted from cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) waveforms.

This paper proposed a method to classify Rbc\u2019s abnormalities based on deformed shaped RBCs image by using SVM and Deep learning in comparison on the RBCs cell Classification. Classifying normal cells of RBCs indicate a healthy patient and Classifying anemic abnormalities indicate presence of disease. And is very important in medical field to detect and classify disease in early stage because it saves and protects human lives. The patients waiting time for blood test is longer because the time taken to generate the result of the blood test is more due to high demand and less equipment. This lead to comparison of the two classifiers in order to predict the one that will best perform on RBCs in order to achieved maximum accuracy for the classification. This study shows that SVM classifier can classify the cells in all condition either small or large dataset while deep learning performs mainly on large and very large dataset which RBCs dataset will be generated in large amount in order to work successfully with the state of the earth on RBCs deformity.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.30880/ijie.2018.10.07.004", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Integrated Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2902721619", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29242238", "16944408", "62424113", "11540818", "57367216", "7030941", "9597088", "379259", "2930547", "904144", "10652042", "123288140", "11065216"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69848217"}

Thus, transfer learn- ing and domain adaptation algorithms are designed to ad- dress different issues, and cannot be used in both settings unless substantially modified. Still, one might argue that these problems are just different declinations of learning to learn, i.e. the ability to leverage over prior knowledge when attempting to solve a new task. We propose a learning to learn framework able to lever- age over source data regardless of the origin of the distri- bution mismatch. We consider prior models as experts, and use their output confidence value as features. We use them to build the new target model, combined with the features from the target data through a high-level cue integration scheme.

Video content analysis problems can be modeled using graphical models. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a commonly used graphical model, but the HMM has several limitations such as the assumption of observation independence, the form of observation distribution and the Markov chain interaction. Unlike the HMM, the HCRF is a discriminative model without conditional independence assumption of observations, and is more suitable for video content analysis. We formulate the video content analysis problem using a new HCRF framework based on the temporal interactions between video frames. In addition, according to the non-Gaussian property of video event features, a new feature function using the likelihoods of ICA mixture components is proposed for local observation to further enhance the HCRF model. The discriminative power of the HCRF and representation power of the ICA mixture for non-Gaussian distributions are combined in the new model.

The purpose of the present paper is health assessment and RUL estimation of the cutting tool machines.

The development of lidar system, especially incorporated with high-resolution camera components, has shown great potential for urban classification.

Especially, it can provide the measure of variable importance. Thus, in this study the performance of the Random Forests-based feature selection for urban areas was explored. First, we extract features from lidar data, including height-based, intensity-based GLCM measures; other spectral features can be obtained from imagery, such as Red, Blue and Green three bands, and GLCM-based measures. Finally, Random Forests is used to automatically select the optimal and uncorrelated features for landuse classification. 0.5-meter resolution lidar data and aerial imagery are used to assess the feature selection performance of Random Forests in the study area located in Mannheim, Germany.

Extraction and exploration of methodological information, in particular, requires systematic understanding of the literature, but in many cases is performed within a limited context of publications that can be manually reviewed by an individual or group. Automated methodology identification could provide an opportunity for systematic retrieval of relevant documents and for exploring developments within a given discipline. In this paper we present a system for the identification of methodology mentions in scientific publications in the area of natural language processing, and in particular in automatic terminology recognition. The system comprises two major layers: the first layer is an automatic identification of methodological sentences; the second layer highlights methodological phrases (segments). Each mention is categorised in four semantic categories: Task, Method, Resource/Feature and Implementation. Extraction and classification of the segments is formalised as a sequence tagging problem and four separate phrase-based Conditional Random Fields are used to accomplish the task. The system has been evaluated on a manually annotated corpus comprising 45 full text articles. The results for the segment level annotation show an F-measure of 53% for identification of Task and Method mentions (with 70% precision), whereas the F-measures for Resource/Feature and Implementation identification were 61% (with 67% precision) and 75% (with 86% precision) respectively. At the document-level, an F-measure of 72% (with 81% precision) for Task mentions, 60% (with 81% precision) for Method mentions, 74% (with 78% precision) for the Resource/Feature and 79% (with 81% precision) for the Implementation categories have been achieved.

An enormous amount of data concerning the trajectories of vehicles has been collected and stored for tracking purposes. A trajectory contains not only the footprints of a moving object but also additional information, such as speed and stopping points. Therefore, the large-scale trajectory data sets provide rich information and are currently attracting considerable attention; there have been many successful studies of event detection based on trajectory data. However, most of these studies have focused only on vehicles traveling in a road network and have note considered maritime trajectories. A maritime trajectory also contains auxiliary data (e.g., speed and rotation) in addition to the movements of a ship. However, ships are not bound to road networks, and consequently, it is difficult to apply traditional mining algorithms based on road networks. In addition, even if the amount of maritime trajectory data is very large, these data are also spatially sparse, which will significantly reduce the effectiveness of most existing mining algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new method of abnormal trajectory detection to address this problem. This method can detect abnormal vessel trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS), records for vessels via our feature learning algorithm. To reduce the search space, we invoke reference points as well as the Piecewise Linear Segmentation (PLS), algorithm to compress the trajectories without losing important information. A time-aware and spatially correlated collaborative algorithm is proposed to increase the density of the trajectories to improve the accuracy of the detection algorithm, which is based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).

However, routine blood indices tests are frequently ordered by physicians, as they are easy to perform and are cost effective. In addition, machine learning is broadly accepted for its ability to decipher complicated connections between multiple sets of test data and diseases. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: The aim of this study is to discover the potential association between lung cancer and routine blood indices and thereby help clinicians and patients to identify lung cancer based on these routine tests. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The machine learning method known as Random Forest was adopted to build an identification model between routine blood indices and lung cancer that would determine if they were potentially linked. Ten-fold cross-validation and further tests were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the identification model. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In total, 277 patients with 49 types of routine blood indices were included in this study, including 183 patients with lung cancer and 94 patients without lung cancer. Throughout the course of the study, there was correlation found between the combination of 19 types of routine blood indices and lung cancer. Lung cancer patients could be identified from other patients, especially those with tuberculosis (which usually has similar clinical symptoms to lung cancer), with a sensitivity, specificity and total accuracy of 96.3%, 94.97% and 95.7% for the cross-validation results, respectively. This identification method is called the routine blood indices model for lung cancer, and it promises to be of help as a tool for both clinicians and patients for the identification of lung cancer based on routine blood indices. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Lung cancer can be identified based on the combination of 19 types of routine blood indices, which implies that artificial intelligence can find the connections between a disease and the fundamental indices of blood, which could reduce the necessity of costly, elaborate blood test techniques for this purpose. It may also be possible that the combination of multiple indices obtained from routine blood tests may be connected to other diseases as well.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6714502", "pubmed_id": "31418423", "doi": "10.2196/13476", "venue": "JMIR medical informatics", "journal": "JMIR medical informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2968081492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["206665602", "84267328", "53306431", "206694381", "1609985", "75341761", "3943743", "35623964", "18223763", "21379393", "21482917", "5692372", "4827222", "13183435", "12375526", "39303965", "205499992", "24423898", "14075293", "46599173", "12838540", "6570716", "215402617", "206081194", "11388417", "205256133", "15611977", "6067341", "10205182", "24214192", "18534934", "13840176", "75911032", "89141", "215696206", "14547624", "10563830", "39559345", "20173245", "5656625", "26541345", "35567675", "30877411", "13307213", "70532333", "33904307", "39035348"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201020350"}

In general, the critical purpose of graph-oriented learning algorithms is to construct an informative graph for image clustering and classification tasks. In addition to the classical $K$ -nearest-neighbor and $r$ -neighborhood methods for graph construction, $l_{1}$ -graph and its variants are emerging methods for finding the neighboring samples of a center datum, where the corresponding ingoing edge weights are simultaneously derived by the sparse reconstruction coefficients of the remaining samples. However, the pairwise links of $l_{1}$ -graph are not capable of capturing the high-order relationships between the center datum and its prominent data in sparse reconstruction. Meanwhile, from the perspective of variable selection, the $l_{1}$ norm sparse constraint, regarded as a LASSO model, tends to select only one datum from a group of data that are highly correlated and ignore the others. To simultaneously cope with these drawbacks, we propose a new elastic net hypergraph learning model, which consists of two steps. In the first step, the robust matrix elastic net model is constructed to find the canonically related samples in a somewhat greedy way, achieving the grouping effect by adding the $l_{2}$ penalty to the $l_{1}$ constraint. In the second step, hypergraph is used to represent the high order relationships between each datum and its prominent samples by regarding them as a hyperedge. Subsequently, hypergraph Laplacian matrix is constructed for further analysis. New hypergraph learning algorithms, including unsupervised clustering and multi-class semi-supervised classification, are then derived.

Towards this goal, we evaluated automatic AD-EEG diagnosis accuracy changes before and after feature selection. Nineteen AD patients and 17 healthy subjects (HS) had their resting-state 32-channel EEG recorded for 25 minutes. Power spectrum density (PSD) in bands delta (1.5 - 6 Hz), theta (6.5 - 8 Hz), alpha 1 (8.5 - 10 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5 - 12 Hz), beta 1 (12.5 - 18 Hz), beta 2 (18.5 - 21 Hz) and beta 3 (21.5 - 30 Hz) were extracted from EEG signals. After that, participants were automatically classified as AD or HS with eight different machine learning algorithms under Regression, Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ensemble categories.

This allows to determine trees that perform extraordinarily well or bad, to analyze the reasons for their performance, and thus to gain insights into how to change parameter setting to increase performance or efficiency.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WACV.2019.00037", "venue": "2019 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)", "journal": "2019 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2922409173", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15269729", "207738357", "89141", "63115125", "36772765", "15137276", "37805334", "3605590", "31039418", "6074128", "9520327", "9930408", "6847493", "43151050", "59818709"], "inbound_citations": ["198986094", "210970801"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:71152004"}

Here, we propose to compare the two acclaimed method stated above. A component-based approach is adapted to train face images for recognition.

However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of potential input features. This paper describes a new method for training CRFs by applying Friedman's (1999) gradient tree boosting method. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of regression trees. Regression trees are learned by stage-wise optimizations similar to Adaboost, but with the objective of maximizing the conditional likelihood P(Y|X) of the CRF model. By growing regression trees, interactions among features are introduced only as needed, so although the parameter space is potentially immense, the search algorithm does not explicitly consider the large space. As a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially like previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1015330.1015428", "venue": "ICML '04", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2120247405", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["42087677", "120503853", "60993494", "7955044", "277918", "775373", "15403132", "13618539", "5914287"], "inbound_citations": ["2912366", "12556064", "13937849", "1353137", "11478579", "2844487", "16839920", "9887001", "18065762", "18590037", "12799668", "8803299", "15666670", "15206035", "17802743", "11396924", "17879104", "10128146", "17928415", "14713551", "40316241", "6248266", "2257065", "15269949", "15061867", "1850713", "18490300", "16864990", "13120204", "3531294", "407994", "125782945", "53427502", "35736671", "15714487", "10127976", "12503911", "17496349", "146118623", "14036881", "15218941", "7579827", "1361232", "18093152", "14946938", "8129746", "2438910", "1191883", "7485526", "6748363", "2207306", "5560171", "16237126", "1528918", "17076665", "16148702", "2724066", "211167414", "14833276", "11231900", "10181055", "17957495", "2887429", "7646509", "212415901", "14642127", "76306", "15009971", "215202197", "15320127", "11558738", "12525558", "6160280", "15889400", "18677994", "2882092", "5047129", "3587087", "3036071", "715424", "2648043", "370068"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9677111"}

Recently, multi-task feature selection methods are typically used for joint selection of common features across multiple modalities. In this chapter, we review several latest multi-modality feature learning works in diagnoses of AD. Specifically, multi-task feature selection (MTFS) is proposed to jointly select the common subset of relevant features for multiple variables from each modality. Based on MTFS, a manifold regularized multi-task feature learning method (M2TFS) is used to preserve both the intrinsic relatedness among multiple modalities of data and the data distribution information in each modality. However, most existing methods focus on mining the relationship across multiple modalities of the same subjects, while ignoring the potentially useful relationship across different subjects. In order to overcome this issue, label-aligned multi-task feature selection (LAMTFS) which can fully explore the realtionships across both modalities and subjects is proposed. Then a discriminative multi-task feature selection method is proposed to select the most discriminative features for multi-modality based classification.

This study follows a DSM approach using a Random Forest regression model, legacy soil samples, and terrain covariates to estimate topsoil silt and clay contents in a small catchment of 4.2 km2 in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Central China. We aim (i) to introduce a method to derive spatial uncertainty, and (ii) to improve the initial DSM approaches by additional sampling that is guided by the spatial uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty measure is based on multiple realizations of individual and randomized decision tree models. We used the spatial uncertainty of the initial DSM approaches to stratify the study area and thereby to identify potential sampling areas of high uncertainties. Further, we tested how precisely available legacy samples cover the variability of the covariates within each potential sampling area to define the final sampling area and to apply a purposive sampling design. For the final Random Forest model calibration, we combined the legacy sample set with the additional samples. This uncertainty-driven DSM refinement was evaluated by comparing it to a second approach. In this second approach, the additional samples were replaced by a random sample set of the same size, obtained from the entire study area. For the comparative analysis, external, bootstrap-, and cross-validation was applied. The DSM approach using the uncertainty-driven refinement performed best. The averaged spatial uncertainty was reduced by 31% for silt and by 27% for clay compared to the initial DSM approach.

Introduction Land-cover classification is one of the most common applications of remote sensing. Crop-type classification maps are useful for yield estimation and agricultural disaster compensation, in addition to the management of agricultural fields. Optical remote sensing remains one of the most attractive options for the accumulation of biomass information and forest monitoring (Samreth et al. 2012, Sarker and Nichol 2011). In addition, while optical satellites such as ALOS/AVNIR-2 (Sonobe et al. 2014a), Landsat (Hartfield et al. 2013), MODIS (Sakamoto et al. 2009), and NOAA (Hirano and Batbileg 2013) have been employed in the identification of species and conditions of vegetation, cloud cover significantly limits the number of available optical images, radar is unaffected by cloud cover or low solar zenith angles (Bindlish and Barros 2001). And significant information about soil and vegetation parameters can also be obtained through microwave remote sensing (Sonobe et al. 2014b). These techniques are employed increasingly to manage land and water resources for agricultural applications (Sonobe et al. 2014c). The number of studies on rice and wheat monitoring and mapping using SAR data has increased, and some studies utilizing multi-temporal SAR data have reported high correlations between backscattering coefficients, and plant height and age (Chakraborty et al. 2005, Sonobe et al. 2014d, Waisurasingha et al. 2008). These examples highlight possible uses in the area of agricultural management, specifically for the identification of paddy fields. They indicate the potential use of SAR data for the discrimination of crop types. Furthermore, a number of examples have shown the practical usefulness of supervised learning for classification (Sonobe et al. 2014b). This paper reports a comparison of crop classification using PALSAR data performed by extreme learning machine (ELM) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.6090/jarq.49.377", "venue": null, "journal": "Jarq-japan Agricultural Research Quarterly", "mag_id": "2292913920", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55330897"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16176823"}

However, the characterization of the received waveform is susceptible to various factors in propagation process, resulting in inaccurate representations for the individual emitters, so the discriminative performances of existing methods are usually challenging. To remedy these shortcomings, this paper presents a novel semi-supervised SEI using generative adversarial networks (GAN). We mitigated a representation deep network into Triple-GAN and construct a quadruple-structured framework. The overall feature information hidden in the original signals can be extracted by representation network to improve identification performance while the classification results of Triple-GAN can in turn help the representer learning more discriminative characteristics of individual emitters.

Due to the lack of training data, most researches either resort to simplistic machine learning methods or focus on automatically acquiring training data. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of using more complex and expressive machine learning models trained on a large amount of explicit roles. In addition, we compare the impact of one-way and multi-way selectional preference with the hypothesis that the added information in multi-way models are beneficial. Although our models surpass a baseline that uses prototypical vectors for SemEval-2010, we otherwise face mostly negative results. Selectional preference models perform lower than the baseline on ON5V, a dataset of five ambiguous and frequent verbs.

As ideas related to spatial cognition became known to a greater number of geographers (Downs and Stea 1973; Ittelson 1973), their proper place within geography became the subject of some debate (Tuan 1975; Graham 1976; Bunting and Guelke 1979; Downs 1979, 1981; Rushton 1979; Saarinen 1979). Lloyd\u2019s (1982) review of early progress made by behavioral geographers pointed out two general weaknesses. First, much of the early research was not based on explicit cognitive theories on how spatial knowledge is encoded, structured in human memory, or used to make decision. This was not because geographers refused to acknowledge and investigate spatial cognition theory. Research topics such as imagery had only just become a popular and important topic for psychologists (Cohen 1977; Solso 1979) because the behaviorist paradigm had not considered introspection to be an essential part of psychology. Subjects such as consciousness, mental states, and images were not considered to be worthy research topics (Woodworth 1948). Geographers who were trying to investigate cognitive issues at this time were not completely aware of the theoretical progress that had only recently been made in cognitive psychology.

The data generated from these technologies can be used to identify proteomic patterns that can successfully separate states (e.g. normal versus disease) and possibly discover novel disease biomarkers. Those patterns have high diagnostic significance, as they can be used for early diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression or therapeutic response. This strategy has already been used in various types of cancer, like ovarian, breast and prostate cancer, giving interesting results. ::: However, the complex nature of proteomics data makes their analysis a challenging task, as the initial raw data are very difficult to handle. More specifically, the data retrieved after an MS experiment contain hundreds of samples (i.e. mass spectra), and in each sample correspond tens of thousands of features. In addition to this high dimensionality \u2013 small sample size problem, each spectrum contains a great amount of noise and artifacts, mostly due to the high sensitivity of the instrument, sample contamination and electrical noise. Another common problem is the miscalibration of the spectra that makes the data impossible to compare. For all those reasons, it is more than obvious that in order to extract knowledge about the true underlying biological differences in the proteome, various preprocessing steps need to be applied. ::: The main goal of preprocessing is to come up with a matrix of important features (i.e. peaks) and their corresponding intensity values, which can be further analyzed using a variety of computational methods. To achieve this, one must first remove noise, artifacts and systematic bias without loss of information and then detect and quantify a set of peaks. Preprocessing involves various steps that are highly interrelated and it has been shown that if those steps are not applied carefully, it will be difficult to extract meaningful conclusions about the underlying disease. For each step, a number of methods have been proposed making the decision about the best combination of methods a very challenging task. Furthermore, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of each method and come up with a standard strategy, as for each dataset a different set of methods appear to be more effective. ::: This thesis presents a new pipeline method for the analysis of proteomics data, which incorporates a new preprocessing method. This proposed method deals with the problematic characteristics of this type of data and exploits the advantages of various existing methods. More specifically, our proposed strategy focuses on three main problems: correcting the miscalibration of the mass spectra, detecting the peaks in a sensitive yet robust manner and extracting the true intensity values that correspond in each peak. For the peak finding step, we used a method based on the mean spectrum approach, where we first find the peaks per category, then apply certain criteria to ensure their reproducibility and then combine them in a single peak list. Instead of working with peak locations, we propose the use of peak intervals, to ensure that the small shifts present in the data do not interfere with the final results. In order to evaluate the results of our method, a final feature extraction and classification step was applied in the preprocessed data, using the Support Vector Machines classification algorithm. ::: Our proposed pipeline method was applied in a MALDI MS dataset, obtained by the Proteomics Research Unit of the Biomedical Research Foundation. This particular dataset contained approximately 200 samples, concerning patients with bladder cancer (high or low grade) and benign bladder disease. After the application of the proposed preprocessing method we ended up with a matrix of 456 peak bins and corresponding intensities. The application of the classification algorithm achieved extremely high performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, 31 statistically important peaks were identified, some of which are not detected by existing methods.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "54504620", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107319381"}

Due to the lack of an objective physiological data supporting and a unified data analysis method, doctors can only rely on the subjective experience of the data to distinguish normal people and patients, which easily lead to misdiagnosis.

Firstly, the prefrontal brain networks were constructed based on oxy-Hb signals from 52-channel fNIRS data of schizophrenia and healthy controls. Then, Complex Brain Network Analysis (CBNA) was used to extract features from the prefrontal brain networks. Finally, a classier based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is designed and trained to discriminate schizophrenia from healthy controls. We recruited a sample which contains 34 healthy controls and 42 schizophrenia patients to do the one-back memory task. The hemoglobin response was measured in the prefrontal cortex during the task using a 52-channel fNIRS system.

The information quality enhancements are aimed at improving the training of the data-driven classification techniques used for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) of the process. A simulation case study of a Continuous Stirred Tank-Reactor (CSTR) is used to produce training datasets containing noisy, outlier and missing values. Three metamodeling techniques namely; Ordinary Kriging (OK), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Polynomial Regression (PR) are used to smooth the noise and outliers, and to impute the missing values. Next, the FDD performance of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is compared when it trained with the recuperated datasets by the metamodels, while datasets have noisy, outlier and missing values. The results show high enhancement in the performance of the SVM when it trained with the recuperated data using the metamodels, especially when OK is exploited.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-444-63428-3.50234-4", "venue": null, "journal": "Computer-aided chemical engineering", "mag_id": "2506885275", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114197327"}

Consequently, the study of Alzheimer's drugs has become one of the most popular medical topics. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this study, in order to build a predicting model for Alzheimer's drugs and targets, the attribute discriminators CfsSubsetEval, ConsistencySubsetEval and FilteredSubsetEval are combined with search methods such as BestFirst, GeneticSearch and Greedystepwise to filter the molecular descriptors. Then the machine learning algorithms such as BayesNet, SVM, KNN and C4.5 are used to construct the 2D-Structure Activity Relationship(2D-SAR) model. Its modeling results are utilized for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve(ROC) analysis. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The prediction rates of correctness using Randomforest for AChE, BChE, MAO-B, BACE1, Tau protein and Non-inhibitor are 77.0%, 79.1%, 100.0%, 94.2%, 93.2% and 94.9%, respectively, which are overwhelming as compared to those of BayesNet, BP, SVM, KNN, AdaBoost and C4.5. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: In this paper, we conclude that Random Forest is the best learner model for the prediction of Alzheimer's drugs and targets.

Because the covariance matrix computes the sum of the squared l2-norm distances, it is prone to both outlier samples and outlier features. To develop a robust distance metric learning method, we propose a new objective for distance metric learning using the l1-norm distances.

One major limitation of TSVM is that it involves an expensive matrix inverse operation when solving the dual problem. In addition, TSVM is less effective when dealing with the imbalanced data. In this paper, we propose a maximum margin of twin spheres support vector machine (MMTSSVM) for imbalanced data classification. MMTSSVM only needs to find two homocentric spheres. On one hand, the small sphere captures as many samples in the majority class as possible; on the other hand, the large sphere pushes out most samples in the minority class by increasing the margin between two homocentric spheres. MMTSSVM involves a QPP and a linear programming problem as opposed to a pair of QPPs as in classical TSVM or a larger-sized QPP in SVM, thus it greatly increases the computational speed. More importantly, MMTSSVM avoids the matrix inverse operation. The property of parameters in MMTSSVM is discussed and testified by one artificial experiment. Experimental results on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMTSSVM in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Based on the considerations above, we propose a novel Attribute-Aware Attention Model ($A^3M$), which can learn local attribute representation and global category representation simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. The proposed model contains two attention models: attribute-guided attention module uses attribute information to help select category features in different regions, at the same time, category-guided attention module selects local features of different attributes with the help of category cues. Through this attribute-category reciprocal process, local and global features benefit from each other.

Dissertation supervised by Professor Miroslav Kubat. No. of pages in text. (183) Traditional computational approach to automated classification assumes that each object should be assigned to only one out of two or more classes. However, some realworld applications digress from this generic scenario in two important ways. First, each example can belong to several classes simultaneously (multi-label classification). Second, the classes can be hierarchically ordered in the sense that some are more specific versions of others (hierarchical classification). Seeking to address both of these issues, the presented work deals with \u201chierarchical multi-label classification.\u201d The task has recently received considerable attention; databases in various fields, including web repositories, digital libraries, or genomics, are known to be organized as hierarchies. Seeking to start with something relatively simple, scientists have focused on the special case where the inter-class relations are captured by tree-structured hierarchy. This, however, is not enough. Very often, some classes have more than one parent, in which case the mutual relations (if they are known) have to be described by a hierarchy structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This dissertation intends to contribute to this more general problem. Literature survey indicates that, in non-hierarchical multi-label classification, good performance is achieved when a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to induce each class separately. This said, some experiments suggest that further improvement can be achieved by explicitly dealing with the problem of imbalanced training sets because, in most classes, negative examples heavily outnumber positive ones. The author proposes a solution in terms of a technique referred to as R-SVM; the idea is to re-adjust the SVM-hyperplane offset accordingly. Experiments in the first part of this dissertation rely on data from domains of text-categorization. More important, however, is then the second part that focuses on hierarchical multi-label classification. Here, the author proposes a new technique, HR-SVM, that essentially constitutes a hierarchical extension of R-SVM proceeding in a top-down fashion from more general to more specific classifiers. The weakness of this approach is known as \u201cerror propagation\u201d: examples misclassified at higher levels are propagated down the hierarchy, thus resulting in negative performances at the lower levels. HR-SVM contains a mechanism to correct this kind of errors. The system has been subjected to extensive experiments with many domains from the field of gene function prediction. The results show that the new technique compares favorably with other existing approaches along various performance criteria.

Various applications on the Web have unprecedentedly changed humans' life. Although the explosive growth and spread of the Web have resulted in a huge information repository, yet it is still under-utilized due to the difficulty in automated information extraction (IE) caused by the heterogeneity of Web content. Thus, Web IE is an essential task in the utilization of Web information. Typically, a Web page may describe either a single object or a group of similar objects. For example, the description page of a digital camera describes different aspects of the camera. On the contrary, the faculty list page of a department presents the information of a group of professors. Corresponding to the above two types, Web IE methods can be broadly categorized into two classes, namely, description details oriented extraction and object records oriented extraction. In this thesis, we focus on the later task, namely semi-structured data record extraction from a single Web page. ::: In this thesis, we develop two frameworks to tackle the task of data record extraction. We first present a record segmentation search tree framework in which a new search structure, named Record Segmentation Tree (RST), is designed and several efficient search pruning strategies on the RST structure are proposed to identify the records in a given Web page. The subtree groups corresponding to possible data records are dynamically generated in the RST structure during the search process. Therefore, this framework is more flexible compared with existing methods such as MDR and DEPTA that have a static manner of generating subtree groups. Furthermore, instead of using string edit distance or tree edit distance, we propose a token-based edit distance which takes each DOM node as a basic unit in the cost calculation. ::: Many existing methods, including the RST framework, for data record extraction from Web pages contain pre-coded hard criteria and adopt an exhaustive search strategy for traversing the DOM tree. They fail to handle many challenging pages containing complicated data records and record regions. In this thesis, we also present another framework Skoga which can perform robust detection of different kinds of data records and record regions. Skoga, composed of a DOM structure knowledge driven detection model and a record segmentation search tree model, can conduct a global analysis on the DOM structure to achieve effective detection. The DOM structure knowledge consists of background knowledge as well as statistical knowledge capturing different characteristics of data records and record regions as exhibited in the DOM structure. Specifically, the background knowledge encodes some logical relations governing certain structural constraints in the DOM structure. The statistical knowledge is represented by some carefully designed features that capture different characteristics of a single node or a node group in the DOM. The feature weights are determined using a development data set via a parameter estimation algorithm based on structured output Support Vector Machine model which can tackle the inter-dependency among the labels on the nodes of the DOM structure. An optimization method based on divide and conquer principle is developed making use of the DOM structure knowledge to quantitatively infer the best record and region recognition. ::: Finally, we present a framework that can make use of the detected data records to automatically populate existing Wikipedia categories. This framework takes a few existing entities that are automatically collected from a particular Wikipedia category as seed input and explores their attribute infoboxes to obtain clues for the discovery of more entities for this category and the attribute content of the newly discovered entities. One characteristic of this framework is to conduct discovery and extraction from desirable semi-structured data record sets which are automatically collected from the Web. A semi-supervised learning model with Conditional Random Fields is developed to deal with the issues of extraction learning and limited number of labeled examples derived from the seed entities. We make use of a proximate record graph to guide the semi-supervised leaning process. The graph captures alignment similarity among data records. Then the semi-supervised learning process can leverage the benefit of the unlabeled data in the record set by controlling the label regularization under the guidance of the proximate record graph.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2283455362", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25324934"}

For this purpose, incident reports submitted to the Advanced Incident Management System by public hospitals from one Australian region were used.

Especially, electric utilities including power-line and tower are crucial infrastructures that require considerable resources to be monitored and managed effectively. For the establishment of the power-line scene inventory, its geospatial information such as positions and attributes of power-line networks should be accurately recorded. This paper presents a 3D classification method to classify power-line scene where a few structures including trees, transmission lines and pylons would be vertically overlapped. The research proposes two different scales of feature extractions from a volumetric space and its embedded points for taking advantages of full 3D analysis against conventional 2D pixel-based analysis. With targeted object instances including ground, vegetation, power-line, pylon and building, 21 features to characterize each class are extracted from different segment scale. The Random Forest is investigated as an ensemble decision classifier to classify power-line scenes with extracted features. An ultimate goal of the research is to apply a knowledge-based classifier trained with small training sample to large-scale unlabelled power-line corridors. In order to achieve this goal, this paper conducts a sensitivity analysis in terms of feature extraction scale, feature importance and class distribution over test datasets with or without the separation from training data.

The first construction algorithm employs a function selection manager module in an MEN system. The second construction algorithm is based on a new parallel learning algorithm in which each model rule is trained independently, for which the parameter convergence property of the new learning method is established. As with the first approach, an expert selection criterion is utilised in this algorithm.

Despite significant progress has been made in the past decades, contour detection from natural images remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between edges of objects and surrounding backgrounds. To address this problem, we first capture multi-scale features from pixel-level to segment-level using local and global information. These features are mapped to a space where discriminative information is captured by computing posterior divergence of Gaussian mixture models and sufficient statistics based on deep Boltzmann machine. Then we introduce a stacking random forest learning framework for contour detection. We evaluate the proposed algorithm against leading methods in the literature on the Berkeley segmentation and Weizmann horse data sets.

The field of compositional data analysis has greatly improved our understanding of the nature of such compositions and has provided us with insights on statistically rigorous ways of analysing such constrained data. Employment of standard multivariate statistical procedures on compositional data necessitates the use of appropriate transformation procedures, which removes the non-independence of data points, thus rendering the data suitable for such analysis. Here we present the current situation of the analysis of compositional data in chemical ecology; the awareness of this constraint of compositional data; and alternative ways of analysing such constrained data using Random Forests, a data-mining algorithm which has many features that facilitate the analysis of such data.

SVMs have been successfully applied to various pattern classification problems, such as handwritten digit recognition, text categorization and face detection, due to their powerful learning ability and good generalization ability. However, SVMs require to solve a quadratic optimization problem and need training time that are at least quadratic to the number of training samples. Therefore, many large-scale problems by using traditional SVMs are too hard to be solved. To overcome this difficulty, Lu and colleagues have proposed a mi n-max modular support vector machine (M3-SVM) and part-versus-part task decomposition method [16]. A very important advantage of M 3SVMs over traditional SVMs is that a two-class problem can be further decomposed into a series of two-class subproblems. The M3-network model [15] has been applied successfully to many real-world applications such as part-of-speec h tagging [17], single-trial EEG signal classification [18], prediction of protein subcellular multi-locations [26], face recognition [2, 13] and text categorization [14]. The basic idea behind M3-network is the \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy. The task decomposition scheme of M 3-network is based on class relations, and the instances in the same class can be further decomposed randomly [15], according to parallel hyperplanes [24], or prior knowledge [13]. The learning procedure of each subproblems is independent, and therefore parallel learning can be implemented easily. The combination strategy follows two principles, the minimization principle and the maximization principle [15]. We explore the use of M3-SVMs in multi-view face recognition. Multi-view face recognition is a more challenging task than frontal view face recognition. Face recognition techniques have been developed over the past few decades. But many of those existing face recognition techniques, such as Eigenfaces and Fisher-faces [22, 1], are only effective for frontal view faces. The difficulties of multi-view face recognition is obvious because of the complicated nonlinear manifolds existing in the data space.

In this paper, we introduce a random forest semantic hashing scheme that embeds tiny convolutional neural networks (CNN) into shallow random forests, with near-optimal information-theoretic code aggregation among trees. We start with a simple hashing scheme, where random trees in a forest act as hashing functions by setting `1' for the visited tree leaf, and `0' for the rest. We show that traditional random forests fail to generate hashes that preserve the underlying similarity between the trees, rendering the random forests approach to hashing challenging. To address this, we propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups, obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem, which can be handled using a light-weight CNN weak learner. Such random class grouping scheme enables code uniqueness by enforcing each class to share its code with different classes in different trees. A non-conventional low-rank loss is further adopted for the CNN weak learners to encourage code consistency by minimizing intra-class variations and maximizing inter-class distance for the two random class groups. Finally, we introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class. The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods for image retrieval tasks on large-scale public datasets, while performing at the level of other state-of-the-art image classification techniques while utilizing a more compact and efficient scalable representation.

The results of experiment shows that, based on load current and SVM, this model could realize the condition monitoring of two or more lathes and instead of the method of measurement and state diagnosis in the past that can only works on individual device.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MACE.2010.5536570", "venue": "2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering", "journal": "2010 International Conference on Mechanic Automation and Control Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2116347116", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["110284980", "108753360", "114676028"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2938615"}

As the base constituents of the ensemble are tree-structured predictors, and since each of these is constructed using an injection of randomness, the method is called \u2018random forests\u2019. That the exceptional performance is attained with seemingly only a single tuning parameter, to which sensitivity is minimal, makes the methodology all the more remarkable. The individual trees comprising the forest are all grown to maximal depth. While this helps with regard bias, there is the familiar tradeoff with variance. However, these variability concerns were potentially obscured because of an interesting feature of those benchmarking datasets extracted from the UCI machine learning repository for testing: all these datasets are hard to overfit using tree-structured methods. This raises issues about the scope of the repository. With this as motivation, and coupled with experience from boosting methods, we revisit the formulation of random forests and investigate prediction performance on real-world and simulated datasets for which maximally sized trees do overfit. These explorations reveal that gains can be realized by additional tuning to regulate tree size via limiting the number of splits and/or the size of nodes for which splitting is allowed.

However, most of the studies on hashtag embedding try to capture the semantic distribution of hashtags and often fail to capture the sentiment polarity. Furthermore, generating a task-specific hashtag embedding can distort its semantic representation, which is undesirable for sentiment representation of hashtag.

However, it\u2019s still very challenging for translation tasks that require high quality, especially at high-resolution and photo-reality. In this work, we present Discriminative Region Proposal Adversarial Network (DRPAN) for high-quality image-to-image translation. We decompose the image-to-image translation procedure into three iterated steps: the first is to generate an image with global structure but some local artifacts (via GAN), the second is to use our Discriminative Region Proposal network (DRPnet) for proposing the most fake region from the generated image, and the third is to implement \u201cimage inpainting\u201d on the most fake region for yielding more realistic result through a reviser, so that the system (DRPAN) can be gradually optimized to synthesize images with more attention on the most artifact local part. We explore patch-based GAN to construct DRPnet for proposing the discriminative region to produce masked fake samples, further, we propose a reviser for GANs to distinguish real from masked fake for providing constructive revisions to the generator for producing realistic details, and serve as auxiliaries of the generator to synthesize high-quality results. In addition, we combine pix2pixHD with DRPAN to synthesize high-resolution results with much finer details. Moreover, we improve CycleGAN by DRPAN to address unpaired image-to-image translation with better semantic alignment.

However, with the ramping trend of the number of IoT devices spread in the physical environment, this approach might simply not scale. The data gravity concept, one of the basis of Fog and Mobile Edge Computing, points towards a decentralisation of computation for data analysis, whereby the latter is performed closer to where data is generated. Along this trend, in this paper we explore the accuracy vs. network traffic trade-off when using Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) to learn patterns from data generated in a set of distributed physical locations. HTL is a standard machine learning technique used to train models on separate disjoint training sets, and then transfer the partial models (instead of the data) to reach a unique learning model. We have previously applied HTL to the problem of learning human activities when data are available in different physical locations (e.g., areas of a city). In our approach, data is not moved from where it is generated, while partial models are exchanged across sites. The HTL-based approach achieves lower (though acceptable) accuracy with respect to a conventional solution based on global cloud computing, but drastically cuts the network traffic. In this paper we explore the trade-off between accuracy and traffic, by assuming that data are moved to a variable number of data collectors where partial learning is performed. Centralised cloud and completely decentralised HTL are the two extremes of the spectrum. Our results show that there is no significant advantage in terms of accuracy, in using fewer collectors, and that therefore a distributed HTL solutions, along the lines of a fog computing approach, is the most promising one.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/RTSI.2016.7740634", "venue": "2016 IEEE 2nd International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow (RTSI)", "journal": "2016 IEEE 2nd International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry Leveraging a better tomorrow (RTSI)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2554264368", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18761676", "207196503", "207232279", "17379959", "207738357", "6644398", "156255", "572361", "14227081", "372467", "8604637", "18257206", "7174662", "15514159", "9088317", "207110862"], "inbound_citations": ["204082476", "32331253", "3666007", "23566969", "207888790"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27209010"}

Both electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral features and its temporal features have proven to be useful in addressing this problem. The fusion of the two types of features can provide rich distinguishing information for improving mental workload assessment. Benefiting from the progress of deep learning, this study proposes the two-stream neural networks (TSNN) for fusing the two types of EEG features. Compared with hand-crafted features, the TSNN can learn and fuse EEG features from the spectral and temporal dimensions automatically without prior knowledge. The TSNN includes a spectral stream and a temporal stream. Each stream consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to learn spectral or temporal features from EEG topographic maps. To fuse the learned spectral and temporal information, we concatenate the output of the two streams prior to the fully connected layer. EEG data were collected from 17 subjects who performed n-back tasks with easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels, leading to a three-class mental workload classification. The results show that the TSNN achieves an average accuracy of 91.9%, which is a significant improvement over baseline classifiers based on hand-crafted features. The TSNN also outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods developed for EEG classification. The results indicate that the proposed structure is promising for fusing spectral and temporal features for mental workload assessment. In addition, it provides a high-precision approach for potential applications during cognitive activities.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31034417", "doi": "10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2913400", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2941752771", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["19552900", "2062590", "22340023", "20133108", "3327565", "11816439", "206616087", "10716126", "22613906", "206791327", "2668727", "206761818", "2958085", "4871685", "46830682", "1123764", "17267607", "54562361", "1937976", "9098358", "51681103", "4747877", "13900622", "6534740", "1101322", "15682202", "20623094", "12945001", "14124313", "8738977", "1915014", "56507745", "6254678", "5808102", "13740328", "6628106", "5707386", "122415379", "122009246", "7553535", "3960646", "29454518", "144856389", "25345481", "7022991", "15942923", "115804905"], "inbound_citations": ["211112123", "201276656", "201641145", "211243244"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140378004"}

However, existing representation methods generally only use spatial structure information among patches which fails to exploit the unary feature information of each patch. In addition, traditional methods generally use a human fixed neighborhood graph for patch structure representation which may have no clear structure and also be sensitive to the noise. To overcome these problems, we propose a graph learning and flexible manifold ranking model for weighted patch representation. First, we propose to adopt a flexible manifold ranking for patch weight computation which explores both unary feature and structure relationship in a unified manner and thus performs more discriminatively than existing models which generally only explore structure relationship in patch representation. Second, we learn an adaptive and robust graph to better capture the intrinsic relationship among patches and thus can help to obtain a more robust patch representation.

(Mayhew et al., 2001). Brain-computer interfaces (BCI), already used with severely paralyzed patients, may be adapted for communicating with Alzheimer patients by shifting the paradigm from instrumental-operant learning to classical conditioning (Birbaumer, 2006), e.g. by associating \u201cyes\u201d thinking to a positive emotion and \u201cno\u201d thinking to a negative emotion. We designed an fMRI-based BCI setting aimed at conditioning subjects to associate positive and negative emotional stimuli with respectively congruent and incongruent word pairs, in view of a BCI application for basic yes/no communication. Methods fMRI was performed on 6 healthy subjects during a classical conditioning session, comprising the phases of habituation, acquisition and extinction. The unconditioned stimuli consisted of a positive (baby laughter) and negative (scream) emotional sound. The conditioned stimuli, presented aurally, were congruent (e.g. \u201canimal-elephant\u201d) and incongruent (e.g. \u201canimal-Germany\u201d) word pairs. During the conditioning acquisition phase, congruent word pairs were associated to the baby laughter and incongruent word pairs were associated to the scream. A linear Support Vector Machine was implemented to classify the BOLD signal corresponding to congruent and incongruent word pairs. To investigate the relative importance of distinct brain areas in decoding different brain states, feature vectors from the frontal cortex were also used as input to build a separate classifier. Results Participants rated in the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) the scream and the laughter as having, respectively, negative and positive valence. Moreover, the scream was associated to higher arousal compared to the baby laughter. Classification of the BOLD signal as a response to the congruent and incongruent word pairs immediately followed by the emotional unconditioned stimuli showed above chance level performance (57-64%) in one subject, while the performance was chance level on the remaining subjects (44-56%). Conclusions We presented a possible paradigm for basic yes/no communication, based on the conditioning of BOLD signal by the repeated association of emotional and semantic stimuli. The performance of the classifier by feature selection needs to be improved before being tested with Alzheimer patients.

Depending on the task complexity, thousands to millions of labeled image pairs are needed to train a conditional GAN. However, human labeling is expensive, even impractical, and large quantities of data may not always be available. Inspired by dual learning from natural language translation, we develop a novel dual-GAN mechanism, which enables image translators to be trained from two sets of unlabeled images from two domains. In our architecture, the primal GAN learns to translate images from domain U to those in domain V, while the dual GAN learns to invert the task. The closed loop made by the primal and dual tasks allows images from either domain to be translated and then reconstructed. Hence a loss function that accounts for the reconstruction error of images can be used to train the translators. Experiments on multiple image translation tasks with unlabeled data show considerable performance gain of DualGAN over a single GAN. For some tasks, DualGAN can even achieve comparable or slightly better results than conditional GAN trained on fully labeled data.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1704.02510", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id":

In this paper we compared Support Vector Machine classifiers trained and tested on WEBSPAM\u2013UK data sets from different years. To obtain stable results we proposed new lexical-based features. The HTML document \u2013 transformed into a text without HTML tags, a set of visible symbols, and a list of links including the ones from tags \u2013 gave information about weird combinations of letters; consonant clusters; statistics on syllables, words, and sentences; and the Gunning Fog Index. Using data collected in 2006 as a learning set, we obtained very stable accuracy among years. This choice of the training set reduced the sensitivity in 2007, but that can be improved by managing the acceptance threshold. Finally, we proved that the balance between the sensitivity and the specificity measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is improved by our selection of features.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cose.2014.07.006", "venue": "Comput.

Because of complexity problems, the underlying first order language is often restricted to variables, predicates and constants. In this paper, we propose a new approach for learning logic programs containing function symbols other than constants. The underlying idea is to consider a domain that enables to interpret the function symbols and to compute the interest of a given value for discriminating positive and negative examples. This is modelized in the framework of Constraint Logic Programming and the algorithm that we propose enables to learn some constraint logic programs. This algorithm has been implemented in the system ICC. In order to reduce the complexity, biases have been introduced, as for instance the form of constraints that can be learned, the depth of a term or the size of the constraints.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-61863-5_44", "venue": "ALT", "journal": null, "mag_id": "105928333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16844646", "16493804", "17848619", "18881507", "18880633", "1966156", "50272798"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31107482"}

They share the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, the training set and test set usually come from different domains. Thus, there might be negative similarities between different domains so that the negative transfer problem caused by negative similarity may happen. In this paper, we propose a novel method named active transfer learning (ATL) to solve the above problem. Specifically, the orthogonal projection matrix and the weight coefficient vector are introduced to extend maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) so that it can minimize MMD and simultaneously eliminate the negative transfer. To find the informative and discriminative subsets from the source domain, we then propose an information diversity term by using the local geometric structure information of the source samples. Besides, by using the label information of source samples, our method can guarantee the selected subsets as discriminative as possible. Finally, to efficiently implement the proposed method, an alternating optimization approach, which is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), is designed to solve the optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ATL model, experiments are conducted on five real-world data sets. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2019.2900467", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2915387487", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6396895", "740063", "9440223", "556999", "9247797", "17610729", "17216004", "14717992", "8636415", "641039", "1990988", "14456120", "16081723", "10742222", "39877397", "6742009", "206742596", "597779", "1208582", "8326832", "122694523", "3989653", "119584305", "5709930", "51789432", "52874011", "6708429", "13798326", "407822", "21697481", "9728005", "6321201", "1283257", "130535382"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86486160"}

This tree is distributed as a relict subspecies, at elevations of between 1,010 and 1,631 m in the geographically isolated arid Sierra La Asamblea, an area characterized by mean annual precipitation levels of between 184 and 288 mm. The aim of this research was (i) to estimate the distribution of P. monophylla var. californiarum in Sierra La Asamblea by using Sentinel-2 images, and (ii) to test and describe the relationship between the distribution of P. monophylla and five topographic and 18 climate variables. We hypothesized that (i) Sentinel-2 images can be used to predict the P. monophylla distribution in the study site due to the finer resolution (\u00d73) and greater number of bands (\u00d72) relative to Landsat-8 data, which is publically available free of charge and has been demonstrated to be useful for estimating forest cover, and (ii) the topographical variables aspect, ruggedness and slope are particularly important because they represent important microhabitat factors that can determine the sites where conifers can become established and persist. An atmospherically corrected a 12-bit Sentinel-2A MSI image with 10 spectral bands in the visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared light region was used in combination with the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Supervised classification of this image was carried out using a backpropagation-type artificial neural network algorithm. Stepwise multiple linear binominal logistical regression and Random Forest classification including cross validation were used to model the associations between presence/absence of P. monophylla and the five topographical and 18 climate variables. Using supervised classification of Sentinel-2 satellite images, we estimated that P. monophylla covers 6,653 \u00b1 319 ha in the isolated Sierra La Asamblea. The NDVI was one of the variables that contributed most to the prediction and clearly separated the forest cover (NDVI > 0.35) from the other vegetation cover (NDVI < 0.20). Ruggedness was the most influential environmental predictor variable, indicating that the probability of occurrence of P. monophylla was greater than 50% when the degree of ruggedness terrain ruggedness index was greater than 17.5 m. The probability of occurrence of the species decreased when the mean temperature in the warmest month increased from 23.5 to 25.2 \u00b0C. Ruggedness is known to create microclimates and provides shade that minimizes evapotranspiration from pines in desert environments.

The use of advanced techniques for fault detection and isolation (FDI), and the subsequent fault tolerant control implementation in wind turbines is one of the proposed solutions to reduce losses in efficiency and ensure their continued operation.

In our previous work, we have designed a hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for audio keyword identification. However, there are two inherent weaknesses: 1) a frame-based SVM classifier does not incorporate any contextual information; 2) a robust recognizer relies on large amounts of training data in the case of different sports games videos. In this demo, we present a flexible Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based audio keyword generation system. This is motivated by the successful story of applying HMM in speech recognition. Unlike the frame-based SVM classification followed by a major voting, our HMM-based system treats an audio keyword as a continuous time series data and employs hidden states transition to capture contexts. Moreover, our system introduces an adaptation mechanism to tune the initial HMM models (obtained from available training data) to improve performance by a small number of data from a new sports game video.

Maintaining sustainable urban development and planning becomes one of the major necessity for the government and policy makers.

This study investigates the possibilities of identifying the changed areas with Google Earth Engine (GEE) providing a fast and easy-to-use platform with its geospatial analysis tools for applications such as change detection. In this study, C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1 and Multispectral Instrument (MSI) images of Sentinel-2 were utilized to identify the changed areas, such as new built-ups or soil excavation, of 21 neighborhood units of capital city of Turkey through GEE platform. The image subtraction of MSI images were integrated with image subtraction of SAR images of 2015 and 2017. The image indices such as Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Bare Soil Index (BSI) and Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) were also utilized.

We can conceive of this as a parsing of the phonetic input provided by the foreign word forms, in accordance with phonological output constraints of the borrowing language. Following Silverman (1992) we conceive loanword formation as fundamentally a twostage process: the first of which yields a parsing of the phonetic input into segmentally organised phonetic feature bundles, interpretable as segmental targets in the borrowing language. In the second stage of processing, these segmental targets are parsed into phonological structures (syllables, mora, feet...etc) compatible with the word-prosody of the borrowing language. Japanese borrowings from English provide a good test-bed for models of loanword formation, because examples are abundant and, while the segmental mapping from English to Japanese is relatively straightforward, their respective word-level prosodies are strikingly different, providing ample opportunity to observe prosodic restructuring in loanword formation. to construct 'symbolic' or 'analytical' parsing algorithms for this task, either with or without reference to a framework of learnability theory. This approach came under strong challenge from 'empirical' Connectionist models of language processing in the 1980's. The debate between these competing paradigms, or the search for some suitable 'hybrid', continues. It may be argued that loanword formation provides a more restrictive, and hence better controlled, environment for studying parsing mechanisms than other natural language processing tasks, which involve a host of lexical, morphological, syntactic or pragmatic influences. In this paper, we report the results obtained from a feed-forward neural network, trained on an 1100 word corpus of American English loanwords \"borrowed' into Japanese, postWWII. We make preliminary comparisons with an analytical constraint-based approach to modeling loanword formation.

However, due to the scattering and re-absorption effects inside the leaves and canopy, SIF measured at the canopy level is only a small part of the total SIF emission at the photosystem level. Therefore, a downscaling mechanism of SIF from the canopy level to the photosystem level is important for better understanding the relationship between SIF and the vegetation gross primary production (GPP). In this study, firstly, we analyzed the canopy scattering effects using a simple parameterization model based on the spectral invariant theory. The probability for SIF photons to escape from the canopy was found to be related to the anisotropic spectral reflectance, canopy interception of the upward solar radiation, and leaf absorption. An empirical approach based on a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm was applied to downscale SIF constrained by the red, red-edge and far-red anisotropic reflectance. The RF was trained using simulations conducted with the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. The performance of the SIF downscaling method was evaluated with SCOPE and Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model simulations, ground measurements and airborne data. Results show that estimated SIF at the photosystem level matches well with simulated reference data, and the relationship between SIF and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll is improved by SIF downscaling. This finding in combination with other evaluation criteria suggests the downscaling of canopy SIF as an efficient strategy to normalize species dependent effects of canopy structure and varying solar-view geometries.

The DT and RF models identified the key risk factors associated with acute rejection: the levels of the donor specific IgG anti-bodies, the levels of IgG4 subclass and the number of human leucocyte antigen mismatches between the donor and recipient. Furthermore, the DT model determined dangerous levels of donor-specific IgG subclass antibodies, thus demonstrating the potential of discovering new properties in the data when traditional statistical tools are unable to capture them. The DT and RF classifiers developed in this work predicted early transplant rejection with accuracy of 85%, thus offering an accurate decision support tool for doctors tasked with predicting outcomes of kidney transplantation in advance of the clinical intervention.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2596048762", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79382892"}

A relevant field of application for such methods is urban climatology, since specific urban morphologies produce distinct microclimates. However, application and comparability are so far limited by the variety of typologies used for the description of urban surfaces in EO. In this study Local Climate Zones (LCZ), a system of thermally homogenous urban structures introduced by Stewart and Oke, was used in a pixel-based classification approach. Further, different EO datasets (including satellite multitemporal thermal and multispectral data as well as a normalized digital surface model (NDSM) from airborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and different classifiers (including Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks and Random Forest) were evaluated for their performance in a common framework. Especially the multitemporal thermal and spectral features yielded high potential for the discrimination of LCZ, but morphological profiles from the NDSM also performed well. Further, sets of 10-100 features were selected with the Minimum Redundancy Maximal Relevance approach from multiple EO data. Overall classification accuracies of up to 97.4% and 95.3% were obtained with a Neural Network and a Random Forest classifier respectively. This provides some evidence that LCZ can be derived from multiple EO data. Hence, we propose the typology and the method for the application of automated extraction of urban structures in urban climatology. Further the chosen multiple EO data and classifiers seemed to yield considerable potential for an automated classification of LCZ.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2189873", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2074448420", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["96151425", "32554955", "120387039", "21797198", "56082326", "53352497", "55892999", "129365996", "129119825", "61406394", "7443466", "26985497", "127496841", "61862128", "121381837", "28228772", "129916266", "13007623", "119454179", "129110765", "121494999", "109418717", "134194924", "73614779", "14911714", "2475526", "122871344", "13284902", "2008977", "18359663", "1831347", "206764015", "194951", "1530308", "89141", "128848964"], "inbound_citations": ["121977706", "21444856", "202782597", "15217378", "129750696", "22082427", "8625776", "59426461", "114522298", "26500351", "1651960", "33267773", "3125206", "201259797", "201265001", "209169593", "208041368", "28372911", "198430332", "101421772", "53643213", "117014425", "67791588", "135187853", "125263940", "125684778", "22682868", "53843743", "54784258", "35133804", "86724959", "5086469", "56152254", "134628997", "53240584", "42981529", "44010584", "123464789", "202719352", "199401069", "33622883", "13750753", "59442167", "22131528", "128356313", "135275298", "133377", "164809696", "131777577", "21773385", "27221569", "168169742", "55269342", "5295268", "54203791", "201751038", "18097597", "22494528", "25464499", "125317112", "4510730", "109932326", "37310098", "135360775", "11073704", "17047480", "14602332", "52114723", "211057641", "134836427", "56483356", "25630728"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40822780"}

The evaluation of soil liquefaction potential is of great importance for geotechnical engineers in order to avoid future costs. The most common approach for such an evaluation has been using historical records of soil liquefaction, gathered from different locations. Most of the historical records include SPT and CPT data. This paper focuses on the evaluation of liquefaction potential using shear wave velocity (SVW) database, including 415 site observations. Among many models for liquefaction potential assessment, ANN and SVM are popular and used by different researchers to better predict the future hazards of liquefaction. In this paper, we introduce Random Forest as a method for liquefaction assessment to classify soils with respect to their potential of liquefaction when exposed to certain earthquakes. The details of feature selection and model development is stated. It is shown that Random Forest, tested on 83 unseen cases (20% of database), is able to predict the liquefaction potential in soils with 92.77% accuracy.

In this study the genetic programming (GP) technique was applied for estimating the daily suspended sediment load in two stations in Cumberland River in U.S. Daily flow and sediment data from 1972 to 1989 were used to train and test the applied genetic programming models. The effect of various GP operators on sediment load estimation was investigated. The optimal fitness function, operator functions, linking function and learning algorithm were obtained for modeling daily suspended sediment. The GP estimates were compared with those of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) results, in term of coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, coefficient of residual mass and variance accounted for.

Development of such a system requires designing a framework, which can recognize the drivers\u2019 affective state and take preventive measures to account for escalating stress level. This work presents a machine learning-based approach to identify driving-induced stress patterns. For this, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are utilized as the physiological signals. The ongoing brain activity is logged as EEG signal to determine the link between brain dynamics and emotional states. Three classifiers are utilized in this work, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Random Forest (RF) to classify EEG patterns on the basis of the subject's self-reported emotional states while driving in various situations. A framework is proposed to recognize emotions based on EEG patterns by systematically identifying emotion-specific features from the raw EEG signal and investigating the classifiers\u2019 effectiveness. A comprehensive analysis of various performance measures concludes that among the three classifiers employed in this study, SVM performs better to distinguish between rest and stress state.

Method: One hundred twenty-nine adults and 88 adolescents participated in this study. Anger, fear and surprise emotions were induced by using audio-visual film clips. The physiological signals were measured for 30 seconds each during the rest period and the emotional state. The obtained signals then analyzed, resulting in 18 features of physiological signals. Three different emotions were classified by two classifiers using Discriminant Analaysis and Support Vector Machine(SVM). Results: The analysis on the obtained three different emotions resulted in the classification rate on 72.6% on Discriminant Analaysis, 56.9% on SVM. Conclusion: Although this study showed moderate accuracy, it still has achieved emotional responses through various participants compared to other studies which collected data from one participant.

However, its interpretation is associated with high inter- and intra-observer variability. Since its introduction there have been numerous attempts to develop computerized systems assisting the evaluation of the CTG recording. Nevertheless these systems are still hardly used in a delivery ward. Two main approaches to computerized evaluation are encountered in the literature; the first one emulates existing guidelines, while the second one is more of a data-driven approach using signal processing and computational methods. The latter employs preprocessing, feature extraction/selection and a classifier that discriminates between two or more classes/conditions. These classes are often formed using the umbilical cord artery pH value measured after delivery. In this work an approach to Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) classification using pH is presented that could serve as a benchmark for reporting results on the unique open-access CTU-UHB CTG database, the largest and the only freely available database of this kind. The overall results using a very small number of features and a Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier, are in accordance to the ones encountered in the literature and outperform the results of a baseline classification scheme proving the utility of using advanced data processing methods.

The RF model explained 84.9% of the variation in 2004, 78.8% in 2009, and 82.2% in 2014.

The values of standardized total effects of the main driving factors showed that the average age, average DBH, and culms density had positive effects on vegetation carbons stocks, whereas MAT and MAP had negative effects. Furthermore, the positive effects of average age on the increase of vegetation carbon stocks increased significantly, the negative effects of MAT increased with the increasing MAT, but the negative effects of MAP decreased with the increasing MAP.

The distance and similarity between two sequence are very important and widely studied.

It is feasible to introduce machine learning technology to learn similarity metric from biological data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of guaranteed similarity metric learning (GMSL) to perform alignment of biology sequences in any feature vector space. It introduces the $(\\epsilon, \\gamma, \\tau)$ -goodness similarity theory to Mahalanobis metric learning. As a theoretical guaranteed similarity metric learning approach, GMSL guarantees that the learned similarity function performs well in classification and clustering.

One is in great needs of a large-scale well-annotated training data. The other is how to effectively encode both the current signal segment and the contextual dependency. Both needs many human efforts. Motivated to relieve such issues, this chapter presents a systematic investigation on architecture design strategies for recurrent neural networks in two different perspectives: the pipeline perspective and micro core perspective. From the pipeline perspective, a deep end-to-end recognition architecture is proposed, allowing a fast adaptation to new tasks with minimal human intervention. Firstly, the deep architecture of RNN gave a high nonlinear feature representation. Through hierarchical representations, effective and complex features are expressed in terms of other, simpler ones. Moreover, a hybrid unit is used to encode the long contextual trajectories, which comprise of a BLSTM (bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) layer and a FFS (feed forward subsampling) layer. Secondly, the CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) objective function makes it possible to train the model without annotating the data in character level. Thirdly, a modified CTC beam search algorithm integrates the linguistic constraints wisely during decoding in a unified formulation. In such an end-to-end style, a thin and compact network with high accuracy can be designed and ready to industry-scale applications. From the micro core perspective, a new neuron structure named gated memory unit (GMU) is presented, inspired by both LSTM and GRU. GMU preserves the constant error carousels (CEC) which is devoted to enhance a smooth information flow. GMU also lends both the cell structure of LSTM and the interpolation gates of GRU. Our methods are evaluated on CASIA-OLHWDB 2.x, a publicly available Chinese handwriting database. Comparing with state-of-the-art methods, it shows that: (1) our pipeline demonstrates over 30% relative error reductions on test set in terms of both correct rate and accurate rate; (2) better results can be achieved by our pipeline at certain feasible assumption on competition set; (3) GMU is of potential choice in handwriting recognition tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-06073-2_2", "venue": "Deep Learning: Fundamentals, Theory and Applications", "journal": "Deep Learning: Fundamentals, Theory and Applications", "mag_id": "2912501532", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86529442"}

The presence of inflows of metal-poor gas that trigger star formation bursts of low metallicity has been proposed as an explanation for the local anti-correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and gas-phase metallicity ($\\rm Z_g$) found in the literature. In the present study, we show how the anti-correlation is also present as part of a diversified range of behaviours for a sample of more than 700 nearby spiral galaxies from the SDSS IV MaNGA survey. We have characterized the local relation between SFR and $\\rm Z_g$ after subtracting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of both quantities. $60\\%$ of the analyzed galaxies display a $\\rm SFR-Z_g$ anti-correlation, with the remaining $40\\%$ showing no correlation ($19\\%$) or positive correlation ($21\\%$). Applying a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we obtain that the slope of the correlation is mainly determined by the average gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy. Galaxy mass, $g-r$ colors, stellar age, and mass density seem to play a less significant role. This result is supported by the performed 2nd-order polynomial regression analysis. Thus, the local $\\rm SFR-Z_g$ slope varies with the average metallicity, with the more metal-poor galaxies presenting the lowest slopes (i.e., the strongest $\\rm SFR-Z_g$ anti-correlations), and reversing the relation for more metal-rich systems.

After extracting the STIPs, the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and histogram of optical flow (HOF) features are calculated for the video patches extracted around the STIPs. Action recognition is performed by calculating mutual information of each STIP with respect to all the action classes provided in the training dataset. Mutual information is calculated by using random forest voting. The trees of random forest are built through proposed semi-supervised learning. The tree nodes are split by using unsupervised learning upto a certain predefined depth of the tree by taking the maximum variance of feature differences of the hypothesis. Next, the splitting process of the nodes is carried out by binary error minimization technique based on supervised learning. The experiments are performed on the standard KTH dataset.

Current methods for biomedical image segmentation typically require either complex mathematical models with slow convergence, or expensive-to-calculate image features, which makes them non-feasible for large volumes with many objects (tens to hundreds) of different classes, as is typical in modern medical and biological datasets. Recently, graphical models such as Markov Random Fields (MRF) or Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are having a huge impact in different computer vision areas (e.g. image parsing, object detection, object recognition) as they provide global regularization for multiclass problems over an energy minimization framework. These models have yet to find impact in biomedical imaging due to complexities in training and slow inference in 3D images due to the very large number of voxels. Here, we define an interactive segmentation approach over a supervoxel space by first defining novel, robust and fast regional descriptors for supervoxels. Then, a hierarchical segmentation approach is adopted by training Contextual Extremely Random Forests in a user-defined label hierarchy where the classification output of the previous layer is used as additional features to train a new classifier to refine more detailed label information. This hierarchical model yields final class likelihoods for supervoxels which are finally refined by a MRF model for 3D segmentation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness on a challenging cryo-soft X-ray tomography dataset by segmenting cell areas with only a few user scribbles as the input for our algorithm. Further results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to fully extract different organelles from the cell volume with another few seconds of user interaction. \u00a9 (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

In this paper, we consider issues relevant in the design of biomedical studies in which the goal is the discovery of a subset of features and an associated algorithm that can predict a binary outcome, such as disease status. We compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in high-dimensionality data settings. We evaluate the effects of varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset, imbalance in class distribution and choice of metric for quantifying performance of the classifier. To guide study design, we present a summary of the key characteristics of 'omics' data profiled in several human or animal model experiments utilizing high-content mass spectrometry and multiplexed immunoassay based techniques.ResultsThe analysis of data from seven 'omics' studies revealed that the average magnitude of effect size observed in human studies was markedly lower when compared to that in animal studies. The data measured in human studies were characterized by higher biological variation and the presence of outliers. The results from simulation studies indicated that the classifier Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) had the highest power when the class conditional feature distributions were Gaussian and outcome distributions were balanced.

Nevertheless, the impact of the similarity between training and test samples on this matter has not been studied in a systematic manner. It is therefore unclear how these SFs would perform when only trained on protein-ligand complexes that are highly dissimilar or highly similar to the test set. It is also unclear whether SFs based on machine learning algorithms other than RF can also improve accuracy with increasing training set size and to what extent they learn from dissimilar or similar training complexes. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We present a systematic study to investigate how the accuracy of classical and machine-learning SFs varies with protein-ligand complex similarities between training and test sets. We considered three types of similarity metrics, based on the comparison of either protein structures, protein sequences or ligand structures. Regardless of the similarity metric, we found that incorporating a larger proportion of similar complexes to the training set did not make classical SFs more accurate. By contrast, RF-Score-v3 was able to outperform X-Score even when trained on just 32% of the most dissimilar complexes, showing that its superior performance owes considerably to learning from dissimilar training complexes to those in the test set. In addition, we generated the first SF employing Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), XGB-Score, and observed that it also improves with training set size while outperforming the rest of SFs. Given the continuous growth of training datasets, the development of machine-learning SFs has become very appealing. ::: ::: ::: AVAILABILITY ::: https://github.com/HongjianLi/MLSF. ::: ::: ::: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ::: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30873528", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btz183", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "mag_id": "2922063386", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["213769071", "210839197", "214724834", "202747158", "207990667"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78093747"}

However, the research of muscle fatigue caused by isotonic training receives less attention due to higher signal noise than isometric data. Good representative features are known to reduce signal noise. However, there exists no standard significant features set for isotonic training data. Therefore, this study aims to propose the significant features set for isotonic muscle fatigue. Correlation based feature subset selection (CFS) was used to select the significant features set. The commonly used features in sEMG analysis are Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Modified Mean Absolute Value 1 and 2 (MMAV1, MMAV2), Root Mean Square (RMS), Simple Square Integral (SSI), Variance of EMG (VAR), Waveform Length (WL), Mean Frequency (MF) and Median Frequency (MDF). Support Vector Machine was to measure the performance of features in prediction accuracy. Shapiro-Wilk normality test and ANOVA were performed to further verify the experimental results. Frequency domain features showed higher accuracy than time domain features, however features set with both domains showed better accuracy than a single domain.

An adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for chaotic dynamical systems, under the constraint that the system\u2019s model is unknown.

After transforming the chaotic system\u2019s model into a linear form, the resulting control inputs are shown to contain nonlinear elements which depend on the system\u2019s parameters. The nonlinear terms which appear in the control inputs are approximated with the use of neuro-fuzzy networks. It is shown that a suitable learning law can be defined for the aforementioned neuro-fuzzy approximators so as to preserve the closed-loop system stability.

Traditional reasons that lead to the emergence of gaps in the data is the inability to obtain information, its distortion or even hiding. In the monitoring environmental pollution data it can be as follows: breakdown of devices; adverse weather conditions; errors of measuring devices; damage to information carriers; suspension of measurements during weekends; implementation of the minimum number of measurements allowed by the state standards. As a result, incomplete information is provided for the analysis of the collected data. Today, there are a large number of methods for recovering missing parameters in the data, but for each application area, different methods are used to fill the missing data. The paper analyzes the following methods for processing missing data: the removal of elements with gaps, the method of weighing and filling missed parameters. The mechanisms of missed parameters appearance are described, in which the probability of gaps for each set of records is the same, in which the probability of gaps is determined on the basis of other available full information and where data is not available depending on unknown factors. There is a need to analyze existing and study new methods for filling missed values in the data sets of environmental monitoring, to find such an algorithm that will maximally satisfy the needs for increasing the speed, efficiency and accuracy of filling out missed parameters. So, authors analyze methods for filling missing parameters in environmental monitoring data such as medium-mean, naive forecast, and regression modeling methods.

The controller is based on the Practical Nonlinear Predictive Controller algorithm, a general framework which can be used for the implementation of nonlinear model predictive controllers using almost any class of nonlinear model. Echo State Networks explore the Reservoir Computing learning paradigm, which is a computationally efficient strategy for training recurrent artificial neural networks. In the proposed control algorithm, the ESN model is used to obtain on-line a nonlinear prediction of the system free response and a linearized version of the model is used to obtain a local approximation of the systems step response, which is used to build the dynamic matrix of the system at each sampling instant. The proposed controller was tested in a real nonlinear process, comprising the automatic control of the discharge pressure of a refrigerant compressor in a test rig. This process was identified using an ESN and the results are compared to linear and Hammerstein nonlinear models.

However, generalization performance of OCSVM is profoundly influenced by its Gaussian model parameter \u03c3.

The semantic idea of this algorithm is based on inspecting the spatial locations of the selected support vector samples. The algorithm selects the optimal value of \u03c3 which leads to a decision boundary that has all its support vectors reside on the surface of the training data (i.e. edged support vector). A support vector is identified as an edge sample by constructing a hyperplane with its k-nearest neighbour samples using a hard margin linear support vector machine. The algorithm was successfully validated using two real world sensing datasets, one collected from a lab specimen which was replicated a jack arch from the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and another one collected from sensors mounted on vehicles for road condition assessment.

We present an automated transductive transfer learning approach that addresses this issue. It relies on problem-agnostic, temporal organization of the MOOC clickstream data, where, for each student, for multiple courses, a set of specific MOOC event types is expressed for each time unit. It consists of two alternative transfer methods based on representation learning with auto-encoders: a passive approach using transductive principal component analysis and an active approach that uses a correlation alignment loss term. With these methods, we investigate the transferability of dropout prediction across similar and dissimilar MOOCs and compare with known methods.

In practice, the relevant images in a group may have a wide range of variations, and the salient objects may also have large appearance changes. Such wide variations usually bring about large intra-co-salient objects (intra-COs) diversity and high similarity between COs and background, which makes the co-saliency detection task more difficult. To address these problems, we make the earliest effort to introduce metric learning to co-saliency detection. Specifically, we propose a unified metric learning-based framework to jointly learn discriminative feature representation and co-salient object detector. This is achieved by optimizing a new objective function that explicitly embeds a metric learning regularization term into support vector machine (SVM) training. Here, the metric learning regularization term is used to learn a powerful feature representation that has small intra-COs scatter, but big separation between background and COs and the SVM classifier is used for subsequent co-saliency detection.

The training set is used to train the PSVR model and the test set is then used to evaluate the trained model. The predicted results of PSVR are compared with those of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The parametric trends of CHF are also investigated using the PSVR model.

The investigation figures out trade-off of the two aspects and shows existence of single optimal value of the ratio to minimize the learning errors. I also carried out experiments to compare the performances of agents who use different exploration ratios. The results of the experiments tells existence of equilibrium points to choose the ratio by individual agents.

However, multi-modality based AD diagnostic models are often hindered by the missing data, i.e. , not all the subjects have complete multi-modality data. One simple solution used by many previous studies is to discard samples with missing modalities. However, this significantly reduces the number of training samples, thus leading to a sub-optimal classification model. Furthermore, when building the classification model, most existing methods simply concatenate features from different modalities into a single feature vector without considering their underlying associations. As features from different modalities are often closely related ( e.g. , MRI and PET features are extracted from the same brain region), utilizing their inter-modality associations may improve the robustness of the diagnostic model. To this end, we propose a novel latent representation learning method for multi-modality based AD diagnosis. Specifically, we use all the available samples (including samples with incomplete modality data) to learn a latent representation space. Within this space, we not only use samples with complete multi-modality data to learn a common latent representation, but also use samples with incomplete multi-modality data to learn independent modality-specific latent representations. We then project the latent representations to the label space for AD diagnosis. We perform experiments using 737 subjects from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31021792", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2019.2913158", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2942489367", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["20276406", "53147766", "3564179", "19529282", "54526983", "19742394", "52276927", "4961783", "3294547", "1910886", "24060941", "4431382", "52271871", "4513154", "3270147", "18298109", "12487970", "27213477", "2209189", "6434819", "2633057", "40052659", "14270830", "2610562", "1914191", "4448387", "6044586", "3272607", "31736864", "2995286", "4637531", "16281709", "54339277", "121923358", "452851", "51612107", "3645999", "17861781", "832721", "448134", "202473", "16939941", "1105917", "1668439", "447011", "51607804", "10916354", "961425", "43144161", "3226754", "19769066", "1890316", "202239135", "51615991", "30274925", "15439420", "15564405", "17903383", "52291847", "52269862", "22256730", "37517946", "12155071", "21850590", "17285766"], "inbound_citations": ["195261318", "211730445", "204028166", "202539300"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133608068"}

However, it is still a challenging problem because of inherent dynamic nature of videos. Additionally, lack of sufficient annotated dataset may lead to overfitting issues while training deep networks. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal transfer learning approach using 3D-CNN for video based person re-identification. To address the issue of insufficient labelled data and transfer the knowledge, we use a pre-trained 3D-CNN model of Sports-1M dataset and perform fine-tuning on multiple domain datasets such as PRID-2011, iLIDS-VID, MARS and an aerial video dataset simultaneously. Learning features from multiple domain data is of significant value because of large variation which otherwise is not possible to obtain from small individual datasets. In our experiments, we show that the fine-tuned transferred features encode robust representations and enhance the re-identification accuracy. Further, to boost the performance, we apply XQDA metric learning. Experiments conducted on all the four datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the popular methods by an average improvement of 4% or more.

It is a control task in which the delay period between the sign received and the required response (e.g., turn right or left) is a crucial factor. Delayed response tasks like this one form a temporal problem that can be handled very well by RC networks.

The proposed algorithm fuses the multiple features derived from different color spaces. Multiorientation and multiscale information relating to the color face features are extracted by applying Steerable Pyramid Transform (SPT) to the local face regions. In this paper, the new three hybrid color spaces, YSCr, ZnSCr, and BnSCr, are firstly constructed using the Cb and Cr component images of the YCbCr color space, the S color component of the HSV color spaces, and the Zn and Bn color components of the normalized XYZ color space. Secondly, the color component face images are partitioned into the local patches. Thirdly, SPT is applied to local face regions and some statistical features are extracted.

Accurate and reliable forecast of wind speed is necessary for efficient power production; however, it is not an easy task because it depends upon meteorological features of the surrounding region.

It has also been observed that the integration of several learning models, known as ensemble learning, generally gives better performance compared to a single model. The design of wings, tail, and nose of a jet improves the aerodynamics resulting in a smooth and controlled flight of the jet against the variations of the air currents. Inspired by the shape and working of a jet, a novel Deep Ensemble Learning using Jet-like Architecture (DEL-Jet) technique is proposed to enhance the diversity and robustness of a learning system against the variations in the input space. The diverse feature spaces of the base-regressors are exploited using the jet-like ensemble architecture. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (as jet wings) and one deep Auto-Encoder (as jet tail) are used to extract the diverse feature spaces from the input data. After that, nonlinear PCA (as jet main body) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of extracted feature space. Finally, both the reduced and the original feature spaces are exploited to train the meta-regressor (as jet nose) for forecasting the wind speed.

This paper presents, a mesh network of wireless sensor nodes that only requires readily available hardware, algorithms and methods for acoustic source type identification. A node was constructed by interfacing three separate modules to a microprocessor: (i) a microphone coupled to a USB sound card for recording acoustic data, (ii) a radio frequency (RF) transceiver for inter-node and remote server communication, and (iii) an external Real Time Clock module for time-synchronization between nodes. The system was designed for real-time identification of calls of Black-Rumped Flameback (BRF), a type of woodpecker endemic to the Indian sub-continent and found in parts of Sri Lanka. Any acoustic signal above a predefined intensity threshold was recorded while BRF calls were discriminated with respect to two other known bird calls. This was achieved based on a threshold estimated by measuring the cross-correlation between two known BRF calls. This method was able to successfully identify 83% of the tested BRF calls. Several more frequency domain features were also identified that are compatible with Support Vector Machines (SVM), which is a more robust identification algorithm.

Index Terms-Medical diagnosis, Learning systems I. INTRODUCTION Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of infections in humans, mostly affecting women. It is estimated that 1 in 5 women worldwide will have a UTI during their lifetime (1), 20% of those women will get a second infection and significant percentage of those will suffer from chronic UTI's (2). Between 5-15% of hospital in-patients are also prone to UTI whereas patients in the intensive-care unit are 5-10 times more likely to acquire a nosocomial infection than those in the general wards (3), (4). The current standard method of diagnosis of a UTI is by quantitative urine culture which requires about 24 hours to produce results. Due to the relatively long time for diagnosis, physicians suspecting an infection prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics before a definite diagnosis is made. This prac\u00ad tice contributes to ineffective treatments, chronic infections, increased health-care costs and to an alarming increase in antibiotic resistance (5), (6). It is therefore important to develop a rapid, accurate, and relatively inexpensive method of UTI diagnosis. Such a method should be able to identify the causative pathogen allowing for more specific and effective treatments. Identifying pathogens based on their chemical character\u00ad istics with minimal sample preparation is a relatively recent approach (7). Some techniques that are being used for this pur\u00ad pose include Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2187008064", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:74529956"}

This feature set has been achieved after rigorous experimentation, which has helped in reducing the false positives significantly. METHOD: The proposed method starts with pre-processing, removing any present noise from input images, followed by lung segmentation using optimal thresholding. Then the image is enhanced using multi scale dot enhancement filtering prior to nodule detection and feature extraction. Finally, classification of lung nodules is achieved using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The feature set consists of intensity, shape (2D and 3D) and texture features, which have been selected to optimize the sensitivity and reduce false positives. In addition to SVM, some other supervised classifiers like K-Nearest-Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have also been used for performance comparison. The extracted features have also been compared class-wise to determine the most relevant features for lung nodule detection. The proposed system has been evaluated using 850 scans from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset and k-fold cross validation scheme. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity has been improved compared to the previous methods and false positives per scan have been reduced significantly. The achieved sensitivities at detection and classification stages are 94.20% and 98.15% respectively with only 2.19 false positives per scan. CONCLUSIONS: It is very difficult to achieve high performance metrics using only a single feature class therefore hybrid approach in feature selection remains a better choice. Choosing right set of features can improve the overall accuracy of the system by improving the sensitivity and reducing false positives. This article is protected by copyright.

The main merit of ELM lies in the fact that the input weights as well as hidden layer bias are randomly generated and thus the output weights can be obtained analytically, which can overcome the drawbacks incurred by gradient-based training algorithms such as local optima, improper learning rate and low learning speed. Based on the consistency property of data, which enforces similar samples to share similar properties, we propose a discriminative graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine (GELM) for further enhancing its classification performance in this paper. In the proposed GELM model, the label information of training samples are used to construct an adjacent graph and correspondingly the graph regularization term is formulated to constrain the output weights to learn similar outputs for samples from the same class. The proposed GELM model also has a closed form solution as the standard ELM and thus the output weights can be obtained efficiently. Experiments on several widely used face databases show that our proposed GELM can achieve much performance gain over standard ELM and regularized ELM. Moreover, GELM also performs well when compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods for face recognition.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2013.12.065", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2140224582", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["116858", "2891159", "5117817", "207101649", "15037168", "14619623", "17292559", "13998723", "33005554", "19287620", "122382266", "18270339", "17762302", "14277707", "16453988", "24837731", "21766223", "335128", "9677682", "25316827", "38135033", "32373000", "1461927", "836206", "7863583", "718802", "115462951", "9234219", "2458350", "6667075", "7677466", "196127773", "57227467", "9234347", "2629535", "209099422"], "inbound_citations": ["760183", "173186185", "53084125", "1610324", "201812226", "13877469", "71151854", "207114445", "192545218", "10802494", "3822545", "4325381", "125961102", "173182352", "17903389", "46568411", "181437211", "16990884", "15982451", "26003369", "208515169", "207115339", "5001586", "210195071", "4473088", "38353482", "5028009", "6789903", "51606461", "198140888", "195766614"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2619039"}

The distributed ELM with MapReduce could handle large-scale training dataset efficiently, but how to cope with its updated hidden nodes number which aims to get the higher accuracy is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Distributed Extreme Learning Machine with MapReduce (A-ELM*). It could overcome the weakness of ELM* in learning massive training dataset for updating hidden nodes number. Firstly, we found that through partial adjustment of incremental hidden nodes and decremental hidden nodes, matrix multiplication (the most computation-expensive part in A-ELM*) can be calculated. Next, A-ELM* based on MapReduce framework is proposed. A-ELM* first calculates the intermediate matrix multiplications of the updated hidden nodes subset, and then update the matrix multiplications by modifying the old matrix multiplications with the intermediate ones. Then, based on the updated matrix multiplications, there could obtain the corresponding new output weight vector with centralized computing. Therefore, it is effective for learning large scale training dataset, in which the hidden nodes update rapidly. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed A-ELM*, using synthetic data with extensive experiments, in learning updated hidden nodes.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2015.01.094", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1141911481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["63804419", "27406630", "116858", "2891159", "5117817", "207101649", "15037168", "33683506", "6934060", "36133804", "7058739", "32913674", "760370", "7028394", "11894091", "648613", "214797870", "214797870", "207175461", "2262262"], "inbound_citations": ["195847285", "214624457", "19200450", "207829161", "210970613", "4990584", "1033858", "52294394", "52291556"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207109120"}

As such, Virtual Screening (VS), a computationally intensive process, plays a major role in the systematic drug designing process for pressing diseases. Therefore, it is imperative that the VS process has to be made as fast as possible in order to efficiently dock the ligands from huge databases to a selected protein receptor, targeting a drug. The extremely high rate of increase of the number of ligands in the databases makes it impossible to tackle this problem only by improving the computing resources. Therefore, researchers work on an orthogonal technique, where they use soft computing to reduce the search space through identifying the ligands that are non-dockable, hence improving the throughput as a whole. Machine Learning (ML) can be used to train a binary classifier that can classify the ligands into two known classes: dockable and non-dockable ligands. In this paper, for the first time, we use three ML techniques (Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest) on a single problem domain (a Protease receptor of HIV) and evaluate the performance rendered by the respective models. We show that such classification improves the throughput by two folds with around 90% accuracy.

Most researches have used the machine learning method to classify patients and normal controls, among which support vector machines (SVM) are widely employed. But the classification accuracy of SVM is usually low, due to the usage of a single SVM as classifier. Thus we used multiple SVMs to classify ASD patients and typical controls (TC). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 46 TC and 61 ASD patients were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database. Only 84 of 107 subjects are utilized in experiments because the translation or rotation of 7 TC and 16 ASD patients has surpassed \u00b12mm or \u00b12degrees. Then the random support vector machine cluster was proposed to distinguish TC and ASD. The results show that this method has an excellent classification performance based on all the features. Furthermore, the accuracy based on the optimal feature set could reach to 96.15%.

During weather consultation, the forecasters obtain the final results by combining the observations with the NWP results and giving opinions based on their experience. It is obvious that using a suitable post-processing algorithm for simulating weather consultation is an interesting and important topic. MOML is a post-processing method based on machine learning, which matches NWP forecasts against observations through a regression function. By adopting different feature engineering of datasets and training periods, the observational and model data can be processed into the corresponding training set and test set. The MOML regression function uses an existing machine learning algorithm with the processed dataset to revise the output of NWP models combined with the observations, so as to improve the results of weather forecasts. To test the new approach for grid temperature forecasts, the 2-m surface air temperature in the Beijing area from the ECMWF model is used. MOML with different feature engineering is compared against the ECMWF model and modified model output statistics (MOS) method. MOML shows a better numerical performance than the ECMWF model and MOS, especially for winter. The results of MOML with a linear algorithm, running training period, and dataset using spatial interpolation ideas, are better than others when the forecast time is within a few days.

The information from these are processed and provided back to the travelers in real time. However, the travelers are interested to know not only the current traffic information, but also the future traffic conditions predicted based on the real time data. These predicted values inform the drivers on what they can expect when they make the trip. Travel time is one of the most popular variables which the users are interested to know. Travelers make decisions to bypass congested segments of the network, to change departure time or destination etc., based on this information. Hence it is important that the predicted values be as accurate as possible. A number of different forecasting methods have been proposed for travel time forecasting including historic method, real-time method, time series analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). This paper examines the use of a machine learning technique, namely support vector machines (SVM), for the short-term prediction of travel time. While other machine learning techniques, such as ANN, have been extensively studied, the reported applications of SVM in the field of transportation engineering are very few.

On the other hand, such an approach increases the data volume with more redundant information and increased levels of uncertainty within datasets, which may actually reduce the classification accuracy. It is therefore an essential, though challenging task to select appropriate features and combine datasets for classification. The combination of feature selection techniques using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers has been used in various application fields in a number of studies on classification of hyperspectral data. However, the performance of this technique for classifying multi-source remote sensing data has not been well evaluated in the literature. In this study, the GA-SVM model was proposed and implemented to classify multiple combined datasets, consisting of Landsat 5 TM, multi- date dual polarization ALOS/PALSAR images and their multi- scale textural information. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of the traditional stack-vector approach. A large number of different combined datasets were generated and classified. It is revealed that the proposed method is very efficient for handling multisource data. Results indicated that the GA-SVM approach clearly outperforms the stack-vector approach, with significantly higher classification accuracy and much fewer input features. The highest classification accuracy achieved was 96.47% with only 81 out of 189 features being selected.

In this artical, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Set Covering Machine (SCM) models were used to learn and predict the resistance of the five drugs (Tetracycline, Ampicillin, Sulfisoxazole, Trimethoprim, Enrofloxacin). The SVM model used the number of co-occurring k-mers between the genome of the isolates and the reference resistance genes to learn and predict the phenotypes of the bacteria to a specific antimicrobial, while the SCM model uses a greedy approach to construct conjunction or disjunction of Boolean functions to find the most concise set of k-mers that allows for accurate prediction of the phenotype.

In this study, we seek to determine if the inclusion of data sampling will improve the performance of the Random Forest classifier. In order to test the effect of data sampling, we used Random Undersampling along with two post-sampling class distribution ratios: 35:65 and 50:50 (minority:majority). Additionally, we also built inductive models with Random Forest when no data sampling technique was applied, so we can observe the true effect of the data sampling. All three options were tested on a series of fifteen imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. Our results show that data sampling does improve the classification performance of Random Forest, especially when using the 50:50 post-sampling class distribution ratio.

Furthermore, to address the resource scarceness problem for training the SMT model, we generate around 2 million artificial training sentences using the Chinese character confusion sets, which include a set of Chinese characters with similar shapes and similar pronunciations, provided by the SIGHAN 7 shared task.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2822264", "venue": "TALLIP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2293187843", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2762657", "29068014", "62671765", "14177448", "38608659", "7288710", "1607600", "960007", "207927251", "5219389", "2076339", "13618539", "429415", "2152763", "3856487", "962605", "8247054", "7580221", "29966419"], "inbound_citations": ["208840859"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15663836"}

Most existing NRL methods focus on learning representations from local context of vertices (such as their neighbors).

It's a common sense that vertices in the same community tend to connect densely, and usually share common attributes. These patterns are expected to improve NRL and benefit relevant evaluation tasks, such as link prediction and vertex classification. In this work, we propose a novel NRL model by introducing community information of vertices to learn more discriminative network representations, named as Community-enhanced Network Representation Learning (CNRL). CNRL simultaneously detects community distribution of each vertex and learns embeddings of both vertices and communities. In this way, we can obtain more informative representation of a vertex accompanying with its community information. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed CNRL model on vertex classification, link prediction, and community detection using several real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CNRL significantly and consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we develop a system for extracting person related events and their participants from classical Arabic texts with complex linguistic structure. The first and most effective step to extract event is the correct diagnosis of the event mention and determining sentences which describe events. Implementation and comparing performance and the use of various methods can help researchers to choose appropriate method for event extraction based on their conditions and limitations. In this research, we have implemented three methods including knowledge oriented method (based on a set of keywords and rules), data-oriented method (based on Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and semantic oriented method (based on lexical chain) to automatically classify sentences as on-event or off eventones. The results indicate that knowledge oriented and machine learning methods have high precision and recall in event extraction process. The semantic oriented method with acceptable precision minimizes the linguistic knowledge requirements of knowledge oriented method and preprocessing requirements of data oriented method; and also improves automatic event extraction process from the raw text.

On the basis of machine learning models, our platform classifies gliomas into grades II, III, and IV. Furthermore, we quantitatively interpret and reveal the important parameters contributing to grading with the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. The quantitative analysis and explanation may assist clinicians to better understand the disease and accordingly to choose optimal treatments for improving clinical outcomes. The performance of our grading model was evaluated with cross-validation, which randomly divided the patients into non-overlapping training and testing sets and repeatedly validated the model on the different testing sets. The primary results indicated that this modular platform approach achieved the highest grading accuracy of 0.90\u00b10.04 with Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, with grading accuracies of 0.91\u00b10.08, 0.90\u00b10.08 and 0.90\u00b10.07 for grade II, III, and IV gliomas, respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6337068", "pubmed_id": "30686996", "doi": "10.3389/fnins.2018.01046", "venue": "Front.

Prediction of evaporation amounts is performed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) originated from Support Vector Machine (SVM). To prepare the input data for SVR, phase space reconstructions are realized using both univariate and multivariate time series embedding methods. The idea behind SVR is based on the computation of a linear regression in a multidimensional feature space. Observations vector in the input space are transformed to feature space by way of a kernel function. In this study, Radial Basis Function (RBF) is preferred as a kernel function due to its flexibility to observations from many divers fields. It is widely accepted that SVR is the most effective method for prediction when compared to other classical and modern methods like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) (Samsudin et al., 2011). Thus SVR has been chosen to predict evaporation amounts because of its good generalization capability.

For that purpose, we integrate a Random Forest classifier into a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. It is a flexible approach for obtaining a reliable classification result even in complex urban scenes. In this way, we benefit from the consideration of context on the one hand and from the opportunity to use a large amount of features on the other hand. Considering the interactions in our experiments increases the overall accuracy by 2%, though a larger improvement becomes apparent in the completeness and correctness of some of the seven classes discerned in our experiments. We compare the Random Forest approach to linear models for the computation of unary and pairwise potentials of the CRF, and investigate the relevance of different features for the LiDAR points as well as for the interaction of neighbouring points. In a second step, building objects are detected based on the classified point cloud. For that purpose, the CRF probabilities for the classes are plugged into a Markov Random Field as unary potentials, in which the pairwise potentials are based on a Potts model. The 2D binary building object masks are extracted and evaluated by the benchmark ISPRS Test Project on Urban Classification and 3D Building Reconstruction. The evaluation shows that the main buildings (larger than 50 m 2 ) can be detected very reliably with a correctness larger than 96% and a completeness of 100%.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.11.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1973644502", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["8396595", "61936075", "89141", "5707430", "292287", "7308660", "1585775", "53237055", "6518359", "120489597", "62739295", "10304118", "120149030", "120214420", "207251944", "267952", "42670095", "1756664", "29696476", "5681609", "23257689", "7267744", "2735928", "14584597", "15976656", "21445218", "2357415", "6047709", "46060724", "11607090", "22311998", "13488034", "8027823", "122910057", "55724607", "8564538", "32867831", "14577182", "25842396", "36992239", "12504080", "242941", "1978101", "25085630", "849935", "12935095"], "inbound_citations": ["32481094", "202590404", "45299", "50781059", "18926112", "210184500", "144207769", "56230588", "132716907", "28790445", "39565009", "133256142", "125312871", "199576849", "126382721", "134959297", "33719535", "54527123", "38537196", "52298570", "54998632", "201886876", "49416213", "195443916", "3895592", "55334541", "195447357", "134323558", "58936351", "637858", "204849060", "54030966", "15145457", "7216150", "862064", "195794568", "204967437", "21337078", "195438831", "134902523", "55453607", "17180330", "203701232", "8434900", "30338420", "13899456", "8500749", "8500749", "210843222", "62786847", "131832667", "34303476", "3942506", "3809842", "197488479", "189932036", "10507847", "14015641", "4396837", "85501953", "43580353", "85498741", "52931439", "39988903", "54913795", "201252519", "33417338", "195888292", "27768235", "18123876", "202546207", "78090449", "54064138", "56482022", "49365720", "207823380", "96437956", "52916449", "211207801", "54996890", "204265242", "29190586", "53019834", "207757643", "15247161", "55869554", "126124756", "59437051", "56481660", "78094319", "55782438", "56018810", "18927965", "201620503", "195874255", "17932065", "42696813", "54864851", "58662663", "207822428", "206374096", "202912099", "52276309", "54850286", "46772272", "15565426", "31451242", "19369920", "210042930", "52954790", "23196395", "16882975", "14049351", "109934910", "192467812", "50780127", "61453824", "10887169", "212694397", "8803959", "25371456", "201741291", "131325502", "65108760", "133587814", "55340231", "53358141", "25170914", "174801021", "69286304", "203704985", "201666929", "20693663"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120047621"}

To learn a metric in the unsupervised setting, most metric learning algorithms project observed data to a low-dimensional manifold, where geometric relationships such as pairwise distances are preserved. It can be extended to the nonlinear case by applying the kernel trick, which embeds the data into a feature space by specifying the kernel function that computes the dot products between data points in the feature space. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised Nonlinear Adaptive Metric Learning algorithm, called NAML, which performs clustering and distance metric learning simultaneously. NAML firstmaps the data to a high-dimensional space through a kernel function; then applies a linear projection to find a low-dimensional manifold where the separability of the data is maximized; and finally performs clustering in the low-dimensional space.

The woody component can be characterised by various quantifiable woody structural parameters, such as tree cover, tree height, above ground biomass (AGB) or canopy volume, each been useful for different purposes. In contrast to the limited spatial coverage of ground-based approaches, remote sensing has the ability to sense the high spatio-temporal variability of e.g. woody canopy height, cover and biomass, as well as species diversity and phenological status \u2013 a defining but challenging set of characteristics typical of African savannahs. Active remote sensing systems (e.g. Light Detection and Ranging \u2013 LiDAR; Synthetic Aperture Radar \u2013 SAR), on the other hand, may be more effective in quantifying the savannah woody component because of their ability to sense within-canopy properties of the vegetation and its insensitivity to atmosphere and clouds and shadows. Additionally, the various components of a particular target\u2019s structure can be sensed differently with SAR depending on the frequency or wavelength of the sensor being utilised. This study sought to test and compare the accuracy of modelling, in a Random Forest machine learning environment, woody above ground biomass (AGB), canopy cover (CC) and total canopy volume (TCV) in South African savannahs using a combination of X-band (TerraSAR-X), C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR) radar datasets. Training and validation data were derived from airborne LiDAR data to evaluate the SAR modelling accuracies. It was concluded that the L-band SAR frequency was more effective in the modelling of the CC (coefficient of determination or R 2 of 0.77), TCV ( R 2 of 0.79) and AGB ( R 2 of 0.78) metrics in Southern African savannahs than the shorter wavelengths (X- and C-band) both as individual and combined (X + C-band) datasets. The addition of the shortest wavelengths also did not assist in the overall reduction of prediction error across different vegetation conditions (e.g. dense forested conditions, the dense shrubby layer and sparsely vegetated conditions). Although the integration of all three frequencies (X + C + L-band) yielded the best overall results for all three metrics ( R 2 = 0.83 for CC and AGB and R 2 = 0.85 for TCV), the improvements were noticeable but marginal in comparison to the L-band alone.

Multivariate statistics and a Random Forest classifier were used to create a prognostic model for disease relapse in early patients. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In the early breast cancer training set (n = 40), metabolomics correctly distinguished between early and metastatic disease in 83.7% of cases. A prognostic risk model predicted relapse with 90% sensitivity (95% CI 74.9-94.8%), 67% specificity (95% CI 63.0-73.4%) and 73% predictive accuracy (95% CI 70.6-74.8%). These results were reproduced in an independent early breast cancer set (n = 40), with 82% sensitivity, 72% specificity and 75% predictive accuracy. Disease relapse was associated with significantly lower levels of histidine (p = 0.0003) and higher levels of glucose (p = 0.01), and lipids (p = 0.0003), compared with patients with no relapse. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The performance of a serum metabolomic prognostic model for disease relapse in individuals with ER-negative early stage breast cancer is promising.

Through this equivalent formulation, the sparsification reduces to an approximation problem with a Tikhonov regularizer, which selects the null coefficients of the resulting approximation. The proposed multi-resolutive sparsification achieves a different resolution in the approximation of the input data through a hierarchy of nested approximation spaces. The idea behind our approach is to combine a smooth and strictly convex approximation of the l\"1-norm with Tikhonov regularization and iterative solvers of linear/non-linear equations. Firstly, the iterative sparsification scheme is introduced in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with respect to its native norm. Then, the sparsification is generalized to arbitrary function spaces using the least-squares norm and radial basis functions. Finally, the discrete sparsification is derived using the eigendecomposition and the spectral properties of sparse matrices; in this case, the computational cost is O(nlogn), with n number of input points. Assuming that the data is supported on a (d-1)-dimensional manifold, we derive a variant of the sparsification scheme that guarantees the smoothness of the solution in the ambient and intrinsic space by using spectral graph theory and manifold learning techniques.

In this study, a novel predictor was designed by using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with the ensemble coding (EC) method. To reduce computational time, a feature selection method (DX) was adopted to rank the features and search the optimal feature combination. The DXEC method integrates many features and physicochemical/biochemical properties to predict PPIs.

We extended the experiment to a bigger and more realistic dataset that maintains 50% recall on the Yeast All dataset and 80% recall on the Human All dataset.

On the other hand, the use of SVM with local kernels was presented. Compared with the conventional global kernel, it\u2019s more robust since it can utilize the local features which are influenced only specific parts under partial occlusion.

With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the hepatic lesions recognition technology based on deep visual feature learning can achieve a higher accuracy. While reducing the workload for doctors, this technology can assist doctors to diagnose the disease, so as to obtain more objective and accurate diagnosis results.The database established in this paper mainly includes three kinds of CT images: primary liver cancer, cirrhosis and normal liver. After the database pretreatment with image de-noise algorithms based on median filter and picture enhancement algorithms based on histogram equalization, the convolution neural network CaffeNet was taken as the main framework, and a large number of labeled liver CT images were used to train the network in the experimental process. Meanwhile, the network parameters were continuously updated according to the cost function. Traditional hepatic lesion recognition technology only depends on the surface features from the image, such as gray scale, statistical structure and texture. Deep learning, a tool with high precision and robustness, could be used to mine the hidden features in the huge database. Through testing the trained deep learning model, the average recognition accuracy of 96.67% and the average single sample recognition time of 1.28 seconds could be achieved perfectly.

Global scale and Australia. We tested a variety of bioclimatic models for eight different plant species employing five discriminatory correlative species distribution models (SDMs) including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Bioclim, together with CLIMEX (CL) as a mechanistic niche model. These models were fitted using a training dataset of available global data, but with the exclusion of Australian locations. The capabilities of these techniques in projecting suitable climate, based on independent records for these species in Australia, were compared. Thus, Australia is not used to calibrate the models and therefore it is as an independent area regarding geographic locations. To assess and compare performance, we utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS), and fractional predicted areas for all SDMs. In addition, we assessed satisfactory agreements between the outputs of the six different bioclimatic models, for all eight species in Australia. The modeling method impacted on potential distribution predictions under current climate. However, the utilization of sensitivity and the fractional predicted areas showed that GLM, MaxEnt, Bioclim, and CL had the highest sensitivity for Australian climate conditions. Bioclim calculated the highest fractional predicted area of an independent area, while RF and BRT were poor. For many applications, it is difficult to decide which bioclimatic model to use. This research shows that variable results are obtained using different SDMs in an independent area. This research also shows that the SDMs produce different results for different species; for example, Bioclim may not be good for one species but works better for other species. Also, when projecting a \u201clarge\u201d number of species into novel environments or in an independent area, the selection of the \u201cbest\u201d model/technique is often less reliable than an ensemble modeling approach.

Analytical models are typically used to approximate real robot systems, and various controllers have been designed on top of the analytical model to compensate for the approximation error. Recently, machine learning techniques have been developed for error compensation, resulting in better performance. Unfortunately, combining a learned compensator with an analytical model makes the designed controller redundant and computationally expensive. Also, general machine learning techniques require a lot of data to perform the training process and approximation, especially in solving high dimensional problems. As a result, state-of-the-art machine learning applications are either expensive in terms of computation and data collection, or limited to a local approximation for a specific task or routine. In order to address the high dimensionality problem in learning inverse kinematics and dynamics, as well as to make the training process more data efficient, this paper presents a novel approach using a series of modified Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Namely, we use Conditional GANs (CGANs), Least Squares GANs (LSGANs), Bidirectional GANs (BiGANs) and Dual GANs(DualGANs). We trained and tested the proposed methods using real-world data collected from two types of robotic manipulators, a MICO robotic manipulator and a Fetch robotic manipulator. The data input to the GANs was obtained using a sampling method applied to the real data. The proposed approach enables approximating the real model using limited data without compromising the performance and accuracy.

Traditional color space based traffic lights detection algorithms could be easily affected by other objects (such as buildings, car taillights) in the surrounding environment, and the detection accuracy and real-time performance are not ideal enough. Generally, the deep learning based methods have better advantages of real-time and accuracy performance for the normal scene with obvious traffic lights targets. However, the small traffic lights targets detection rate and accuracy in night-time of these methods are still can't be satisfactory. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel traffic lights detection and recognition algorithm based on multi-feature fusion, which can be implemented in two steps (detection and recognition). For the first step, the SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) super-pixel segmentation algorithm is used for purposes reducing the image data processing complexity and improving the real-time performance. The mean-shift algorithm was used to cluster the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space components respectively for enhancing the target data and reducing the interference from other targets. For the second step, the feature information extracted by CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradient) feature are fused. The SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is trained on a data set of traffic lights established by our own.

In this regard, CAD systems based on machine learning and image processing techniques are developed to differentiate melanoma lesions from benign and dysplastic nevi using dermoscopic images. Generally, these frameworks are composed of sequential processes: pre-processing, segmentation, and classification. This architecture faces mainly two challenges: (i) each process is complex with the need to tune a set of parameters, and is specific to a given dataset; (ii) the performance of each process depends on the previous one, and the errors are accumulated throughout the framework. In this paper, we propose a framework for melanoma classification based on sparse coding which does not rely on any pre-processing or lesion segmentation. Our framework uses Random Forests classifier and sparse representation of three features: SIFT, Hue and Opponent angle histograms, and RGB intensities. The experiments are carried out on the public PH2 dataset using a 10-fold cross-validation. The results show that SIFT sparse-coded feature achieves the highest performance with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90.3% respectively, with a dictionary size of 800 atoms and a sparsity level of 2. Furthermore, the descriptor based on RGB intensities achieves similar results with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 71.3%, respectively for a smaller dictionary size of 100 atoms. In conclusion, dictionary learning techniques encode strong structures of dermoscopic images and provide discriminant descriptors.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2216973", "venue": "SPIE Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2230521999", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["24317370", "43360122", "38976787", "16815557", "89141", "8042197", "6920783", "26191138", "18792504", "21998707", "16464678", "72305748", "14469991", "1458265", "206596226", "7677466", "6888534", "11855688", "18331486", "14427335", "16513805", "121066701"], "inbound_citations": ["32394838", "199549021", "214861838", "195246991", "4062915", "2726467", "51983726", "51615365"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15573338"}

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood.

Existing graph-based propagation algorithms usually treat unlabeled examples equally, and transmit seed labels to the unlabeled examples that are connected to the labeled examples in a neighborhood graph. However, such a popular propagation scheme is very likely to yield inaccurate propagation, because it falls short of tackling ambiguous but critical data points (e.g., outliers). To this end, this paper treats the unlabeled examples in different levels of difficulties by assessing their reliability and discriminability, and explicitly optimizes the propagation quality by manipulating the propagation sequence to move from simple to difficult examples. In particular, we propose a novel iterative label propagation algorithm in which each propagation alternates between two paradigms, teaching-to-learn and learning-to-teach (TLLT). In the teaching-to-learn step, the learner conducts the propagation on the simplest unlabeled examples designated by the teacher. In the learning-to-teach step, the teacher incorporates the learner\u2019s feedback to adjust the choice of the subsequent simplest examples. The proposed TLLT strategy critically improves the accuracy of label propagation, making our algorithm substantially robust to the values of tuning parameters, such as the Gaussian kernel width used in graph construction.

In fact, the space of phylogenetic trees is a tropical Grassmannian in terms of max-plus algebra. Therefore, to classify multi-locus data sets for phylogenetic analysis, we propose tropical support vector machines (SVMs). Like classical SVMs, a tropical SVM is a discriminative classifier defined by the tropical hyperplane which maximizes the minimum tropical distance from data points to itself in order to separate these data points into sectors (half-spaces) in the tropical projective torus. Both hard margin tropical SVMs and soft margin tropical SVMs can be formulated as linear programming problems. We focus on classifying two categories of data, and we study a simpler case by assuming the data points from the same category ideally stay in the same sector of a tropical separating hyperplane. For hard margin tropical SVMs, we prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for two categories of data points to be separated, and we show an explicit formula for the optimal value of the feasible linear programming problem. For soft margin tropical SVMs, we develop novel methods to compute an optimal tropical separating hyperplane. Computational experiments show our methods work well.

The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to model the response of the carotid blood flow to different chest compression waveforms as a function of time during resuscitation from cardiac arrest. This work tests several approaches to predict the carotid blood flow generated by the next chest compression based on knowledge of the duration of resuscitation, the chest compression rate, and the last compression's carotid blood flow. Methods: Using an existing physiological database from swine cardiac arrest studies, we computed the features of CPR epoch, compression index, compression rate, and the previous carotid blood flow and used them as the inputs to our model in order to predict carotid blood flow using a Random Forest algorithm. We tested animal specific (estimated with data from a single animal) and global (estimated with data from all but one animals) models for effectiveness. Results: Animal specific models did not generalize when applied to the rest of the animals. The global model performed reasonably well when trained on six animals and tested on the 7th, resulting in errors of 40-160 \u03bcL per compression, compared to an average of approximately 400 \u03bcL net carotid blood flow per compression in early compressions. In addition, the global model highlighted the inter-animal variability in carotid blood flow generated by identical chest compression waveforms. Generation of probability distribution functions of carotid blood flows suggested at least three different distribution profiles in seven animals. Conclusion: A single physiological metric, carotid blood flow, combined with information about the duration of resuscitation and the compression rate was sufficient to model and predict carotid blood flow in the next compression. Significance: This demonstrates that the physiological response to chest compression can be predicted from a relatively modest data set. This suggests that closed loop mechanical CPR is a viable medical device target.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31403405", "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2019.2934682", "venue": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "mag_id": "2969100648", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199539006"}

This paper addresses this problem in the context of semantic segmentation. Current strategies fail on this task because they do not consider a peculiar aspect of semantic segmentation: since each training step provides annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the background class (i.e. pixels that do not belong to any other classes) exhibit a semantic distribution shift. In this work we revisit classical incremental learning methods, proposing a new distillation-based framework which explicitly accounts for this shift.

The recent trend in data mining is integrating multi-modal and multi-dimensional data for improved reservoir properties prediction. The objective of this paper is to employ hybrid machine learning and feature-selection based predictive models to estimate the permeability of carbonate reservoirs from integrated seismic and well log data. Hybrid models of Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (T2FLS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Functional Networks (FN) as the non-linear feature selection algorithm are proposed. Five seismic attributes were integrated with six commonly used Well logs. Data were collected from 33 oil Wells but only 17 of them had a complete matching seismic-log pair. The performance of the hybrid models were compared to those of the individual models without the non-linear but with the conventional feature selection algorithm. The comparative results showed improved prediction accuracies with the hybrid models and more excellently with the FN-SVM model. A blind test on the models revealed that the FN-SVM hybrid model gave an (R-Square) of 0.82, root mean square error of 0.46, and mean absolute error of 0.42 compared to the lowest performing T2FLS model with 0.40, 0.77 and 0.65 respectively. This demonstrates the significance of the hybrid machine learning paradigm in solving petroleum engineering problems with improved accuracies.

It not only has Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)\u2019s extremely fast training speed and better generalization performance than traditional Neuron Network (NN), but also has the merit in handling imbalance data by assigning more weight to minority class and less weight to majority class. But it still has the limitation of its weight generated according to class distribution of training data, thereby, creating dependency on input data [R. Sharma and A. S.

However, these kernel tricks could result in a longer training time or only a minute accuracy improvement (or both). On the other hand, if data from one class are separated into subclasses according to their proximity, then all the subclasses should be easily separated by hyperplanes. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy of linear SVM by first applying k means clustering to each class of input data. Then, after clustered, a multi-classes linear SVM is trained using each subclass as a separate class. Thus, the trained SVM can identify any new input into a subclass which can be easily mapped to the correct class.

Prior studies show that using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can significantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design robust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have been taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial edges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to discriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean graphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available in the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised knowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the robustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is neglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of improving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean graphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized aggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial edges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a poisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to penalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts, and transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned graph.

This variation especially hampers the application of otherwise successful supervised-learning techniques which, in order to perform well, often require a large amount of labeled training data that is exactly representative of the target data. We therefore propose to use transfer learning for image segmentation. Transfer-learning techniques can cope with differences in distributions between training and target data, and therefore may improve performance over supervised learning for segmentation across scanners and scan protocols. We present four transfer classifiers that can train a classification scheme with only a small amount of representative training data, in addition to a larger amount of other training data with slightly different characteristics. The performance of the four transfer classifiers was compared to that of standard supervised classification on two magnetic resonance imaging brain-segmentation tasks with multi-site data: white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid segmentation; and white-matter-/MS-lesion segmentation. The experiments showed that when there is only a small amount of representative training data available, transfer learning can greatly outperform common supervised-learning approaches, minimizing classification errors by up to 60%.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25376036", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2014.2366792", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["7623467", "961425", "9502424", "52874011", "8153773", "17033784", "15917446", "53335638", "20885957", "12587862", "11172804", "4078501", "15036406", "42007885", "41011989", "13021961", "12700546", "740063", "9216170", "75357633", "3081324", "64543020", "8054729", "41434082", "2995286", "6501130", "7859796", "15127540", "12927582", "3352475", "40256591", "7600590", "11695825", "7263397", "9520602", "31638406"], "inbound_citations": ["182949066", "159041750", "67855681", "73728965", "4803898", "4903005", "215150464", "52983907", "3622792", "2068465", "4779449", "67789892", "16711640", "91199087", "215548377", "51610741", "53289366", "59222756", "210123396", "2898025", "458063", "6119231", "41868828", "52289931", "9618348", "35807508", "198898096", "212616576", "19395044", "41160729", "5007388", "202706047", "211532689", "37526952", "51719291", "211069504", "44068793", "50772610", "57189554", "3306376", "215444490", "211190424", "14565242", "52273041", "52877796", "59523755", "12916864", "214634728", "51942808", "53098601", "209166639", "59600395", "198339906", "212657479", "53368818", "58007100", "53098684", "51982242", "2866568", "196660124", "92671930", "3746421", "208956931", "211043990", "21730326", "7359077", "115138152", "209391575", "215077177", "214999687", "6373134", "204509162", "52170403", "211171692", "12188411", "69720700"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206748677"}

This paper presents a novel Support Vector Machine (SVM) based Deep Specific Recognition Model (DeepSRM) that is learned based on a generic recognition model. The generic recognition model refers to the model trained with data across different conditions, i.e., when people are watching movies of different types. Although the generic recognition model can provide a baseline for the recognition model trained for each specific condition, the different behaviors people exhibit in different conditions limit the recognition performance of the generic model. Therefore, the specific recognition model is proposed for each condition separately and built on top of the generic recognition model. A number of experiments are conducted using a database aiming to study group analysis while each group (i.e., four participants together) were watching a number of long movie segments. Our experimental results show that the proposed deep specific recognition model (44%) outperforms the generic recognition model (26%).

In this study, we mitigate this labeling effort using generative adversarial networks (cycleGAN) wherein we synthesize realistic catheters in flouroscopy from localized guidewires in camera images whose annotations are cheaper to acquire. Our approach is motivated by the fact that catheters are tubular structures with varying profiles, thus given a guidewire in a camera image, we can obtain the centerline that follows the profile of a catheter in an X-ray image and create plausible X-ray images composited with such a centerline. In order to generate an image similar to the actual X-ray image, we propose a loss term that includes perceptual loss alongside the standard cycle loss.

With the fast development of internet and information technology, it is impossible to get a complete system dictionary for Chinese natural language processing, as new words out of the basic system dictionary are always being created. A latent semi-CRF model, which combines the strengths of LDCRF (Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Field) and semi-CRF, is proposed to detect the new words together with their POS synchronously regardless of the types of the new words from the Chinese text without being pre-segmented. Unlike the original semi-CRF, the LDCRF is applied to generate the candidate entities for training and testing the latent semi-CRF, which accelerates the training speed and decreases the computation cost. The complexity of the latent semi-CRF could be further adjusted by tuning the number of hidden variables in LDCRF and the number of the candidate entities from the Nbest outputs of the LDCRF. A new-words-generating framework is proposed for model training and testing, under which the definitions and distributions of the new words conform to the ones existing in real text.

Metabolite profiles have previously been shown to delineate BV and non-BV women and appear to be influenced by microbial composition. Therefore, we sought to determine if vaginal metabolites varied between smokers and non-smokers within each stratum of CST. Methods Forty reproductive-aged women (20 smokers/20 non-smokers) were recruited. Vaginal bacterial composition was characterised by 16S rRNA gene analysis. Metabolic profiles were determined by GC/MS and LC/MS and compared to libraries of known metabolites. Data were analysed with Random Forests, a method that uses decision trees to rank metabolite importance. Results We identified 619 metabolites from mid-vaginal swab eluates \u2013 three-fold more than previously described in the vagina. Women were categorised into CST-I ( L. crispatus -dominated), CST-III ( L. iners -dominated) and CST-IV (low- Lactobacillus /high anaerobes). Metabolites were strongly separated by CST ( F = 3.0855, P PERM = 0.0001). Within each CST, significant differences in metabolic profiles of smokers and non-smokers were evident. Nicotine and the breakdown metabolite cotinine was higher in smokers versus non-smokers from all CSTs. Smokers in CST-I had higher concentrations of xanthosine and paraxanthine. Smokers in CST-III were reduced in their relative concentrations of N-stearoyltaurine and 4-methylcatechol sulfate. Biogenic amines agmatine, cadaverine and spermidine were increased in smokers from CST-III and IV. Smokers from CST-IV had higher concentrations of kynurenate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate and palmitoyl ethanolamide. Conclusion The metabolite profile of the vaginal tract is strongly influenced by the vaginal microbiota. Detection of nicotine and breakdown products in the vagina may serve as molecular biomarkers of smoking. Kynurenate and biogenic amines have known roles in lymphocyte proliferation and inflammation and may indicate bacterial immune- and stress-resistance. Our results suggest that smoking affects several important metabolites present in the vagina that may have implications for women\u2019s health.

The use of the CNN approach requires large amounts of data to facilitate a complex end-to-end feature extraction and classification process. Within the context of Xray security screening, limited availability of object of interest data examples can thus pose a problem. To overcome this issue, we employ a transfer learning paradigm such that a pre-trained CNN, primarily trained for generalized image classification tasks where sufficient training data exists, can be optimized explicitly as a later secondary process towards this application domain. To provide a consistent feature-space comparison between this approach and traditional feature space representations, we also train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on CNN features. We empirically show that fine-tuned CNN features yield superior performance to conventional hand-crafted features on object classification tasks within this context. Overall we achieve 0.994 accuracy based on AlexNet features trained with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition to classification, we also explore the applicability of multiple CNN driven detection paradigms such as sliding window based CNN (SW-CNN), Faster RCNN (F-RCNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks (R-FCN) and YOLOv2. We train numerous networks tackling both single and multiple detections over SW-CNN/F-RCNN/RFCN/ YOLOv2 variants. YOLOv2, Faster-RCNN, and R-FCN provide superior results to the more traditional SW-CNN approaches. With the use of YOLOv2, using input images of size 544\u00d7544, we achieve 0.885 mean average precision (mAP) for a six-class object detection problem. The same approach with an input of size 416\u00d7416 yields 0.974 mAP for the two-class firearm detection problem and requires approximately 100ms per image.

Transfer learning is used to adapt the surrogate model (trained using supervised learning technique) for different scenarios where solar energy potential, wind speed and energy demand are notably different.

We consider learning multiple multiclass classification tasks online where no information is ever provided about the task category of a training example. The algorithm thus needs an automated task recognition capability to properly learn the different classification tasks. The learning mode is ldquoonlinerdquo where training examples for different tasks are mixed in a random fashion and given sequentially one after another. We assume that the classification tasks are related to each other and that both the tasks and their training examples appear in random during ldquoonline training.rdquo Thus, the learning algorithm has to continually switch from learning one task to another whenever the training examples change to a different task. This also implies that the learning algorithm has to detect task changes automatically and utilize knowledge of previous tasks for learning new tasks fast.

Data mining algorithms were used to develop models to forecast the outcome of leafroller pest monitoring decisions on 'Hayward' kiwifruit crops in New Zealand. Using industry spray diary and pest monitoring data gathered at an orchard block level for compliance purposes, 80 attributes (independent variables) were created in three categories from the spray diary data: (1) individual insecticide applications applied during 2-week time windows, (2) groups of insecticide applications within time periods prior to or after fruit set and (3) orchard management attributes. Five machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine) and one statistical method (Logistic regression) (classifiers) were used to develop models to forecast insecticide application decisions for leafroller control, by predicting whether pest monitoring results were above or below a spray threshold.

Detecting cognitive distraction represents an important function for driver distraction mitigation systems. We developed a layered algorithm that integrated two data mining methods--Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) and supervised clustering--to detect cognitive distraction using eye movement and driving performance measures. In this study, the algorithm was trained and tested with the data collected in a simulator-based study, where drivers drove either with or without an auditory secondary task. We calculated 19 distraction indicators and defined cognitive distraction using the experimental condition (i.e., \"distraction\" as in the drives with the secondary task, and \"no distraction\" as in the drives without the secondary task). We compared the layered algorithm with previously developed DBN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The results showed that the layered algorithm achieved comparable prediction performance as the two alternatives. Nonetheless, the layered algorithm shortened training and prediction time compared to the original DBN because supervised clustering improved computational efficiency by reducing the number of inputs for DBNs. Moreover, the supervised clustering of the layered algorithm revealed rich information on the relationship between driver cognitive state and performance. This study demonstrates that the layered algorithm can capitalize on the best attributes of component data mining methods and can identify human cognitive state efficiently.

Features are extracted from each convolutional layer and the classification accuracy achieved by a Support Vector Machine is measured on a dataset that is disjoint from the samples used in training of the ResNet-50 model.

For this purpose, it is necessary to consider a mono-town as a complete system, a living organism with a definite life cycle and structure of energy consumers.

In this paper, we propose a generative model trained with synthetic images rendered from 3D models which can reduce the burden on collecting real training data and make the background conditions more realistic. Our architecture is composed of two sub-networks: a semantic foreground object reconstruction network based on Bayesian inference and a classification network based on multi-triplet cost training for avoiding overfitting on the monotone synthetic object surface and utilizing accurate information of synthetic images like object poses and lighting conditions which are helpful for recognizing regular photos. First, our generative model with metric learning utilizes additional foreground object channels generated from semantic foreground object reconstruction sub-network for recognizing the original input images. Multi-triplet cost function based on poses is used for metric learning which makes it possible to train an effective categorical classifier purely based on synthetic data. Second, we design a coordinate training strategy with the help of adaptive noise applied on the inputs of both of the concatenated sub-networks to make them benefit from each other and avoid inharmonious parameter tuning due to different convergence speeds of two sub-networks.

Online monitoring of the degradation process in SiCf-SiCm composites is of great importance to ensure the safety of the nuclear reactor system. The degradation monitoring task can be mapped as a classification problem: given the Acoustic Emission(AE) events at a given timeslot, the model is expected to predict which one of the following three stages the material is in: elastic, matrix-driven and fiber-driven cracking. In this paper, degradation tests on SiCf-SiCm composite tubes were conducted using a bladder-based internal pressure technique with AE monitoring. We then trained a deep learning based end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) model for online monitoring of the damage progression process of SiCf-SiCm composite tubes using the AE data as the raw input. As a comparison, we also applied Random Forest (RF) with expert-crafted audio event features to the damage stage prediction problem. Experimental results show that both RF and CNN models yield good results but on average our end-to-end CNN models outperform the RF models due to its high-level feature extraction capability. The CNN model with single events can reach an average prediction accuracy of 84.4% compared to 74% of the RF models. Combining multiple audio samples typically improves the accuracy of the models with RF accuracy reaching 82.8% and CNN accuracy reaching 86.6%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2943210", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2977135140", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["94671237", "139937340", "89141", "42216944", "206471429", "122724049", "204920626", "29304113", "206190760", "19574528", "15539264", "6844431", "114095901", "137209543", "34085971", "8810481", "6593498", "751749"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204080119"}

In this article, we describe an extension of our system (namely UET-CAM) that participated in the BioCreative V CDR. The original UET-CAM system\u2019s performance was ranked fourth among 18 participating systems by the BioCreative CDR track committee. In the Disease Named Entity Recognition and Normalization (DNER) phase, our system employed joint inference (decoding) with a perceptron-based named entity recognizer (NER) and a back-off model with Semantic Supervised Indexing and Skip-gram for named entity normalization. In the chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction phase, we proposed a pipeline that includes a coreference resolution module and a Support Vector Machine relation extraction model. The former module utilized a multi-pass sieve to extend entity recall. In this article, the UET-CAM system was improved by adding a \u2018silver\u2019 CID corpus to train the prediction model. This silver standard corpus of more than 50 thousand sentences was automatically built based on the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) database. We evaluated our method on the CDR test set. Results showed that our system could reach the state of the art performance with F1 of 82.44 for the DNER task and 58.90 for the CID task.
