Least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) has been receiving increasing interest in areas ranging from its original application in pattern recognition to other applications such as regression estimation due to its remarkable generalization performance. In this paper, LS-SVM is a promising method for the forecasting of gas concentration because it uses a risk function consisting of the empirical error and a regularized term which is derived from the structural risk minimization principle. The variability in performance of LSSVM with respect to the free parameters is investigated experimentally. In addition, this study examines the feasibility of applying LS-SVM in gas concentration forecasting by comparing it with the multilayer back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and the regularized radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The experimental results show that among the three methods, LS-SVM outperforms the BPNN gas concentration forecasting, and there are comparable generalization performance between LS-SVM and RBFNN, but LS-SVM converges faster than the RBFNN.

However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961\u20131990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4\u201316% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001\u20132009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar\u2013hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning.

Graph stream classification aims to learn a classification model from a stream of graphs with only one-pass of data, requiring real-time processing in training and prediction. This is a nontrivial task, as many existing methods require multipass of the graph stream to extract subgraph structures as features for graph classification which does not simultaneously satisfy \u201cone-pass\u201d and \u201creal-time\u201d requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive real-time graph stream classification method to address this challenge. We partition the unbounded graph stream data into consecutive graph chunks, each consisting of a fixed number of graphs and delivering a corresponding chunk-level classifier. We employ a random hashing function to compress the original node set of graphs in each chunk for fast feature detection when training chunk-level classifiers. Furthermore, a differential hashing strategy is applied to map unlimited increasing features (i.e., cliques) into a fixed-size feature space which is then used as a feature vector for stochastic learning.

We consider spatial contexts, for which we solve so-called jigsaw puzzles, i.e., each image is cut into grids and then disordered, and the goal is to recover the correct configuration. Existing approaches formulated it as a classification task by defining a fixed mapping from a small subset of configurations to a class set, but these approaches ignore the underlying relationship between different configurations and also limit their applications to more complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach which applies to jigsaw puzzles with an arbitrary grid size and dimensionality. We provide a fundamental and generalized principle, that weaker cues are easier to be learned in an unsupervised manner and also transfer better. In the context of puzzle recognition, we use an iterative manner which, instead of solving the puzzle all at once, adjusts the order of the patches in each step until convergence. In each step, we combine both unary and binary features of each patch into a cost function judging the correctness of the current configuration. Our approach, by taking similarity between puzzles into consideration, enjoys a more efficient way of learning visual knowledge. We verify the effectiveness of our approach from two aspects. First, it solves arbitrarily complex puzzles, including high-dimensional puzzles, that prior methods are difficult to handle. Second, it serves as a reliable way of network initialization, which leads to better transfer performance in visual recognition tasks including classification, detection and segmentation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1812.00329", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00201", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2955933297,2964060161,2903520223", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7817156", "27623606", "51872664", "49865868", "1274537", "206597351", "9062671", "6161478", "62437194", "4246903", "1966580", "4009713", "206770307", "1241368", "206594692", "9433631", "5776303", "206592218", "3144218", "195908774", "12369376", "206741597", "3074096", "9232547", "12983299", "56507745", "206429151", "9348728", "4448336", "187547", "7275771", "199587467", "3035960", "3966049", "11758569", "6383532", "10328909", "4625569", "3719281", "5776545", "12220680", "2930547", "8518974", "14124313", "206592484", "5276358", "47064121", "47016865", "8105340", "4702621", "195347098", "1849990", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["208267682", "212634334", "62841734", "203736814", "210702725"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54437811"}

The nuclear proteins are crucial for chromosomal maintenance/segregation, gene expression, RNA processing/export, and many other processes. Several methods have been developed for predicting the nuclear proteins in the past. The aim of the present study is to develop a new method for predicting nuclear proteins with higher accuracy.ResultsAll modules were trained and tested on a non-redundant dataset and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation technique. Firstly, Support Vector Machines (SVM) based modules have been developed using amino acid and dipeptide compositions and achieved a Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.59 and 0.61 respectively. Secondly, we have developed SVM modules using split amino acid compositions (SAAC) and achieved the maximum MCC of 0.66. Thirdly, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based module/profile was developed for searching exclusively nuclear and non-nuclear domains in a protein. Finally, a hybrid module was developed by combining SVM module and HMM profile and achieved a MCC of 0.87 with an accuracy of 94.61%. This method performs better than the existing methods when evaluated on blind/independent datasets. Our method estimated 31.51%, 21.89%, 26.31%, 25.72% and 24.95% of the proteins as nuclear proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, mouse and human proteomes respectively. Based on the above modules, we have developed a web server NpPred for predicting nuclear proteins http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/nppred/.ConclusionThis study describes a highly accurate method for predicting nuclear proteins. SVM module has been developed for the first time using SAAC for predicting nuclear proteins, where amino acid composition of N-terminus and the remaining protein were computed separately. In addition, our study is a first documentation where exclusively nuclear and non-nuclear domains have been identified and used for predicting nuclear proteins.

Most of the previously proposed graph construction methods are unsupervised in nature, as they ignore the label information already present in the SSL setting in which they operate. In this paper, we explore how available labeled instances can be used to construct a better graph which is tailored to the current classification task. To achieve this goal, we evaluate effectiveness of various supervised metric learning algorithms during graph construction. Additionally, we propose a new metric learning framework: Inference Driven Metric Learning (IDML), which extends existing supervised metric learning algorithms to exploit widely available unlabeled data during the metric learning step itself. We provide extensive empirical evidence demonstrating that inference over graph constructed using IDML learned metric can lead to significant reduction in classification error, compared to inference over graphs constructed using existing techniques. Finally, we demonstrate how active learning can be successfully incorporated within the the IDML framework to reduce the amount of supervision necessary during graph construction.

The use of computational techniques involving artificial intelligence and image processing has contributed more and more to support the specialists in obtaining a more precise diagnosis. METHODS: This paper proposes a methodology that exclusively uses texture analysis to describe features of masses in digitized mammograms. To increase the efficiency of texture feature extraction, the diversity index's capability to detect patterns of species co-occurrence is used. For this purpose, the Gleason and Menhinick indexes are used. Finally, the extracted texture is classified using the Support Vector Machine, looking to differentiate the malignant masses from the benign. RESULTS: The best result was obtained using the Gleason index, with 86.66% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, 83.33% specificity and an area under the ROC Curve (Az) of 0.86. CONCLUSION: Both indexes showed statistically similar performance; however, the Gleason index was slightly superior.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4322/rbeb.2014.008", "venue": "Revista Brasileira de Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica", "journal": "Revista Brasileira de Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2010700452", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["195684331", "82831554", "44404541", "961425", "62642944", "206786900", "68362967", "121276449", "28399860", "30575633", "33578981", "5905078", "16539414", "84875868", "11509081", "20236563", "25213224", "18283718", "28637672", "41242745", "13520515"], "inbound_citations": ["46896340", "11919344"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52083001"}

In this study, we test different predictive modeling approaches for estimating Energy Use Intensity (EUI) for US commercial office buildings and the individual energy end-uses of HVAC, plug loads, and lighting, based on the latest Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) 2012 microdata. After preliminary statistical analysis, six regression or machine learning techniques are applied and compared for prediction performance. Among all candidates, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest demonstrate both accuracy and stability. However, machine learning algorithms are better than the linear regression only to a limited extent, with on average 10\u201315% lower prediction errors for Total EUI prediction. Conversely, linear regression models slightly outperform machine learning methods in estimating Plug Loads EUI. These mixed results suggest careful consideration in applying advanced predictive algorithms to the CBECS dataset. Individual variable importance was tested using Random Forest, with the top 10 predictors differing for the total and sub-system EUIs. The analysis demonstrates that, for the techniques applied, the variables reported in CBECS have inadequate predictive power to map actual energy consumption.

ECG representations are learned by a signal transformation recognition network. The network learns high-level abstract representations from unlabeled ECG data. Six different signal transformations are applied to the ECG signals, and transformation recognition is performed as pretext tasks. Training the model on pretext tasks helps our network learn spatiotemporal representations that generalize well across different datasets and different emotion categories. We transfer the weights of the self-supervised network to an emotion recognition network, where the convolutional layers are kept frozen and the dense layers are trained with labelled ECG data. We show that our proposed method considerably improves the performance compared to a network trained using fully-supervised learning.

However, the quality of the resulting model crucially relies on the expressiveness of the inference model. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB), a technique for training Variational Autoencoders with arbitrarily expressive inference models. We achieve this by introducing an auxiliary discriminative network that allows to rephrase the maximum-likelihood-problem as a two-player game, hence establishing a principled connection between VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We show that in the nonparametric limit our method yields an exact maximum-likelihood assignment for the parameters of the generative model, as well as the exact posterior distribution over the latent variables given an observation. Contrary to competing approaches which combine VAEs with GANs, our approach has a clear theoretical justification, retains most advantages of standard Variational Autoencoders and is easy to implement.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1701.04722", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952673310,2579277680", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["117000403", "13995862", "8768364", "84591", "6104263", "7101807", "1033682", "206594692", "2757547", "1176485", "10186982", "11514441", "6072417", "8785311", "14542261", "39872644", "9969477", "459456", "1972072", "11112994", "2023211", "1292495", "107645", "11758569", "736758", "12554042", "16895865", "67381884", "14989939", "13583585"], "inbound_citations": ["54146899", "52171239", "57375701", "53073317", "204838066", "52928892", "49665341", "90258881", "195832046", "54081458", "166228020", "198145997", "139107623", "160009778", "69530308", "3826036", "195798904", "198968035", "53084856", "47008571", "3833554", "50776178", "49863692", "52161924", "52965042", "201070139", "26668832", "115134494", "46939522", "1102029", "211252572", "34040907", "73679608", "49742003", "47011860", "4747025", "61809828", "19115748", "211004079", "21140441", "53250428", "211298325", "203606077", "48354854", "44106530", "54039400", "4809276", "204950392", "125121895", "5051282", "211506594", "2349418", "52281710", "52894495", "203593336", "62918652", "210692015", "14570343", "209524833", "119304974", "102483685", "146809512", "211574547", "1176485", "52286437", "118647892", "71149553", "9768941", "51930417", "203692479", "49210757", "49658725", "53500719", "24016284", "52158713", "145048710", "67769433", "208176008", "52283616", "3529936", "70350032", "145964395", "202772297", "10040085", "54058392", "155089284", "914501", "32773083", "43949511", "49667998", "32714539", "53378016", "59413924", "155100374", "24587981", "195346042", "52931207", "49209375", "4656694", "201698224", "3508638", "58006604", "3481010", "44167674", "4560603", "43939347", "202538803", "208542956", "204824208", "211118191", "25593412", "208010442", "3621232", "3631901", "29157105", "202778107", "202764816", "209444272", "208123993", "62835115", "198179579", "56474243", "3357865", "211224946", "186206719", "204008419", "12256925", "189858337", "9302801", "86412119", "88522450", "49876500", "22852474", "42393436", "211531452", "58672494", "37044800", "19893784", "88521144", "210839653", "214714561", "214623394", "52290451", "62841645", "20404279", "53080148", "53249777", "3125754", "208617491", "202560588", "51934350", "43957121", "3614357", "54029681", "44807913", "3268720", "201140272", "49671188", "3680335", "119308384", "51944148", "52947374", "52947374", "203610412", "54447086", "3859452", "3483047", "56895255", "18408394", "28059433", "173991122", "198923737", "67856728", "52184258", "146120959", "21583479", "209844853", "209316170", "52895409", "53160152", "5028564", "3413715", "88516101", "51825971", "22901106", "44146533", "52986890", "53046753", "44129259", "174801098", "1564507"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:605416"}

We find an advantage for correlation-based representation learning, while the best results on most tasks are obtained with our new variant, deep canonically correlated autoencoders (DCCAE).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ICML", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1883346539", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5702881", "2495132", "1580352", "2380455", "7691428", "14079018", "11567084", "1145503", "5709930", "217774", "961425", "2800834", "7774791", "519902", "3792324", "15601387", "11583904", "7185434", "202473", "1658773", "928608", "122166830", "5740053", "6792954", "1302147", "13945591", "10223494", "19536953", "14542261", "5624519", "874413", "277457", "33570889", "26901423", "18764978", "352650", "1957433", "64543020", "9197086", "8563582", "710430", "8936496", "17804904", "761978", "14488097", "42041158", "1830773"], "inbound_citations": ["52302901", "14701299", "56173785", "54446206", "140235498", "1267737", "195317017", "6171136", "209006601", "69764200", "131776464", "35367723", "8246491", "195347107", "3423672", "174801299", "204535872", "53095472", "2867243", "44505277", "209853223", "195798904", "47020689", "52968048", "1534702", "14832335", "9461224", "198179469", "51850379", "2647832", "11242334", "202770169", "71150055", "207758389", "17845861", "6641690", "15688444", "24716231", "139090404", "28274047", "30227854", "195791753", "15269703", "146811135", "203605940", "204809311", "53717388", "90261346", "7508221", "202583670", "52148283", "52278448", "201902407", "8261939", "16702244", "69774072", "211723645", "11416787", "10334009", "3210759", "6926927", "8650061", "70047933", "209176706", "52057446", "4935860", "21688999", "209420630", "195347833", "195808312", "31438356", "1256595", "195584084", "146059366", "3337633", "15339392", "88515414", "14817534", "201660247", "52964239", "197633187", "209452789", "36979319", "4383922", "8213209", "78095095", "158046919", "53975307", "5925683", "32300562", "24684862", "7891208", "73724847", "433382", "18166588", "4562167", "53113804", "51878244", "214714465", "6419793", "53035211", "69824621", "18365605", "53714187", "34106601", "70290628", "53036778", "155720043", "67788110", "85499201", "13550390", "49186584", "160011316", "198165359", "21833080", "16156893", "53719993", "209843915", "34264868", "165117617", "15651829", "16170024", "53866024", "208643385", "18447312", "207977064", "1416535", "2864373", "7559976", "11473956", "4439453", "49397352", "19220314", "204744117", "209501590", "53695298", "16059121", "16102569", "86645888", "208002318", "16565399", "46942171", "53108231", "34567620", "11356405", "18010010", "13509748", "4029742", "6314764", "57754596", "211146549", "10047351", "5809636", "199442572", "86832326", "3637408", "204837544", "9471964", "81978057", "195750492", "9243519", "92477026", "56449491", "8728609", "208207242", "1539344", "214772746", "11533063", "209333315", "19174354", "197631968", "25437893", "198906771", "213174990", "52186795", "209459365", "67871604", "4682293", "169032532", "174800489", "51935625", "16733625", "211055796", "211677783", "51613426", "202778036", "69388495", "207756610", "53848110", "202640625", "7680187", "21726743", "195758625", "51610893", "197544778", "89605507", "10278413", "51611871", "199465992", "440272", "52908638", "54015769", "16744726", "202778887", "52147318", "9228543", "209515968", "211066445", "204974665", "203377803", "2203482", "140119311", "203687270", "199489015", "4555230", "204837259", "211029667", "215327116", "83458663"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14269196"}

The aim of this survey is to draw a user profile, by analysing his or her tweets. In this early stage of research, being a pre-processing phase, a dictionary based approach is considered.

Early assessment of patients\u2019 mortality in intensive care units is of great importance. In this paper, a Deep Rule-Based Fuzzy System (DRBFS) was proposed to develop an accurate in-hospital mortality prediction in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients employing a large number of input variables. Our main contribution is proposing a system, which is capable of dealing with big data with heterogeneous mixed categorical and numeric attributes. In DRBFS, the hidden layer in each unit is represented by interpretable fuzzy rules. Benefiting the strength of soft partitioning, a modified supervised fuzzy k-prototype clustering has been employed for fuzzy rule generation. According to the stacked approach, the same input space is kept in every base building unit of DRBFS. The training set in addition to random shifts, obtained from random projections of prediction results of the current base building unit is presented as the input of the next base building unit. A cohort of 10,972 adult admissions was selected from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data set, where 9.31% of patients have died in the hospital. A heterogeneous feature set of first 48 h from ICU admissions, were extracted for in-hospital mortality rate. Required preprocessing and appropriate feature extraction were applied. To avoid biased assessments, performance indexes were calculated using holdout validation. We have evaluated our proposed method with several common classifiers including naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and D-TSK-FC. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for NB, DT, GB, DBN, D-TSK-FC and our proposed method were 73.51%, 61.81%, 72.98%, 70.07%, 66.74% and 73.90% respectively.

Meteorological data and its effect have been the attention of the researchers of the smart city planning for thorough utilization and management of resources, that help in effective government management, convenient public services and sustainable industrial development.

Wind energy is utilized through wind turbines and requires foreknowledge of wind parameters like speed and direction. The aim of this paper is to predict dominant wind speed and direction for time-series wind dataset, that can be incorporated into city planning for selecting suitable sites for wind turbines. This paper proposes three one-dimensional (1D) algorithms using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for dominant wind speed and direction prediction. The proposed 1D LSTM (1DLSTM), RF (1DRF) and SVM (1DSVM) take successive time values in terms of wind speed and direction as input and predict the future dominant speed and direction, separately. The proposed algorithms are trained and tested using historical wind dataset of Stuttgart and Netherlands respectively. Prediction using 1DLSTM results in total accuracies reaching up to 93.9% and 94.7%, up to 92.8% and 93.8% using 1DSVM and up to 88.7% and 89.3% using 1DRF for speed and direction, respectively.

In this study, we defined the landscape of ECM-associated transcriptional dysregulation and performed in-silico associative analyses in terms of multiple -omics platforms, cellular composition and immunological parameters. Methods We defined the landscape of ECM gene dysregulation by integrating curated Gene Ontology ECM genes with genes differentially expressed between cancer and normal tissues from TCGA. ssGSEA scores for this set were then correlated with purity (ABSOLUTE), tested for stromal association using microdissected tumours and MethylCIBERSORT, and neoepitope counts derived using Topiary. Single-cell RNAseq data was used to validate CAF-origin. Linear models were used to identify transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic correlates, and finally, RNAseq data from three cohorts of PD1-blockade treated patients and 0.632 bootstrap evaluation of logistic regression or Random Forest models based on ECM genes, Cytolytic Activity, Mutational burden or their combinations was performed. Results A core set of 58 ECM genes is dysregulated and significantly enriched amongst genes differentially expressed between cancer and normal tissues pan-cancer. Those upregulated in cancers were found to be a negative prognostic factor pan-cancer and through integrative analysis of microdissected samples, deconvolution and single-cell RNAseq, were found to originate in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts. Transcriptome, proteome and genomics analyses implicated TGF-beta as a driver of this ECM-dysregulation signature and most notably, this programme was associated with heavily-mutated, neoantigen-high, CD8 high cancers, M1-macrophage-skewed tumours suggesting a role as a putative adaptation permitting immune evasion. Indeed, ECM dysregulation scores were significantly better predictors of response to PD1-blockade in pretreatment biopsies compared to cytolytic activity, an interferon gene signature, and mutational-burden, while TGF-beta expression alone was not, implicating a key role for CAF-specific ECM gene dysregulation in immune evasion. Conclusion A TGF-beta associated, CAF-derived signature of ECM-gene dysregulation broadly in operation across cancer types constitutes an immune evasion mechanism that indicates refractoriness to PD1-blockade.

The task of question classification is to predict the entity type of the answer of a natural language question. Question classification is typically done using machine learning techniques. Different lexical, syntactical and semantic features can be extracted from a question. In this work we introduce two new semantic features which improve the accuracy of classification. Furthermore, we developed a weighed approach to optimally combine different features. We also applied Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique to reduce the large feature space of questions to a much smaller and efficient feature space. We adopted two different classifiers: Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found that applying LSA on question classification can not only make the question classification more time efficient, but it also improves the classification accuracy by removing the redundant features. Furthermore, we discovered that when the original feature space is compact and efficient, its reduced space performs better than a large feature space with a rich set of features. In addition, we found that in the reduced feature space, BPNN performs better than SVMs which are widely used in question classification.

ObjectiveTo evaluate whether vector representations encoding latent topic proportions that capture similarities to MeSH terms can improve performance on biomedical document retrieval and classification tasks, compared to using MeSH terms. Materials and methodsWe developed the TopicalMeSH representation, which exploits the 'correspondence' between topics generated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and MeSH terms to create new document representations that combine MeSH terms and latent topic vectors. We used 15 systematic drug review corpora to evaluate performance on information retrieval and classification tasks using this TopicalMeSH representation, compared to using standard encodings that rely on either (1) the original MeSH terms, (2) the text, or (3) their combination. For the document retrieval task, we compared the precision and recall achieved by ranking citations using MeSH and TopicalMeSH representations, respectively. For the classification task, we considered three supervised machine learning approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), logistic regression, and decision trees. We used these to classify documents as relevant or irrelevant using (independently) MeSH, TopicalMeSH, Words (i.e., n-grams extracted from citation titles and abstracts, encoded via bag-of-words representation), a combination of MeSH and Words, and a combination of TopicalMeSH and Words. We also used SVM to compare the classification performance of tf-idf weighted MeSH terms, LDA Topics, a combination of Topics and MeSH, and TopicalMeSH to supervised LDA's classification performance. ResultsFor the document retrieval task, using the TopicalMeSH representation resulted in higher precision than MeSH in 11 of 15 corpora while achieving the same recall. For the classification task, use of TopicalMeSH features realized a higher F1 score in 14 of 15 corpora when used by SVMs, 12 of 15 corpora using logistic regression, and 12 of 15 corpora using decision trees. TopicalMeSH also had better document classification performance on 12 of 15 corpora when compared to Topics, tf-idf weighted MeSH terms, and a combination of Topics and MeSH using SVMs. Supervised LDA achieved the worst performance in most of the corpora.

To fix the problem, we developed an effective algorithm to detect abnormal step counting, which extract 13 non-directional features from acceleration data, and feed them into One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to check wether it is abnormal. The detection algorithm has been tested on a dataset composed of 600 minutes real world data, which is captured by 10 users. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is capable of detecting most of the abnormal situations while not mistaking normal activity (walking/running) for abnormal.

Gene expression data usually contains a large number of tumor-free data and has the characteristics of high dimensions. In order to select determinant genes related to breast cancer from the initial gene expression data, we propose a new feature selection method, namely, support vector machine based on recursive feature elimination and parameter optimization (SVM-RFE-PO). The grid search (GS) algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and the genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to search the optimal parameters in the feature selection process. Herein, the new feature selection method contains three kinds of algorithms: support vector machine based on recursive feature elimination and grid search (SVM-RFE-GS), support vector machine based on recursive feature elimination and particle swarm optimization (SVM-RFE-PSO), and support vector machine based on recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithm (SVM-RFE-GA). Then the selected optimal feature subsets are used to train the SVM classifier for cancer classification. We also use random forest feature selection (RFFS), random forest feature selection and grid search (RFFS-GS), and minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) algorithm as feature selection methods to compare the effects of the SVM-RFE-PO algorithm. The results showed that the feature subset obtained by feature selection using SVM-RFE-PSO algorithm results has a better prediction performance of Area Under Curve (AUC) in the testing data set.

The classic weights of the weighted SVR are added to the slack variables in the objective function (OF-weights). This procedure directly shrinks the coefficient of each observation in the estimated functions; thus, it is widely used for minimizing influence of outliers. We propose to additionally add weights to the slack variables in the constraints (CF-weights) and call the combination of weights the doubly weighted SVR. We illustrate the differences and similarities of the two types of weights by demonstrating the connection between the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the SVR. We show that an SVR problem can be transformed to a LASSO problem plus a linear constraint and a box constraint. We demonstrate the capabilities of the doubly weighted approach through an example of prediction of house prices. The weight functions in the house pricing model depend on the geographical distance to the house of interest and the difference in time of sale (CF-weights) as well as the differences lying in variables (OF-weights), such as house size and number of floors. The results illustrate that the combination of the two types of weights describes the relative importance of observations very well and lowers the influence of possible outliers. Therefore, it enables the SVR models to have good performance.

The existing global feature-based methods have worse accuracies than regional feature-based methods, because regional feature-based methods focus on the determination of differentiated features within local regions. To learn more discriminative global features, in this paper, we proposed the use of L2 normalization to tackle a neglected conflict between the widely used metric loss (triplet loss) and classification loss (softmax loss) in global feature-based methods. Furthermore, a multi-level metric learning network (MMLN) is proposed for fine-grained image classification based on global features. In the MMLN, multi-level metric learning objectives and classification objectives are present at multiple high-level layers. The multi-level metric learning objectives work together to supervise the network in order to learn highly discriminative features. In addition, a new probability aggregation strategy (PAS) is proposed to produce a fused prediction by combining the multi-level predictive probabilities. Experiments were conducted on three standard fine-grained classification datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft). Results demonstrated that our MMLN achieved accuracies of 88.0%, 94.6% and 92.4% respectively and outperformed state-of-the-art methods, substantially improving fine-grained classification tasks. Besides, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) shows that the MMLN is able to pay more attention to the discriminative local regions due to the application of multi-level metric learning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953957", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2991619217", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16119123", "14342571", "206594692", "206592766", "1829423", "11710343", "10610121", "52155581", "127017046", "198905043", "85455797", "10685040", "6882979", "52065963", "59336116", "76666182", "1331231", "12916936", "4533146", "2053770", "50788959", "52957198", "2897719", "9757556", "1325997", "49207803", "56598304", "53622838", "85517477", "8485068", "206597034", "1396647", "206593880", "206592484", "4242479", "199452868", "206771654"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208280262"}

By\"seeing\"many different analogy problems, along with possible solutions, Analogator gradually develops an ability to make new analogies. That is, it learns to make analogies by analogy. This approach stands in contrast to most existing research on analogy-making, in which typically the a priori existence of analogical mechanisms within a model is assumed. The present research extends standard connectionist methodologies by developing a specialized associative training procedure for a recurrent network architecture. The network is trained to divide input scenes (or situations) into appropriate figure and ground components. Seeing one scene in terms of a particular figure and ground provides the context for seeing another in an analogous fashion. After training, the model is able to make new analogies between novel situations. Analogator has much in common with lower-level perceptual models of categorization and recognition; it thus serves as a unifying framework encompassing both high-level analogical learning and low-level perception. This approach is compared and contrasted with other computational models of analogy-making.

Thus, in order to overcome these gaps, a new ensemble based anomaly detection scheme called \"Hybrid Classification Model for Anomaly Detection (HyClass)\" in cloud environment has been proposed.

To attain an optimum medical treatment for breast cancer, an early breast cancer detection is crucial. This paper proposes a multistage feature selection method that extracts statistically significant features for breast cancer size detection using proposed data normalization techniques. Ultra-wideband (UWB) signals, controlled using microcontroller are transmitted via an antenna from one end of the breast phantom and are received on the other end. These ultra-wideband analogue signals are represented in both time and frequency domain. The preprocessed digital data is passed to the proposed multi-stage feature selection algorithm. This algorithm has four selection stages. It comprises of data normalization methods, feature extraction, data dimensional reduction and feature fusion. The output data is fused together to form the proposed datasets, namely, 8-HybridFeature, 9-HybridFeature and 10-HybridFeature datasets. The classification performance of these datasets is tested using the Support Vector Machine, Probabilistic Neural Network and Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers for breast cancer size classification. The research findings indicate that the 8-HybridFeature dataset performs better in comparison to the other two datasets. For the 8-HybridFeature dataset, the Na\u00efve Bayes classifier (91.98%) outperformed the Support Vector Machine (90.44%) and Probabilistic Neural Network (80.05%) classifiers in terms of classification accuracy.

Alignment is a basic concept to measure sequence similarity in Proteomics that has been used in a number of applications ranging from protein recognition to protein subcellular localization. In this article, we propose a novel integrated approach to predicting PPI based on sequence alignment by jointly using a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (SA-kNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

We demonstrate that in our approach the two methods, SA-kNN and SVM, are complementary, which are combined in an ensemble to overcome their respective limitations. While the SVM is trained on Amino Acid (AA) compositions and protein signatures mined from literature, the SA-kNN makes use of the similarity of two protein pairs through alignment.

While showing promising results, these approaches suffer three problems. First, they involve solving non-convex optimization problems where achieving the global optimal is NP-hard.

The paper compares implementations of the algorithms in traditional data mining tools with HPC realizations and \u2019big data\u2019 technology stacks.

Our team has demonstrated several photonic reservoir computers with performance comparable to digital algorithms on a series of benchmark tasks such as channel equalisation and speech recognition. Recently, we showed that our opto-electronic reservoir computer could be trained online with a simple gradient descent algorithm programmed on an FPGA chip. This setup makes it in principle possible to feed the output signal back into the reservoir, and thus highly enrich the dynamics of the system. This will allow to tackle complex prediction tasks in hardware, such as pattern generation and chaotic and financial series prediction, which have so far only been studied in digital implementations. Here we report simulation results of our opto-electronic setup with an FPGA chip and output feedback applied to pattern generation and Mackey-Glass chaotic series prediction. The simulations take into account the major aspects of our experimental setup. We find that pattern generation can be easily implemented on the current setup with very good results. The Mackey-Glass series prediction task is more complex and requires a large reservoir and more elaborate training algorithm. With these adjustments promising result are obtained, and we now know what improvements are needed to match previously reported numerical results.

The rich sensor data can be continuously monitored for intrusion events through anomaly detection. However, conventional threshold-based anomaly detection methods are inadequate due to the dynamic complexities of these systems, while supervised machine learning methods are unable to exploit the large amounts of data due to the lack of labeled data. On the other hand, current unsupervised machine learning approaches have not fully exploited the spatial-temporal correlation and other dependencies amongst the multiple variables (sensors/actuators) in the system for detecting anomalies. In this work, we propose an unsupervised multivariate anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Instead of treating each data stream independently, our proposed MAD-GAN framework considers the entire variable set concurrently to capture the latent interactions amongst the variables. We also fully exploit both the generator and discriminator produced by the GAN, using a novel anomaly score called DR-score to detect anomalies by discrimination and reconstruction. We have tested our proposed MAD-GAN using two recent datasets collected from real-world CPS: the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and the Water Distribution (WADI) datasets.

C-rich sequences were also found in a region extending to 80 nt downstream of exons,along with G-triplet motifs.

However, existing models still have some disadvantages such as high cost and high computational complexity. At present, the Two-Pathway Generative Adversarial Network (TP-GAN) is the state-of-the-art face synthesis model, which can perceive the global structure and local details at the same time. It solves the prier problems but has disadvantages such as training difficulty and lack of diversity of generated samples. Based on Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), this paper proposes a novel Two-Pathway Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (TPWGAN-GP) model to tackle these defects. TPWGAN-GP uses a gradient penalty method to satisfy the Lipschitz continuity condition, which solves the problems of difficulty in hyper-parameter adjustment and gradient explosion in the TP-GAN, making the convergence speed faster and the model more stable in training process. The generated samples are of higher quality, resulting in more photorealistic faces for recognition tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3318299.3318346", "venue": "ICMLC '19", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2946217860", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["659553", "5533324", "17485723", "15785666", "1033682", "13058841", "10894094", "980236", "5351802", "2908606", "2806929", "21011865"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:160010601"}

Recent research on learning robot control has predominantly focussed on learning single tasks that were studied in isolation.

In order to do so, robots may learn the invariants and the regularities of their individual tasks and environments. This task-independent knowledge can be employed to bias generalization when learning control, which reduces the need for real-world experimentation. We argue that knowledge transfer is essential if robots are to learn control with moderate learning times in complex scenarios.

The term sentiment refers to the feelings or opinion of the person towards some particular domain. Hence it is also known as opinion mining. It leads to the subjective impressions towards the domain, not facts. It can be expressed in terms of polarity, reviews or previously by thumbs up and down to denote positive and negative sentiments respectively. Sentiments can be analyzed using NLP, statistics or machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis may ask questions regarding \u201ccustomer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, \u201cpublic opinion towards new iPhone series launched\u201d etc. In real world, public or consumer opinions about some product or brand are very important for its sell. Hence sentiment analysis is a very important research area for real life applications i.e. decision making. However various methods were introduced for performing sentiment analysis, still that are not efficient in extracting the sentiment features from the given content of text. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Maximum Entropy are the machine learning algorithms used for sentiment analysis which has only a limited sentiment classification category ranging between positive and negative. Especially supervised and unsupervised algorithms have only limited accuracy in handling polarity shift and binary classification problem. Even though the advancement in sentiment Analysis technique there are various issues still to be noticed and make the analysis not accurately and efficiently. So this paper presents the survey on various sentiment Analysis methodologies and approaches in detailed. This will be helpful to earn clear knowledge about sentiment analysis methodologies.

However, for practical, privacy, or other reasons, in a variety of applications we may have no control over the individual source task training, nor access to source training samples. Instead we only have access to features pre-trained on such data as the output of \"black-boxes.''

Although G2P models have been studied thoroughly in the literature, we propose a G2P system which is optimized for producing a high-quality top-k list of candidate pronunciations for an input grapheme string. Our pipeline approach uses Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to predict phonemes from graphemes and a discriminative re-ranker, which incorporates information from previous stages in the pipeline with a graphone language model to construct a high-quality ranked list of results.

Identification of TB bacilli manually sometime may confuse with some stain residue & non tuberculosis bacilli. Due to this we get the faulty results. For this reason need of atomization is required for exact identification of tuberculosis. We present an object, pattern (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis cell) recognition method using Support Vector Machine (SVM), k -nearest neighbor ( Knn) and Gaussian membership function. The object i.e. M.TB bacilli cells are extracted using color segmentation method, from Ziehl-Nelson stained sputum smears images. These images have blue background on which red color M.TB bacilli cells. Images are by self developed data set, obtained using a bright field microscope. The various shapes of objects are extracted using segmentation method. The extracted shapes is the mixture of M. TB bacilli cells, non TB cells and few are stain residue etc. For proper recognition(M.TB cells) the shape based feature of these patterns are extracted on the basis of these futures data set the multiple classifiers like SVM, Knn and Gaussian are applied for recognition of M.TB bacilli cells.

From the evaluation, we observed that a varied non-redundant training samples makes the decision tree learn the most. Pixel count per object-class should be just adequate otherwise it may lead to under/over-fitting problem.

Over traditional glass lens systems, better miniaturization potential and fixed length lens while zooming are unique abilities offered by the fluid lens. Non-uniform blurring for each color plane of the image is also caused by the fluid in the lens. A sharp green color plane and blurred blue and red color planes are also produced by this fluid. For natural and medical images, the edges in the green and blue color planes are similar. In this work, the sharpness of the blurred color planes is improved by sharing edge information between color planes. Avoiding shading artifacts while improving edge quality is the goal of this work. Several algorithms are discussed: a wavelet-based algorithm, a contourlet- based algorithm, a Support Vector Regression algorithm, and an Adaboost classification algorithm. In each algorithm, the strengths of the previous algorithm are built upon in order to improve results. A major advantage of these methods is that shading and edge information is combined without using a complicated point spread function. While the focus of this dissertation is on using the green color plane to improve the blue color plane, the same algorithms could be applied to the red color plane as well. Infrared imaging, medical image overlaying, satellite mapping, and remote sensing are all multiband system with high edge correlation where this work could be applied", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "40241747", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126484586"}

In order to train the model, we propose a following framework divided in three blocks: generation of thick cloud masks for training images based on texture and spectrum analysis, selection of input-target couples of training images and training of the model using the GAN framework.

The impressive, yet elusive empirical performance of GANs has lead to the rise of many GAN-VAE hybrids, with the hopes of GAN level performance and additional benefits of VAE, such as an encoder for feature reduction, which is not offered by GANs. Recently, the Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) was proposed, achieving performance similar to that of GANs, yet it is still unclear whether the two are fundamentally different or can be further improved into a unified model. In this work, we study the $f$-GAN and WAE models and make two main discoveries. First, we find that the $f$-GAN and WAE objectives partake in a primal-dual relationship and are equivalent under some assumptions, which then allows us to explicate the success of WAE. Second, the equivalence result allows us to, for the first time, prove generalization bounds for Autoencoder models, which is a pertinent problem when it comes to theoretical analyses of generative models. Furthermore, we show that the WAE objective is related to other statistical quantities such as the $f$-divergence and in particular, upper bounded by the Wasserstein distance, which then allows us to tap into existing efficient (regularized) optimal transport solvers. Our findings thus present the first primal-dual relationship between GANs and Autoencoder models, comment on generalization abilities and make a step towards unifying these models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NeurIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2971350903", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14570343", "1033682", "107645", "5216145", "605416", "6104263", "52965042", "3532229", "53966386", "124648603", "118347220", "1292495", "34051459", "3508638", "31204957", "52195570", "53098820", "52903121", "30182751", "64170024", "123415613", "3289726", "14114329", "51919254", "45391913", "463216"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202778107"}

We introduce 2 techniques for quantifying the time-varying mixture effect of multiple exposures on an outcome of interest. Lagged WQS, the first technique, is based on Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression, a penalized regression method that estimates mixture effects using a weighted index. We also introduce Tree-based DLMs, a nonparametric alternative for assessment of lagged mixture effects. This technique is based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, a nonparametric, tree-based estimation technique that has shown excellent performance in a wide variety of domains. In a simulation study, we tested the feasibility of these techniques and evaluated their performance in comparison to standard methodology. Both methods exhibited relatively robust performance, accurately capturing pre-defined non-linear functional relationships in different simulation settings.

Two data set classification algorithms, Significance Analysis of Microarray and Prediction Analysis of Microarray, successfully identified 220 candidate PFS-discriminatory methylated loci. Of those, 112 were found capable of predicting PFS with 95% accuracy, by Prediction Analysis of Microarray, using an independent set of 40 advanced ovarian tumors (from 20 short-PFS and 20 long-PFS patients, respectively).

Since the weather data has a huge amount of information, in order to build efficient and effective heavy rain prediction models, we need to find proper weather attributes, isobaric surfaces and suitable range for experiments. First, we have the candidate weather attributes with expert knowledge and evaluate those attributes using machine learning approach, Support Vector Machine (SVM). After the evaluation, we find out the best resulted 3 pairs of an attribute and an isobaric surface, and combine those to have better performance in prediction. The combination of high performed weather attributes showed better performance than the combined attributes which was recommended by the experts. We next figure out how the range of area affect in prediction. After the experiments, dimensions of the best resulted data were 4,800, which will be used as the inputs to prediction models. Even though we have dramatically reduced the number of dimension compared to the original weather data, it still is not proper for heavy rain forecasting in 6 hours. The running time of the model to produce an output with 4,800 dimensions of input takes about 2 minutes. However, 2 minute is not short enough since every local place may needs to predict heavy rain with their own local heavy rain cases for more accurate weather forecasting. If there are 30 local places, it would take an hour to produce outputs for all local places. An hour is not feasible to predict heavy rain in 6 hours. Therefore, in order to build more efficient models, we apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a much smaller set of inputs without degrading performance. After running GA, 4,800 inputs are reduced 757 inputs and the running time of the model with 757 inputs is 1/8 of the model with 4,800 inputs.

Interactions between natural and anthropogenic characteristics within the aquatic environment influence fish communities in complex ways that make the effect of a single characteristic difficult to ascertain. Researchers are faced with the question of how to deal with a large number of variables and complex interrelationships. This study utilized multiple approaches to identify key environmental variables to fish communities of the Fox River Basin in Illinois: Pearson and Spearman correlations, an algorithm based on information theory called mutual information, and a measure of variable importance built into the machine learning algorithm Random Forest. The results are based on a dataset developed for this study, which uses a fish index of biological integrity (IBI) and its ten component metrics as response variables and a range of environmental variables describing geomorphology, stream flow statistics, climate, and both reach-scale and watershed-scale land use as independent variables. Agricultural land use and the magnitude and duration of low flow events were ranked by the algorithms as key factors for the study area.

This system assists radiologists in interpreting the MRIs, improves the brain tumor diagnostic accuracy, and directs the focus toward the abnormal images only. The proposed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system consists of five steps: MRI preprocessing to remove the background noise, image segmentation by combining Otsu binarization and K-means clustering, feature extraction using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) approach, and dimensionality reduction of the features by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method. The major features were submitted to a kernel support vector machine (KSVM) for performing the MRI classification.

Therefore, the production of methods and systems for the automated classification of time-domain astronomical objects is of great importance. The Liverpool Telescope has a number of wide-field image gathering instruments mounted upon its structure, the Small Telescopes Installed at the Liverpool Telescope. These instruments have been in operation since March 2009 gathering data of large areas of sky around the current field of view of the main telescope generating a large dataset containing millions of light sources. The instruments are inexpensive to run as they do not require a separate telescope to operate but this style of surveying the sky introduces structured artifacts into our data due to the variable cadence at which sky fields are resampled. These artifacts can make light sources appear variable and must be addressed in any processing method. The data from large sky surveys can lead to the discovery of interesting new variable objects. Efficient software and analysis tools are required to rapidly determine which potentially variable objects are worthy of further telescope time. Machine learning offers a solution to the quick detection of variability by characterising the detected signals relative to previously seen exemplars. In this paper, we introduce a processing system designed for use with the Liverpool Telescope identifying potentially interesting objects through the application of a novel representation learning approach to data collected automatically from the wide-field instruments. Our method automatically produces a set of classification features by applying Principal Component Analysis on set of variable light curves using a piecewise polynomial fitted via a genetic algorithm applied to the epoch-folded data. The epoch-folding requires the selection of a candidate period for variable light curves identified using a genetic algorithm period estimation method specifically developed for this dataset. A Random Forest classifier is then used to classify the learned features to determine if a light curve is generated by an object of interest. This system allows for the telescope to automatically identify new targets through passive observations which do not affect day-to-day operations as the unique artifacts resulting from such a survey method are incorporated into the methods. We demonstrate the power of this feature extraction method compared to feature engineering performed by previous studies by training classification models on 859 light curves of 12 known variable star classes from our dataset. We show that our new features produce a model with a superior mean cross-validation F1 score of 0.4729 with a standard deviation of 0.0931 compared with the engineered features at 0.3902 with a standard deviation of 0.0619. We show that the features extracted from the representation learning are given relatively high importance in the final classification model. Additionally, we compare engineered features computed on the interpolated polynomial fits and show that they produce more reliable distributions than those fit to the raw light curve when the period estimation is correct.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.04.035", "venue": "Expert Syst.

However, due to power constraints, resource efficient algorithms are necessary in order to perform accurate realtime activity recognition while consuming minimal energy. In this paper, we present a two-tier architecture for optimizing power consumption in such systems. While the first tier relies on a hierarchical classification approach, the second one manages the activation and deactivation of the classification system.

We had three main goals: 1) develop a model of potential habitat for arroyo toads, based on long-term environmental variables and all available locality data; 2) develop a model of the species' current habitat by incorporating recent remotely-sensed variables and only using recent locality data; and 3) integrate results of both models to identify sites that may be employed in conservation efforts. We used a machine learning technique, Random Forests, to develop the models, focused on riparian zones in southern California. We identified 14.37% and 10.50% of our study area as potential and current habitat for the arroyo toad, respectively. Generally, inclusion of remotely-sensed variables reduced modeled suitability of sites, thus many areas modeled as potential habitat were not modeled as current habitat. We propose such sites could be made suitable for arroyo toads through active management, increasing current habitat by up to 67.02%. Our general approach can be employed to guide conservation efforts of virtually any species with sufficient data necessary to develop appropriate distribution models.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4488373", "pubmed_id": "26125634", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0131628", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1487465440", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1837791", "2228429", "85901162", "82344287", "86204306", "969382", "17068718", "4427756", "209557686", "85404381", "11950180", "83932594", "16279624", "86314655", "84203158", "25307265", "85863823", "10632694", "13947811", "6674057", "83876305", "86236075", "83724563", "13910042", "122725444", "89141", "3626971", "126767942", "24596318", "84527740", "14485554", "17952309", "2391953", "11245224", "13586358", "53609562", "39361255", "10285111", "82954532", "85434630", "128681158", "2645233", "12704194", "86471869", "135374534", "129749977", "53073682", "133749371"], "inbound_citations": ["49654277"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5981495"}

{"paper_id": "126439896", "title": "Urban Tree Mortality", "authors": [{"first": "Lara", "middle": ["A."], "last": "Roman", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Urban forests have aesthetic, environmental, human health, and economic benefits that motivate tree planting programs. Realizing these benefits depends on tree survival. Cost-benefit analyses for urban forest ecosystem services are sensitive to mortality rate assumptions and associated population projections. However, long-term mortality data is needed to assess the accuracy of these assumptions. Analytical tools from demography, such as life tables, mortality curves, and survival analysis, can improve our understanding of urban tree mortality. Demographic approaches have been widely used in forest ecology to quantify population dynamics and project future changes in wildland systems. However, to apply demographic techniques to urban forests, longitudinal data is needed, with repeated mortality observations on individual trees. In this dissertation, I analyzed five years of longitudinal data from two Northern California studies: street trees in Oakland and yard trees in Sacramento. These field projects are complemented by a conceptual overview of demographic approaches to urban tree mortality (Chapter 1), and an investigation of practitioner-based tree monitoring programs.For the Oakland study (Chapter 2), I documented tree mortality and planting rates, net population growth, and assessed selected risk factors for survival. I monitored the entire street tree population in a small plot for five years after an initial inventory (2006). I adapted the classic demographic balancing equation to quantify annual inputs and outputs to the system, tracking pools of live and standing dead trees. There was a 17.2% net increase in live tree counts during the study period, with 3.7% overall annual mortality. However, population growth was constrained by high mortality of small/young trees. Size-based mortality rates followed a Type III curve, with highest mortality for small trees, and lower for mid-size and large trees. I used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between 2011 survival outcomes and inventory data from 2006. Significant associations were found for size class, foliage condition, planting location, and a multiplicative interaction term for size and foliage condition.For the Sacramento study (Chapter 3), I assessed tree losses during the establishment phase for a residential tree give-away program. A cohort of young trees distributed in 2007 was monitored for five years. I used Random Forests to identify the most important risk factors at different life history stages, and survival analysis to evaluate post-planting survivorship. Analysis included socioeconomic, biophysical, and maintenance characteristics. In addition to field observations of tree planting status, survival, and maintenance, I also collected property ownership information (renter vs. owner-occupancy, homeowner change, and foreclosure) through the Multiple Listing Service and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics from the U.S. Census. I found that 84.9% of trees were planted, with 70.9% survivorship at five years post-planting. Planting rates were higher in neighborhoods with higher educational attainment, and on owner-occupied properties with stable residential ownership. Five-year survival was also higher for properties with stable homeownership, as well as for tree species with low water use demand. When I incorporated maintenance characteristics from the first year of field observations, factors related to tree care were important to survival. Many residents did not adhere to recommended maintenance practices. These results illustrate the critical role of stewardship and consistent homeownership to young tree mortality on residential properties, and suggest that survival assumptions in urban forest cost-benefit models may be overly optimistic.To learn more about practitioner-driven monitoring efforts, I surveyed 32 local urban forestry organizations across the United States about the goals, challenges, methods, and uses of their monitoring programs (Chapter 4). Non-profit organizations, municipal agencies, state agencies, and utilities participated. Common goals for monitoring included evaluating the success of tree planting and management, taking a proactive approach towards tree care, and engaging communities. Challenges included limited staff and funding, difficulties with data management and technology, and field crew training. Programs used monitoring results to inform tree planting and maintenance practices, provide feedback to individuals responsible for tree care, and manage hazard trees. Participants emphasized the importance of planning ahead: carefully considering what data to collect, setting clear goals, developing an appropriate database, and planning for funding and staff time. Urban tree monitoring partnerships between researchers and local organizations should be developed, with standardized protocols and clear research questions. Such partnerships would provide urban forestry professionals with improved mortality information to evaluate the success of planting programs, while expanding the data sets available to researchers. The Oakland and Sacramento studies (Chapters 2 and 3) offer examples of demographic approaches to urban tree mortality that can be replicated and expanded as more longitudinal data becomes available from both researchers and practitioners.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "98042931", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["213728572", "5247023"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126439896"}

The purpose of this paper was to exclude the human factor in security breaches executed in this manner with the use of various machine learning algorithms. For the purpose of training and testing of the most successful algorithms (Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) paper used two separate bases, UCIs Phishing Websites Data Set and Spam Emails Dataset together with Weka software, and found that the best results for both of them are achieved with the Random Forest algorithm. However, databases responded differently to feature selection algorithms, as the best result for phishing (97.33% accuracy) was accomplished through Ranker + Principal Components Optimization, and the best result for spam (94.24% accuracy) was accomplished through BestFirst + CfsSubsEval Optimization in Weka. These findings provide a base platform for future work towards a faster and more accurate online fraud detection.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-02577-9_47", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems", "mag_id": "2902589333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198145489"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69376019"}

Usually, both labeled positive and negative samples are needed to train the classifier. For the problem of gene function prediction, however, the available information is only about positive samples. In other words, we know which genes have the function of interested, while it is generally unclear which genes do not have the function, i.e. the negative samples. If all the genes outside of the target functional family are seen as negative samples, the imbalanced problem will arise because there are only a relatively small number of genes annotated in each family. Furthermore, the classifier may be degraded by the false negatives in the heuristically generated negative samples.ResultsIn this paper, we present a new technique, namely Annotating Genes with Positive Samples (AGPS), for defining negative samples in gene function prediction. With the defined negative samples, it is straightforward to predict the functions of unknown genes. In addition, the AGPS algorithm is able to integrate various kinds of data sources to predict gene functions in a reliable and accurate manner. With the one-class and two-class Support Vector Machines as the core learning algorithm, the AGPS algorithm shows good performances for function prediction on yeast genes.ConclusionWe proposed a new method for defining negative samples in gene function prediction. Experimental results on yeast genes show that AGPS yields good performances on both training and test sets. In addition, the overlapping between prediction results and GO annotations on unknown genes also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2275242", "pubmed_id": "18221567", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-57", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1965887320", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["41355367", "4350057", "5612356", "7722647", "3009359", "20768270", "16104434", "6111063", "2577381", "10812503", "14438941", "41905034", "21383334", "7412694", "21242353", "11923127", "2110475", "23734366", "4362821", "7022860", "2838900", "5839507", "890408", "17686011", "64733", "1194241", "1105917", "6111063", "961425", "2789165", "5892850", "2340136"], "inbound_citations": ["15188545", "83113375", "23795612", "32573774", "199565200", "36412649", "11158414", "15308886", "38778877", "2864330", "23103598", "16602178", "8924693", "4638396", "10072567", "215134807", "7050150", "17728817", "17000833", "9421962", "3150207", "196983420", "215089779", "3143679", "11111341", "2245601", "43115049", "199510077", "14176307", "33025929", "45283926", "38200764", "2215664", "52094990", "10112842", "15246555", "14481484", "10819268", "59291982", "24252655", "67882798", "14274074", "11291370", "215205045", "6178399", "2023898", "17573606"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:366837"}

This paper introduces partial transfer learning, which relaxes the shared label space assumption to that the target label space is only a subspace of the source label space. Previous methods typically match the whole source domain to the target domain, which are prone to negative transfer for the partial transfer problem. We present Selective Adversarial Network (SAN), which simultaneously circumvents negative transfer by selecting out the outlier source classes and promotes positive transfer by maximally matching the data distributions in the shared label space.

An adaptive background subtraction method combined with color is used to segment the motion objects. Then the trained SVM classifier distinguishes the motion object whether it is a human or not. In order to simplify the design of SVM classifier and improve efficiency of machine learning, a center radiating vector representation is proposed to abstract features of the object. And the optimal representation is obtained by experiments. During the machine learning, a bootstrap method is adopted to reduce the complexity of training SVM.

In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google dataset collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and evaluating predictive models for node failures. Our results support the practicality of a data-driven approach by showing the effectiveness of predictive models based on data found in typical data center logs. We use BigQuery, the big data SQL platform from the Google Cloud suite, to process massive amounts of data and generate a rich feature set characterizing node state over time. We describe how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest classifiers each trained on these features, to predict if nodes will fail in a future 24-h window. Our evaluation reveals that if we limit false positive rates to 5 %, we can achieve true positive rates between 27 and 88 % with precision varying between 50 and 72 %. This level of performance allows us to recover large fraction of jobs' executions (by redirecting them to other nodes when a failure of the present node is predicted) that would otherwise have been wasted due to failures. We discuss the feasibility of including our predictive model as the central component of a data-driven autonomic manager and operating it on-line with live data streams (rather than off-line on data logs). All of the scripts used for BigQuery and classification analyses are publicly available on GitHub.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1606.04456", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10586-016-0564-y", "venue": "Cluster Computing, Volume 19, Issue 2, pp 865-878, 2016", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2336207029", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7331211", "4854841", "17947858", "12873117", "15824743", "16767165", "3251066", "11991974", "16121682", "62223887", "11483812", "12093784", "14676974", "9875845", "15080565", "11149239", "18487617", "19023719", "6177410", "14135620", "14906054", "2276633", "731390", "63732674", "1149996", "15071543", "1748771", "5926120"], "inbound_citations": ["160009696", "199059060", "59233936", "50777476", "52018619", "204509195"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9668619"}

Thus, we examined whether the presence of woodlands in riparian buffer zones also impacts the thermal characteristics of lowland streams during the summer. Water temperature data were recorded with digital temperature loggers located in eight quasi-natural sites across the Garwolin Plain in central Poland. The mean, maximum, minimum, and mean daily range parameters were calculated for the whole study period from July to September 2017 with a 30 min. resolution. The percentage of woodlands in the catchment area and buffer zone along the streams was estimated based on satellite images from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions. The Random Forest method was used in the classification process with an accuracy of 96%. The similarity of measurement sites in terms of water temperature was determined using cluster analysis (Ward method), while a Spearman correlation coefficient was applied to compare thermal parameters with the percentage of woodland areas. The results indicate that water temperature patterns across the measurement sites varied, with mean temperatures ranging from 14.4\u00b0C in site T8 to 16.3\u00b0C in site T1. Furthermore, the correlation analysis confirmed our hypothesis that the presence of woodland areas does not significantly alter the thermal parameters of lowland streams. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that sites with significantly different percentages of woodland areas were closely linked due to the similar distributions of water temperature values. However, it must be emphasised that the lack of riparian woodlands in buffer zones does not exclude the presence of shade associated with shrubs and grasses, as well as aquatic plants. In consequence, more advanced indicators of riparian shade, such as vegetation mapping using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or hemispherical photography, should be used for small lowland streams.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2478/frp-2018-0023", "venue": null, "journal": "Forest Research Papers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2961742891", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10787240", "89485875", "41327681", "128889497", "85948416", "128810717", "129328462", "128592296", "129465051", "54798777", "129358193", "130643043", "133848715", "84296735", "128522610", "28120203", "129724583"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198490539"}

Most of the Quranic verses would urge and encourage people to do right and good deeds, and also warn them from committing evil and bad deeds. The method of classifying a text into two opposing opinions has been applied previously in solving the problem of sentiment analysis. Currently, it is applied in identifying between Targhib (encouragement) and Tarhib (warning) verses in the Qur\u2019an. Each verse of the Qur\u2019an can be treated as either an encouragement, warning or neutral. The language of the Holy Qur\u2019an is one of the most challenging natural languages in sentiment analysis. The aim of this work is to classify the verses of encouragement and warning using sentiment analysis and NLP techniques. Several approaches are used in the Sentiment Analysis classification, such as the machine learning approach, the lexicon-based approach and the hybrid approach. In carrying out this aim, the applied machine learning approach was used, where the impact of the use of different techniques such as POS tagging, N-Gram and Feature selection with correlation based were evaluated and investigated. 95.6% accuracy was achieved using Naive Bayes (NB) and 91.5% accuracy was achieved using the Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Our method learns a set of If-Then rules that are generally considered to be understandable and that allow an explicit control of their complexity to meet user-supplied requirements. The adoption of the unordered rule learning paradigm, along with exploiting the trained SVMs helps overcome the weakness of standard rule learners in high dimensional feature spaces.

Early identification of at-risk gait helps prevent falls and injuries. The main aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a wavelet based multiscale analysis of a gait variable [minimum foot clearance (MFC)] in extracting features for developing a model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for automated detection of balance impairment and estimation of the falls risk in the elderly. MFC during continuous walking on a treadmill was recorded on 11 healthy elderly and 10 elderly with balance problems (falls risk) and with a history of tripping falls. The multiscale exponents (beta) between successive wavelet (Wv) coefficient levels after Wnu decomposition of MFC series (512 points) into eight levels from level 2 (Wnu2) to level 256 (Wnu256), were calculated for healthy as well as falls-risk elderly adults. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the most powerful predictor variable was found to be betaWnu16-Wnu8 (ROCarea = 1.0), followed by betaWnu16-Wnu8 (ROCarea = 0.92). These multiscale exponents were used as inputs to the SVM model to develop relationships between the intrinsic characteristics of gait control and the healthy/falls-risk category. The leave one out technique was utilized for optimal tuning and testing of the SVM model. The maximum accuracy was found to be 100% using a polynomial kernel (d = 4) with C = 10 and the maximum ROC = 1.0, when the SVM model was used to diagnose gait area patterns of healthy and falls risk elderly subjects. For relative risk estimation of all subjects, posterior probabilities of SVM outputs were calculated. In conclusion, these results suggest considerable potential for SVM gait recognition model based on multiscale wavelet features in the detection of gait changes in older adults due to balance impairments and falling behavior. These preliminary results are also encouraging and could be useful not only in the falls risk diagnostic applications but also for evaluating the need for referral for falls prevention intervention (e.g., exercise program to improve balance).", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICISIP.2006.4286092", "venue": "2006 Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Sensing and Information Processing", "journal": "2006 Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Sensing and Information Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2545980070", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18823240", "32312748", "110755134", "29094590", "11694774", "8551777", "46681014", "2727398", "35059654", "28069071", "7138354", "21631205", "5173538", "18181838", "56563878", "125476886"], "inbound_citations": ["18828316", "18145195"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2154620"}

GAs are applied to solve optimization problems without the assumption of linearity, differentiability, continuity or convexity of the objective function. There are some works where GAs and LSSVM work together, however, mostly to find the LSSVM kernel and/or classifier parameters. Nevertheless, our new proposal combines LSSVM and GAs for achieving sparse models, in which each support vector has just a few features in a feature selection sense. The idea behind our proposal is to remove non-relevant features from the patterns by using GAs. Removing a pattern has less impact than removing a feature since the training dataset has in general more patterns than features. On the basis of the results, our proposal leaves non-relevant features out of the set of features and still maintains or even improves the classification accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-20518-8_42", "venue": "IWANN", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2948498978", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:174803825"}

The Random Forest (RF) machine-learning technique was used, with three sets of inputs: i) the electricity generated at Mutriku, ii) the wave energy flux (WEF) prediction made by the ECMWF wave model at Mutriku's nearest gridpoint, and iii) ocean and atmospheric data for the Bay of Biscay. For this last input, extended empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) were calculated to reduce the dimensionality of these data, while retaining most of the information. The forecasts are evaluated using the R-Squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The model easily outperforms a persistence forecast at 8\u201310 h and beyond.

Usually, these two choices are not independent as not every learning algorithm is able to handle any approximation structure well.

Existing search engines highly depend on surrounding texts for ranking images, or leverage the query-image pairs annotated by human labelers to train a series of ranking functions. However, there are two major limitations: 1) the surrounding texts are often noisy or too few to accurately describe the image content, and 2) the human annotations are resourcefully expensive and thus cannot be scaled up. We demonstrate in this paper that the above two fundamental challenges can be mitigated by jointly exploring the cross-view learning and the use of click-through data. The former aims to create a latent subspace with the ability in comparing information from the original incomparable views (i.e., textual and visual views), while the latter explores the largely available and freely accessible click-through data (i.e., ``crowdsourced\" human intelligence) for understanding query. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-view learning method for image search, named Click-through-based Cross-view Learning (CCL), by jointly minimizing the distance between the mappings of query and image in the latent subspace and preserving the inherent structure in each original space. On a large-scale click-based image dataset, CCL achieves the improvement over Support Vector Machine-based method by 4.0\\% in terms of relevance, while reducing the feature dimension by several orders of magnitude (e.g., from thousands to tens). Moreover, the experiments also demonstrate the superior performance of CCL to several state-of-the-art subspace learning techniques.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2600428.2609568", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 37th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research & development in information retrieval", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1969732194", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14496321", "1633422", "2350854", "1183583", "8923487", "10309388", "1560943", "202473", "7416443", "2955919", "207605508", "5700664", "13823051", "195908774", "1452577", "8482989", "5238612", "12729587", "28020", "10957914", "14655000", "6358316", "117268472", "9938635", "10279153", "10155814", "482197", "508028", "5955111"], "inbound_citations": ["13914676", "131774688", "38366141", "84179999", "41407374", "13679889", "16616133", "22541202", "59337444", "199543973", "52165579", "7908490", "201809942", "167521", "10391268", "15772353", "28994143", "14962904", "44184704", "43279153", "207242032", "44243065", "53039874", "88497262", "1967178", "3477804", "17687327", "18069238", "1012652"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16837848"}

With a Hebbian-type of learning rule incorporating a trace of previous activity patterns, the siamese VisNet learns features with increasing invariance in changing environments from layer to layer. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the robustness of the siamese VisNet against viewpoint changes, appearance changes, and joint viewpoint-appearance changes.

In this thesis, we explore inertial-based gesture recognition on Smartphones, where gestures holding a semantic value are drawn in the air with the device in hand. In our research, speed and delay constraints required by an application are critical, leading us to the choice of neural-based models. Thus, our work focuses on metric learning between gesture sample signatures using the \"Siamese\" architecture (Siamese Neural Network, SNN), which aims at modelling semantic relations between classes to extract discriminative features, applied to the MultiLayer Perceptron. Contrary to some popular versions of this algorithm, we opt for a strategy that does not require additional parameter fine tuning, namely a set threshold on dissimilar outputs, during training. Indeed, after a preprocessing step where the data is filtered and normalised spatially and temporally, the SNN is trained from sets of samples, composed of similar and dissimilar examples, to compute a higher-level representation of the gesture, where features are collinear for similar gestures, and orthogonal for dissimilar ones. While the original model already works for classification, multiple mathematical problems which can impair its learning capabilities are identified. Consequently, as opposed to the classical similar or dissimilar pair; or reference, similar and dissimilar sample triplet input set selection strategies, we propose to include samples from every available dissimilar classes, resulting in a better structuring of the output space. Moreover, we apply a regularisation on the outputs to better determine the objective function. Furthermore, the notion of polar sine enables a redefinition of the angular problem by maximising a normalised volume induced by the outputs of the reference and dissimilar samples, which effectively results in a Supervised Non-Linear Independent Component Analysis. Finally, we assess the unexplored potential of the Siamese network and its higher-level representation for novelty and error detection and rejection. With the help of two real-world inertial datasets, the Multimodal Human Activity Dataset as well as the Orange Dataset, specifically gathered for the Smartphone inertial symbolic gesture interaction paradigm, we characterise the performance of each contribution, and prove the higher novelty detection and rejection rate of our model, with protocols aiming at modelling unknown gestures and open world configurations. To summarise, the proposed SNN allows for supervised non-linear similarity metric learning, which extracts discriminative features, improving both inertial gesture classification and rejection.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2565893045", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2639879"}

These products contain complex guarantees that are computationally expensive to value, and insurance companies are turning to machine learning for the valuation of large portfolios of variable annuity policies. Although earlier studies, exemplified by the regression modelling approach, have shown promising results, the valuation accuracy is unsatisfying. In this paper, we show that one main cause for the poor valuation accuracy is the inefficient selection of representative policies. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel transfer-learning based portfolio valuation framework. The framework first builds a backbone deep neural network using historical Monte Carlo simulation results. The backbone network provides a valuation-driven representation for selecting the policies that best represent a large portfolio. Furthermore, the transferred network provides a way to adaptively extrapolate from these representative policies to the remaining policies in the portfolio. By overcoming a major difficulty faced by the popular Kriging model, the need of matrix inversion, the transferred network can handle a large number of representative policies to sufficiently cover a diverse portfolio.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-29894-4_57", "venue": "PRICAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2969500109", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201114569"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201739310"}

Tree species classification provides valuable information to forest monitoring and management.

Considering the seasonal changes in forests and the higher spectral and spatial resolution acquired with sensors attached to UAV, we present the use of time series of images to classify four tree species.

Four tree species were classified using Spectral angle mapper (SAM), Spectral information divergence (SID) and Random Forest (RF).

Hence, the crowd can be handled as a group entity instead of tracking the individual in the crowd. The behavior of the crowd can be distinguished with motion patterns due to prominent spatio-temporal characteristics. The proposed system involves a systematic approach to recognize the global events in human crowd through observing motion patterns such as flow, speed and direction.

Accordingly, scientists, as well as logistics managers, consider order picking as one of the most promising area for productivity improvements. This chapter is intended to provide the reader with an overview of different intelligent tools applicable to the issue of picking optimization. Specifically, by this chapter, we show how different types of intelligent algorithms can be used to optimize order picking operations in a warehouse, by decreasing the travel distance (and thus time) of pickers. The set of intelligent algorithms analyzed include: genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, simulated annealing, ant colony optimization and particles swarm optimization models. For each intelligent algorithm, we start with a brief theoretical overview.

The accuracy of the method was assessed for a total of 245 vertebrae. For the vertebra detection, we proposed an adapted version of two descriptors, namely Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF), coupled with a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Vertebrae are successfully detected in 89.8% of cases and it is demonstrated that SURF slightly outperforms SIFT. The Active Shape Model approach was considered as a segmentation procedure. We observed that a statistical shape model specific to the vertebral level improves the results. Angular errors of cervical spine mobility are presented.

Due to the combinatorial explosion associated to big data -based analyzes, many models need to be created and tested. Model selection becomes a critical and integral aspect of scientific data analysis that leads to the development of a functional model. A three-objective optimization model selection criterion (3 D - SVM ) is introduced for analyzing highly/ultra unbalanced data structures. It uses three competing attributes \u2013 prediction, separability, complexity \u2013 to project each candidate model into a 3 D -space to select the final model. The 3 D - SVM criterion is enabled by a new separability index introduced here, and is a step forward in the application of machine learning initiatives for rare event detection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.promfg.2019.06.094", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Manufacturing", "mag_id": "2963535883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["196112851"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199588093"}

A novel clustering algorithm with stimulating discriminant measures (SDM) of both within- and between-cluster scatter variances is proposed to produce robust segmentation of nucleus and cytoplasm of lymphocytes/lymphoblasts. Specifically, the proposed between-cluster evaluation is formulated based on the trade-off of several between-cluster measures of well-known feature extraction methods. The SDM measures are used in conjuction with Genetic Algorithm for clustering nucleus, cytoplasm, and background regions. Subsequently, a total of eighty features consisting of shape, texture, and colour information of the nucleus and cytoplasm sub-images are extracted. A number of classifiers (multi-layer perceptron, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Dempster-Shafer ensemble) are employed for lymphocyte/lymphoblast classification. Evaluated with the ALL-IDB2 database, the proposed SDM-based clustering overcomes the shortcomings of Fuzzy C-means which focuses purely on within-cluster scatter variance.

Moreover, sub-clinical mastitis leads to the use of antibiotics with consequent increased risk of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, early detection of infected cows is of great importance. The Somatic Cell Count (SCC) day-test used for mastitis surveillance, gives data that fluctuate widely between days, creating questions about its reliability and early prediction power. The recent identification of risk parameters of sub-clinical mastitis based on milking parameters by machine learning models is emerging as a promising new tool to enhance early prediction of mastitis occurrence. To develop the optimal approach for early sub-clinical mastitis prediction, we implemented 2 steps: (1) Finding the best statistical models to accurately link patterns of risk factors to sub-clinical mastitis, and (2) Extending this application from the farms tested to new farms (method generalization). Herein, we applied various machine learning-based prediction systems on a big milking dataset to uncover the best predictive models of sub-clinical mastitis. Data from 364,249 milking instances were collected by an electronic automated in-line monitoring system where milk volume, lactose concentration, electrical conductivity (EC), protein concentration, peak flow and milking time for each sample were measured. To provide a platform for the application of the models developed to other farms, the Z transformation approach was employed. Following this, various prediction systems [Deep Learning (DL), Naive Bayes, Generalized Liner Model, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient-Boosted Tree (GBT) and Random Forest] were applied to the non-transformed milking dataset and to a Z-standardized dataset. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve), AUC (Area Under The Curve), and high accuracy demonstrated the high sensitivity of GBT and DL in detecting sub-clinical mastitis.

Currently, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed with high-throughput Sequencing (ChIP-seq) is able to locate the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) accurately in high throughput and it has become the gold-standard method for TFBS finding experimentally. However, due to its high cost, it is impractical to apply the method in a very large scale. Considering the large number of transcription factors, numerous cell types and various conditions, computational methods are still very valuable to accurate TFBS identification.ResultsIn this paper, we proposed a novel integrated TFBS prediction system, CTF, based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Integrating information from different sources, CTF was able to capture patterns of TFBSs contained in different features (sequence, chromatin and etc) and predicted the TFBS locations with a high accuracy. We compared CTF with several existing tools as well as the PWM baseline method on a dataset generated by ChIP-seq experiments (TFBSs of 13 transcription factors in mouse genome). Results showed that CTF performed significantly better than existing methods tested.ConclusionsCTF is a powerful tool to predict TFBSs by integrating high throughput data and different features. It can be a useful complement to ChIP-seq and other experimental methods for TFBS identification and thus improve our ability to investigate functional elements in post-genomic era.Availability: CTF is freely available to academic users at: http://cbb.sjtu.edu.cn/~ccwei/pub/software/CTF/CTF.php", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3535700", "pubmed_id": "23282203", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-13-S8-S18", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2101459357", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["4399576", "1674278", "401950", "3207586", "12102719", "33411681", "14695257", "17962696", "17748662", "757320", "10898835", "10759082", "2762792", "15451197", "1888028", "12427620", "2722988", "19706637", "1768190", "9836611", "4424884", "8550870", "503050"], "inbound_citations": ["9398683", "15212603", "31836890", "3213044"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5201618"}

Moreover, its codebook vector adaptation rule involves m-winning neurons dynamics and not the winner takes all approach. During convergence phase of the map a group of Support Vector Machines, associated with its codebook vectors, is simultaneously trained in an online fashion so that each SVM learns to positively respond when the input data belong to the topological sub-space represented by its corresponding codebook vector, taking into account similarity with that codebook vector. Moreover, it learns to negatively respond to input data not belonging to such a previously mentioned corresponding topological sub-space.

Additionally, NormAE significantly improved biomarker discovery (median number of differential peaks increased from 322 and 466 to 1140 and 1622, respectively). NormAE was compared with four commonly used batch effect removal methods. The results demonstrated that using NormAE produces the best calibration results.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32207605", "doi": "10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05460", "venue": "Analytical chemistry", "journal": "Analytical chemistry", "mag_id": "3012822544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214630402"}

Human talent prediction is an alternative to handle this issue. Due to that reason, classification and prediction in data mining which is commonly used in many areas can also be implemented to human talent. There are many classification techniques in data mining techniques such as Decision Tree, Neural Network, Rough Set Theory, Bayesian theory and Fuzzy logic. Decision tree is among the popular classification techniques, which can produce the interpretable rules or logic statement. The generated rules from the selected technique can be used for future prediction. In this article, we present the study on how the potential human talent can be predicted using a decision tree classifier. By using this technique, the pattern of talent performance can be identified through the classification process. In that case, the hidden and valuable knowledge discovered in the related databases will be summarized in the decision tree structure. In this study, we use decision tree C4.5 classification algorithm to generate the classification rules for human talent performance records.

We intend to study a multi-targets and multi-components design that will provide synergistic results to improve efficiency of cancer therapy.MethodsWe have developed a general methodology, AMFES (Adaptive Multiple FEature Selection), for ranking and selecting important cancer biomarkers based on SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification. In particular, we exemplify this method by three datasets: a prostate cancer (three stages), a breast cancer (four subtypes), and another prostate cancer (normal vs. cancerous). Moreover, we have computed the target networks of these biomarkers as the signatures of the cancers with additional information (mutual information between biomarkers of the network). Then, we proposed a robust framework for synergistic therapy design approach which includes varies existing mechanisms.ResultsThese methodologies were applied to three GEO datasets: GSE18655 (three prostate stages), GSE19536 (4 subtypes breast cancers) and GSE21036 (prostate cancer cells and normal cells) shown in. We selected 96 biomarkers for first prostate cancer dataset (three prostate stages), 72 for breast cancer (luminal A vs. luminal B), 68 for breast cancer (basal-like vs. normal-like), and 22 for another prostate cancer (cancerous vs. normal.

In this work, a prediction method of Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is proposed, which can either give good accuracy and a confidential interval. Firstly the mathematical theory is explained thoroughly, and then the RVM is implemented to predict two voltage dropping trends based on two degradation data of a PEMFC. Finally the results are discussed and the effectiveness is evaluated. The RVM is proved to be a good candidate to predict the degradation trends of PEMFC.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITEC.2015.7165794", "venue": "2015 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo (ITEC)", "journal": "2015 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo (ITEC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1572571571", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["16212571", "16212571", "4696686", "43966622", "22334147", "7596571", "15179374", "390988", "16563654", "207749827", "3020909", "32102641", "64484408"], "inbound_citations": ["14531027", "25425298", "34564390", "145931401", "52149295"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35150306"}

The category of heuristic search techniques known as estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) seek to incrementally sample from probability distributions in which optimal (or near-optimal) solutions have increasingly higher probabilities. Can we use domain knowledge to assist the estimation of these distributions? To answer this in the affirmative, we need: (a) a general-purpose technique for the incorporation of domain knowledge when constructing models for optimal values; and (b) a way of using these models to generate new data samples. Here we investigate a combination of the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for (a), and standard logic-programming machinery to generate new samples for (b). Specifically, on each iteration of distribution estimation, an ILP engine is used to construct a model for good solutions. The resulting theory is then used to guide the generation of new data instances, which are now restricted to those derivable using the ILP model in conjunction with the background knowledge). We demonstrate the approach on two optimisation problems (predicting optimal depth-of-win for the KRK endgame, and job-shop scheduling). Our results are promising: (a) On each iteration of distribution estimation, samples obtained with an ILP theory have a substantially greater proportion of good solutions than samples without a theory; and (b) On termination of distribution estimation, samples obtained with an ILP theory contain more near-optimal samples than samples without a theory. Taken together, these results suggest that the use of ILP-constructed theories could be a useful technique for incorporating complex domain-knowledge into estimation distribution procedures.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1608.01093", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-63342-8_10", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951744226,2498190096", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37584572", "61131488", "53809290", "15956928", "6126501", "14992676", "63611639"], "inbound_citations": ["6544199"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14592957"}

The \ufb01eldof cognitive development, which traces it roots back toJean Piaget and earlier, faces a choice. On the one hand,powerful new approaches from genetics, functional imag-ing, developmental psychopathology and computationalmodelling, offer a tempting future pathway. On the otherhand, some believe these new possibilities are a mirage,and that we should not be distracted from describinghuman developmental change at the cognitive level basedon behavioural experiments.In the 1970s and 80s cognitive psychology began topermeate the older \ufb01eld of child psychology resulting in asubdisciplineofcognitivedevelopment.Althoughthisthrusthad many successes and greatly advanced our under-standing in certain domains, a less positive outcome wasthat it focussed researchers on describing steady states atdifferent ages rather than focussing on processes of change[1]. A number of recent advances have lead to renewedattention on understanding mechanisms of developmentalchange. One advance is research on the types of learningmechanisms that drive developmental change, oftenimplementedand testedin computational models. Asecondis an investigation of the types of changes in mental repre-sentations that occur during development (see Johnson MPosner & Rothbart; Aslin & Fiser). Connectionist andneural-network models provide tools for the exploration ofdifferent theories about the extent and nature of plasticityduring development (Elman). Studies that compare typicalandatypicaldevelopmentaltrajectoriesallowustoexaminethe scope and limits of plasticity (Scerif & Karmiloff-Smith ,Stilesetal.,Maurer,Lewis&Mondloch).Comparisonswithotherspeciesallowustoassessthedevelopmentofcognitiveabilities in the absence of language (Go\u00b4mez).There is great potential for these recent advances toinform theories of cognitive development. For example,the advent of child-friendly functional imaging offers anumber of advantages to the \ufb01eld. At a purely practicallevel, there are enormous dif\ufb01culties in making inferencesabout the developing mind from non-verbal behaviouralmeasures alone. Although behavioural methods willcontinue to remain important, more direct measures ofbrain function can now be obtained without any responsebeing required from the participant, a major advantage inyoung children. More interestingly, neuroimaging offersthe potential to explore questions such as whether thesame behaviour in infants and adults is mediated by thesame patterns of cortical activation? Connectionist andneural-network models provide tools that can be used toformalize and assess theories of developmental change.These models can have different degrees of neuralplausibility and can instantiate a variety of theoreticalperspectives on the extent and nature of environmentalin\ufb02uence.Although the newly emerging \ufb01eld of developmentalcognitive neuroscience, and its associated technology, hasgenerated much excitement, there are also sceptics whofear that it will not advance progress on the key issuesthat have dominated developmental psychology fordecades. The ability to collect rich and complex data setsfrom the typical and atypical developing brain of theinfant and child does not in itself guarantee that thecrucial experiments for testing theories of developmentalchange will be conducted. Limitations and constraintsimposed by the available neuroimaging and compu-tational methods could bias experimenters towards par-ticulartheoreticalperspectives.Forexample,theabilitytoimage and localize brain function in children couldencourage a view of mental development in terms of theaddition of static computational modules. Similarly,connectionist network modelling has not usually beenused to explore nativist accounts of development.The agenda of this special issue, which grew out of arecent meeting (The XXIst Meeting of the InternationalAssociation for the Study of Attention and Performance,Processes of Change in Brain and Cognitive Development,26 July\u20131 August, 2004 in Winter Park, Colorado) is toassess how evidence from cognitive neuroscience hascontributed to the current state of knowledge aboutprocesses of change during human mental development,and to discuss the ways in which these techniques andtoolscanbeharnessedtoaddressthefundamentalquestions of cognitive development.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "15737815", "doi": "10.1016/j.tics.2005.01.010", "venue": "Trends in cognitive sciences", "journal": "Trends in cognitive sciences", "mag_id": "1975170362", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["12269446"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44263453"}

The proposed work compares the performance of different kernel methods available in GURLS package with the library for Support Vector Machines namely, LIBSVM. The assessment is based on HSI classification accuracy measures and computation time. The experiment is performed on two standard Hyper Spectral datasets namely, Salinas A and Indian Pines subset captured by AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) sensor. From the analysis, it is observed that GURLS library is competitive to LIBSVM in terms of its prediction accuracy whereas computation time seems to favor LIBSVM. The major advantage of GURLS toolbox over LIBSVM is its simplicity, ease of use, automatic parameter selection and fast training and tuning of multi-class classifier.

Many imaging modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) can be interpreted in this way. We can venture further and consider that a medical image naturally factors into some spatial factors depicting anatomy and factors that denote the imaging characteristics. Here, we explicitly learn this decomposed (disentangled) representation of imaging data, focusing in particular on cardiac images. We propose Spatial Decomposition Network (SDNet), which factorises 2D medical images into spatial anatomical factors and non-spatial modality factors. We demonstrate that this high-level representation is ideally suited for several medical image analysis tasks, such as semi-supervised segmentation, multi-task segmentation and regression, and image-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we show that our model can match the performance of fully supervised segmentation models, using only a fraction of the labelled images. Critically, we show that our factorised representation also benefits from supervision obtained either when we use auxiliary tasks to train the model in a multi-task setting (e.g. regressing to known cardiac indices), or when aggregating multimodal data from different sources (e.g. pooling together MRI and CT data). To explore the properties of the learned factorisation, we perform latent-space arithmetic and show that we can synthesise CT from MR and vice versa, by swapping the modality factors. We also demonstrate that the factor holding image specific information can be used to predict the input modality with high accuracy.

The information in the game is partial. Indeed, the service provider never observes the EV drivers' energy demand. The only information he has access to is contained in a feedback function which depends on his predictions accuracy and on the EV drivers' consumption level. The local/expanded accuracy and the ability for uncertainty handling of the regret mini-mization learning approach is evaluated by comparison with three well-known learning approaches: (i) Neural Network, (ii) Support Vector Machine, (iii) AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average process, using as benchmarks two data bases: an artificial one generated using a bayesian network and real domestic household electricity consumption data in southern California.

An important problem to be addressed when analyzing this data is distinguishing between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and protein coding transcripts (PCTs). Thus, we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method to distinguish lncRNAs from PCTs, using features based on frequencies of nucleotide patterns and ORF lengths, in transcripts. The proposed method is based on SVM and uses the first ORF relative length and frequencies of nucleotide patterns selected by PCA as features. FASTA files were used as input to calculate all possible features. These features were divided in two sets: (i) 336 frequencies of nucleotide patterns; and (ii) 4 features derived from ORFs. PCA were applied to the first set to identify 6 groups of frequencies that could most contribute to the distinction. Twenty-four experiments using the 6 groups from the first set and the features from the second set where built to create the best model to distinguish lncRNAs from PCTs. This method was trained and tested with human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) data, achieving 98.21%, 98.03% and 96.09%, accuracy, respectively. Our method was compared to other tools available in the literature (CPAT, CPC, iSeeRNA, lncRNApred, lncRScan-SVM and FEELnc), and showed an improvement in accuracy by \u22483.00%. In addition, to validate our model, the mouse data was classified with the human model, and vice-versa, achieving \u224897.80% accuracy in both cases, showing that the model is not overfit. The SVM models were validated with data from rat (Rattus norvegicus), pig (Sus scrofa) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and obtained more than 84.00% accuracy in all these organisms. Our results also showed that 81.2% of human pseudogenes and 91.7% of mouse pseudogenes were classified as non-coding. Moreover, our method was capable of re-annotating two uncharacterized sequences of Swiss-Prot database with high probability of being lncRNAs. Finally, in order to use the method to annotate transcripts derived from RNA-seq, previously identified lncRNAs of human, gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) were analyzed, having successfully classified 98.62%, 80.8% and 91.9%, respectively. The SVM method proposed in this work presents high performance to distinguish lncRNAs from PCTs, as shown in the results. To build the model, besides using features known in the literature regarding ORFs, we used PCA to identify features among nucleotide pattern frequencies that contribute the most in distinguishing lncRNAs from PCTs, in reference data sets.

Each task is formulated as a structured prediction problem and modeled by a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) model. We argue that the two tasks are correlated problems whose outputs can provide prior knowledge of the target prediction for each other. The two HCRFs are coupled in a unified graphical model called coupled HCRF where the joint dependence of the cluster labels and face name association is naturally embedded in the correlation between the two HCRFs.

MKL kernels expand on traditional base kernels that are used to improve performance on non-linearly separable datasets. Multiple kernels use combinations of those base kernels to develop novel kernel shapes that allow for more diversity in the generated solution spaces. Customising these kernels to the dataset is still mostly a process of trial and error. Guidelines around what combinations to implement are lacking and usually they requires domain specific knowledge and understanding of the data. Through a brute force approach, this study tests multiple datasets against a combination of base and non-weighted MKL kernels across a range of tuning hyperparameters. The goal was to determine the effect different kernels shapes have on classification accuracy and whether the resulting values are statistically different populations. A selection of 8 different datasets are chosen and trained against a binary classifier.

Multi-contrast scans can enhance the accuracy for many deep learning algorithms. However, these scans may not be available in some situations. Thus, it is valuable to synthetically generate non-existent contrasts from the available one. Existing methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) lack the freedom to map one image to multiple contrasts using only a single generator and discriminator, hence, requiring training of multiple models for multi-contrast MR synthesis. We present a novel method for multi-contrast MR image synthesis with unpaired data using GANs. Our method leverages the strength of Star-GAN to translate a given image to n contrasts using a single generator and discriminator. We also introduce a new generation loss function, which enforces the generator to produce high-quality images which are perceptually closer to the real ones and exhibit high structural similarity as well.

Normally, a pathologist has to examine by LM many histological sections to perform a complete and accurate diagnosis. For this reason, an automatic system for the analysis of LM images of the liver would be particularly useful. Goal of this paper is to propose an automatic multi-stage procedure to classify the normal tissue, and the pathologic ones from human liver microphotographs. Due to the articulated nature of the examined images, the analysis will first assess if steatosis is present, by using objects analysis, and then determine whether the image belongs to a normal tissue or to one of the other pathologic ones, by using a machine learning based technique. To this aim some texture features are calculated, and the Principal Component Analysis is applied to derive the best representation of the data.

Most multivariate statistical quality control charts are usually used (in manufacturing and service industries) to determine whether a process is performing as intended or if there are some unnatural causes of variation upon an overall statistics. Once the control chart detects out-of-control signals, one difficulty encountered with multivariate control charts is the interpretation of an out-of-control signal. That is, we have to determine whether one or more or a combination of variables is responsible for the abnormal signal. A novel approach for diagnosing the out-of-control signals in the multivariate process is described in this paper. The proposed methodology uses the optimized support vector machines (support vector machine classification based on genetic algorithm) to recognize set of subclasses of multivariate abnormal patters, identify the responsible variable(s) on the occurrence of abnormal pattern. Multiple sets of experiments are used to verify this model.

Nowadays, there is a growing consensus that the increasing dimensionality poses impeding effects on the performances of classifiers, which is termed as the \u201cpeaking phenomenon\u201d in the field of machine intelligence. To address the issue, dimensionality reduction is commonly employed as a preprocessing step on the Big dimensional data before building the classifiers. In this paper, we propose an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approach for large-scale data analytic. In contrast to existing approaches, we embed hidden nodes that are designed using singular value decomposition (SVD) into the classical ELM. These SVD nodes in the hidden layer are shown to capture the underlying characteristics of the Big dimensional data well, exhibiting excellent generalization performances. The drawback of using SVD on the entire dataset, however, is the high computational complexity involved. To address this, a fast divide and conquer approximation scheme is introduced to maintain computational tractability on high volume data. The resultant algorithm proposed is labeled here as Fast Singular Value Decomposition-Hidden-nodes based Extreme Learning Machine or FSVD-H-ELM in short. In FSVD-H-ELM, instead of identifying the SVD hidden nodes directly from the entire dataset, SVD hidden nodes are derived from multiple random subsets of data sampled from the original dataset. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons are conducted to assess the FSVD-H-ELM against other state-of-the-art algorithms.

In the Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) genome, helitron sequences have high variability in terms of size by base pairs (bp) varied from 11 to 8965 bp from one sequence to another. These TEs are not uniformly dispersed sequences, and they have the ability to mobilize within a genome by a rolling-circle mechanism. This ability to move and reproduce in genomes enables these elements to play a major role in genomic evolution. In order to follow the evolution, we predicted helitron families (10 classes) in the C.elegans genome using the combination of the features extracted from signals corresponding to DNA sequences and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In our classification system, the features extracted from the signals were shown to be efficient to automatically predict helitronic sequences. As a result, the Gaussian radial kernel over 100-fold cross-validation gave the best accuracy rates, ranging from 68% to 97%, with an overall mean score of 83.7%, and we successfully identified the Helitron Y1A class for a specific value of c and gamma, reaching an accuracy rate of 100%.

Single unit activity, accounted for input-output transforms in distributed neural networks. Serial recording during a stereotyped task has no demerits in understanding population coding, assuming a reasonable neuronal sample, and a hypothesis related to relatively stereotyped input-output mappings. Complex, emergent features of neuronal ensembles is not needed for an understanding of input-output mappings, but may play a role in more fundamental information-processing functions, such as learning, coordination among parallel networks, and attention to action. The population vector is computed from the activity of hidden units, but its accuracy does not depend on direct influences of hidden units on output elements. Cosine-like tuning and population vector coding emerged from a minimal-assumption network. The population vector rotated when the input output function is changed from the standard mapping to a nonstandard one. Population-vector rotation is accounted by a transition between two inputs, one representing the visual signal and reflecting standard visuomotor mapping, and the target signal into which it is transformed, and reflecting nonstandard mapping. The changes of hidden-unit tuning properties that occurred while the network learned a nonstandard transform corresponded to those observed in the motor cortex of a monkey that learned analogous transforms. The tuning properties of individual cells changed during the learning of both transformational and arbitrary mappings. During learning, the population vector became more accurate in both model and biological networks, for both standard and nonstandard mappings, and for both transformational and arbitrary nonstandard mappings.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11480279", "doi": "10.1016/S0079-6123(01)30017-1", "venue": "Progress in brain research", "journal": "Progress in brain research", "mag_id": "1850598946", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13331811"}

The novel aspect of this scheme is the definition and use of a conceptual space where information originating from heterogeneous media types can be meaningfully combined and facilitate analysis decisions. More specifically, our contribution is on proposing a modeling approach for Bayesian Networks that defines this conceptual space and allows evidence originating from the domain knowledge, the application context and different content modalities to support or disproof a certain hypothesis. Using this scheme we have performed experiments on a set of 162 compound documents taken from the domain of car manufacturing industry and 118581 video shots taken from the TRECVID2010 competition. The obtained results have shown that the proposed modeling approach exploits the complementary effect of evidence extracted across different media and delivers performance improvements compared to the single-medium cases.

A growing number of studies link the functional role of SNPs with the networks and pathways mediated by the disease-associated genes. For example, many non-synonymous missense SNPs (nsSNPs) have been found near or inside the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interfaces. Determining whether such nsSNP will disrupt or preserve a PPI is a challenging task to address, both experimentally and computationally. Here, we present this task as three related classification problems, and develop a new computational method, called the SNP-IN tool (non-synonymous SNP INteraction effect predictor). Our method predicts the effects of nsSNPs on PPIs, given the interaction's structure. It leverages supervised and semi-supervised feature-based classifiers, including our new Random Forest self-learning protocol. The classifiers are trained based on a dataset of comprehensive mutagenesis studies for 151 PPI complexes, with experimentally determined binding affinities of the mutant and wild-type interactions. Three classification problems were considered: (1) a 2-class problem (strengthening/weakening PPI mutations), (2) another 2-class problem (mutations that disrupt/preserve a PPI), and (3) a 3-class classification (detrimental/neutral/beneficial mutation effects). In total, 11 different supervised and semi-supervised classifiers were trained and assessed resulting in a promising performance, with the weighted f-measure ranging from 0.87 for Problem 1 to 0.70 for the most challenging Problem 3. By integrating prediction results of the 2-class classifiers into the 3-class classifier, we further improved its performance for Problem 3. To demonstrate the utility of SNP-IN tool, it was applied to study the nsSNP-induced rewiring of two disease-centered networks. The accurate and balanced performance of SNP-IN tool makes it readily available to study the rewiring of large-scale protein-protein interaction networks, and can be useful for functional annotation of disease-associated SNPs.

Numerous factors have been related to variations of soil salinity, some of them combined empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and correlation analysis. However, environmental factors that essentially affect soil-water balance are not given enough attention. In addition, further analysis is needed in exploring how well the environmental factors can interpret the variations in soil salinity at different scales, especially in arid oasis areas and at large scales. This paper explores the potential of modeling variations in soil salinity via the EMD and Random Forest modeling of remote sensing based environmental factors. A case study is presented for Tarim basin, Xinjiang, China, using land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), TRMM precipitation (TRM) and digital elevation model (DEM) products. Soil salinity and its decompositions were first correlated with environmental factors for feature selection. Then, those selected environmental factors and their decompositions were correlated and coupled with their counterparts of soil salinity to evaluate their synchronization. Finally, those IMF components of environmental factors that had high correlation coefficients and were coupled well with corresponding IMF components of soil salinity were identified and divided into different feature sets for modeling. Mean absolute error and mean bias error were adopted for accuracy assessment of the models. Our results indicate that soil salinity series can be separated into eight scales ranging from 170 km to 480 km. IMF components 5\u20137 account for most of the variation and can be modeled using the corresponding IMF components of different combinations of DEM, ET, LST and TRM. IMF components 6\u20137 are well coupled with LST and ET at approximately 475 km scale. Overall, regional-scale modeling of variations in soil salinity based on remote sensing products is possible. Reasonably accurate results can be obtained in arid oasis areas where researchers and policy makers must focus on preventing the loss of agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.05.016", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "2618369426", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134684127"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134700347"}

Shortwave NIR spectroscopy is also a rapid, flexible, and cost-effective method to control product quality in food industry. The method of support vector regression coupled with shortwave NIR spectroscopy was explored for the nondestructive quantitative analysis of the important quality parameters of soy sauce, including amino nitrogen content, total acid content, salt content and color ratio. In this study, the support vector regression(SVR) models based on subtractive spectra and positive spectra were found and compared, the results show that the subtractive spectrum was more excellent than the positive spectrum. Meanwhile, R and RSE were determined, respectively, by means of original spectra and pretreated spectra(standard normal variate (SNV), first-derivative and second-derivative), and the corresponding models were successfully established. The best prediction was achieved by a support vector regression model of the first derivative transformed dataset. In addition, the result obtained by the proposed method was compared with that of Partial Least Squares(PLS), which showed that the generalization performance of the classifier based on SVR was much better than that of PLS.

Proteins interact through exposed residues that present differential physicochemical properties, and these can be exploited to identify protein interfaces.ResultsHere we present VORFFIP, a novel method for protein binding site prediction. The method makes use of broad set of heterogeneous data and defined of residue environment, by means of Voronoi Diagrams that are integrated by a two-steps Random Forest ensemble classifier.

Automatic classification of the scanned 1867 paper map proved difficult, but its manual digitization could benefit from object-based image segmentation. Classifying digital aerial images was more accurate via the object-based than pixel-based method, but only if the images were segmented appropriately. In the object-based classification, spectral-based features were much more important and useful than shape/geometry features for land-cover discrimination, as ranked by RF. During the 147 years, 32% of the region changed in land type. Settlement and roads increased in extent by 1850% and 691%, respectively, and woodland decreased by 19%. These changes fragmented the landscape, altered the hydrological regime, and affected river morphology.

Methods From January 2006 to November 2012, 188 patients (78%) underwent accelerated chemoradiotherapy, and 52 patients (22%) underwent chemotherapy alone followed by esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma. Mean age was 61 \u00b1 9.2 years, and 89% were male. Residual primary cancer, assessed as the percentage of residual primary cancer cells in resection specimens, was quantified histologically by a gastrointestinal pathologist. Random Forest technology was used for data analysis. Results Twenty-five specimens (10%) had no residual primary cancer (ypT0), 79 (33%) had 1% to 25% residual cancer, 91 (38%) had 26% to 75%, and 45 (19%) had >75%. Survival was worse with increasing residual primary cancer, plateauing at 75%. Greater residual primary cancer was associated with worse survival across the spectrum of higher ypTN. Higher ypT, larger number of positive nodes, and use of induction chemotherapy rather than induction chemoradiotherapy were associated with greater residual primary cancer. Conclusions Less residual primary cancer in response to preoperative therapy is associated with a linear increase in survival after esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma; however, survival is poorer than for resected early-stage cancers. Therefore, for patients with poor prognostic indicators, including higher percentage of residual primary cancer, the role of adjuvant therapy needs to be further examined in an attempt to improve survival.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27530636", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.05.007", "venue": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "journal": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery", "mag_id": "2363400349", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["73514344"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37853549"}

Urban trees contribute significantly in mitigating the urban heat island effect and supporting biodiversity. However, accurate and up-to-date mapping of urban tree species is difficult because of the time-consuming nature of field sampling, fine-scale spatial variation, and potentially high species diversity. Advanced remote sensing data such as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with high pulse density (25 point/m 2 ) and hyperspectral imagery offer two different yet complementary approaches to estimating crown structure and canopy physiological information at the individual crown scale, which can be useful for mapping tree species. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of these technologies to map 15 common urban tree species using a Random Forest (RF) classifier in the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. LiDAR-derived crown structural information was combined with hyperspectral-derived spectral vegetation indices for species classification. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 51.1%, 61.0%, and 70.0% using hyperspectral, LiDAR and the combined data respectively. The overall accuracy for the two most important and iconic native coniferous species improved markedly from 78.3% up to 91% using the combined data. The results of this research highlight that (1) the combination of structural and spectral information provided an improved classification accuracy than when used separately, and variables derived from LiDAR data contributed more to the accurate prediction of species than hyperspectral features; (2) higher classification accuracies were observed for evergreen species, species with distinguishable crown structure, and species undergoing flowering; (3) and finally the anthocyanin content index and photochemical reflectance index were the most important hyperspectral features for the discrimination of tree species in the spring budburst stage.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.010", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2748857187", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202743703", "57765084", "19420814", "51685487", "100595412", "56517392", "49551582", "208224461", "52208116", "202313392", "58981728", "199118450", "56177300", "80617422", "202196613", "134347339", "24992843", "209449872", "210913310", "211032150", "210843042", "85499267", "49416154", "92392076"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133771040"}

Non-invasive osteoporosis diagnosis based on image analysis has been focused on in recent years. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we propose a new approach for osteoporosis diagnosis based on support vector machine (SVM) using 3D micro-CT images. This approach combines the parameters related to osteoporosis and obtains an optimal classifier for distinguishing osteoporosis and normal groups. Bone mineral density (BMD) and four parameters relevant to trabecular bone (TB) structure have been used as features for osteoporosis recognition, which are obtained from micro-CT image data through Volumetric Topological Analysis (VTA). Combining the five parameters, we utilize SVM method to train these data due to its excellent performance on classification. 50 micro-CT image data are used in our experiment, in which, 25 are from osteoporosis group and 25 are from normal group. Results: Precision, recall and F-measure are used to evaluate the performance of the classifier obtained, which are 90.9%, 100% and 95.2% in the experiment. Discussion: The good performance demonstrates that SVM method performed on the five parameters can effectively distinguish osteoporosis and normal groups.

The study area of this work is the Fregeneda-Almendra region (between Spain and Portugal), where Li occurs in pegmatites.

To overcome this, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were applied to. This study aims at: (i) comparing the performance accuracy in lithological mapping achieved by SVM and by RF; (ii) evaluating the sensitivity of both classifiers to class imbalance and; (iii) compare the results achieved with previously obtained results. For these, the same Level 1-C Sentinel-2 images (October 2017) were used. SVM showed slightly better accuracy, but RF was able to correctly classify a larger number of mapped Li-bearing pegmatites. The performance of the models was not equal for all classes, having all underperformed in some classes. Also, RF was affected by class imbalanced, while SVM prove to be more insensitive. The potential of this kind of approach in Li-exploration was confirmed since both algorithms correctly identified the presence of Li-bearing pegmatites in the three open-pit mines where they outcrop as well in areas where Li-pegmatites were mapped.

In this paper, a novel out-of-sample method is introduced by utilizing high dimensional model representation (HDMR) as a nonlinear multivariate regression with the Tikhonov regularizer for unsupervised manifold learning algorithms. The proposed method was extensively analyzed using illustrative datasets sampled from known manifolds. Several experiments with 3D synthetic datasets and face recognition datasets were also conducted, and the performance of the proposed method was compared to several well-known out-of-sample methods. The results obtained with locally linear embedding (LLE), Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) showed that the proposed method achieves competitive even better performance than the other out-of-sample methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31095481", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2019.2915162", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2945595726", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["124252520", "14879317", "1536455", "20061298", "39935916", "26204565", "2071866", "10726702", "122694523", "6894357", "9943893", "7449031", "11048216", "10428467", "14820441", "8531166", "13930797", "6289873", "119142859", "9936813", "8147519", "118050721", "38292000", "12064404", "125449533", "73652951", "26819488", "12051918", "115620935", "124368293", "2226763", "7071215", "17779599", "497801", "52804443", "52899184", "31489787"], "inbound_citations": ["211057158"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:157058978"}

To make this unbelievable huge information ::: space accessible, search engines index the uploaded contents and provide efficient ::: algorithmic machinery for ranking the importance of documents with respect to an input ::: query. All major search engines such as Google, Yahoo or Bing are keyword-based, which ::: is indisputable a very powerful tool for accessing information needs centered around documents. ::: However, this unstructured, document-oriented paradigm of the World Wide Web has serious drawbacks, when searching for specific knowledge about real-world entities. ::: When asking for advanced facts about entities, today's search engines are not very good in providing accurate answers. Hand-built knowledge bases such as Wikipedia or its structured counterpart DBpedia are excellent sources that provide common facts. However, these knowledge bases are far from being complete and most of the knowledge lies still buried in unstructured documents. ::: Statistical machine learning methods have the great potential to help to bridge the gap between text and knowledge by (semi-)automatically transforming the unstructured representation of the today's World Wide Web to a more structured representation. This ::: thesis is devoted to reduce this gap with Probabilistic Graphical Models. Probabilistic ::: Graphical Models play a crucial role in modern pattern recognition as they merge two important fields of applied mathematics: Graph Theory and Probability Theory. ::: The first part of the thesis will present a novel system called Text2SemRel that is able to (semi-)automatically construct knowledge bases from textual document collections. The resulting knowledge base consists of facts centered around entities and their relations. ::: Essential part of the system is a novel algorithm for extracting relations between entity ::: mentions that is based on Conditional Random Fields, which are Undirected Probabilistic Graphical Models. ::: In the second part of the thesis, we will use the power of Directed Probabilistic Graphical Models to solve important knowledge discovery tasks in semantically annotated large document collections. In particular, we present extensions of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework that are able to learn in an unsupervised way the statistical semantic ::: dependencies between unstructured representations such as documents and their semantic annotations. Semantic annotations of documents might refer to concepts originating from a thesaurus or ontology but also to user-generated informal tags in social tagging ::: systems. These forms of annotations represent a first step towards the conversion to a more structured form of the World Wide Web. ::: In the last part of the thesis, we prove the large-scale applicability of the proposed fact extraction system Text2SemRel. In particular, we extract semantic relations between genes and diseases from a large biomedical textual repository. The resulting knowledge ::: base contains far more potential disease genes exceeding the number of disease genes that ::: are currently stored in curated databases.

And bibliographic data extraction has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In this paper, we address the problem of automatic extraction of bibliographic data in Chinese electronic book and propose a tool called CEBBIP* for the task, which includes three main systems: data preprocessing, data parsing and data postprocessing. In the data preprocessing system, the tool adopts a rules-based method to locate citation data in a book and to segment citation data into citation strings of individual referencing literature. And a learning-based approach, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), is employed to parse citation strings in the data parsing system. Finally, the tool takes advantage of document intrinsic local format consistency to enhance citation data segmentation and parsing through clustering techniques. CEBBIP has been used in a commercial E-book production system. Experimental results show that CEBBIP's precision rate is very high. More specially, adopting the document intrinsic local format consistency obviously improves the citation data segmenting and parsing accuracy.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1555400.1555412", "venue": "JCDL '09", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1999053255", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11453237", "3526393", "9517078", "16011291", "41004871", "1007888", "2074297", "13169886", "1300961", "16261927", "24935941"], "inbound_citations": ["17892962", "2411319", "62191204", "14204938", "14956204", "11984172", "6099912", "15264856"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11454087"}

Given a query im age, our approach first classi fies the image into one of the three categories: microaneurysm (MA) , neovascularization (NV) and normal, and then it retrieves DR images that are clinically-relevant to the query image from an archival image database. In the classification stage, the query DR images are classified by the Multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (McMIL) approach, where images are viewed as bags, each of which contains a number of instances corresponding to non-overlapping blocks, and each block is characterized by low-level featur es including color, texture, histogram of e dge directions, and shape. McMIL first learns a collection of instance prototypes for each class that maximizes the Diverse Density function using Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A nonlinear mapping is then defined using the instance prototypes and maps every bag to a point in a new multi-class bag feature space . Finally a multi-class Support Vector Machine is trained in the multi-class bag feature space.

Random Forest as a robust classifier has been utilized effectively to deal with challenging characteristics of imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. In this study, we seek the answer to the question, do alterations to the bootstrapping process within Random Forest improve its classification performance? Thus, we performed an experimental study using Random Forest with four bootstrapping approaches, including two new novel bootstrapping approaches, across 15 imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. Our results demonstrate that two of the bootstrapping approaches, including one of our proposed approaches, outperform other approaches, however, this difference is statistically insignificant. We conclude that Random Forest is a robust classifier, able to handle the challenge of class imbalance, and can be slightly improved by altering bootstrapping process.

Others have argued that CN models have little to contribute to our efforts to understand intelligence (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). A critical examination of the popular characterizations of SP and CN models suggests that neither of these extreme positions is justified. There are many advantages to be gained by a synthesis of the best of both SP and CN approaches in the design of intelligent systems. The Generalized connectionist networks (GCN) (alternately called generalized neuromorphic systems (GNS)) introduced in this paper provide a framework for such a synthesis. 1. Symbol Processing Architectures for Intelligent Systems The symbol processing approach to the design of intelligent systems was summarized by Newell (1980) and Newell & Simon (1972) in terms of what they called the physical symbol systems and by Fodor (1976) in terms of what he called the language of thought. In this framework, perception and cognition are tantamount to acquiring and manipulating symbolic representations. It is suggested that the symbol structures that constitute such representations have a counterpart in the physical structure of the brain and/or the brain\u2019s internal states. Models of intelligent systems developed within this framework typically are (but do not have to be) based on the von Neumann serial stored program model of computation. Popular interpretations of this definition are often overly restrictive, and appear to exclude (for no good reason) systems that perceive, learn, and reason with non-symbolic (e.g., iconic or analogic) representations, or using numerically-encoded probabilistic or fuzzy inference structures. The following sections critically examine popular conceptions and major strengths and weaknesses of SP models of intelligent systems. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This is a draft of a paper that is currently under review.

Spatial and temporal data mining provides innovative solutions for mining Earth Science data by incorporating spatial and temporal dependencies into standard data mining techniques. Although there has been substantial research in spatial and temporal data mining, there are still many technical issues that need to be addressed. This includes issues such as processing massive high resolution data, reducing the effect of noise, fusing data from heterogeneous sources, etc. We develop a class of efficient and robust spatial and temporal data mining algorithms in this thesis to overcome these challenges. First, we develop an integrated localized prediction framework based on Support Vector Machine to incorporate spatial and temporal dependencies. Efficient algorithms are also proposed to reduce its computational overhead. Second, we study the error accumulation problem in multi-step time series prediction and develop a novel semi-supervised multivariate time series prediction algorithm for long term forecasting. A covariance alignment method is also proposed to reduce the inconsistencies between historical and future climate data when applying the algorithm to future climate projection problems. Third, we propose a graph-based framework to detect and categorize different types of anomalies in multivariate time series data. We applied the framework to the problem of detecting and characterizing ecosystem disturbances in Earth Science data. While the spatial and temporal data mining techniques proposed in this thesis have been applied to many problems in the Earth Science domain, they are also applicable to spatial and temporal data in other application domains such as traffic analysis, image processing, network monitoring, etc.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2251462224", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131033119"}

Firstly we build a new training dataset of 313 alanine-mutated interface residues extracted from 34 protein complexes. Then we generate a wide variety of 600 sequence, structure, exposure and energy features, together with Euclidean and Voronoi neighborhood properties. To remove redundant and irrelevant information, we select a set of 26 optimal features utilizing a two-step feature selection method, which consist of a minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure and a sequential forward selection process. Based on the selected 26 features, we use Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to build our prediction model. Performance of our PredHS2 approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms and other state-of-the-art hot spot prediction methods on the training dataset and the independent test set (BID) respectively.

Famously, in his 1950 paper \u2018Computing Machinery and Intelligence\u2019 [11], the British mathematician Alan Turing suggested replacing this question which he found \u201ctoo meaningless to deserve discussion\u201d with a simple [behaviourial] test based on an imagined Victorian-esque pastime he entitled the \u2018imitation game\u2019. In this special issue of Kybernetes a selection of authors with a special interest in Turing\u2019s work (including those who participated in the 2008 AISB symposium on the Turing test) have been invited to explore and clarify issues arising from Turing\u2019s 1950 paper on the imitation game; now more widely known as the Turing test. As early as 1941 Turing was thinking about machine intelligence [3] specifically how computing machines could solve problems by searching through the space of possible problem solutions guided by heuristic principles. And in 1947 Turing gave what is perhaps the earliest public lecture on machine intelligence at the Royal Astronomical Society, London. Subsequently, in 1948, following a year\u2019s sabbatical at Cambridge, Turing completed a report for the UK\u2019s National Physical Laboratory on his research into machine intelligence, entitled Intelligent Machinery [10]. Although not published contemporaneously, the report is notable for predicting many core themes which eventually emerged from the yet nascent science of machine intelligence: Expert Systems; Connectionism; Evolutionary Algorithms; but most intriguingly of all in the context of this special issue, the report offers perhaps the earliest version of the imitation game / Turing test.

The most common vocalisations of Right whales are characterized as frequency modulated up sweeps with duration of ~1s and a frequency range from 50 to 200 Hz. These species favour shallow waters during their seasonal migration. Such shallow-water acoustic environments act as a waveguide and cause the mono-component up call emitted by the vocalising whale to become a dispersive multimode signal with different time arrivals and relative energy at the receiver. As well as the natural variation in species vocalisation, another variation in the characteristic features extracted from dispersive calls results from the dispersion effect. In this thesis normal mode modelling was used to better understand the influence of shallow water on the parameters of Right whale up calls. Also, examples from data recorded in Cape Cod Bay shows the dispersion influence. Visual scanning indicates that 93% of the data are dispersive and the first mode in 85% of these calls is less excited than the second mode due to the dependence of mode excitation on the depth of the calling whale. The discrimination between the Northern Right whale up calls and background noise has been investigated using the Support Vector Machine classifier. To perform this task, a region-based active contour segmentation method is proposed. This approach is based on the evolution of the contour within the spectrogram image searching for the uniformity of the target object. In this work both synthesized data based on typical Right whale vocalisations and real data recorded in Cape Cod Bay are used to evaluate the proposed method. To illustrate the variation in the data caused by the channel effect we compare the descriptive statistics of the call duration using both the single mode and the multi-mode approaches. The single mode analysis was performed by extracting the frequency contour of the first mode.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "356751114", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55557890"}

Domain adaptation (DA) addresses this problem by designing classifiers that are robust to mismatched distributions.

We propose a blind DA algorithm that does not require target domain samples for training. For this purpose, we learn a global nonlinear extreme learning machine (ELM) model from the source domain data in an unsupervised fashion. The global ELM model is then used to initialize and learn class specific ELM models from the source domain data. During testing, the target domain features are augmented with the reconstructed features from the global ELM model.

In this paper, we propose nonparametric models for the power curves of two small wind turbines of 50 kW and 2.5 kW rated capacities, based on the manufacturer power curve.

One significant problem with adopting DNNs for skin cancer classification is that the class frequencies in the existing datasets are imbalanced. This problem hinders the training of robust and well-generalizing models. Data Augmentation addresses this by using existing data more effectively. However, standard data augmentation implementations are manually designed and produce only limited reasonably alternative data. Instead, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is utilized to generate a much broader set of augmentations. This paper proposes a novel enhancement for the progressive generative adversarial networks (PGAN) using self-attention mechanism. Self-attention mechanism is used to directly model the long-range dependencies in the feature maps. Accordingly, self-attention complements PGAN to generate fine-grained samples that comprise clinically-meaningful information. Moreover, the stabilization technique was applied to the enhanced generative model. To train the generative models, ISIC 2018 skin lesion challenge dataset was used to synthesize highly realistic skin lesion samples for boosting further the classification result.

However, it is so difficult to bridge the meanings of different multimedia modalities that the performance of multimodal retrieval is deteriorated now. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to build the relationship between visual and textual modalities and to verify the multimodal retrieval. Specifically, this mechanism depends on the multimodal binary classifiers based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to verify whether the answers are related to the query examples. Firstly, we propose the multimodal probabilistic semantic model to rank the answers according to their generative probabilities. Furthermore, we build the multimodal binary classifiers to filter out unrelated answers. The multimodal binary classifiers are called the word classifiers. It can improve the performance of the multimodal probabilistic semantic model. The experimental results show that the multimodal probabilistic semantic model and the word classifiers are effective and efficient. Also they demonstrate that the word classifiers based on ELM not only can improve the performance of the probabilistic semantic model but also can be easily applied to other probabilistic semantic models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jfranklin.2017.08.019", "venue": "J.

Though these two processes may be different, they are very much interrelated. The ability to reason about a domain of knowledge is often based on rules about that domain, that must be learned somehow. And the ability to reason can often be used to acquire new knowledge, or learn.

For building extraction, we apply fuzzy sets to create a fuzzy landscape of shadows which in turn involves a two-step procedure. The first step is a preliminarily image classification at a fine segmentation level to generate vegetation and shadow information. The second step models the directional relationship between building and shadow objects to extract building information at the optimal segmentation level. We conducted the experiments on two datasets of Pleiades images from Wuhan City, China.

These representations are typically used for visualization, classification, and clustering and have been successfully applied to a variety of problems in the pharmaceutical and bioinformatics domains. SOMs in these domains have generally been restricted to static sets of nodes connected in either a grid or hexagonal connectivity and planar or toroidal topologies. We investigate the impact of connectivity and topology on SOM performance, and experiments were performed on fixed and growing SOMs. Three synthetic and two relevant data sets from the chemistry domain were used for evaluation, and performance was assessed on the basis of topological and quantization errors after equivalent training periods. Although we found that all SOMs were roughly comparable at quantizing a data space, there was wide variation in the ability to capture its underlying structure, and growing SOMs consistently outperformed their static counterparts in regards to topological errors. Additionally, one growing SOM, the Neural Gas, was found to be far more capable of capturing details of a target data space, finding lower dimensional relationships hidden within higher dimensional representations.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17705465", "doi": "10.1021/ci7001445", "venue": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "mag_id": "2079016649", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16754592", "7631399"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26876182"}
{"paper_id": "58512255", "title": "Biometric identity verification using on-line & off-line signature verification", "authors": [{"first": "Alisher", "middle": [], "last": "Kholmatov", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Biometrics is the utilization of biological characteristics (face, iris, fingerprint) or behavioral traits (signature, voice) for identity verification of an individual. Biometric authentication is gaining popularity as a more trustable alternative to password-based security systems as it is relatively hard to be forgotten, stolen, or guessed. Signature is a behavioral biometric: it is not based on the physical properties, such as fingerprint or face, of the individual, but behavioral ones. As such, one's signature may change over time and it is not nearly as unique or difficult to forge as iris patterns or fingerprints, however signature's widespread acceptance by the public, make it more suitable for certain lower-security authentication needs. Signature verification is split into two according to the available data in the input. Off-line signature verification takes as input the image of a signature and is useful in automatic verification of signatures found on bank checks and documents. On-line signature verification uses signatures that are captured by pressure-sensitive tablets and could be used in real time applications like credit card transactions or resource accesses. In this work we present two complete systems for on-line and off-line signature verification. During registration to either of the systems the user has to submit a number of reference signatures which are cross aligned to extract statistics describing the variation in the user's signatures. Both systems have similar verification methodology and differ only in data acquisition and feature extraction modules. A test signature's authenticity is established by first aligning it with each reference signature of the claimed user, resulting in a number of dissimilarity scores: distances to nearest, farthest and template reference signatures. In previous systems, only one of these distances, typically the distance to the nearest reference signature or the distance to a template signature, was chosen, in an ad-hoc manner, to classify the signature as genuine or forgery. Here we propose a method to utilize all of these distances, treating them as features in a two-class classification problem, using standard pattern classification techniques. The distances are first normalized, resulting in a three dimensional space where genuine and forgery signature distributions are well separated. We experimented with the Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machines, and a linear classifier used in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis, to classify a given signature into one of the two classes (forgery or genuine). Test data sets of 620 on-line and 100 off-line signatures were constructed to evaluate performances of the two systems. Since it is very difficult to obtain real forgeries, we obtained skilled forgeries which are supplied by forgers who had access to signature data to practice before forging. The online system has a 1.4% error in rejecting forgeries, while rejecting only 1.3% of genuine signatures. As an offine signature is easier to forge, the offine system's performance is lower: a 25% error in rejecting forgery signatures and 20% error in rejecting genuine signatures. The results for the online system show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art results, and the results for the offline system are comparable with the performance of experienced human examiners.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "604739740", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["58186488", "3994007", "54692479", "214780595", "5998046", "43998291", "1348533", "39843226", "39843226", "9601608", "1594346", "15416092", "16414733", "15764101", "20472758", "32778249", "11508481", "16298031", "2174565", "56285071", "16618839", "15608670", "206985513", "7717159", "31672360", "14754917"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58512255"}

Although the large majority of the existing techniques rely on a single classifier such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), several ensemble methods such as Adaboost or Random Forests (RF) have also been explored. The ensemble methods combine the outputs of several classifiers and aim to increase performance by exploring the diversity of the base classifiers in terms of features or examples, which are usually randomly selected. In this paper we propose using a different kind of ensemble to address the three class problem of classifying AD, MCI and Control Normals (CN) from PET brain images. We propose the favourite class ensemble of classifiers where each base classifier in the ensemble uses a different feature subset which is optimized for a given class. Since different image features correspond to different sets of brain voxels, the proposed favourite class classifiers are able to take into account the fact that the spatial pattern of brain degeneration in AD changes in time as the disease progresses. We tested this approach on FDG-PET images from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database using as base classifiers both Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF).

In the second approach, the pieces of information contained in the first and second IMFs of each hyperspectral image band are combined using composite kernels for SVM classification with higher accuracy.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2010.2070510", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2126796976", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["28637672", "14495716", "6906514", "13077907", "229594", "60633363", "2853017", "7443466", "26985497", "37082642", "1128166", "18409415", "14728800", "1262186", "201885367", "17207251", "8376138", "126526508", "20891879", "17579352", "10110052", "18690533", "91185935", "18226941", "21445438", "15613456", "201243488", "128848964", "47302", "18683182", "693844"], "inbound_citations": ["30279462", "4339759", "11133773", "67867638", "26129396", "3693618", "21667294", "32751861", "215643139", "39006349", "1004952", "1497758", "25700524", "454589", "23166636", "50768531", "1153858", "4721296", "49412283", "25846516", "4869472", "54018217", "21954089", "9866582", "55714662", "43491097", "7710797", "22677105", "56523033", "35540493", "4641916", "132130467", "135324174", "209383073", "215299168", "43802675", "2239793", "206692034", "10969170", "210971507", "59247497", "5967824", "191207456", "8324343", "1525786", "4108161", "2763989", "5859462", "10877291", "32219353", "15142590", "4240376", "198408769", "48386825", "17534054", "54452669", "22209205", "32773685", "4629611", "14707070", "38271485", "18041310", "2475388", "25958218", "53093622", "6372823", "8659310", "4454977"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16542065"}

It is a complex disease characterized by many morphological, clinical and molecular features. It is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells. Soft Computing has become popular in developing systems that encloses human expertise. Imaging technologies and clinical cytology have improved breast cancer diagnosis, better survival rates and treatment by early detection of primary or metastatic masses, differentiating benign from malignant tumors and promoting intraoperative surgical guidance and post operative specimen evaluation. Medical results produce undesirable faults and extreme clinical costs which influence the value of services offered to patients. Hence, exact detection is extremely important for proper treatment and cure of disease. Precise outcome can be achieved using Artificial Neural Network. Different kernel functions of Support Vector Machine are used for classification of breast cancer dataset. The comparative analysis of both ANN and SVM is done for performance evaluation in terms of accuracy. The dataset used in this research is taken from UCI database composed of 683 cytological instances, out of which 458 are benign and 241 are malignant. The results show a better performance for SVM classifier than ANN.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2593357624", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207963973", "199439539"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19412586"}

The design of deep neural network models makes it necessary to extend training datasets in order to introduce variations and increase the number of samples; word-retrieval is therefore very difficult in low-resource scripts. Much of the existing literature comprises preprocessing strategies which are seldom sufficient to cover all possible variations. We propose an Adversarial Feature Deformation Module (AFDM) that learns ways to elastically warp extracted features in a scalable manner.

A continuous, non-invasive, telemonitoring device that can accurately monitor cardiac metrics could greatly help this population, reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and cost. ::: ::: ::: APPROACH ::: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms trained on electrical-impedance tomography (EIT) data are presented for portable cardiac monitoring. The approach was validated on a simulated thorax and a measured tank experiment. A highly detailed 4D chest model (finite element method mesh and conductivity profiles) was developed utilizing the 4D XCAT phantom to provide realistic data. The ML algorithms were trained using databases that assumed the presence of poorly contacting electrodes without any assumptions of knowing which electrodes would be bad in the experiment. The trained ML algorithms were compared to EIT evaluated with and without removing bad electrodes. ::: ::: ::: MAIN RESULTS ::: A regression Support Vector Machine (rSVM) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) were found to be the most accurate and robust to poorly contacting electrodes while not needing to know which electrodes were in poor contact in the simulated and measured experiments, respectively. ::: ::: ::: SIGNIFICANCE ::: Although, the ML algorithms are not always better than EIT (with bad electrodes removed), the comparable results without needing priori knowledge of which electrodes are bad is seen as a very promising feature. An evaluation of computational costs showed that the DNN required comparable computational to the other methods while requiring less memory, which could make the DNNs an attractive algorithm for a low-power, portable system.

DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic mechanism, which controls the regulation of gene expression and is useful in early detection of cancer.

Recent research efforts attempted to reduce this high dimensionality by different feature selection techniques. This article proposes a multistage feature selection approach to select the optimal CpG sites from three different DNAm cancer datasets (breast, colon and lung). The proposed approach combines three different filter feature selection methods including Fisher Criterion, t-test and Area Under ROC Curve. In addition, as a wrapper feature selection, we apply genetic algorithms with Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) as its fitness function, and SVM as its evaluator. Using the Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) strategy, subsets of 24, 13 and 27 optimal CpG sites are selected for the breast, colon and lung cancer datasets, respectively. By applying fivefold cross-validation on the training datasets, these subsets of optimal CpG sites showed perfect classification accuracies of 100, 100 and 97.67%, respectively. Moreover, the testing of the three independent cancer datasets by these final subsets resulted in accuracies 96.02, 98.81 and 94.51%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated high classification performance and small optimal feature subsets. Consequently, the biological significance of the genes corresponding to these feature subsets is validated using enrichment analysis.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00500-016-2439-9", "venue": null, "journal": "Soft Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2552933951", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["167222335", "210985991", "212702635", "203896072", "198966597", "210930454"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26722299"}

The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, \"meta\" refers to training multiple tasks, and \"transfer\" is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance.

Most of the time, the genuine cardholder is not aware that someone else has seen or stolen his card information.

Fraud detection based on the analysis of existing purchase data of cardholder is a promising way to reduce the rate of successful credit card frauds. As manually processing credit card transactions is a time-consuming and resource-demanding task, credit card issuers search for high-performing and efficient algorithms that automatically look for anomalies in the set of incoming transactions. Data mining is a well-known and often suitable solution to big data problems involving risk such as credit risk modelling, churn prediction and survival analysis. Nevertheless, fraud detection in general is an atypical prediction task which requires a tailored approach to address and predict future fraud. Though most of the fraud detection systems show good results in detecting fraudulent transactions, they also lead to the generation of too many false alarms. This assumes significance especially in the domain of credit card fraud detection where a credit card company needs to minimize its losses but, at the same time, does not wish the cardholder to feel restricted too often.

Moreover, visual disability was assessed by the Activity of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS). The subjects were followed up for 12 months in order to record prospective falls. A subject who reported at least one fall within one year from the baseline assessment was considered as faller, otherwise as non-faller. Different tree-based algorithms (i.e., C4.5, AdaBoost and Random Forests) were used to develop automatic classifiers and their performances were evaluated by the cross-validation approach. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Over the follow-up, 25 falls were referred by 13 patients. The logistic regression analysis showed the following variables as significant predictors of prospective falls: pseudophakia and use of prescribed eyeglasses as protective factors, recent worsening of visual acuity as risk factor. Random Forest ranked best corrected visual acuity, number of sleeping hours and job type as the most important features. Finally, AdaBoost enabled the identification of subjects at higher risk of falling in the following 12 months with a sensitivity rate of 69.2% and a specificity rate of 76.6%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The current study proposes a novel method, based on classification trees applied to self-reported factors and health information assessed by a standardized questionnaire during ophthalmological visits, to identify ophthalmic patients at higher risk of falling in the following 12 months.

Overall, the different methods evaluated in the current study are Ordinary Kriging (OK), Regression Kriging (RK), Random Forest (RF), Random Forest Kriging (RFK), Gradient Boosting (GB) and Gradient Boosting Kriging (GBK). According to the findings of the study, machine learning methods (RF and GB) improve the prediction accuracy. The improvement ranged from 6% to 9% for RMSE, 47% to 250% for R2 and 4% to 11% for MAE. Moreover, the introduction of residuals' kriging (hybrid methods), increases the accuracy of predictions furthermore (from 1% to 34%). It is also interesting that the measured collocated soil parameters that are used as auxiliary variables have consistently more influence (increased Pearson correlation coefficient for MLR and importance for RF and GB) than the environmental parameters. The main reason could be the flat terrain and the rather homogenous study area that minimizes the effect of topography on the soils.

Computational identification of enhancers is difficult because they do not exhibit clear location preference relative to their target gene and also because they lack clearly distinguishing genomic features. This represents a major challenge in deciphering transcriptional regulation. Recent ChIP-seq based genome-wide investigation of epigenomic modifications have revealed that enhancers are often enriched for certain epigenomic marks. Here we utilize the epigenomic data in human heart tissue along with validated human heart enhancers to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model of cardiac enhancers. Cross-validation classification accuracy of our model was 84% and 92% on positive and negative sets respectively with ROC AUC = 0.92. More importantly, while P300 binding has been used as gold standard for enhancers, our model can distinguish P300-bound validated enhancers from other P300-bound regions that failed to exhibit enhancer activity in transgenic mouse. While GWAS studies reveal polymorphic regions associated with certain phenotypes, they do not immediately provide causality. Next, we hypothesized that genomic regions containing a GWAS SNP associated with a cardiac phenotype might contain another SNP in a cardiac enhancer, which presumably mediates the phenotype. Starting with a comprehensive set of SNPs associated with cardiac phenotypes in GWAS studies, we scored other SNPs in LD with the GWAS SNP according to its probability of being an enhancer and choose one with best score in the LD as enhancer. We found that our predicted enhancers are enriched for known cardiac transcriptional regulator motifs and are likely to regulate the nearby gene. Importantly, these tendencies are more favorable for the predicted enhancers compared with an approach that uses P300 binding as a marker of enhancer activity.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3581590", "pubmed_id": "23424115", "doi": "10.1142/9789814447973_0010", "venue": "Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "293047985", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["204762576", "14727192", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["9037064"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6895081"}

The objective of this study is to explore the potential of transfer learning for soil spectroscopy and its performance on soil clay content estimation using hyperspectral data. First, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is used on Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) mineral soils. To evaluate whether the pre-trained 1D-CNN model was transferrable, LUCAS organic soils were used to fine-tune and validate the model.

Spectral index, as suggested as a simple transferrable feature, was also explored on LUCAS data, but did not performed well on the estimation of clay content. Then, the pre-trained 1D-CNN model was further fine-tuned by field samples collect in the study area with spectra extracted from HyMap imagery, achieved an accuracy of R\u00b2 = 0.601, RMSE = 8.62 and RPD = 1.54.

Advances in the field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled the use of flying robots equipped with sensors like optical cameras to assess the damage caused by natural or manmade disasters and locate victims in the debris.

The sequence of images of the avalanche debris captured by the UAV is processed with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract discriminative features. A trained linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is integrated at the top of the CNN to detect objects of interest. Moreover, we introduce a pre-processing method to increase the detection rate and a post-processing method based on a Hidden Markov Model to improve the prediction performance of the classifier. Experimental results conducted on two different datasets at different levels of resolution show that the detection performance increases with an increase in resolution, while the computation time increases.

The aim of the present study was to use non-linear methods to model the RBA to the oestrogen receptor of a large diverse set of chemicals. To this end, various variable selection methods were applied to a large group of descriptors. The methods included stepwise regression, partial least squares and recursive partitioning (Formal Inference Based Recursive Modelling, FIRM). The selected descriptors were used in Counter-Propagation Neural Networks (CPNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the models were compared in terms of the predictivity of the activities of an external validation set. The results showed that although there was a certain degree of similarities between the structural descriptors selected by different methods, the predictive power of the CPNN and SVM models varied.

The Landmark-Boosting model also maintained the best calibration across moderate- and high-risk groups and over time. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed temporal model can not only accurately predict 1-year CKD risk but also improve performance over time with additionally accumulated data, which is essential for clinical use to improve renal management of patients with diabetes. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Incorporation of temporal information in EHR data can significantly improve predictive model performance and will particularly benefit patients who follow-up with their physicians as recommended.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7055762", "pubmed_id": "32012067", "doi": "10.2196/15510", "venue": "JMIR Medical Informatics", "journal": "JMIR Medical Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2989324284", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["37428382", "59226297", "32491826", "56193512", "79266954", "28738233", "6689721", "700433", "20206004", "3919488", "979006", "12691872", "49276140", "4900015", "215272518", "11315009", "3303891", "34343219", "13514714", "20628633", "4515689", "81707849", "19295858", "37149831", "43180417", "28711", "73903482", "1943162", "12471709", "25634909", "4644251", "17782117", "7955044", "207159665", "9074524", "58622080"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209236939"}

Adding significant predictors (i.e., soil structure), and implementing more flexible regression algorithms are among the main strategies of PTFs improvement. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the improved effect of categorical soil structure information on estimating soil-water content at various matric potentials, which has been reported in literature, could be enduringly captured by regression techniques other than the usually applied linear regression. Two data mining techniques, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), which have been recently introduced as promising tools for PTF development, were utilized to test if the incorporation of soil structure will improve PTF\u2019s accuracy under a context of rather limited training data. The results show that incorporating descriptive soil structure information, i.e., massive, structured and structureless, as grouping criterion can improve the accuracy of PTFs derived by SVM approach in the range of matric potential of \u22126 to \u221233 kPa (average RMSE decreased up to 0.005 m 3 m \u2212 3 after grouping, depending on matric potentials). The improvement was primarily attributed to the outperformance of SVM-PTFs calibrated on structureless soils. No improvement was obtained with kNN technique, at least not in our study in which the data set became limited in size after grouping. Since there is an impact of regression techniques on the improved effect of incorporating qualitative soil structure information, selecting a proper technique will help to maximize the combined influence of flexible regression algorithms and soil structure information on PTF accuracy.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.04.014", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2021144087", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212714438", "55485143", "85554437"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129373711"}

According to the connotation of Scientific Outlook on Development,this paper constructs a comprehensive human all-round development evaluation index system through selection,screening,and rational analysis of human all-round development indicators.This paper establishes human all-round development evaluation model based on support vector machines,and analyzes the development on fourteen provinces in China as of 2006. This paper is organized as follows.Section 1 contains the introduction.Section 2 constructs an index system of human all-round development evaluation based on the Scientific Outlook on Development.Section 3 describes the construction of evaluation model of human all-round development evaluation based on support vector machines.Building on the index system and the evaluation model,section 4 discusses empirical research on human all-round development of fourteen provinces in China as of 2006.This section discusses survey data used in this study,the evaluation process,and the results of this study.Finally,section 5 contains the conclusion. This paper has three aspects of contributions.Firstly,this paper maps the evaluation indicator space into the higher-dimensional feature space through support vector machines using the Gauss kernel.This solves the nonlinear weighting problem of human all-round development evaluation and changes the disadvantage of the existing evaluation method that adopts linear weighting method without considering the nonlinear relationship between the indicators and the evaluation results. Secondly,this paper designs input indicators of training set for support vector machines through an orthogonal model.At the same time,this paper designs training set for support vector machines through the product of inputs and weights.The training set of support vector machines is determined afterwards.The weight of training set is designed through AHP.This solves the problem of determining the training set without input and output.Also,this changes the comprehensive evaluation model of human all-round development based on support vector regression without training data. Thirdly,this paper calculates Gini Coefficient and Gross National Happiness by using the cumulative proportion of population,the cumulative proportion of income,inflation,and other indicators.This design solves the indirect calculation problem of Gini Coefficient and Gross National Happiness,and changes the existing research that is unable to evaluate the regional human all-round development because of statistical data flaws.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IEEM 2012", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2348320209", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64422680"}

These problems are of more direct concern to computer scientists than to psychologists, philosophers or neuroscientists. Accordingly, the purpose of the workshop is to bring together computer-science oriented connectionist researchers who have addressed the problems, so as to understand the issue of achieving high-level cognitive processing in connectionist systems more clearly. The following is a list of preferred topics for presentations and discussions at the workshop. The topics are not orthogonal. 1. Connectionist/neural implementation of (aspects of) commonsense reasoning, planning, natural language understanding and rapid, 'one-shot' learning. 2.

Given training videos for a certain event, a classifier is constructed to identify videos displaying it. In particular, the problems of the weakly supervised setting and the unclear event structure are addressed in this paper. The first issue is associated with the loosely annotated training videos that usually contain many irrelevant shots. The second one is the difficulty of assuming the event structure in advance, because videos can be created by arbitrary camera and editing techniques. To overcome these problems, a Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF) is used where hidden states work as an intermediate layer to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant shots to the event. In addition, the relation among hidden states characterises the event structure. Thus, the above problems are managed by optimising hidden states and their relation, so as to distinguish videos where the event occurs from the rest of videos. Experimental results on TRECVID video data validate the effectiveness of HCRFs in this context.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2578726.2578742", "venue": "ICMR", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1997292542", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9203634", "344673", "18900135", "15238581", "206597351", "1744924", "565274", "843729", "277918", "14112033", "16652859", "13298437", "18763045", "11621312", "15133854", "7677566", "5893582", "1171329", "16312007", "59856400", "1720166", "9124349"], "inbound_citations": ["5850115", "13879833", "6129896"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13834160"}

However, these features have different acoustic characteristics that play important roles in speaker recognition. Thus, we propose a non-parallel VCS that efficiently uses both mel-cepstrum and spectral envelopes as input features. Our method is based on three key strategies: 1) we use generative adversarial networks for voice conversion; 2) we add noise to facilitate the training of the formant part; and 3) we integrate the acoustic features to generate high-quality converted voices.

However, the performance of scene classification strongly relies on the discriminative power of feature representation, which is generally hand-engineered and requires a huge amount of domain-expert knowledge as well as time-consuming hand tuning. Recently, unsupervised feature learning (UFL) provides an alternative way to automatically learn discriminative feature representation from images. However, the performances achieved by conventional UFL methods are not comparable to the state-of-the-art, mainly due to the neglect of locally substantial image structures. This paper presents an improved UFL algorithm based on spectral clustering, named UFL-SC, which cannot only adaptively learn good local feature representations but also discover intrinsic structures of local image patches. In contrast to the standard UFL pipeline, UFL-SC first maps the original image patches into a low-dimensional and intrinsic feature space by linear manifold analysis techniques, and then learns a dictionary (e.g., using K-means clustering) on the patch manifold for feature encoding. To generate a feature representation for each local patch, an explicit parameterized feature encoding method, i.e., triangle encoding, is applied with the learned dictionary on the same patch manifold. The holistic feature representation of image scenes is finally obtained by building a bag-of-visual-words (BOW) model of the encoded local features. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UFL-SC algorithm can extract efficient local features for image scenes and show comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approach on open scene classification benchmark.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2444405", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2105032938", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206691461", "128848964", "11560704", "5822303", "22398460", "6771828", "130535382", "10048333", "6091340", "8784107", "828465", "14457153", "6387937", "9686347", "308212", "61529410", "90113", "17804904", "6692382", "23642485", "14201947", "12008458", "207763512", "1302462", "206765110", "206769720", "12132619", "2071866", "14879317", "1536455", "291166", "10726702", "2444921", "2657786", "7549619", "231648", "13976978", "1181154", "9265597", "8519109", "3177797", "1487700", "14542261", "12638869", "206769424", "2990061", "993769", "961425", "16555962", "13904304", "119563947", "46638242"], "inbound_citations": ["3823778", "8948766", "125514806", "3809717", "4397697", "38923308", "9343143", "24045116", "199571816", "115206713", "15948014", "174819202", "23909025", "81980507", "847115", "173987225", "57759390", "20351644", "22513165", "10577012", "172136699", "1377727", "199012732", "548288", "199135579", "18263771", "6950668", "1939509", "22747888", "204208840", "31429268", "19963944", "7489335", "3765094", "209320089", "3294389", "126044833", "15298934", "8349072", "12537710", "10397600", "209487645", "24373527", "19091803", "69274491", "3652639", "3046524", "209339783", "207114695", "9125483", "3718143", "24501682", "15812978", "4809177", "22538752", "125523751", "49545927", "3447026", "52934107", "17472350", "27798755", "28782221", "44168318", "52296965", "7417614", "51965457", "206911747", "204823266", "46927956", "10175419", "208041238", "12727694", "22270920", "3714259", "15745256", "201032419", "13079847", "146093592", "52111661", "40498115", "6621758", "54463580", "132052207", "53948857"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21226824"}

Many factors should be considered when designing a product. Design of Experiments (DOE) has been a major, conventional method for such purpose. Moreover, nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) provides fast processing, real-time predictions with a continuous quality improvement for complex industrial design processes. ML with big data is known to handle multi-dimensional and multi-variate data in dynamic industrial systems. However, the ability of the ML methods against limited training datasets has been addressed scarcely. In the present study, a Taguchi DOE approach combined with two selected common ML approaches, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have been assessed against producing a robust prediction tool for mechanical properties of carbon fibers with a limited training dataset. To this end, empirical models based on three rendering parameters of the stabilization reaction process of oxidized Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers (OPF) have been created. These rendering parameters were obtained according to the explanation of whole Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FT-IR ATR) spectra. ML revealed a very promising agreement between the trained empirical models and experimental data. Namely, in terms of the fibers Young\u2019s modulus, the results showed that the SVR empirical model with the average error of less than \u00b12.4% had a better performance than ANN-LMA (Levenberg \u2013Marquardt algorithm) with the average error of less than \u00b12.7%.

Till now, there is no definitive clinical examination that can diagnose a PD patient. However, it has been reported that PD patients face deterioration in handwriting. Hence, different computer vision and machine learning researchers have proposed micrography and computer vision based methods. But, these methods possess two main problems. The first problem is biasedness in models caused by imbalanced data i.e. machine learning models show good performance on majority class but poor performance on minority class. Unfortunately, previous studies neither discussed this problem nor took any measures to avoid it. In order to highlight the biasedness in the constructed models and practically demonstrate it, we develop four different machine learning models. To alleviate the problem of biasedness, we propose to use random undersampling method to balance the training process. The second problem is low rate of classification accuracy which has limited clinical significance. To improve the PD detection accuracy, we propose a cascaded learning system that cascades a Chi2 model with adaptive boosting (Adaboost) model. The Chi2 model ranks and selects a subset of relevant features from the feature space while Adaboost model is used to predict PD based on the subset of features. Experimental results confirm that the proposed cascaded system shows better performance than other six similar cascaded systems that used six different state of the art machine learning models. Moreover, it was also observed that the proposed cascaded system improves the strength of conventional Adaboost model by 3.3% and reduces its complexity.

Under this assumption, these algorithms divided manifold into a set of overlapping local patches which are locally isometric to linear subsets of Euclidean space. Then the learnt manifold would be a flat manifold with zero Riemannian curvature. But in the general cases, manifolds may not have this property. To be more specific, the traditional manifold learning does not consider the curvature information of the embedded manifold. In order to improve the existing algorithms, we propose a curvature-aware manifold learning algorithm called CAML. Without considering the local and global assumptions, we will add the curvature information to the process of manifold learning, and try to find a way to reduce the redundant dimensions of the general manifolds which are not isometric to Euclidean space.

Recent research shows impressive recommendation performance by using neural network-based methods to transform tag-based user or item profiles to abstract feature representations. However, in the process of training a neural network, these methods need an more effective measurement to balance the tag-based profiles and the abstract representations to further improve item recommendation. This paper proposes a method based on Generative Adversarial Networks to tackle this issue. In this method, abstract features of users and items are extracted from their tag-based profiles by a disentangling network.

Using various natural language processing algorithms, we found that linguistic coordination (i.e., the extent to which students mimic each other in terms of their grammatical structure) did not predict the quality of student collaboration or learning gains. However, we found that the coherence of students' discourse was significantly different across our experimental conditions; this measure was positively correlated with their learning gains. Finally, using various language metrics, we were able to roughly (i.e., using a median- split) predict learning gains with a 94.4% accuracy using Support Vector Machine.

Several methods, measures, aspects and testing methodologies are available to evaluate the software fault. In this paper, a fuzzy-filtered neuro-fuzzy framework is introduced to predict the software faults for internal and external software projects. The suggested framework is split into three primary phases. At the earlier phase, the effective metrics or measures are identified, which can derive the accurate decision on prediction of software fault. In this phase, the composite analytical observation of each software attribute is calculated using Information Gain and Gain Ratio measures. In the second phase, these fuzzy rules are applied on these measures for selection of effective and high-impact features. In the last phase, the Neuro-fuzzy classifier is applied on fuzzy-filtered training and testing sets. The proposed framework is applied to identify the software faults based on inter-version and inter-project evaluation. In this framework, the earlier projects or project-versions are considered as training sets and the new projects or versions are taken as testing sets. The experimentation is conducted on nine open source projects taken from PROMISE repository as well as on PDE and JDT projects. The approximation is applied on internal version-specific fault prediction and external software projects evaluation.

In reality, it is pointless to use all features considering that redundant or irrelevant features would deteriorate the detection performance. Meanwhile, statistical approaches are extensively practised in the Anomaly Based Detection System (ABDS) environment. These statistical techniques do not require any prior knowledge on attack traffic; this advantage has therefore attracted many researchers to employ this method. Nevertheless, the performance is still unsatisfactory since it produces high false detection rates. In recent years, the demand for data mining (DM) techniques in the field of anomaly detection has significantly increased. Even though this approach could distinguish normal and attack behaviour effectively, the performance (true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative) is still not achieving the expected improvement rate. Moreover, the need to re-initiate the whole learning procedure, despite the attack traffic having previously been detected, seems to contribute to the poor system performance. ::: ::: This study aims to improve the detection of normal and abnormal traffic by determining the prominent features and recognising the outlier data points more precisely. To achieve this objective, the study proposes a novel Intrusion Detection Scheme for Identifying Known and Unknown Web Attacks (I-WEB) which combines various strategies and methods. The proposed I-WEB is divided into three phases namely pre-processing, anomaly detection and post-processing. In the pre-processing phase, the strengths of both filter and wrapper procedures are combined to select the optimal set of features. In the filter, Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) is proposed, whereas the Random Forest (RF) classifier is chosen to evaluate feature subsets in wrapper procedures. In the anomaly detection phase, the statistical analysis is used to formulate a normal profile as well as calculate the traffic normality score for every traffic. The threshold measurement is defined using Euclidean Distance (ED) alongside the Chebyshev Inequality Theorem (CIT) with the aim of improving the attack recognition rate by eliminating the set of outlier data points accurately. To improve the attack identification and reduce the misclassification rates that are first detected by statistical analysis, ensemble-learning particularly using a boosting classifier is proposed. This method uses using LogitBoost as the meta-classifier and RF as the base-classifier. Furthermore, verified attack traffic detected by ensemble learning is then extracted and computed as signatures before storing it in the signature library for future identification. This helps to reduce the detection time since similar traffic behaviour will not have to be re-executed in future.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2891065805", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53241502"}

A forward sequential approximate Markov blanket is then defined to eliminate the redundant feature. An ensemble learning is employed to achieve approximately optimal global feature selection, which can acquire the feature subsets from different perspectives. Finally, by fusing all the feature subsets, the improved evidence theory approach is utilized to gain the final feature subset.

The classification problems in this study are explored in terms of mean accuracy and the effects of varying algorithm parameters over different types of datasets. This content analysis has been examined through eight different datasets taken from UCI to train models for all three algorithms. The results obtained from this study clearly show that RF and kNN outperform NB. Furthermore, kNN and RF perform relatively the same in terms of mean accuracy nonetheless kNN takes less time to train a model. The changing numbers of attributes in datasets have no effect on Random Forest, whereas Naive Bayes mean accuracy fluctuates up and down that leads to a lower mean accuracy, whereas, kNN mean accuracy increases and ends with higher accuracy. Additionally, changing number of trees has no significant effects on mean accuracy of the Random forest, however, the time to train the model has increased greatly. Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbor are proved to be the best classifiers for any type of dataset. Thus, Naive Bayes can outperform other two algorithms if the feature variables are in a problem space and are independent.

It constructs the feature by calculating the gradient direction histogram of the local region. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is applied to solve the feature dimension explosion. It can be used to extract the main feature components of the data and often used for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. Thirdly, the SVM algorithm is used for classification.

Experiments were conducted on the AVEC2012 database of spontaneous dialogues and the IEMOCAP database of acted dialogues. We studied the performance of two types of acoustic features for emotion recognition: knowledge-inspired disfluency and nonverbal vocalisation (DIS-NV) features, and statistical Low-Level Descriptor (LLD) based features. Both Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) were built using each feature set on each emotional database. Our work aims to identify aspects of the data that constrain the effectiveness of models and features. Our results show that the performance of different types of features and models is influenced by the type of dialogue and the amount of training data. Because DIS-NVs are less frequent in acted dialogues than in spontaneous dialogues, the DIS-NV features perform better than the LLD features when recognizing emotions in spontaneous dialogues, but not in acted dialogues. The LSTM-RNN model gives better performance than the SVM model when there is enough training data, but the complex structure of a LSTM-RNN model may limit its performance when there is less training data available, and may also risk over-fitting.

Although the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that it is not possible to anticipate market movements consistently, the use of computationally intensive systems that employ machine learning algorithms is increasingly common in the development of stock trading mechanisms. Several studies, using daily stock prices, have presented predictive system applications trained on fixed periods without considering new model updates. In this context, this study uses a machine learning technique called Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock prices for large and small capitalisations and in three different markets, employing prices with both daily and up-to-the-minute frequencies. Prediction errors are measured, and the model is compared to the random walk model proposed by the EMH.

However, the nature of ovarian cysts lacks accurate judgement, leading to that many patients with benign nodules still need Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies or surgeries, increasing the physical pain and mental pressure of patients as well as unnecessary medical health care costs. Therefore, we present an image diagnosis system for classifying the ovarian cysts in color ultrasound images, which novelly applies the image features fused by both high-level features from deep learning network and low-level features from texture descriptor. Firstly, the ultrasound images are enhanced to improve the quality of training data set and the rotation invariant uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) features are extracted from each of the images as the low-level texture features. Then the high-level deep features extracted by the fine-tuned GoogLeNet neural network and the low-level ULBP features are normalized and cascaded as one fusion feature that can represent both the semantic context and the texture patterns distributed in the image. Finally, the fusion features are input to the Cost-sensitive Random Forest classifier to classify the images into \u201cmalignant\u201d and \u201cbenign\u201d. The high-level features extracted by the deep neural network from the medical ultrasound image can reflect the visual features of the lesion region, while the low-level texture features can describe the edges, direction and distribution of intensities. Experimental results indicate that the combination of the two types of features can describe the differences between the lesion regions and other regions, and the differences between lesions regions of malignant and benign ovarian cysts.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31254110", "doi": "10.1007/s10916-019-1356-8", "venue": "Journal of Medical Systems", "journal": "Journal of Medical Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2995749778,2953917349", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["104463375", "22044040", "52163874", "58573709", "15933697", "11100323", "23473327", "71930543", "18464728", "17369203", "7324833", "45877095", "22469513", "16133383", "5019648", "4806344", "11167539", "195908774", "4236914", "11100323", "214879725", "393948", "18487686", "14120111", "39087784", "116858", "53304118", "26893209", "15037168", "205527719"], "inbound_citations": ["211058830"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195737584"}

One unobtrusive and non-invasive way of recognizing human affective states entails the exploration of how physiological signals vary under different emotional experiences. In particular, this paper explores the correlation between autonomically-mediated changes in multimodal body signals and discrete emotional states. In order to fully exploit the information in each modality, we have provided an innovative classification approach for three specific physiological signals including Electromyogram (EMG), Blood Volume Pressure (BVP) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). These signals are analyzed as inputs to an emotion recognition paradigm based on fusion of a series of weak learners. Our proposed classification approach showed 88.1% recognition accuracy, which outperformed the conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with 17% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, in order to avoid information redundancy and the resultant over-fitting, a feature reduction method is proposed based on a correlation analysis to optimize the number of features required for training and validating each weak learner. Results showed that despite the feature space dimensionality reduction from 27 to 18 features, our methodology preserved the recognition accuracy of about 85.0%.

We address the task of estimating the engagement state of customers for a robot bartender based on the data from audiovisual sensors. We begin with an offline experiment using hidden Markov models, confirming that the sensor data contains the information necessary to estimate user state. We then present two strategies for online state estimation: a rule-based classifier based on observed human behaviour in real bars, and a set of supervised classifiers trained on a labelled corpus. These strategies are compared in offline cross-validation, in an online user study, and through validation against a separate test corpus. These studies show that while the trained classifiers are best in a cross-validation setting, the rule-based classifier performs best with novel data; however, all classifiers also change their estimate too frequently for practical use. To address this issue, we present a final classifier based on Conditional Random Fields: this model has comparable performance on the test data, with increased stability.

The state-of-art method to ensure smart grid security is to detect cyber attacks by deep learning.

In this work, we conduct a detailed study to measure the effectiveness of GANs in enhancing speech contaminated by both additive and reverberant noise. Motivated by recent advances in image processing, we propose operating GANs on log-Mel filterbank spectra instead of waveforms, which requires less computation and is more robust to reverberant noise. While GAN enhancement improves the performance of a clean-trained ASR system on noisy speech, it falls short of the performance achieved by conventional multi-style training (MTR).

We argue they can serve as generic representations for modelling images. In particular, by working in scattering space, we achieve competitive results both for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, while making progress towards constructing more interpretable CNNs. For supervised learning, we demonstrate that the early layers of CNNs do not necessarily need to be learned, and can be replaced with a scattering network instead. Indeed, using hybrid architectures, we achieve the best results with predefined representations to-date, while being competitive with end-to-end learned CNNs. Specifically, even applying a shallow cascade of small-windowed scattering coefficients followed by $1\\times 1$1\u00d71-convolutions results in AlexNet accuracy on the ILSVRC2012 classification task. Moreover, by combining scattering networks with deep residual networks, we achieve a single-crop top-5 error of 11.4 percent on ILSVRC2012. Also, we show they can yield excellent performance in the small sample regime on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets, exceeding their end-to-end counterparts, through their ability to incorporate geometrical priors. For unsupervised learning, scattering coefficients can be a competitive representation that permits image recovery. We use this fact to train hybrid GANs to generate images.

To solve this problem, we construct an adaptive model to learn user distance in multiple social networks via combining distance metric learning and boosting technologies. The basic idea of our model is to embed related social networks into a potential feature space, while retaining the topologies of social networks. To get the solution to our model, we formulate it as a convex optimization problem.

As an alternative to these image-based methods, this paper investigates whether it is possible to transfer the learning (or parameters) of a highly accurate pre-trained (deep neural network) model for classifying truck images generated from 3D-point cloud data from a LiDAR sensor.

A thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on the data in order to ascertain the presence of anomalies such as outliers and extreme values. The EDA revealed that the bank data had 45, 211 instances and 17 features, with 11.7% positive responses. This was in addition to the detection of outliers and extreme values. Classification algorithms used for modelling the bank dataset include; Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and the Random Forest ensemble. These algorithms were applied to both the balanced and original bank data using Orange 3.2 data mining application following the Cross Industry Standard for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), and the ten-fold cross-validation method. Results from the experimental methods revealed that the performance of the Random Forest ensemble improved when the data was balanced. Results also showed that the features duration, poutcome, contact, month and housing were the most important features that contribute to the success of the bank customer marketing campaign for deposit subscription. The study also revealed that the duration of call to clients, response to past promotions, and the use of cell phone contribute positively to the success of the campaign. While the months of September, November, March and April recorded higher subscription rates. Those in management cadre and technicians were found to have responded more positively to the campaign than those in other job categories.

This is important in order to understand and respond to the immediate needs of the consumer. According to Raorane and Kulkarni (2011), the study of consumers helps firms and organizations to improve their marketing strategies by understanding issues such as the psychology, mindset, behavior and motivation of consumers. It is clear from the last statement that corporate organizations must hold data on customers, and develop capacity to analyze and make good use of such transactional data. One of such transaction that has been automated is customer relationship management (CRM). In this study relevant data mining techniques are used to determine which customer and what market segment would respond positively to promotions and marketing campaigns by a corporate organization. The study would rely on consumer data aggregated electronically through customer relationship management (CRM) processes. According to Tudor, Bara and Botha (2011, p. 266), a customer relationship management system is a bucket on information technology (IT) applications and procedures whose target is to identify the main expectations and preferences of clients, and to effectively use client information to improve relationships between the enterprise and its customers. Electronic CRM (eCRM), which entails wide application of information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as personalized email for instance could be categorized into four dimensions for direct marketing purposes; (i) customer identification, (ii) customer attraction, (iii) customer retention, and (iv) customer development (Kracklauer, Mills & Seifert, 2004). The motivation behind the study was to improve the level of confidence in the ability to accurately predict the customers and market segment that would respond positively to the marketing campaigns of an unnamed Portuguese bank. \u2026", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of International Technology and Information Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["73620570", "8353376", "57146809", "166803109", "13326443", "7481148", "207113272", "55494899"], "inbound_citations": ["62900163", "25088246"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:187161706"}

Impacts of planting dates on production are very well known. In the current study machine learning algorithms have been used in determining planting date. The proposed method aims to help farmers to obtain higher yield providing them with accurate planting date. For this purpose, metereological data was used as an input. For each year, metereological information (Daily Maximum Air Temperature, Daily Relative Humudity, Daily Average Air Temperature, Daily Minimum Air Temperature and Daily Precipitation) in the first 300 days were used to determine three different planting dates; early, normal and late for wheat crop. For estimation of planting date, classification algorithms of k Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decisions Trees were used. Performances of different algorithms were calculated with leave one out cross validation approach. In order to eleminate extremely high processing time because of high dimension of the data set and improve estimation performance, genetic algorithm was used to reduce the number of features. For the estimations performed using both all features and also the features selected with genetic algorithm the highest accuracies were obtained using kNN method with classification accuracy rates of 37% and 92%, respectively.

All these methods favor properties of a convex and composite optimization objective. The latter consists of a convex regularization term and loss function with Lipschitz continuous subgradients, e.g. l1-norm ball together with hinge loss. Some approaches approximate in a limit the l0-type of a penalty. In our analysis we focus on a regret and convergence criteria of such an approximation. We derive our results in terms of a sequence of convex and strongly convex optimization objectives. These objectives are obtained via the smoothing of a generic sub-differential and possibly non-smooth composite function by the global proximal operator. We report an extended evaluation and comparison of the reweighted schemes against different state-of-the-art techniques and solvers for linear SVMs. Our experimental study indicates the usefulness of the proposed methods for obtaining sparser and better solutions.

Most previous methods focus on integrating similarities and associating information contained in heterogeneous miRNA-disease networks. However, these methods establish only shallow prediction models that fail to capture complex relationships among miRNA similarities, disease similarities, and miRNA-disease associations. We propose a prediction method on the basis of network representation learning and convolutional neural networks to predict disease miRNAs, called CNNMDA. CNNMDA deeply integrates the similarity information of miRNAs and diseases, miRNA-disease associations, and representations of miRNAs and diseases in low-dimensional feature space. The new framework based on deep learning was built to learn the original and global representation of a miRNA-disease pair. First, diverse biological premises about miRNAs and diseases were combined to construct the embedding layer in the left part of the framework, from a biological perspective. Second, the various connection edges in the miRNA-disease network, such as similarity and association connections, were dependent on each other. Therefore, it was necessary to learn the low-dimensional representations of the miRNA and disease nodes based on the entire network. The right part of the framework learnt the low-dimensional representation of each miRNA and disease node based on non-negative matrix factorization, and these representations were used to establish the corresponding embedding layer. Finally, the left and right embedding layers went through convolutional modules to deeply learn the complex and non-linear relationships among the similarities and associations between miRNAs and diseases. Experimental results based on cross validation indicated that CNNMDA yields superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, case studies on lung, breast, and pancreatic neoplasms demonstrated the powerful ability of CNNMDA to discover potential disease miRNAs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6696449", "pubmed_id": "31349729", "doi": "10.3390/ijms20153648", "venue": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "journal": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963026948", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["174231", "12866404", "25810610", "8431485", "13702049", "15001322", "22618534", "2371379", "9794073", "13313854", "1721807", "8100322", "17887601", "18322697", "52185327", "104295096", "207602356", "22527645", "34603152", "28590494", "3895466", "3823309", "51603744", "3823388", "52916003", "4018627", "196683084", "1713713", "49406702", "13772289", "59274491", "14081058", "171393353", "13812899", "14038145", "7931182", "93283", "12829250", "4856921", "29716793", "8791620", "9836392", "18632662", "10002473", "3298558", "17041507", "4792467", "215682655", "18072472", "1167362", "33139226", "3738355", "46965545", "52910859", "37360775", "4418009", "86271406", "32220065", "22662824", "7530766", "1440722", "215065774", "15257733", "8081113", "16603592", "15295074"], "inbound_citations": ["202413202"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198933320"}

More specifically, a novel methodology is investigated for discriminating defects by applying a supervised neural classification technique, namely SVM, to innovative multidimensional wavelet based feature vectors. These vectors are extracted from the K-Level 2-D DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) transformed original image using Vector Quantization techniques and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Analysis applied to these wavelet domain quantization vectors.

Meanwhile, transfer learning has been widely applied in computer vision and natural language processing applications to improve deep neural network's generalization capabilities. However, very few previous works applied transfer learning framework to time series mining problems. Particularly, the technique of measuring similarities between source domain and target domain based on dynamic representation such as density estimation with importance sampling has never been combined with transfer learning framework. In this paper, we first proposed a general adaptive transfer learning framework for multi-view time series data, which shows strong ability in storing inter-view importance value in the process of knowledge transfer. Next, we represented inter-view importance through some time series similarity measurements and approximated the posterior distribution in latent space for the importance sampling via density estimation techniques.

However, an accurate selection of the underlying model order (in terms of number of input lags, output lags and input delay) is still a critical issue in the identification of LPV systems in the LS-SVM setting. In this paper, we address this issue by extending the LS-SVM method to sparse LPV model identification, which, besides non-parametric estimation of the model coefficients, achieves datadriven model order selection via convex optimization. The main idea of the proposed method is to first estimate the coefficients of an over-parameterized LPV model through LS-SVM. The estimated coefficients are then scaled by polynomial weights, which are shrunk towards zero to enforce sparsity in the final LPV model estimate.

However, in many scenarios, the available datasets may be limited and distributed across multiple agents, each of which is seeking to learn the distribution of the data on its own. In such scenarios, the local datasets are inherently private and agents often do not wish to share them. In this paper, to address this multi-agent GAN problem, a novel brainstorming GAN (BGAN) architecture is proposed using which multiple agents can generate real-like data samples while operating in a fully distributed manner and preserving their data privacy. BGAN allows the agents to gain information from other agents without sharing their real datasets but by \"brainstorming\" via the sharing of their generated data samples. Therefore, the proposed BGAN yields a higher accuracy compared with a standalone GAN model and its architecture is fully distributed and does not need any centralized controller. Moreover, BGANs are shown to be scalable and not dependent on the hyperparameters of the agents' deep neural networks (DNNs) thus enabling the agents to have different DNN architectures. Theoretically, the interactions between BGAN agents are analyzed as a game whose unique Nash equilibrium is derived.

Partial Least Square Regression models were developed based on Raman spectroscopic characteristics of the pork loins to predict the values of the sensory attributes. Furthermore, binary barcodes were created based on spectroscopic characteristics of the pork loins, and subjected to multivariate statistical discriminant analysis (i.e., Support Vector Machine) to differentiate and classify pork loins into quality grades (\"good\" and \"bad\" in terms of tenderness and chewiness). Good agreement (>83% correct predictions) with sensory panel results was obtained.

However, real world tasks such as link prediction and entity resolution, require the representation of multiple relations, heterogeneous and structured data. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a sub area of machine learning that induces structured hypotheses from multi-relational examples and background knowledge (BK) represented as logical clauses. With a few exceptions, most of the systems developed in ILP induce Horn-clauses and uses Prolog as their baseline inference engine. However, the recent development of efficient Answer Set Programming solvers points out that these can be a viable option to be the reasoning component of ILP systems, especially to address nonmonotonic reasoning. In this paper, we present dASBoT, a system that is capable of inducing extended normal rules mined from answer sets yielded from the examples and the BK.

In this paper, we design special code/decode scheme and evaluation function for a training model firstly; and then use genetic algorithm to optimize key parameters which represent the SVM training model. Therefore a most suitable SVM classifier can be obtained for pedestrian detection. Experiments have been carried out in a single camera based pedestrian detection system.

Such requirements grow in the case of blade shape optimization in which several analyses are needed. A fast and reliable way to mimic the CFD solutions is to use surrogate models. In this study, a machine learning technique, the support vector regression (SVR) method based on a set of CFD solutions, is used as the surrogate model. CFD solutions are calculated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equation with the k-epsilon turbulence model using a commercial solver. The support vector regression model is then trained to give a functional relationship between the spanwise twist distribution and the generated torque. The smooth twist distribution is defined using a three-node cubic spline with four parameters in total. The optimum twist is determined for two baseline blade cases: the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Phase II and Phase VI rotor blades. In the optimization process, extremum points that give the maximum torque are easily determined since the SVR gives an analytical model. Results show that it is possible to increase the torque generated by the NREL VI blade more than 10% just by redistributing the spanwise twist without carrying out a full geometry optimization of the blade shape with many shape-defining parameters.

Experiments on signal regression show that this method is comparable to or even better than the existing SVM function regression with the scalar wavelet kernel, the Gaussian kernel, and the exponential radial basis function kernel.

Finally, each support vector machine is individually trained with its own feature vector that includes the most discriminative fault features, offering the highest classification performance. In this study, the effectiveness of the proposed GA-based kernel discriminative feature analysis and the classification ability of individually trained OAA MCSVMs are addressed in terms of average classification accuracy.

While most SLAM approaches provide a geometrical representation of the scene, a semantic map is necessary for more complex interactions with the surroundings. Current methods treat the semantic map as part of the geometry which limits scalability and accuracy. We propose to represent the semantic map as a geometrical mesh and a semantic texture coupled at independent resolution. The key idea is that in many environments the geometry can be greatly simplified without loosing fidelity, while semantic information can be stored at a higher resolution, independent of the mesh. We construct a mesh from depth sensors to represent the scene geometry and fuse information into the semantic texture from segmentations of individual RGB views of the scene. Making the semantics persistent in a global mesh enables us to enforce temporal and spatial consistency of the individual view predictions. For this, we propose an efficient method of establishing consensus between individual segmentations by iteratively retraining semantic segmentation with the information stored within the map and using the retrained segmentation to re-fuse the semantics. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach by reconstructing semantic maps of scenes from NYUv2 and a scene spanning large buildings.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.07029", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11263-019-01187-z", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "journal": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952358048,2950482804", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4410104", "7665907", "2211223", "6163234", "2913088", "3429309", "22155964", "51883685", "6622200", "206597351", "119823700", "4950226", "102496818", "14547347", "121126926", "12854173", "6868780", "13307022", "206594692", "206771194", "14281310", "6298417", "8655888", "206593899", "1371704", "10385138", "4396837", "17129072", "52967509", "5696978", "6813232", "52288581", "30883922", "206852649", "3731974", "5753855", "5115938", "1745976", "6324125", "206596552", "206594095", "14329201", "27709540", "14124313", "12742386", "3525655", "49564824", "4592390", "206596482", "26638291", "73431591", "15623791", "6130946", "6544192", "16413702", "8485068", "22622013", "49558889", "5028882"], "inbound_citations": ["203566191", "211132891"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189763747"}

The selected techniques are applied to real LiDAR data from two areas in the province of Lugo (Galizia, Spain).

As acquiring audiovisual corpora is expensive and time-consuming, we designed our solution to counteract the lack of data. Firstly, we have used phonetic information (phoneme label and respective duration) as input to ensure speaker independence, and in second hand, we have experimented around pretraining strategies to reach acceptable performances. We demonstrate how a careful initialization of the last layers of the network can greatly ease the training and help to handle coarticulation effect.

Compared to widely known box-office receipts prediction with single-output in movie industry, estimating the market share and price for performing arts is still a challenging problem due to high dimensional datasets yet limited number of samples. This paper describes a data-driven decision support system to help arts managers make strategic decisions, especially on session-determination and price-setting, considering price discrimination and prediction on the corresponding sales volume. Eight different attributes from the database, with multiple labels in each attribute, are used to accurately and comprehensively represent and classify the characteristics of performing arts in each genre. A web-based influence factor is also defined to quantify the popularity and publicity of performing arts. For this multi-input and multi-output problem, support vector regression (SVR) is employed and its optimal parameters are determined using genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) respectively. Price utility axiom with the law of demand is applied to maximize the receipts. Compared to artificial neural networks (ANN), those two optimization based SVR methods perform much better, in terms of effectiveness and reliability.Copyright \u00a9 2015 by ASME", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2015-47059", "venue": "DAC 2015", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2333258249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62428051"}

However, one may wonder whether these non-trivial components are needed to formulate practical and effective hashing models. In this paper, we answer the above question by proposing an embarrassingly simple approach to binary representation learning. With a simple classification objective, our model only incorporates two additional fully-connected layers onto the top of an arbitrary backbone network, whilst complying with the binary constraints during training. The proposed model lower-bounds the Information Bottleneck (IB) between data samples and their semantics, and can be related to many recent `learning to hash' paradigms. We show that, when properly designed, even such a simple network can generate effective binary codes, by fully exploring data semantics without any held-out alternating updating steps or auxiliary models.

Our multi-task DNN approach combines tasks of multiple-domain classification (for query classification) and information retrieval (ranking for web search), and demonstrates significant gains over strong baselines in a comprehensive set of domain adaptation.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "N15-1092", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3115/v1/N15-1092", "venue": "HLT-NAACL", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2295072214", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["85205", "5555779", "11168734", "11616343", "351666", "61894598", "538820", "5291693", "15274053", "16213872", "10473972", "9215625", "2141094", "8384258", "9792203", "2040762", "7644747", "1306065", "2407601", "16447573", "7478738", "16447573", "9079100", "14992849", "26661612", "1957433", "6674407", "709066", "207218382", "990233", "629094", "52864147"], "inbound_citations": ["202661161", "202770618", "35618061", "203658251", "201669002", "3099009", "211171937", "102350676", "8365042", "12594774", "159040000", "207853069", "86680939", "4750571", "4214000", "7021843", "8497672", "1603796", "52066962", "45896762", "52304319", "54446463", "5552940", "51879056", "209436563", "203605948", "21745974", "53081246", "44101722", "53083475", "52957972", "207912298", "4325193", "52290191", "207847598", "52291676", "52052099", "207925358", "214638351", "18791593", "3912005", "7693963", "9878977", "173184849", "52115814", "630188", "32688228", "29931698", "15476643", "5756244", "214612070", "53874402", "51605770", "92130481", "16607798", "207965920", "31128405", "53104001", "44162260", "118711638", "2115702", "102352117", "7185340", "32106959", "42229133", "49584706", "52291500", "35165609", "59523594", "12871803", "201058594", "1637481", "207757700", "3391175", "196174835", "15660331", "199379317", "3400444", "9743401", "1923223", "31298398", "202577893", "53670226", "7121591", "44145233", "184487812", "41932649", "53080947", "3247793", "52011255", "477021", "54436181", "207757947", "3270903", "153312532", "203573821", "52172546", "208637516", "6655663", "203930028", "21632466", "3521542", "13811096", "12505073", "9306975", "207852771", "52012542", "25711094", "16121770", "209444743", "52076041", "150374113", "215246971", "1982031", "173990863", "15782198", "7023487", "10809507", "207852805", "8737624", "198967714", "10175374", "69993167", "4733921", "29474629", "210895480", "84846285", "189763720", "201666897", "211266585", "208310264", "202622162", "211298549", "207690211", "11565783", "5064446", "22232318", "52010695", "6954272", "3628389", "53107625", "52824259", "52985426", "6028387", "128345418", "52986176", "3876517", "204939265", "13843762", "53082905", "15442925", "212657697", "53714482", "212423462", "24164624", "3285020", "16795507", "196186678", "86384162", "197928316", "48364994", "203605264", "202896372", "52956481", "15027923", "211105080", "2085523", "3047732", "67481", "199377627", "9018933", "56480920", "52289977", "3666085", "196175699", "11185579", "14530074", "207863651", "208210478", "9921016"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11754890"}

For online fault monitoring, it is necessary to construct first a fault database that contains fuzzy rules for all possible faults in the system. Recursive least squares algorithm is used to train the network online, from which the IF-THEN rules are extracted.

Traditional statistics and the classical neural networks literature have developed many methods for discriminating between two classes of instances using linear functions, as well as methods for interpolation using linear functions. These techniques, which include both efficient iterative procedures and theoretical analysis of their generalisation properties, provide the framework within which the construction of more complex systems will be developed in the coming chapters. In this chapter we review results from the literature that will be relevant to the study of Support Vector Machines. We will first discuss algorithms and issues of classification, and then we will move on to the problem of regression. Throughout this book, we will refer to learning machines using hypotheses that form linear combinations of the input variables as linear learning machines. Importantly, we will show that in most cases such machines can be represented in a particularly useful form, which we will call the dual representation.

Thus, the consumers tend to rely a lot on product reviews before buying any products or availing their services. However, not all reviews available over internet are authentic. Spammers manipulate the reviews in their favor to either devalue or promote products. Thus, customers are influenced to take wrong decision due to these spurious reviews, i. e., spammy contents. In order to address this problem, a hybrid approach of improved binary particle swarm optimization and shuffled frog leaping algorithm are proposed to decrease high dimensionality of the feature set and to select optimized feature subsets.

This creates analytical and computational difficulties in solving MKL algorithms. To overcome this issue, we first develop a novel kernel approximation approach for MKL and then propose an efficient Low-Rank MKL (LR-MKL) algorithm by using the Low-Rank Representation (LRR). It is well-acknowledged that LRR can reduce dimension while retaining the data features under a global low-rank constraint.

One clear example is face recognition. However, SVM cannot be applied when the feature vectors defining our samples have missing entries. This is clearly the case in face recognition when occlusions are present in the training and/or testing sets. When k features are missing in a sample vector of class 1, these define an affine subspace of k dimensions. The goal of the SVM is to maximize the margin between the vectors of class 1 and class 2 on those dimensions with no missing elements and, at the same time, maximize the margin between the vectors in class 2 and the affine subspace of class 1. This second term of the SVM criterion will minimize the overlap between the classification hyperplane and the subspace of solutions in class 1, because we do not know which values in this subspace a test vector can take. The hyperplane minimizing this overlap is obviously the one parallel to the missing dimensions. However, this condition is too restrictive, because its solution will generally contradict that obtained when maximizing the margin of the visible data. To resolve this problem, we define a criterion which minimizes the probability of overlap. The resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently and we show how the global minimum of the error term is guaranteed under mild conditions.

Extreme multi-label classification is an important research problem since not only does it enable the tackling of applications with many labels but it also allows the reformulation of ranking problems with certain advantages over existing formulations. Our objective, in this paper, is to develop an extreme multi-label classifier that is faster to train and more accurate at prediction than the state-of-the-art Multi-label Random Forest (MLRF) algorithm [2] and the Label Partitioning for Sub-linear Ranking (LPSR) algorithm [35]. MLRF and LPSR learn a hierarchy to deal with the large number of labels but optimize task independent measures, such as the Gini index or clustering error, in order to learn the hierarchy. Our proposed FastXML algorithm achieves significantly higher accuracies by directly optimizing an nDCG based ranking loss function. We also develop an alternating minimization algorithm for efficiently optimizing the proposed formulation.

A two-stage architecture is proposed to improve its prediction accuracy and generalization performance for gas concentration forecasting. In the first stage, KPCA is adopted to extract features and obtain kernel principal components, so the correlation space of gas concentration is reconstructed according to the accumulative contribution ratio. Then, in the second stage, support vector regression (SVR) is employed for forecasting gas concentration, which hyperparameters are selected by adaptive chaotic cultural algorithm (ACCA).

For the discrimination of urban materials, hyperspectral imaging proved a valuable tool. In this study, two methods for classification, Spectral Angle Mapper and Support Vector Machines, are compared on a hyperspectral dataset to derive a detailed map of roof materials. Spectral similarity of different materials, especially with low reflectance and no distinct absorption features can complicate the classification process. Therefore, hyperspectral data were supplemented with laser scanning data to not only discriminate roof from ground data but also to use roof inclination to distinguish roof spectra. A binary roof mask from a laser scanning dataset was used to restrict the classification to roofs only. After testing the two classifiers on this reduced dataset, the approach was extended by incorporating inclination information in the classification process. Comparison between the classified images is done visually and quantitatively using confusion matrices. It can be shown that both classifiers are suitable for the classification of roof materials with the Spectral Angle Mapper results yielding higher classification accuracies than Support Vector Machines.

Community detection is an important challenge in network analysis. We approach community detection based on a Shared-Influence-Neighbor (SIN) similarity metric that measures the closeness of a pair of nodes in terms of their mutual influence and the common set of nodes they both influence. In this paper, we present two novel influence-guided label propagation (IGLP) algorithms. One is called IGLP-Weighted-Ensemble (IGLP-WE), in which each node adopts the label of the majority of its neighbors, weighted by the SIN similarity. This simple weighting scheme effectively resolves the significant stability issue in conventional label propagation algorithms. The other is called IGLP-Direct-Passing (IGLP-DP), in which the label is propagated directly from one node to its most similar neighbor step by step. This new label propagation method produces a deterministic partition and requires no convergent iterations. For both IGLP-WE and IGLP-DP, we regard the resultant partitioning as the initial configuration of the community structure. We then perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering to uncover the hierarchical communities at different scales using a new cluster-proximity measure. Extensive tests on a set of real-life networks and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of our algorithms in terms of both quality and efficiency in undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted networks.

Soon, during the 1960s, there were attempts to separate applications from basic theoretical research. Since this theoretical research encounters difficulties regarding its status as a separate discipline, and considering the constraints necessary to clarify the concept of \u2018good application\u2019, impossible to satisfy simultaneously (a real problem to solve, in response to a social demand, and a viable solution in terms of reliability, robustness, speed and cost), two main streams have emerged. The first one, as a computer technique, is intended to build applications based on a strict logic, using natural language to facilitate interaction with the computer, but not directly related to the human way of using language (this approach is designated as natural language processing). Such pragmatic research accepts certain kinds of errors, but must lead to concrete results in limited time. The goal is to provide effective systems for real applications, able to respond effectively to requests addressed to them in fairly large areas; these systems are directly related to social and industrial productivity, which is the essential criterion of evaluation. Some technological developments, such as microcomputers, have made available to people specific applications of natural language processing and have enabled the emergence of small specialized firms. This produced, in the second half of the 1980s, the emergence of a \u2018language industry\u2019 and of the field of \u2018linguistic engineering\u2019. On the other hand, during the late 1960s, the gap between the social demand, the resources invested and the poor performance obtained led to the emergence of theoretical studies intended to formalize languages (as opposed to the more empirical machine translation). This leads to \u2018pilot systems\u2019, aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of complex theoretical approaches, but unable to operate outside a set of rather limited examples. The limits may be at different levels: more or less limited vocabulary or accepted sentences, knowledge about the field more or less complete, more or less developed reasoning and so on. These limits have a significant impact on communication itself. For natural language processing systems to be effective, they must make appropriate inferences from what is said and, conversely their behavior should allow the inferences that the users usually do when using their language. Thus, this position paper stresses that understanding the surface meaning of a natural language is not sufficient but that the goals, intentions and strategies of the participants in a dialogue must be understood.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/comjnl/bxq060", "venue": "Comput.

Next, model inputs variables are optimized using genetic algorithms (GAs) with a view to maximize the performance of catalyst. Moreover, the SVR model is employed as an approximate model for fitness function in SVR-GA architecture. The SVR-GA is a novel strategy for heterogeneous catalysis modeling and optimization.

In this research, a new industrial acoustic dataset has been created by gathering the audio data obtained from a number of videos of industrial processes, recorded in factories involving industrial tools and processes. Due to the fact that the anomalous events in real life are rather rare and the creation of these events is highly costly, anomaly event sounds are superimposed to regular factory soundscape by using different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values. To show the effectiveness of the proposed system, the performances of the feature extraction and the AAD are evaluated. The comparison has been made between CAE, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), and a hybrid approach of them (CAE-OCSVM) under various SNRs for different anomaly and process sounds.

Due to its vast practical applications and financial implications, handwritten character recognition is still an important research area. In this research, the Handwritten Ethiopian Character Recognition (HECR) dataset has been prepared to train the model. The images in the HECR dataset were organized with more than one color pen RGB main spaces that have been size normalized to 28 \u00d7 28 pixels. The dataset is a combination of scripts (Fidel in Ethiopia), numerical representations, punctuations, tonal symbols, combining symbols, and special characters. These scripts have been used to write ancient histories, science, and arts of Ethiopia and Eritrea. In this study, a hybrid model of two super classifiers: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is proposed for classification. In this integrated model, CNN works as a trainable automatic feature extractor from the raw images and XGBoost takes the extracted features as an input for recognition and classification. The output error rates of the hybrid model and CNN with a fully connected layer are compared. A 0.4630 and 0.1612 error rates are achieved in classifying the handwritten testing dataset images, respectively. Thus XGBoost as a classifier performs a better result than the traditional fully connected layer.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960161", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2995579872", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9329224", "15782139", "202677248", "4650265", "20484716", "24051800", "139095972", "46912989", "54810325", "15046312", "55120845", "5800492", "9433631", "10077891", "30051715", "124262345", "86424418", "20810472", "22836442", "4659176", "52011140", "5439826"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209898367"}

This research is aimed at finding the most relevant features in prediction of cysteines oxidation states and the disulfide bonds connectivity of proteins. Models predicting the oxidation states of cysteines are developed with machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Associative Neural Networks (ASNNs). A record high prediction accuracy of oxidation state, 95%, is achieved by incorporating the oxidation states of N-terminus cysteines, flanking sequences of cysteines and global information on the protein chain (number of cysteines, length of the chain and amino acids composition of the chain etc.) into the SVM encoding. This is 5% higher than the current methods. This indicates to us that the oxidation states of amino terminal cysteines infer the oxidation states of other cysteines in the same protein chain. Satisfactory prediction results are also obtained with the newer and more inclusive SPX dataset, especially for chains with higher number of cysteines. Compared to literature methods, our approach is a one-step prediction system, which is easier to implement and use. A side by side comparison of SVM and ASNN is conducted. Results indicated that SVM outperform ASNN on this particular problem. ::: For the prediction of correct pairings of cysteines to form disulfide bonds, we first study disulfide connectivity by calculating the local interaction potentials between the flanking sequences of the cysteine pairs. The obtained interaction potential is further adjusted by the coefficients related to the binding motif of enzymes during disulfide formation and also by the linear distance between the cysteine pairs. Finally, maximized weight matching algorithm is applied and performance of the interaction potentials evaluated. Overall prediction accuracy is unsatisfactory compared with the literature. ::: SVM is used to predict the disulfide connectivity with the assumption that oxidation states of cysteines on the protein are known. Information on binding region during disulfide formation, distance between cysteine pairs, global information of the protein chain and the flanking sequences around the cysteine pairs are included in the SVM encoding. Prediction results illustrate the advantage of using possible anchor region information. ::: INDEX WORDS: cysteines, oxidation states, connectivity, disulphide bonds, support vector machine (SVM), Associative neural network (ASNN).", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "61092184", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91502554"}

However, in practice, we often have limited data on the true predictive task of interest, and must instead rely on more abundant data on a closely-related proxy predictive task. For example, e-commerce platforms use abundant customer click data (proxy) to make product recommendations rather than the relatively sparse customer purchase data (true outcome of interest); alternatively, hospitals often rely on medical risk scores trained on a different patient population (proxy) rather than their own patient population (true cohort of interest) to assign interventions. Yet, not accounting for the bias in the proxy can lead to sub-optimal decisions. Using real datasets, we find that this bias can often be captured by a sparse function of the features. Thus, we propose a novel two-step estimator that uses techniques from high-dimensional statistics to efficiently combine a large amount of proxy data and a small amount of true data. We prove upper bounds on the error of our proposed estimator and lower bounds on several heuristics used by data scientists; in particular, our proposed estimator can achieve the same accuracy with exponentially less true data (in the number of features). Our proof relies on a new LASSO tail inequality for approximately sparse vectors. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on e-commerce and healthcare datasets; in both cases, we achieve significantly better predictive accuracy as well as managerial insights into the nature of the bias in the proxy data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1812.11097", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Machine Learning", "mag_id": "2997540247", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210180248"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209492891"}

Connectionist models may have greater potential for providing developmental accounts, but the architectures that have been most widely used to account for developmental phenomena cannot perform one-trial learning and this has limited their use as models of human memory. We show that a connectionist-like architecture can learn, using a gradient-descent algorithm, to perform single-trial learning in a similar manner to convolution. The solution that the network finds leads to less variable retrieval than does convolution. Furthermore, the network can learn to carry out the convolution operation itself.

Mapping croplands, including fallow areas, is an important measure to determine the quantity of food that is produced, where it is produced, and when it is produced (which season).

However, mapping cropland extent at finer (e.g., 30-m or finer) spatial resolution over very large areas such as continental, and global extent is challenging. This study developed a precise Landsat 30-m cropland extent map and calculated cropland areas of the Australian continent for the nominal year 2015 using a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm (MLA) through Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The process involved the use of 8 bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, temp, NDVI and NDWI) of Landsat-8 every 16-day data for the years 2014 and 2015. Each band was a composited over 2-4 time-period using mean value compositing. Overall, there was a 48-layer data-cube on which we generated knowledge of croplands versus non-croplands, coded the knowledge into RF MLA and run on the GEE cloud to obtain cropland extent for all of Australia.

The hybrid model includes a model of social dialogue moves, which it uses to selectively bias word recognition probabilities at a low level in the neu- ral speech recognition system. The model demonstrates how symbolic and neurologically inspired components can success- fully exchange information and mutually influence their pro- cessing. Furthermore, the biasing mechanism is grounded in brain mechanisms of perceptual decision making. Keywords: Speech Recognition; Liquid State Machine; Dia- logue Context; Top-Down Bias; Signal-to-Token Conversion Introduction Human cognition comprises high-level knowledge-based pro- cesses as well as low-level perceptual and motor processes, both of which are implemented via electro-chemical mecha- nisms in the brain. High-level cognitive processes are often viewed as symbolic and discrete, while low-level perceptual and motor processes are subsymbolic and continuous. More- over, high-level processes are taken to operate on structured representations, while low-level processes will usually not be representational at all. Two key challenges in cognitive science are thus to understand (1) how high-level processes are realized in \u201cneural hardware\u201d and (2) how they can in- teract with low-level processes (e.g., how discrete symbolic knowledge can influence continuous subsymbolic processes and vice versa). We will focus on the second challenge in this paper. Connectionist computational modeling has made signif- icant progress in addressing (1) over the years, producing more and more refined neurologically plausible models of cognitive functions which are verified physiologically (e.g. (Machens, Romo, & Brody, 2005)). However, fewer efforts have been made to address (2). Only recently, hierarchical Bayesian models have been proposed as a natural, systematic way to connect higher-level to lower-level processes (Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2008). Similar to the Bayesian approach, our goal is to understand the interactions between these two types of processes which operate at fundamentally different levels. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling often focuses on the \u201ccomputational level\u201d (Marr, 1982), showing how higher- level processes can influence lower levels (e.g., by showing how distributions of higher-level structures constrain distribu- tions of lower-level items). In contrast, our approach attempts to address all three levels and their mutual interactions. This is because these levels cannot be considered in complete iso- lation in cases where higher-level processes have to interact with lower-level processes in real-time contexts with real- world inputs. Specifically, we claim that the nature and time- course of low-level processes imposes significant constraints on the possible ways of exchanging information with higher- level processes. Low-level processes will limit the types of computations that are allowed in higher-level processes that communicate with them, since they may have stringent tim- ing requirements and will not wait for a computation to finish with a result. Proposals that do not incorporate those con- straints might result in models that produce correct results under some empirical regimes, but which are infeasible given implemenation constraints. For example, a hierarchical Bayesian model of natural language processing might be able to show that high-level knowledge about grammar can successfully bias low-level speech processing, but whether that particular computational way of biasing is actually feasible and realistic in humans can only be determined by taking algorithmic and implementa- tion constraints into account. These constraints include time bounds caused by the incremental nature of the speech pro- cessor. In this case the high-level computation can not expect to have access to a whole utterance before it starts biasing, since by that point the speech processor will already have ad- vanced past the point where it is useful. Thus, although there are many ways in which higher levels could influence lower levels at the computational level, most of them are not re- alized in humans because of implementation or algorithmic constraints. This paper makes three contributions: first, we will present a general way of integrating high-level processes operating on structured symbolic knowledge with low-level neural pro-", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2402436611", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16083770", "1799293", "9521648", "2164151", "5792850", "4798373", "4430950", "38376601", "474354", "45378154", "124937374", "18473066", "5931840", "60791882"], "inbound_citations": ["2520927", "1564678"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2968402"}

In addition to performing straightforward dictionary attacks, these tools can expand password dictionaries using password generation rules, such as concatenation of words (e.g., \"password123456\") and leet speak (e.g., \"password\" becomes \"p4s5w0rd\"). Although these rules work well in practice, expanding them to model further passwords is a laborious task that requires specialized expertise. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce PassGAN, a novel approach that replaces human-generated password rules with theory-grounded machine learning algorithms. Instead of relying on manual password analysis, PassGAN uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to autonomously learn the distribution of real passwords from actual password leaks, and to generate high-quality password guesses. Our experiments show that this approach is very promising. When we evaluated PassGAN on two large password datasets, we were able to surpass rule-based and state-of-the-art machine learning password guessing tools. However, in contrast with the other tools, PassGAN achieved this result without any a-priori knowledge on passwords or common password structures. Additionally, when we combined the output of PassGAN with the output of HashCat, we were able to match 51%-73% more passwords than with HashCat alone. This is remarkable, because it shows that PassGAN can autonomously extract a considerable number of password properties that current state-of-the art rules do not encode.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1709.00440", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-21568-2_11", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2751688886,2949800886,2963532563", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["207241585", "13943041", "14757739", "9957731", "89141", "18569962", "207599948", "5002792", "351666", "16234956", "12554454", "1282515", "59605920", "3727579", "3716469", "110359062", "17558010", "207229839", "1033682", "1697424", "206741496", "10894094", "3052834", "21293818", "5051282", "2156336", "8239952", "6628106", "12529428", "7027066", "2542741", "41312633", "7625356", "17707860", "745330", "17434130", "2320797", "12803511", "15238391", "207656012", "12986753", "14432549", "17362994", "7004303", "2672720", "31567403", "11758569", "195652429", "64543020", "20714", "10488675", "16545411", "8843166", "2814088", "3350443", "2984526", "10892926", "13583585", "213431", "1277217", "14257320", "6730566"], "inbound_citations": ["49419405", "54445848", "207831645", "172136264", "214594690", "211685836", "44233250", "160017949", "210908152", "54462738", "19087488", "198968127", "49416214", "211056673", "207957202", "90262646", "132770356", "145048453", "212699348", "58010985", "209457465", "51880782", "211041390", "207812455", "52301682", "203655343"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3855165"}

The characteristic wavelengths were respectively selected by Bootstrapping Soft Shrinkage (BOSS), Variable Iterative Space Shrinkage Approach (VISSA) and Model Adaptive Space Shrinkage (MASS) algorithms. Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to establishing the relationship between the characteristic peaks, the full spectra, three characteristic spectra and the labels of tea grades. The results showed that VISSA-SVM model had the best classification performance, but the model precision can still be improved. Thus, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm was introduced to optimize the parameters of SVM model. The accuracy and Kappa coefficient of test set of VISSA-ABC-SVM model were improved to 97.436% and 0.962, respectively. Therefore, the combination of fluorescence hyperspectra with VISSA-ABC-SVM model can accurately identify the grade of Tieguanyin tea. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The rapid and accurate nondestructive tea grade identification method contributes to the construction of the tea online grade detection system. FHSI technology can solve the shortcomings of the reported methods and improved the identification accuracy of tea grades. It can be applied to the rapid detection of tea quality by tea companies, tea market, tea farmers and other demanders.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31313313", "doi": "10.1111/1750-3841.14706", "venue": "Journal of food science", "journal": "Journal of food science", "mag_id": "2956368841", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197422094"}

This paper presents a logistic discriminant metric learning method for this challenging problem. Different with most existing metric learning algorithms, it exploits both original data and auxiliary data during training, which is motivated by the new machine learning paradigm-learning using privileged information. Such privileged information is a kind of auxiliary knowledge, which is only available during training. Our goal is to learn an optimal distance function by constructing a locally adaptive decision rule with the help of privileged information. We jointly learn two distance metrics by minimizing the empirical loss penalizing the difference between the distance in the original space and that in the privileged space. In our setting, the distance in the privileged space functions as a local decision threshold, which guides the decision making in the original space like a teacher. The metric learned from the original space is used to compute the distance between a probe image and a gallery image during testing. In addition, we extend the proposed approach to a multi-view setting which is able to explore the complementation of multiple feature representations. In the multi-view setting, multiple metrics corresponding to different original features are jointly learned, guided by the same privileged information. Besides, an effective iterative optimization scheme is introduced to simultaneously optimize the metrics and the assigned metric weights. Experiment results on several widely-used data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to global decision threshold-based methods and outperforms most state-of-the-art results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29757732", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2017.2765836", "venue": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "journal": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204837533", "208879626", "73516403", "53091764", "58666662", "208109823", "127308432", "215722888", "173992221", "202699290", "58673480", "52019590", "201666140", "197928478", "69527867", "52927586", "195848681", "204837592"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195667009"}

We demonstrate that SVR model for buildup factor determination can be applied as a fast engineering tool, replacing more traditional approaches based on semi-empirical formulas. More important is the fact that using general regression model like SVR in conjunction with machine learning methodology for the development and evaluation of learned models, provides a general approach for replacing complex simulation models. Therefore, we attempt to summarize research activities in a set of guidelines and procedures for performing an optimized search for the SVR model, for similar types of physical problems.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2286331267", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111509631"}
