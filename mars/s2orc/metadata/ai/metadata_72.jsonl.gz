In addition to inter turn short detection, the other faults like open, short, phase to phase faults and DC volt-age faults are detected through wavelet transforms and k means clustering. Open and short faults are classified using artificial neural network. All other faults are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Switched reluctance motors are very popular in these days, because of ease in manufacturing and operation. Though an electronic circuit can detect the faults like open and short, the classification cannot be done effectively with electronic circuitry. More over an intelligent method can easily identify the fault and classify and hence the root cause of the fault may be guessed and rectified using this method of classification. This is highly possible with the time localization property of the wavelet transforms. So instant of fault occurrence can be detected along with the type of fault. The information used to include this intelligence in the system are just current waveforms, flux waveforms and torque waveforms.

For example, Least-Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) offer an attractive way of estimating LPV models directly from data without requiring from the user to specify the functional dependencies of the model coefficients on the scheduling variable. These methods have also been recently extended in order to automatically determine the model order directly from data by the help of regularization. Nonetheless, despite all these recent improvements, LPV identification methods still require some strong a priori such as i) the dependencies are static or dynamic, ii) it is known which variables are considered to be the scheduling or iii) all coefficient functions of the underlaying system depend on all scheduling variables. This prevents the complexity of the scheduling dependency of the model to be shrunk gradually and independently until an optimal bias-variance trade off is found. In this paper, a novel reformulation of the LPV LS-SVM approach is proposed which, besides of the non-parametric estimation of the coefficient functions, achieves data-driven coefficient complexity selection via convex optimization.

While many advancements have been made, there is room for continued improvements. One hurdle is that CT images can exhibit high noise and low contrast, particularly in lower dosages. To address this, we focus on a preprocessing method for CT images that uses stacked generative adversarial networks (SGAN) approach. The first GAN reduces the noise in the CT image and the second GAN generates a higher resolution image with enhanced boundaries and high contrast. To make up for the absence of high quality CT images, we detail how to synthesize a large number of low- and high-quality natural images and use transfer learning with progressively larger amounts of CT images. We apply both the classic GrabCut method and the modern holistically nested network (HNN) to lesion segmentation, testing whether SGAN can yield improved lesion segmentation.

There has been no work found to reduce the number of parameters used in GANs. Therefore, we propose a method to compress GANs using knowledge distillation techniques, in which a smaller \"student\" GAN learns to mimic a larger \"teacher\" GAN. We show that the distillation methods used on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Celeb-A datasets can compress teacher GANs at ratios of 1669:1, 58:1, and 87:1, respectively, while retaining the quality of the generated image. From our experiments, we observe a qualitative limit for GAN's compression. Moreover, we observe that, with a fixed parameter budget, compressed GANs outperform GANs trained using standard training methods. We conjecture that this is partially owing to the optimization landscape of over-parameterized GANs which allows efficient training using alternating gradient descent.

With use of the optimal adaptation path, the optimal video quality picking strategy, a ML algorithm is trained and learns to behave in similar optimal fashion. ::: The first contribution of this work is the modification of an existing optimization formulation with the goal of determining the Pareto frontier for QoE aware adaptation algorithms. This formulation allows to evaluate with an aggressiveness switching parameter \u03b1 the trade-off between average quality and quality switching in the video playout. The results of this evaluation lead to a modified version of a two-step optimization problem formulation with an allowable maximum quality level degradation parameter e while minimizing the number of quality switches. ::: Given a video and a data-rate histogram, the optimization outputs the optimal adaptation path. The optimal adaptation path is the optimal quality level picking strategy at each decision instance in time. The optimal decisions are used as input for training a ML algorithm. These supervised trained ML algorithms consist of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a k-Nearest-Neighbors approach. ::: The best performing learning technique, in terms of learning accuracy, is then used as an adaptation logic in a HAS scenario simulated through a Discrete Event Simulation (DES). The performance is evaluated through user-centric evaluation metrics gathered from the DES. These metrics are the average playout quality, the quality switching frequency, the stalling-frequency and -ratio and the buffer level throughout the video playout. The HASBRAIN algorithm's performance is furthermore compared with the performance of well-known threshold-based adaptation algorithms TRDA and KLUDCP within the same evaluation scenario. The ML's adaptation performance behavior allows it to reach a similar average playout quality than the other algorithms while reducing the number of quality switches.

Traditionally different scoring methods, ranging from simple heuristic models to probabilistic models, have been used for this task. Recently researchers have started to use supervised machine learning techniques for solving this problem which is then called the learning-to-rank (LtR) problem. Many supervised learning methods have been tested so far with empirical success over conventional methods [4] The random forest is a relatively simple but effective and efficient learning algorithm which aggregates the predictions of a large number of independent and variant base learners, namely decision trees. Its major benefits over other state-of-the-art methods include inherent parallelizability, ease of tuning and competitive performance. These benefits attract researchers across various disciplines where a random forest is a very popular choice. However, for LtR task, the random forest has not been thoroughly investigated. In this research, we investigate the random forest based LtR algorithms. We aim at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and understanding of these algorithms. With respect to the first goal, we employ undersampling techniques and leverage the inherent structure of a random forest to achieve better scalability, especially for highly imbalanced datasets [2]. We also reduce the correlation among the trees to reduce learning time and to improve performance [3]. With respect to the second goal, we investigate various objective functions ranging from completely randomized splitting criterion to so-called listwise splitting [1]. We also conduct a thorough study on random forest based pointwise algorithms. With respect to the third goal, we develop methods for estimating the bias and variance of rank-learning algorithms, and examine their empirical behavior against parameters of the learning algorithm", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3130332.3130346", "venue": "SIGF", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2740912294", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8615969", "43855102", "73724958"], "inbound_citations": ["13855297"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8061530"}

Studies on EHR data have enabled real world applications like understanding of disease progression, outcomes analysis, and comparative effectiveness research. However, often every study is independently commissioned, data is gathered by surveys or specifically purchased per study by a long and often painful process. This is followed by an arduous repetitive cycle of analysis, model building, and generation of insights. This process can take anywhere between 1 - 3 years. In this paper, we present a robust end-to-end machine learning based SaaS system to perform analysis on a very large EHR dataset. The framework consists of a proprietary EHR datamart spanning ~55 million patient lives in USA and over ~20 billion data points. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the largest in the industry to analyze medical records at this scale, with such efficacy and ease. We developed an end-to-end ML framework with carefully chosen components to support EHR analysis at scale and suitable for further downstream clinical analysis. Specifically, it consists of a ridge regularized Survival Support Vector Machine (SSVM) with a clinical kernel, coupled with Chi-square distance-based feature selection, to uncover relevant risk factors by exploiting the weak correlations in EHR. Our results on multiple real use cases indicate that the framework identifies relevant factors effectively without expert supervision. The framework is stable, generalizable over outcomes, and also found to contribute to better out-of-bound prediction over known expert features. Importantly, the ML methodologies used are interpretable which is critical for acceptance of our system in the targeted user base.

For RBDO, the Sequential Optimization and Reliability Assessment (SORA) is employed as well, which decouples deterministic optimization from the reliability analysis. The improved SVM-based reliability analysis is used to amend the error from linear approximation for limit-state function in SORA. A mathematical example and a simplified aircraft wing design demonstrate that the improved SVM-based reliability analysis is more accurate than FORM and needs less training points than the Monte Carlo simulation and that the proposed optimization strategy is efficient.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2015/569016", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1614663146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["5234241", "62429843", "119496005", "120233608", "123608472", "123769069", "6809761", "55158159", "120001120", "120464972", "7138354", "121019091", "206108600", "15466123", "189903614", "62210455", "62436322", "62065543", "119994384", "195642969", "984304", "60486887", "118676835", "119733347", "36516283", "172129638", "106867375"], "inbound_citations": ["18481665", "57497642", "133898670", "150120136", "126386859"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54727773"}

Support vector machine (SVM) based classification gives a promising approach for fault diagnostics of electric transformers. But the standard method for N-class SVMs (there are many types of electrical transformer fault) doesn't present an easy solution. The constructing N-class SVMs are still an unsolved research problem. In this paper, we apply a new learning architecture (the Decision Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine, DDAGSVM) in electric transformer fault diagnosis and try to obtain good results. The DDAGSVM operates in a kernel-induced feature space and uses two-class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision node of the DDAG.

In this study, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to identify appropriate biomarkers for predicting Breast Cancer, from routine consultation and blood analysis data, which can subsequently help in the process of early diagnosis of the disease. It was observed during experimental study, that Resistin, Leptin, Glucose, BMI and Age of the patients, can be used for the purpose of automatic breast cancer prediction. In this paper, Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (BCCD) has been considered for performing experimentations. The GA-selected patient-attributes were subsequently utilized, by a number of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, to learn a prediction model for the disease.

However, due to the large amount of data flowing over the network, effective real time intrusion detection is almost impossible. The goal of this paper is to design a Hybrid IDS (HIDS) that can be successfully employed in a real time manner and suitable for resolving the multi-class classification problem. HIDS relies on a Naive Base feature selection (NBFS) technique, which is used to reduce the dimensionality of sample data. Moreover, HIDS has another pioneering issue that other techniques do not have, which is the outlier rejection. Outliers are noisy input samples that can lead to high rate of misclassification if they are applied for model training. Rejecting outliers has been accomplished through applying a distance based methodology to choose the most informative training examples, which are then used to train an Optimized Support Vector Machines (OSVM). Afterward, OSVM is employed for rejecting outliers. Finally, after outlier rejection, HIDS can successfully detect attacks through applying a Prioritized K-Nearest Neighbors (PKNN) classifier. Hence, HIDS is a triple edged strategy as it has three main contributions, which are: (i) NBFS, which has been employed for dimensionality reduction, (ii) OSVM, which is applied for outlier rejection, and (iii) PKNN, which is used for detecting input attacks. HIDS has been compared against recent techniques using three well-known intrusion detection datasets: KDD Cup \u201999, NSL-KDD and Kyoto 2006+ datasets. HIDS has the ability to quickly detect attacks and accordingly can be employed for real time intrusion detection. Thanks to OSVM and PKNN, HIDS performed high detection rates specifically for the attacks which are rare such as R2L and U2R. PKNN is also suitable for resolving the multi-label classification problem.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10462-017-9567-1", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence Review", "journal": "Artificial Intelligence Review", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2726872669", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17269127", "60677933", "206989002", "13986641", "12559974", "17772052", "2443126", "7367791", "6628916", "39174364", "32148709", "1607600", "62195333", "122082528", "27945040", "3431133", "26183137", "14455772", "9245407", "114168501", "2430214", "36119068", "5322427", "1506043"], "inbound_citations": ["59603061", "202641393", "54434778", "198647921", "199005454", "199583083"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5171985"}

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) coupled with satellite images and sensor information have been proven to aid in the prediction of forest fires ::: and the extent of burnt areas. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides an active fire product in the form of spatial hotspots using an enhanced Collection 6 algorithm since 2015, which basically consists of active fires. This study proposes a one-class SVM based approach to identify the hotspots that are more likely to be a part of large forest fires. For this, Hotspots in Portugal in the time period 2000-2016 were analysed. 38 known large forest fire events across Portugal were used to train the VM model. As expected, it was observed that these forest fires generally occurred in spatio-temporal clusters when compared to the overall hotspot population. The input parameters for the model were based on spatial and temporal clustering behaviour of the hotspots, external factors such as land cover, temperature, elevation etc. and attributes from the Collection 6 data such as latitude, fire detection confidence, fire radiative power and brightness temperatures. Leave-one-out cross-validation and hold-out validation techniques were used to validate the model. As a result, 79.8 % of the overall hotspots from 2000 to 2017 were classified as \"true\" forest fires. These \"true\" detections were analysed over time. This led to the identification of other forest fire events that were not included in the training or the test dataset for the model. The results also showed that the model was more sensitive to land cover, temperature, FRP and cluster parameters when compared to other parameters. This proves that the model is responsive to active fires occurring on forest areas and also to spatio- emporal clustering. It is assumed that this approach could be successfully adapted to other study areas as there are no study area dependent input parameters used, except for the latitude, which needs to be taken into consideration. The model can be extended by using other input parameters such as humidity, slope etc. In addition, assigning higher weightage to the more influential parameters such as land cover and spatio-temporal clustering could lead to better results.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2781405430", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134069579"}

To date, most existing methods for representation learning primarily focus on networks with simplex labels, yet real-world objects (nodes) are inherently complex in nature and often contain rich semantics or labels, e.g., a user may belong to diverse interest groups of a social network, resulting in multi-label networks for many applications. The multi-label network nodes not only have multiple labels for each node, such labels are often highly correlated making existing methods ineffective or fail to handle such correlation for node representation learning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label graph convolutional network (ML-GCN) for learning node representation for multi-label networks. To fully explore label-label correlation and network topology structures, we propose to model a multi-label network as two Siamese GCNs: a node-node-label graph and a label-label-node graph. The two GCNs each handle one aspect of representation learning for nodes and labels, respectively, and they are seamlessly integrated under one objective function. The learned label representations can effectively preserve the inner-label interaction and node label properties, and are then aggregated to enhance the node representation learning under a unified training framework.

For the nonlinear problem in forecasting precipitation time series, a hybrid prediction model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) coupled with extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to reduce the difficulty in modeling monthly precipitation forecasting and improve the prediction accuracy. The monthly precipitation data in the past 60 years from Yan\u2019an City and Huashan Mountain, Shaanxi Province, are used as cases to test this new hybrid model. First, the nonstationary monthly precipitation time series are decomposed into several relatively stable intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using VMD.

In this paper, the problem of wireless VR resource management is investigated for a wireless VR network in which VR contents are sent by a cloud to cellular small base stations (SBSs). The SBSs will collect tracking data from the VR users, over the uplink, in order to generate the VR content and transmit it to the end-users using downlink cellular links. For this model, the data requested or transmitted by the users can exhibit correlation, since the VR users may engage in the same immersive virtual environment with different locations and orientations. As such, the proposed resource management framework can factor in such spatial data correlation, so as to better manage uplink and downlink traffic. This potential spatial data correlation can be factored into the resource allocation problem to reduce the traffic load in both uplink and downlink. In the downlink, the cloud can transmit 360 \u2022 contents or specific visible contents (e.g., user field of view) that are extracted from the original 360 \u2022 contents to the users according to the users' data correlation so as to reduce the backhaul traffic load. In the uplink, each SBS can associate with the users that have similar tracking information so as to reduce the tracking data size. This data correlation-aware resource management problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' successful transmission probability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies an instantaneous VR delay target. To solve this problem, a machine learning algorithm that uses echo state networks (ESNs) with transfer learning is introduced. By smartly transferring information on the SBS's utility, the proposed transfer-based ESN algorithm can quickly cope with changes in the wireless networking environment due to users' content requests and content request distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed algorithm achieves up to 15.8% and 29.4% gains in terms of successful transmission probability compared to Q-learning with data correlation and Q-learning without data correlation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1902.05181", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2900624", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2966383632,2953290894,2914403288", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["2701799", "6865405", "40438527", "20247713", "9698308", "24596784", "2600739", "4566356", "24463449", "13748019", "4737443", "44657737", "740063", "26853250", "46949212", "45560410", "128239332", "1513960", "23985036", "15142608", "7479159", "1730595", "6151991", "21659631", "11508732", "49728640", "3291894", "13673880"], "inbound_citations": ["195767238", "209382660", "212647151", "214743131", "152282873"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61153358"}

In fact, this study addresses questions of how to allocate scarce water to different consumers, in order to achieve the highest efficiency and economic benefits. To gain this goal, the existing agricultural activities in each irrigation network were simulated by applying the Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) economic model and then by coupling the economic model with a water allocation planning model of the basin (MODSIM), the hydro-economic framework was generated. These tools helped to allocate water based on its economic value, maximize net profit by determining the optimal cultivating area and analyze the effects of various allocation scenarios on employment, economic productivity, and reliability indicators. Moreover, Bayesian Networks and Random Forest algorithms were developed as an automated substitute to simplify the process and reduce computational complexity.

In current prediction research on lncRNA-disease associations, correlation analysis of disease prognosis is overlooked. In this study, a logistic regression prediction model based on tumor clinical stage data and the expression quantity of lncRNA transcript is constructed. The proposed model is based on unknown human lncRNA-disease associations combining with the clinical stage data. Firstly, the importance of the characteristic variable is calculated by the proposed CVSgC-RF algorithm. Secondly, 95 lncRNAs, which are most closely related to prostate cancer, are calculated from 480 alternative lncRNAs by CASO and CVSe-CS-CF. On the basis of the above 95 lncRNAs, the CSPA-PL algorithm is used to select a further 22 lncRNAs that are most closely related to the tumor clinical stage for prostate cancer. Finally, 22 lncRNAs are used to construct a logistic regression prediction model. Additionally, this method is applied to lung cancer data; 16 lncRNAs are selected to construct a logistic regression prediction model for lung cancer.

In this paper, the classification of RapidEye imagery with balanced and imbalanced training data for mapping the crop types was addressed. Classification with imbalanced training data may result in low accuracy in some scenarios. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifications were implemented here to classify the data. For evaluating the influence of the balanced and imbalanced training data on image classification algorithms, three different training datasets were created. Two different balanced datasets which have 70 and 100 pixels for each class of interest and one imbalanced dataset in which each class has different number of pixels were used in classification stage. Results demonstrate that ML and NN classifications are affected by imbalanced training data in resulting a reduction in accuracy (from 90.94% to 85.94% for ML and from 91.56% to 88.44% for NN) while SVM is not affected significantly (from 94.38% to 94.69%) and slightly improved.

Therefore, apart from improving access to the databases and the world wide web, it is becoming increasingly important to help researchers in the process of forming, evaluating and revising their scientific models. ::: The thesis describes a new framework, implemented as a tool called JustAid, that successfully integrates techniques from Knowledge Acquisition and Machine Learning in a way that complements their strengths to overcome their weaknesses, and provides an interactive environment to help researchers in a process of scientific discovery. JustAid can use information stored in medical databases and assist experimental scientists in forming, testing and revising scientific models (without a need of a knowledge engineer). The thesis argues that the important task facing knowledge acquisition research is not to devise tools to acquire knowledge from people, but to devise tools to assist people acquire, manage and integrate knowledge for themselves. In the light of research work in situated cognition, the thesis argues that a new generation of knowledge-based systems must support the incremental model building process, by allowing an expert to build, test and modify the current model on an on-going basis. The thesis argues that the problems faced in revising the model are similar to those faced by incremental learning systems, and shows how an Inductive Logic Programming framework can be used for this task. Difficulties involved in using the existing incremental learning techniques are discussed, followed by the introduction of a new incremental learning technique that can learn Horn-clause logic programs from observations that are not in Horn-clause form. JustAid provides an intuitive and easy to use graphical user interface that allows an expert to build and revise models using domain dependent constructs (causal relationships). This eliminates any need of a knowledge engineer.

The out come of this research will assist people in diagnosing problems, such as in plant diseases, health, industrial and etc. While the previous works have extracted causality knowledge within only one or two adjacent EDUs (Elementary Discourse Units), this research focuses to mine causality knowledge existing within multiple EDUs which takes multiple causes and multiple effects in to consideration, where the adjacency between cause and effect is unnecessary. There are two main problems: how to identify the interesting causality events from documents, and how to identify the boundaries of the causative unit and the effective unit in term of the multiple EDUs. In addition, there are at least three main problems involved in boundaries identification: the implicit boundary delimiter, the nonadjacent cause-consequence, and the effect surrounded by causes. This research proposes using verb-pair rules learnt by comparing the Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify causality EDUs in Thai agricultural and health news domains. The boundary identification problems are solved by utilizing verb-pair rules, Centering Theory and cue phrase set. The reason for emphasizing on using verbs to extract causality is that they explicitly make, in a certain way, the consequent events of cause-effect, e.g. 'Aphids suck the sap from rice leaves. Then leaves will shrink. Later, they will become yellow and dry.'. The outcome of the proposed methodology shown that the verb-pair rules extracted from NB outperform those extracted from SVM when the corpus contains high occurence of each verb, while the results from SVM is better than NB when the corpus contains less occurence of each verb. The verb-pair rules extracted from NB for causality extraction has the highest precision (0.88) with the recall of 0.75 from the plant disease corpus whereas from SVM has the highest precision (0.89) with the recall of 0.76 from bird flu news.

Seasonal to annual forecasts of precipitation patterns are very important for water infrastructure management.

We present a statistical analysis to explore the utility of using rainfall relationships in Sri Lanka with ENSO and IOD to predict rainfall to Mahaweli and Kelani, river basins of the country. Forecasting of rainfall as classes; flood, drought and normal are helpful for the water resource management decision making. Results of these models give better accuracy than a prediction of absolute values. Quadratic discrimination analysis (QDA) and classification tree models are used to identify the patterns of rainfall classes with respect to ENSO and IOD indices. Ensemble modeling tool Random Forest is also used to predict the rainfall classes as drought and not drought with higher skill.

Variations in local characteristics and continuous system changes require regional adjustments and continuous updating with current evidence. However, acquiring data on damage influencing factors is usually very costly. Therefore, it is of relevance to assess the value of additional data in terms of model performance improvement. We use empirical flood loss data on direct damage to residential buildings available from computer aided telephone interviews that were compiled after major floods in Germany. This unique data base allows us to trace the changes in predictive model performance by incrementally extending the data base used to derive flood loss models. Two models are considered: a uni-variable stage damage function and RF-FLEMO, a multi-variable probabilistic model approach using Random Forests. Additional data are useful to improve model predictive performance and increase model reliability, however the gains also seem to depend on the model approach.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1051/e3sconf/20160705005", "venue": "E3S Web of Conferences", "journal": "E3S Web of Conferences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2538720399", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["54751301", "130603635", "129999392", "53311006", "54210260", "89141", "122795641", "207738357", "3093707", "1878582", "122635484"], "inbound_citations": ["214768966", "116242900"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132103097"}

We conducted a validation study of intention of suicide attempts/self-harm contacts identified by a commonly applied Danish register-based algorithm (DK-algorithm) based on hospital discharge diagnosis and emergency room contacts. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Of all 101 530 people identified with an incident suicide attempt/self-harm contact at Danish hospitals between 1995 and 2012 using the DK-algorithm, we selected a random sample of 475 people. We validated the DK-algorithm against medical records applying the definitions and terminology of the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment of suicidal events, nonsuicidal events, and indeterminate or potentially suicidal events. We calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) of the DK-algorithm to identify suicidal events overall, by gender, age groups, and calendar time. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We retrieved medical records for 357 (75%) people. The PPV of the DK-algorithm to identify suicidal events was 51.5% (95% CI: 46.4-56.7) overall, 42.7% (95% CI: 35.2-50.5) in males, and 58.5% (95% CI: 51.6-65.1) in females.

Cancer is the most serious disease facing humans and possibly leading to death. So, a definitive solution must be done to these diseases, to eliminate them and also to protect humans from them. Breast cancer is considered being one of the dangerous types of cancers that face women in particular. Early examination should be done periodically and the diagnosis must be more sensitive and effective to preserve the women lives. There are various types of breast cancer images but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become one of the important ways in breast cancer detection. In this work, a new method is done to detect the breast cancer using the MRI images that is preprocessed using a 2D Median filter. The features are extracted from the images using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). These features are reduced to 13 features. Then, support vector machine (SVM) is used to detect if there is a tumor or not. Simulation results have been accomplished using the MRI images datasets.

Data-driven models that investigate the feasibility of solar-fueled energies, face challenges in respect to identifying their appropriate input data as such variables may not be available at all sites due to a lack of environmental monitoring system. In this paper, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-derived predictors are employed to train three-phase hybrid SVR model for monthly GSR prediction. Firstly, to acquire relevant model input features, MODIS variables are screened with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and secondly, a Gaussian emulation method of sensitivity analysis is incorporated on all screened variables to ascertain their relative role in predicting GSR. To address pertinent issues of non-stationarities, PSO selected variables are decomposed with Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation prior to its incorporation in Support Vector Regression (SVR), constructing a three-phase PSO-W-SVR hybrid model where the hyper-parameters are acquired by evolutionary (i.e., PSO & Genetic Algorithm) and Grid Search methods. Three-phase PSO-W-SVR hybrid model is benchmarked with alternative machine learning models. Thirty-nine model scenarios are formulated: 13 without feature selection (e.g., SVR), 13 with feature selection (e.g., PSO-SVR for two-phase models) and the remainder 13 with feature selection strategy coupled with data decomposition algorithm (e.g., PSO-W-SVR leading to a three-phase model). Metrics such as skill score (RMSESS), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott\u2019s (WI), Legates & McCabe\u2019s ( E 1 ) and Nash\u2013Sutcliffe coefficients ( E N S ) are applied to comprehensively evaluate prescribed models. Empirical results register high performance of three-phase hybrid PSO-W-SVR models, exceeding the prescribed alternative models. High predictive ability evidenced by a low RRMSE and high E1 ascertains PSO-W-SVR hybrid model as considerably favorable in its capability to be enriched by MODIS satellite-derived variables. Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform algorithm is also seen to provide resolved patterns in satellite variables, leading to a superior performance compared to the other data-driven model.

This paper explores the possibility of combing the laser-ultrasonic technology and a hybrid intelligent method to fast achieve classification and evaluation of artificial rolling contact fatigue (RCF) defect in different depths. The laser ultrasonic scanning detection system is used to collect data samples from different locations of the defects quickly, and the signals are detected by an interferometer. Once the characteristic information of different rail defects is acquired and trained by Support Vector Machine (SVM), the high efficient and high-precision rail detection can be realized through the input of the feature in the detection process. The hybrid method is composed by Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and SVM. The WPT is used to decompose the signal of surface defect in different frequency bands. The KPCA is used to eliminate the redundancy of the original feature set, thereby reducing the correlation among all the defect features. Wavelet packet time-frequency coefficient (X), energy (E) and local entropy (F) are generated and a new feature (Ynew) is created by fusing X, E and F, as a result of WPT and KPCA. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) method is used to classify RCF defect in different depths. It implements a fast classification of small data.

However, many approaches do not give an intuitive relation between the raw features and the diagnosis. Therefore, they are difficult for clinicians to interpret. Moreover, most approaches treat the features extracted from the brain (for example, voxelwise gray matter concentration maps from brain MRI) as independent variables and ignore their spatial and anatomical relations. In this paper, we present a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)\u2010based learning method for the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which integrates spatial\u2010anatomical information. In this way, spatial\u2010neighbor features in the same anatomical region are encouraged to have similar weights in the SVM model. Secondly, we introduce a group lasso penalty to induce structure sparsity, which may help clinicians to assess the key regions involved in the disease. For solving this learning problem, we use an accelerated proximal gradient descent approach. We tested our method on the subset of ADNI data selected by Cuingnet et al. (2011) for Alzheimer's disease classification, as well as on an independent larger dataset from ADNI. Good classification performance is obtained for distinguishing cognitive normals (CN) vs. AD, as well as on distinguishing between various sub\u2010types (e.g. CN vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment). The model trained on Cuignet's dataset for AD vs. CN classification was directly used without re\u2010training to the independent larger dataset. Good performance was achieved, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed methods. For all experiments, the classification results are comparable or better than the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art, while the weight map more clearly indicates the key regions related to Alzheimer's disease.

Firstly we show that each of them can be represented as an instance of a common schema. Secondly we compare the four fittings. By modifying Jung's result, we show that all definite hypotheses derived by V*-operation with Generalization can be derived by Bottom Generalization and vice versa, but that some hypotheses cannot be derived by Saturant Generalization. We also give a hypotheses of a general clause which can be derived Bottom Generalization but not by V*-operation with Generalization. We show Inverse Entailment is more powerful than other three fittings both in definite and in general clausal logic.

Inductive Logic Programming, being based on First-Order Logic as a representation language, provides a suitable learning framework to be adopted in these cases. However, the intrinsic complexity of this framework, added to the complexity of the specific application context, often requires pure induction to be supported by various kinds of meta-information on the domain itself and/or on its representation in order to prune the search space of all possible definitions. Indeed, avoiding the exploration of paths that do not lead to any correct solution can greatly reduce computational times, and hence becomes a critical issue for the performance of the whole learning process. In the current practice, providing such information is often in charge of the human expert. It is also a difficult and error-prone activity, in which mistakes are highly probable because of a number of factors. This makes it desirable to develop procedures that can automatically generate such information starting from the same observations that are input to the learning process. This paper focuses on a specific kind of meta-information: the types used in the description language and their related domains.

Unfortunately, existing Learning Management System (LMS) that generally provides online discussion cannot afford a comprehensive evaluation on the content of the transcripts and the level of interaction among participants. Therefore, this research explores the analysis process of OAD qualitatively and quantitatively. The work focuses on Content Analysis (CA) and Social Network Analysis (SNA), two popular methods employed by educators and researchers to analyze online discussion in e-learning environment. Although these two methods are well established, the techniques remain manual. Furthermore, presently, these two methods of analysis are conducted and studied independently. Hence, this research proposes a new framework integrating CA with SNA called CASNA, which provides comprehensive information of the result, and automation of the processes. CASNA is applied and embedded in LMS (Moodle) to validate the proposed framework. This research also introduces sentence as the unit of interaction instead of message to assess the level of participation among students. In addition, in order to qualitatively analyze the online discussion, two text classifiers; the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) approaches are employed to categorize the sentences based on Soller\u2019s model and the results are compared. The evaluation of these two classifiers is done based on precision, accuracy, recall and F-Measure. The result shows that SVM outperform BPNN in terms of precision and accuracy; falls behind BPNN in terms of recall and F-Measure. This research also discusses the use of network indicators of SNA. Adjacency matrix, graph theory and network analysis techniques are applied to quantitatively define the network interactions among participants.

In this study, we classified the vegetation of an open alkali landscape, characterized by two Natura 2000 habitat types: Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes and Pannonic loess steppic grasslands . We generated 18 variables from an ALS dataset collected in the growing (leaf-on) season. Elevation is a key factor determining the patterns of vegetation types in the landscape, and hence 3 additional variables were based on a digital terrain model (DTM) generated from an ALS dataset collected in the dormant (leaf-off) season. We classified the vegetation into 24 classes based on these 21 variables, at a pixel size of 1 m. Two groups of variables with and without the DTM-based variables were used in a Random Forest classifier, to estimate the influence of elevation, on the accuracy of the classification. The resulting classes at Level 4, based on associations, were aggregated at three levels \u2014 Level 3 (11 classes), Level 2 (8 classes) and Level 1 (5 classes) \u2014 based on species pool, site conditions and structure, and the accuracies were assessed. The classes were also aggregated based on Natura 2000 habitat types to assess the accuracy of the classification, and its usefulness for the monitoring of habitat quality. The vegetation could be classified into dry grasslands, wetlands, weeds, woody species and man-made features, at Level 1, with an accuracy of 0.79 (Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient, \u03ba ). The accuracies at Levels 2\u20134 and the classification based on the Natura 2000 habitat types were \u03ba : 0.76, 0.61, 0.51 and 0.69, respectively. Levels 1 and 2 provide suitable information for nature conservationists and land managers, while Levels 3 and 4 are especially useful for ecologists, geologists and soil scientists as they provide high resolution data on species distribution, vegetation patterns, soil properties and on their correlations. Including the DTM-based variables increased the accuracy ( \u03ba ) from 0.73 to 0.79 for Level 1.

The modern power transformers has subjected to different types of faults, which affect the continuity of power supply which in turn causes serious economic losses. To avoid the interruption of power supply, various fault diagnosis approaches are adopted to detect faults in the power transformer and has to eliminate the impacts of the faults at the initial stage. Among the fault diagnosis methods, the hybrid technique of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm is simple conceptually derived and its implementation process is faster with better scaling properties for complex problems with non linearity and load variations but performance factor related to accuracy has a declined value in case of correlations implicit . In order to obtain better fault diagnosis to improve the service of the power transformer, SVM is optimized with Improved PSO technique to achieve high interpretation accuracy for Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) of power transformer through the extracting positive features from both the techniques. Primary SVM is applied to establish classification features for faults in the transformer through DGA. The features are applied as input data to Autonomous optimized Technique for faults analysis. The proposed methodology obtains the DGA data set from diagnostic gas in oil of 500 KV main transformers of Pingguo Substation in South China Electric Power Company. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB software with an Intel core 3 processor with speed of 3 GHZ and 4 GB RAM PC. The result obtained by Autonomous optimized Technique (IPSO-SVM) is compared against PSO-SVM to estimate the performance of the classifiers in terms of execution time and quality of classification for precision.

To enhance the selection of channel with less noise among the white spaces (idle channels), the a priory knowledge of Radio Frequency (RF) power is very important. Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques cans be applied to these scenarios to predict the required RF power in the available channels to achieve optimum Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we developed a time domain based optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for the prediction of real world RF power within the GSM 900, Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) FM and TV bands. Sensitivity analysis was used to reduce the input vector of the prediction models. The inputs of the ANN and SVR consist of only time domain data and past RF power without using any RF power related parameters, thus forming a nonlinear time series prediction model. The application of the models produced was found to increase the robustness of CR applications, specifically where the CR had no prior knowledge of the RF power related parameters such as signal to noise ratio, bandwidth and bit error rate. Since CR are embedded communication devices with memory constrain limitation, the models used, implemented a novel and innovative initial weight optimization of the ANN's through the use of compact differential evolutionary (cDE) algorithm variants which are memory efficient.

Therefore, we present a spatio-temporal variable selection based support vector regression (VS-SVR) model fed with the high-dimensional traffic data collected from all available road segments.

This research seeks to identify human action in image and video data. Its research results have been widely used in the fields of safety monitoring, disability monitoring, understanding multimedia content, human\u2013computer interaction, virtual reality, and so on. However, the existing traditional human action recognition technology has many limitations in practical application, such as low accuracy and weak adaptive ability. Although the action recognition based on deep learning can self-learn and improve the action recognition accuracy, there are many difficulties in training the deep neural network model, such as gradient disappearance, gradient explosion, and overfitting. Therefore, this paper will reduce the abovementioned difficulties in deep neural network model training from the perspective of deep neural network model parameter initialization and then propose a model parameter initialization method based on the multilayer maxout network activation function to solve the difficulties in deep neural network model training. Then, on this basis, a method of learning the temporal and spatial characteristics of human action based on the deep neural network model is proposed. First, the method detects and tracks the human action and uses the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to encode the temporal and spatial features of various parts of the human body. Second, the temporal and spatial feature codes of various parts of the human body are integrated into a global temporal and spatial feature representation method of the action video through a RBM neural network. Finally, the trained SVM classifiers are used to recognize human action. Experiments show that the human action recognition method proposed in this paper not only has high recognition accuracy but also has great adaptability.

In the proposed method, the manifold of data is divided into several clusters and then, we learn a new metric for each partition by utilizing not only input features, but also their corresponding poses. The manifold clustering allows the decomposition of multiple manifolds into a set of manifolds that are less complex. Furthermore, the input data could be mapped to a new space where the ambiguity problem is minimized. Our guiding principle for learning the distance metrics is to preserve the manifold structure of the input data.

Most of the previous developments occurred by slow, expensive trial-and-error approaches, which have produced a considerable amount of data over the past 100 years. By finding patterns in such types of data, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can extract useful knowledge, providing important insights into composition-property maps. A key step in glass composition design is to identify their physical-chemical properties, such as the glass transition temperature, Tg. In this paper, we investigate how different ML algorithms can be used to predict the Tg of glasses based on their chemical composition. For such, we used a dataset of 43,240 oxide glass compositions, each one with its assigned Tg. Besides, to assess the predictive performance obtained by ML algorithms, we investigated the possible gains by tuning the hyperparameters of these algorithms. The results show that the best ML algorithm for predicting Tg is the Random Forest (RF). One of the main challenges in this task is the prediction of extreme Tg values. To do this, we assessed the predictive performance of the investigated ML algorithms in three Tg intervals. For extreme Tg values ( \u2264 450 K and \u2265 1150 K), the top-performing algorithm was the k-Nearest Neighbours, closely followed by RF. The induced RF model predicted extreme values of Tg with a Relative Deviation (RD) of 3.5% for glasses with high Tg ( \u2265 1150 K), and RD of 7.5% for glasses with very low Tg ( \u2264 450 K). Finally, we propose a new visual approach to explain what our RF model learned, highlighting the importance of each chemical element to obtain glasses with extreme Tg.

A customer entering the diverse cloud market is likely to be overwhelmed with a host of difficult choices in terms of service selection. This applies to all levels of service, but Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) level is particularly important for the end user given the fact that IaaS provides more choices and control for application developers. In the IaaS domain, however, there is no straightforward method to compare virtual machine performance and, more generally cost/performance trade-offs, within or across cloud providers. A wrong decision can result in a financial loss as well as a reduced application performance. A cloud broker can help in resolving such issues by acting as an intermediary between the cloud provider and the cloud consumer \u2013 hence, serving as a decision support system for assisting the customer in the decision process. In this thesis, we exploit machine learning for building an intelligent decision support system which assists customers in making application-driven decisions in a multi-cloud environment. The thesis examines a representative set of appropriate inference and prediction based learning techniques, that are essential for capturing application behaviour on different deployment setups, such as Polynomial Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR). In addition, the thesis examines the efficiency of the learning techniques, recognising that machine learning can impose significant training overhead. The thesis also introduces a novel transfer learning aided technique, leading to substantial reduction in this overhead. By definition, transfer learning aims to solve the new problem faster or with a better solution by using the previously learned knowledge. Quantitatively, we observed a reduction of approximately 60% in the learning time and cost by transferring the existing knowledge about the application and cloud platform in order to learn a new prediction model for some other application or cloud provider. Intensive experimentation has been performed in this study for learning and evaluation of proposed decision support system. Explicitly, we have used three different representative applications over two cloud providers, namely Amazon and Google. Our proposed decision support system, enriched with transfer learning methods, is capable of generating decisions that are viable across different applications in a multi-cloud environment.

Stochastic finite element (FE) simulation was used to calculate the head-on-cup contact mechanics for five thousand combinations of design and loading parameters. FE results were used to train a Random Forest (RF) surrogate model to rapidly predict the contact patch dimensions, contact area, pressures and plastic deformations for arbitrary designs and loading. In addition to widely observed polar and edge contact, FE results included ring-polar, asymmetric-polar, and transitional categories which have previously received limited attention. Combinations of design and load parameters associated with each contact category were identified. Polar contact pressures were predicted in the range of 0\u2013200 MPa with no permanent deformation. Edge loading (with subluxation) was associated with pressures greater than 500 MPa and induced permanent deformation in 83% of cases. Transitional-edge contact (with little subluxation) was associated with intermediate pressures and permanent deformation in most cases, indicating that, even with ideal anatomical alignment, bearings may face extreme wear challenges. Surrogate models were able to accurately predict contact mechanics 18,000 times faster than FE analyses.

Physical phantom measurements are commonly employed to determine the field-specific output factors (OFs) but are often subject to limited machine time, measurement uncertainties and intensive labor. In this study, a machine learning-based approach was developed to predict output (cGy/MU) and derive MUs, incorporating the dependencies on gantry angle and field size for a single-room proton therapy system. The goal of this study was to develop a secondary check tool for OF measurements and eventually eliminate patient-specific OF measurements. ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: The OFs of 1754 fields previously measured in a water phantom with calibrated ionization chambers and electrometers for patient-specific fields with various range and modulation width combinations for 23 options were included in this study. The training data sets for machine learning models in three different methods (Random Forest, XGBoost and Cubist) included 1431 (~81%) OFs. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to prevent \"overfitting\" and to validate each model. The remaining 323 (~19%) OFs were used to test the trained models. The difference between the measured and predicted values from machine learning models was analyzed. Model prediction accuracy was also compared with that of the semi-empirical model developed by Kooy (Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 2005). Additionally, gantry angle dependence of OFs was measured for three groups of options categorized on the selection of the second scatters. Field size dependence of OFs was investigated for the measurements with and without patient-specific apertures. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: All three machine learning methods showed higher accuracy than the semi-empirical model which shows considerably large discrepancy of up to 7.7% for the treatment fields with full range and full modulation width. The Cubist-based solution outperformed all other models (P < 0.001) with the mean absolute discrepancy of 0.62% and maximum discrepancy of 3.17% between the measured and predicted OFs. The OFs showed a small dependence on gantry angle for small and deep options while they were constant for large options. The OF decreased by 3%-4% as the field radius was reduced to 2.5 cm. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Machine learning methods can be used to predict OF for double-scatter proton machines with greater prediction accuracy than the most popular semi-empirical prediction model. By incorporating the gantry angle dependence and field size dependence, the machine learning-based methods can be used for a sanity check of OF measurements and bears the potential to eliminate the time-consuming patient-specific OF measurements.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29500818", "doi": "10.1002/mp.12842", "venue": "Medical physics", "journal": "Medical physics", "mag_id": "2790522724", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53212666", "86616374", "215470889", "215497893", "202029307", "209337435", "92160197"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4238546"}

This manuscript presents Deep Convolutional Neural Fields (DeepCNF), a combination of DCNN with Conditional Random Field (CRF), for sequence labeling with highly imbalanced label distribution. The widely-used training methods, such as maximum-likelihood and maximum labelwise accuracy, do not work well on highly imbalanced data. To handle this, we present a new training algorithm called maximum-AUC for DeepCNF. That is, we train DeepCNF by directly maximizing the empirical Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), which is an unbiased measurement for imbalanced data. To fulfill this, we formulate AUC in a pairwise ranking framework, approximate it by a polynomial function and then apply a gradient-based procedure to optimize it. We then test our AUC-maximized DeepCNF on three very different protein sequence labeling tasks: solvent accessibility prediction, 8-state secondary structure prediction, and disorder prediction. Our experimental results confirm that maximum-AUC greatly outperforms the other two training methods on 8-state secondary structure prediction and disorder prediction since their label distributions are highly imbalanced and also have similar performance as the other two training methods on the solvent accessibility prediction problem which has three equally-distributed labels. Furthermore, our experimental results also show that our AUC-trained DeepCNF models greatly outperform existing popular predictors of these three tasks.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1511.05265", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2174269795", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["15205687", "29104081", "9494295", "1734828", "1996665", "41495580", "8399984", "3031721", "30690389", "86145726", "20871379", "5886678", "18378845", "8869874", "125275910", "18432318", "10511727", "5805074", "8571129", "2309950", "1115550", "8881910", "13759790", "29185760", "195908774", "44577703", "277918", "14542261", "5681609", "18021555", "16191434", "59937231", "206406180", "338001", "14591934", "15403132", "6057632", "641879", "12061490", "39156260", "9067453"], "inbound_citations": ["67856359", "16411066"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6663862"}

Instead of conventional ways of modeling stock prices, we construct models which relate the market indicators to a trading decision directly. Furthermore, unlike a reversal trading system or a binary system of buy and sell, we allow three modes of trades, namely, buy, sell or stand by, and the stand-by case is important as it caters to the market conditions where a model does not produce a strong signal of buy or sell. Linear trading models are firstly developed with the scoring technique which weights higher on successful indicators, as well as with the Least Squares technique which tries to match the past perfect trades with its weights. The linear models are then made adaptive by using the forgetting factor to address market changes. Because stock markets could be highly nonlinear sometimes, the Random Forest is adopted as a nonlinear trading model, and improved with Gradient Boosting to form a new technique\u2014Gradient Boosted Random Forest.

Different from other papers which directly apply reconstruction loss between encoder and generator, SelfExGAN introduces Nash equilibrium between these three parts in order to discover the correspondence between latent inputs and training data spontaneously.

These networks are highly nonlinear rule-based models. The development of the ANFPN dwells on the technologies of Computational Intelligence(Cl), namely fuzzy sets, neural networks and genetic algorithms. NFN contributes to the formation of the premise part of the rule-based structure of the ANFPN. The consequence part of the ANFPN is designed using PNN. At the premise part of the ANFPN, NFN uses both the simplified fuzzy inference and error back-propagation learning rule. The parameters of the membership functions, learning rates and momentum coefficients are adjusted with the use of genetic optimization. As the consequence structure of ANFPN, PNN is a flexible network architecture whose structure(topology) is developed through learning. In particular, the number of layers and nodes of the PNN are not fixed in advance but is generated in a dynamic way. In this study, we introduce two kinds of ANFPN architectures, namely the basic and the modified one. Here the basic and the modified architecture depend on the number of input variables and the order of polynomial in each layer of PNN structure. Owing to the specific features of two combined architectures, it is possible to consider the nonlinear characteristics of process system and to obtain the better output performance with superb predictive ability. The availability and feasibility of the ANFPN are discussed and illustrated with the aid of two representative numerical examples.

Aflatoxin detection and measurement relies mainly on chemical methods usually based on chromatography approaches, and recently developed immunochemical based assays that have advantages but also limitations, since these are expensive and destructive techniques. Nondestructive, optical approaches are recently being developed to assess presence of contamination in a cost and time effective way, maintaining acceptable accuracy and reproducibility. In this paper are presented the results obtained with a simple portable device for nondestructive detection of aflatoxins in almonds. The presented approach is based on the analysis of fluorescence spectra of slurried almonds under 375 nm wavelength excitation.

Originally, the motivation for developing BCIs has been to provide severely disabled individuals with a basic communication system. Recent years, BCIs directed at regular consumers in practical control applications have gained popularity as well, for which the ultimate goal is to provide a more natural way of communicating with machines. However, BCIs intended at use in control systems face several challenges and are still inferior to conventional controllers in terms of usability, reliability and practical value. In this thesis, we explore two novel concepts that can enforce BCIs. The first concept relies on detection of so-called Error-Related Potentials (ErrPs), which are the response in brainwaves to an erroneous event. We argue for that these potentials can serve as reward-based signals that give feedback to the system, which enables the BCI to adapt to the user. The second concept is to use sequence labeling frameworks based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to translate brainwaves into control signals with greater accuracy. We also suggest how these two concepts can be combined. Our experiments to detect ErrPs in BCI control applications using a consumer grade headset to obtain EEG measurements indicate no presence of ErrPs, however, the reliability of the EEG recordings is questionable. Furthermore, we have developed a new implementation of the so-called Sparse Hidden-Dynamic CRF (SHDCRF) and measure its performance on a common BCI classification task.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called spatially Regularized Graph Learning (ReGLe), to automatically explore the intrinsic relationship among patches both with global and local cues for robust object representation. In particular, the target object bounding box is partitioned into a set of non-overlapping image patches, which are taken as graph nodes, and each of them is associated with a weight to represent how likely it belongs to the target object. To improve the accuracy of node weight computation, we dynamically learn the edge weights (i.e., the appearance compatibility of two nodes) according to both global and local relationship among patches. First, we pursue the low-rank representation for capturing the global low-dimensional subspace structure of patches. Second, we encode the local information into the low-rank representation by exploiting the fact that neighboring nodes usually have similar appearance. Finally, we utilize the representations to learn their affinities (i.e., graph edge weights). The node and edge weights are jointly optimized by a designed ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm, the object feature representation is updated by imposing the weights of patches on the extracted image features. The object location is finally predicted by maximizing the classification score in the structured SVM.

If we are told \u201cif glork then frum,\u201d and \u201cglork,\u201d we can infer \u201cfrum\u201d; any name that serves as the subject of a sentence can appear as the object of a sentence. These universals are pervasive in language and reasoning. One account of how they are generalized holds that humans possess mechanisms that manipulate symbols and variables; an alternative account holds that symbol-manipulation can be eliminated from scientific theories in favor of descriptions couched in terms of networks of interconnected nodes. Can these \u201celiminative\u201d connectionist models offer a genuine alternative? This article shows that eliminative connectionist models cannot account for how we extend universals to arbitrary items. The argument runs as follows.

Next, it is shown that the class of eliminative connectionist models that is currently popular cannot learn to extend universals outside the training space.

Cokely (cokely@psy.fsu.edu) Department of Psychology, Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 Roy W. Roring (roring@psy.fsu.edu) Department of Psychology, Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 Part-Set Cuing Experiment 2: Simulation Results In a part-set cuing paradigm, when part of a previously studied list of words is provided as a memory aid, a reliable and robust impairment of the non-cued list items results. Since its discovery (Slamecka, 1968; as cited in Nickerson, 1984), this paradoxical phenomenon has been characterized as a persisting enigma in memory research (Nickerson, 1984), of both theoretical and practical concern. One leading informal model, the strategy disruption interpretation (Basden & Basden, 1995), suggests that the part-set cuing impairment results because one\u2019s retrieval strategy is changed and differs from the original encoding strategy, following the presentation of cues. The strategy disruption account is thoroughly supported by empirical evidence; however, it has been criticized as theoretically vague and poorly defined. In contrast, the other leading account, a formal model using SAM (Raaijmaker & Shiffrin, 1981), while precise, has been criticized as overly defined, theoretically inconsistent, and unable to account for the full range of findings (Roediger & Neely, 1982). In an attempt to more precisely identify and extend the strategy disruption interpretation, we examine and compare both neural network simulations and human experiments in a part-set cuing paradigm. The Neural Network The artificial neural network used was a fully-connected, auto-associative, three-layer perceptron, using a backpropagation algorithm with a learning rate set to 0.1. The network used 15 input and 15 output nodes with a bias, 10 hidden, and 10 context units. The context layer used a 1 to 1 association from hidden units to context units and was fully connected from context to hidden units. Experiment 1: Human Results A within-participant (N=24) design was used and counterbalanced for list-order, list-cue-order, and randomized part-set cuing. A typical and robust part-set cuing impairment was observed for cued (M=.35) verses non-cued (M=.40) items, F (1,23) = 4.99, p < .05. A within-simulated-participant (N=24) part-set cuing design was used and counterbalanced for list-order and list-cue- order, with randomized part-set cues. Output vector error served as the dependent variable and was summed and analyzed for cued and non-cued states. A typical and robust part-set cuing impairment was observed, F (1, 23) = 24.00, p < .05, without evidence of catastrophic interference. Conclusion & Discussion The neural network was consistent with the observed human performance, providing a good fit across a number of analyses. The findings suggest that the neural network formalism is consistent with and may serve as an extension of the Basden and Basden strategy disruption account of part-set cuing. That is, following cuing, different study and activation patterns disrupt the subsequent process of recall. This disruption is caused by a change in the availability and accessibility of cued items, altering the retrieval process and thus the retrieval strategy. Although the experimental evidence is from a small set, results suggest that the neural network can provide an increasingly precise mechanistic account of part-set cuing impairment that is consistent with the leading informal theoretical account. Future simulations should attempt to replicate key findings including part-set cuing facilitation and category-cuing impairment. References Basden, D. R., & Basden, B. H. (1995).

Thus in this study, besides clarifying how to apply the Chebyshev kernel functions on vector inputs, we also increase the generalization capability of the previously proposed Chebyshev kernels and show how to derive new kernel functions by using the generalized Chebyshev polynomials.

This study compared four popular machine learning algorithms trained on unselected, nation-wide population data from Sweden to solve the binary classification problem of predicting survival versus non-survival 2 years after first myocardial infarction (MI). This prospective national registry study for prognostic accuracy validation of predictive models used data from 51,943 complete first MI cases as registered during 6 years (2006\u20132011) in the national quality register SWEDEHEART/RIKS-HIA (90% coverage of all MIs in Sweden) with follow-up in the Cause of Death register (> 99% coverage). Primary outcome was AUROC (C-statistic) performance of each model on the untouched test set (40% of cases) after model development on the training set (60% of cases) with the full (39) predictor set. Model AUROCs were bootstrapped and compared, correcting the P-values for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method. Secondary outcomes were derived when varying sample size (1\u2013100% of total) and predictor sets (39, 10, and 5) for each model. Analyses were repeated on 79,869 completed cases after multivariable imputation of predictors. A Support Vector Machine with a radial basis kernel developed on 39 predictors had the highest complete cases performance on the test set (AUROC = 0.845, PPV = 0.280, NPV = 0.966) outperforming Boosted C5.0 (0.845 vs. 0.841, P = 0.028) but not significantly higher than Logistic Regression or Random Forest. Models converged to the point of algorithm indifference with increased sample size and predictors. Using the top five predictors also produced good classifiers. Imputed analyses had slightly higher performance. Improved mortality prediction at hospital discharge after first MI is important for identifying high-risk individuals eligible for intensified treatment and care. All models performed accurately and similarly and because of the superior national coverage, the best model can potentially be used to better differentiate new patients, allowing for improved targeting of limited resources.

Digital images taken of real-life scenes capture objects at different positions, rotations and scales. Furthermore, variations in lighting, shape, color and texture within the same class make object classification a huge obstacle for computer vision algorithms. The most robust methodologies related to variations in lighting, rotation, color and scale, are based on \u201ckey points\u201d localization, followed by applying a local descriptor to each surrounding region. Researchers have used various methods for detecting key points and have applied various local descriptors. Of these, the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Center-Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (CS-LBP) methods have obtained good performance and are associated with clustering algorithms or histogram representation based on independent features (Bag of Features (BoF)). In the BoF approach, the visual codebook extracted around the \u201ckey points\u201d regions can effectively describe objects by their appearance based on local texture analysis. Recently, we proposed two new texture descriptors for object detection based on the Local Mapped Pattern (LMP) approach. The Mean-Local Mapped Pattern (M-LMP) and the Center Symmetric Local Mapped Pattern (CS-LMP) exhibit better performance than SIFT and CS-LBP, but prior results have shown that the size of descriptors could be reduced without loss of sensitivity. In this paper, we investigated reducing the size of the M-LMP descriptor and then evaluating its performance for object classification by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In our experiments, we implemented an object recognition system based on the M-LMP reduced descriptor, and compared our results against the SIFT, Local Intensity Order Pattern (LIOP) and CS-LMP descriptors. The object classification results were analyzed using a BoF model and a SVM classifier, with the result that performance using the reduced descriptor is better than the other three well-known methods tested and also requires less processing time.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-016-4003-0", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2528047645", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17726917", "461853", "619371", "1261520", "6617054", "28319396", "6459076", "6650709", "30581466", "15706770", "489600", "17072537", "2875084", "11117513", "61571454", "2572455", "14144539", "5258236", "130535382", "6278891", "8475287", "8571961", "1704741", "3761655", "13308232", "6076287", "12209481", "14457153", "12808608", "16749848", "1458265", "1440386", "42281583", "7912524", "14841054", "6645225"], "inbound_citations": ["46961274", "53206461", "28853514", "85447326"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19603914"}

Literature reports have shown numerous benefits of the Wavelet analysis in EMG feature extraction for pattern recognition. However, its application to typical knee exercises when using only a single EMG channel is limited. In this study, three types of knee exercises, i.e., flexion of the leg up (standing), hip extension from a sitting position (sitting) and gait (walking) are investigated from 14 healthy untrained subjects, while EMG signals from the muscle group of vastus medialis and the goniometer on the knee joint of the detected leg are synchronously monitored and recorded. Four types of lower-limb motions including standing, sitting, stance phase of walking, and swing phase of walking, are segmented. The Wavelet Transform (WT) based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach is proposed for the classification of four lower-limb motions using a single-channel EMG signal from the muscle group of vastus medialis. Based on lower-limb motions from all subjects, the combination of five-level wavelet decomposition and SVD is used to comprise the feature vector. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then configured to build a multiple-subject classifier for which the subject independent accuracy will be given across all subjects for the classification of four types of lower-limb motions. In order to effectively indicate the classification performance, EMG features from time-domain (e.g., Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Root-Mean-Square (RMS), integrated EMG (iEMG), Zero Crossing (ZC)) and frequency-domain (e.g., Mean Frequency (MNF) and Median Frequency (MDF)) are also used to classify lower-limb motions. The five-fold cross validation is performed and it repeats fifty times in order to acquire the robust subject independent accuracy. Results show that the proposed WT-based SVD approach has the classification accuracy of 91.85%\u00b10.88% which outperforms other feature models.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5503271", "pubmed_id": "28692691", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0180526", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2735021484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["29457027", "11486306", "3348523", "36501402", "7125852", "202266251", "32547722", "44033369", "16222840", "1111940", "16570534", "11933045", "10388201", "9464840", "59891343", "15073946", "24228844", "7639640", "40662954", "16373401", "7084615", "21417300", "26866338", "6503334", "8391605", "7138354", "28637672", "14759812", "13900622", "16346354"], "inbound_citations": ["208881694", "210122531", "81536257", "204939807", "198931738"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39861329"}

First, ACWV builds a class-count FP-tree (called CCFP-tree) from the given historical data.

In this study we evaluate the effectiveness of a support vector machine applied for those compounds and used to classify a collection with unknown activity. This approach was aimed at reducing the number of compounds to be tested against the given target. Our method predicts the biological activity of chemical compounds based on only the atom pairs (AP) two dimensional topological descriptors. The supervised support vector machine (SVM) method herein is trained on compounds from the MDL drug data report (MDDR) known to be active for specific protein target. For detailed analysis, five different biological targets were selected including cyclooxygenase-2, dihydrofolate reductase, thrombin, HIVreverse transcriptase and antagonists of the estrogen receptor. The accuracy of compound identification was estimated using the recall and precision values. The sensitivities for all protein targets exceeded 80% and the classification performance reached 100% for selected targets. In another application of the method, we addressed the absence of an initial set of active compounds for a selected protein target at the beginning of an HTS-campaign. In such a case, virtual highthroughput screening (vHTS) is usually applied by using a flexible docking procedure. However, the vHTS experiment typically contains a large percentage of false positives that should be verified by costly and time-consuming experimental follow-up assays. The subsequent use of our machine learning method was found to improve the speed (since the docking procedure was not required for all compounds from the database) and also the accuracy of the HTS hit lists (the enrichment factor).", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17346118", "doi": "10.2174/138620707780126705", "venue": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "journal": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "mag_id": "2145784250", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["5684376", "14052021", "56170813", "9816584", "976090", "2641372", "97535000", "20671937", "16123867", "233022", "3870910", "12340117", "18613819", "59585298", "215616728", "214954713", "215701065", "18380465", "25416953", "215648250", "409751", "1624677", "16676845", "12769693"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46245980"}

The lack of data concerning the location and extent of VMEs poses a significant obstacle to their protection. Habitat suitability modeling is increasingly used in spatial management planning due to its ability to predict the distribution and niche of marine organisms based on limited input data. We generated broad-scale, medium-resolution (1 km2) ensemble models for ten VME indicator taxa within the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone and a portion of the South Pacific Regional Fishery Management Organisation (SPRFMO) convention area. Ensemble models were constructed using a weighted average of three habitat suitability model types: Boosted Regression Trees, Maximum Entropy, and Random Forest. All models performed well, with area under the curve scores above 0.9, and ensemble models marginally outperformed any of the individual modeling approaches. Highly suitable habitat for each VME indicator taxa was predicted to occur in relatively small areas throughout the region, typically associated with elevated seafloor features with steep slopes. Determining the spatial distribution of VME indicator taxa is critical for assessing the current and historical extent of bottom trawling impacts on benthic communities, and for supporting the improved spatial management of fisheries in the South Pacific Ocean. Given the additional threats of climate change and ocean acidification to VME indicator taxa throughout the deep sea, habitat suitability modeling is likely to play an increasing role in designing effective, long-term protection measures for cumulative impacts on VMEs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.fishres.2018.11.020", "venue": null, "journal": "Fisheries Research", "mag_id": "2903334596", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211228343", "212636905", "214763861", "212737541"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92844583"}

Its mapping is crucial for erosion monitoring and remediation of degraded areas. In addition, mapping of areas with high potential for future gully erosion can be used to assist prevention strategies. Good relations with topographic variables collected from the field are appropriate for determining areas susceptible to gullying. Image analysis of high resolution remotely sensed imagery (HRI) in combination with field verification has proven to be a good approach, although dependent on expensive imagery. Automatic and semi-automatic methods, such as object-oriented analysis (OOA), are rapid and reproducible. However, HRI data are not always available. We therefore attempted to identify gully systems using statistical modeling of image features from medium resolution imagery, here ASTER. These data were used for determining areas within gully system boundaries (GSB) using a semi-automatic method based on OOA. We assess if the selection of useful object features can be done in an objective and transferable way, using Random Forests (RF) for prediction of gully systems at regional scale, here in the Sehoul region, near Rabat, Morocco. Moderate success was achieved using a semi-automatic object-based RF model (out-of-bag error of 18.8%). Besides compensating for the imbalance between gully and non-gully classes, the procedure followed in this study enabled us to balance the classification error rates. The user's and producer's accuracy of the data with a balanced set of class showed an improved accuracy of the spatial estimates of gully systems, when compared to the data with imbalanced class. The model over-predicted the area within the GSB (13\u201327%), but its overall performance demonstrated that medium resolution satellite images contain sufficient information to identify gully systems, so that large areas can be mapped with relatively little effort and acceptable accuracy.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geomorph.2014.04.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Geomorphology", "mag_id": "2021302788", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["59412830", "9550559", "133848222", "36660880", "133916304", "210246826", "203603683", "25419539", "132957498", "8583559", "207962088", "130494544", "134472398", "132730088"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128480422"}

X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning is largely used to assess the location and volume of these hemorrhages. Manual segmentation of the CT scan using planimetry by an expert reader is the gold standard for volume estimation, but is time-consuming and has within- and across-reader variability. We propose a fully automated segmentation approach using a random forest algorithm with features extracted from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods The Minimally Invasive Surgery plus rt-PA in ICH Evacuation (MISTIE) trial was a multi-site Phase II clinical trial that tested the safety of hemorrhage removal using recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). For this analysis, we use 112 baseline CT scans from patients enrolled in the MISTE trial, one CT scan per patient. ICH was manually segmented on these CT scans by expert readers. We derived a set of imaging predictors from each scan. Using 10 randomly-selected scans, we used a first-pass voxel selection procedure based on quantiles of a set of predictors and then built 4 models estimating the voxel-level probability of ICH. The models used were: 1) logistic regression, 2) logistic regression with a penalty on the model parameters using LASSO, 3) a generalized additive model (GAM) and 4) a random forest classifier. The remaining 102 scans were used for model validation.For each validation scan, the model predicted the probability of ICH at each voxel. These voxel-level probabilities were then thresholded to produce binary segmentations of the hemorrhage. These masks were compared to the manual segmentations using the Dice Similarity Index (DSI) and the correlation of hemorrhage volume of between the two segmentations. We tested equality of median DSI using the Kruskal-Wallis test across the 4 models. We tested equality of the median DSI from sets of 2 models using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results All results presented are for the 102 scans in the validation set. The median DSI for each model was: 0.89 (logistic), 0.885 (LASSO), 0.88 (GAM), and 0.899 (random forest). Using the random forest results in a slightly higher median DSI compared to the other models. After Bonferroni correction, the hypothesis of equality of median DSI was rejected only when comparing the random forest DSI to the DSI from the logistic ( p p p https://github.com/muschellij2/ichseg ) and a Shiny R application online ( http://johnmuschelli.com/ich_segment_all.html ) for implementing and testing the proposed approach.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5328741", "pubmed_id": "28275541", "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2017.02.007", "venue": "NeuroImage: Clinical", "journal": "NeuroImage: Clinical", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2588271337", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["311668", "3107793", "25293394", "25871904", "6427629", "30852749", "12553884", "18927930", "14663317", "2408063", "46697385", "13449610", "14810151", "52764", "30675624", "2667611", "40637200", "36097354", "17464595", "31147286", "7253493", "32381546", "2602346", "1739295", "18468567", "199667715", "126300549", "89141", "16162039", "42639", "123001831", "55027773", "3093707", "53335638", "41735097", "12031765"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1642576"}

In recent decades, rapid changes in land use and land cover in Urmia Lake basin is accompanied by important consequences such as the destruction of natural resources, environmental pollution, and rapid growth of cities. Understanding the ratio of changes as well as the systematic and random transitions of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) over time can be used to determine the extent of degradation, manage these changes in a proper direction, predict future changes, and act properly. Detecting and modeling land use changes by using remotely sent data and GIS technology can provide a solid understanding of changes in land use and therefor can offer suitable management practices. The aim of the present study is the use of remote sensing and GIS for mapping land use and land cover changes and identification of their transitions using a transfer matrix and Landsat images in Urmia Lake basin. Therefor, the performance of pixel-based and object-oriented methods of land use and land cover classification specified in Urmia Lake basin is going to be compared. Also the spatial and temporal dynamics of LULC is going to be analysed for this basin. Another objective of this research is to identify the ratio of vulnerabilities of each land use relative to other land uses. ::: 2- Theoretical Framework ::: Land-cover transitions can be classified into random and systematic changes. Random transitions are those influenced by coincidental or unique processes of change; for instance, the rapid and abrupt changes of land transformations in an ecosystem depending on resilience and feedback mechanisms. On the other hand, Systematic transitions are those due to regular or common processes of change. (Tucker et al., 1991; Lambin et al., 2003). ::: 3- Methodology ::: In this study, Landsat TM and ETM + images were used for the period of 1988 to 2015. First, some image pre-processing techniques were done including reducing the brightness of water, strips of pixels in images, and removing the cloud spots. The area of Urmia Lake basin is 5786 Km2 and contains eight Landsat image frames. So, for each period, 8 images were obtained and mosaicked based on band to band method and the coordinate of the region. After running the required pre-processing on the images, training samples were obtained and the images were classified based on vector machine and object-based classification methods. Then, the results of the classification were validated. Based on field observations and vegetation map of Urmia lake basin, the training samples were obtained from 6 land uses including the residential area, forests, agricultural fields, rangelands, water resources, and bare lands. Bias, Gama, Kernel functions, and pyramid levels and Penalty Pyramid Parameters were obtained from a cyclic kernel function for Support Vector Machine. Also, effective parameters of object-oriented approach were obtained including the window width, weighted mean factor, weighted variance factor with error, and similarity tolerance. ::: In order to evaluate the results, Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy were used. For estimating the rate of transmission and other characteristics of the watershed of Urmia Lake, the transition matrix of object-oriented classification method was extracted for 1988-2015. After that, by using appropriate formula, the rate of gain, loss, persistence, net change, and swap (simultaneous exchange) was calculated for each land use/land cover. The swap represented changes in the location between land covers, whereas the net change was associated with a measurable irreversible change in the surface of one land cover to another; having these two components of change allowed the actual spatial dynamics of LULC change to be determined in the study area. In this manner, it was possible to determine the total change in LULC between 1988 and 2015 and highlight the land cover types that exhibited the greatest variation. ::: 4- Results & Discussion ::: The overall accuracy of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and object-oriented approach were 94 and 92 respectively. Also, Kappa coefficient was 92 and 89 respectively, showing that although both methods show acceptable results, the object-oriented approach is stronger. The results of the transactions showed that coverage has been persisted in the 59 percent of the land in the catchment area of Lake Urmia during the period of 1988 to 2015, most of which was related to the residential areas. About 14 percent of the basin has experienced swap. Water resources has experienced the most loss and the less swap. ::: For residential areas, agricultural fields, and water resources classes, the ratio of gain to persistence is more than 1 indicating that the amount of gains are due to the persistence of these classes. The ratio of net changes to persistence was negative for the classes of forest, rangelands, and water resources. The net reduction of water resources was almost contrary to the persistence of this landscape. Also, the net reduction of agricultural fields was almost the same but half the net gain. ::: 5- Conclusions & Suggestions ::: Urmia Lake basin has experienced rapid changes and transitions during 1988-2015; that is, only 59 percent of the land uses have been stable while the other areas have experienced a kind of transition. Due to the reduction of water resources and rangelands, bare lands and agricultural fields have been increased. The results should be noticed for an integrated watershed management of the basin.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.22067/geography.v15i1.56877", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2775993771", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134970254"}

This study aims to empirically assess SOC stocks change between 1991 and 2011 at the landscape scale using easy-to-access spatially-explicit environmental factors. The study area was located in southeast Madagascar, in a region that exhibits very high rate of deforestation and which is characterized by both humid and dry climates. We estimated SOC stock on 0.1 ha plots for 95 different locations in a 43,000 ha reference area covering both dry and humid conditions and representing different land cover including natural forest, cropland, pasture and fallows. We used the Random Forest algorithm to find out the environmental factors explaining the spatial distribution of SOC. We then predicted SOC stocks for two soil layers at 30 cm and 100 cm over a wider area of 395,000 ha. By changing the soil and vegetation indices derived from remote sensing images we were able to produce SOC maps for 1991 and 2011. Those estimates and their related uncertainties where combined in a post-processing step to map estimates of significant SOC variations and we finally compared the SOC change map with published deforestation maps. Results show that the geologic variables, precipitation, temperature, and soil-vegetation status were strong predictors of SOC distribution at regional scale. We estimated an average net loss of 10.7% and 5.2% for the 30 cm and the 100 cm layers respectively for deforested areas in the humid area. Our results also suggest that these losses occur within the first five years following deforestation. No significant variations were observed for the dry region.

Machine-learning-based methods have an advantage over traditional statistical methods in studying these systems because the former do not impose unrealistic assumptions (such as linearity), are capable of inferring missing data, and can reduce long-term expert annotation burden. Thus, a wider adoption of machine learning methods in ecology and earth science has the potential to greatly accelerate the pace and quality of science. Despite these advantages, machine learning techniques have not had wide spread adoption in ecology and earth science. This is largely due to 1) a lack of communication and collaboration between the machine learning research community and natural scientists, 2) a lack of easily accessible tools and services, and 3) the requirement for a robust training and test data set. These impediments can be overcome through financial support for collaborative work and the development of tools and services facilitating ML use. Natural scientists who have not yet used machine learning methods can be introduced to these techniques through Random Forest, a method that is easy to implement and performs well.

In this paper, in order to make it easy to look up artist information in music articles, we propose a method to extract entities such as artist names in music articles in Japanese, and to perform entity linking which links from artist entities to artist information automatically. The method consists of two phases. First, we extract artist names in music articles. An artist name is a named entity, and it is necessary to distinguish artist names from other named entities, such as personal names of non-artists, place names, organization names, etc. In order to achieve it, we prepare training data of music articles in which artist names are manually tagged, and extract artist names using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Next, we choose a web page of artist information for each extracted artist name. We use Wikipedia as the source of artist information to verify the usefulness of the proposed method, we conducted evaluation experiments using cross-validation.

Different from conventional methods (e.g., k-NN) that predict the missing values by simply replacing them with the average of nearby observations, WS-GAN adopts a GAN-based structure, in which the generator approximates the real distribution of observations under the supervision of the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to distinguish the ground truth from \"faked\" data produced by the generator. WS-GAN differs from the literature in two aspects: (1) WS-GAN is able to use the auxiliary information of local radio environment, e.g., geographical information as terrain and buildings, to improve the estimation performance, since such auxiliary information has significant impact on the variation of received signal strength. (2) The objective function of WS-GAN combines adversarial loss and a new light-weight reconstruction error term for weakly supervision, which are jointly optimized during training. The experiments on a real dataset show that WS-GAN can generally achieve more accurate results than baselines. Moreover, through a case study, we demonstrate that the wireless coverage maps generated by WS-GAN are more rational and practical than those obtained by baselines.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3269206.3269294", "venue": "CIKM '18", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2897831143", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1254778", "9062671", "1033682", "10555584", "40015949", "207763512", "206771128", "12803511", "2202933", "11758569", "9775470", "24005817"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53038351"}

Recent advances in remote sensing technology have enabled to capture the spatiotemporal variability of the constituents in coastal waters. The present study evaluates the potential of remote sensing using machine learning techniques, for improving water quality estimation over the coastal waters of Hong Kong. Concentrations of suspended solids (SS), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and turbidity were estimated with several machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Cubist regression (CB), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Landsat (5,7,8) reflectance data were compared with in-situ reflectance data to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. The highest accuracies of the water-quality indicators were achieved by ANN for both, in-situ reflectance data (89%-Chl-a, 93%-SS, and 82%-turbidity) and satellite data (91%-Chl-a, 92%-SS, and 85%-turbidity. The water quality parameters retrieved by the ANN model was further compared to those retrieved by \u201cstandard Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour\u201d (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets. Root mean square error (RMSE) for estimating SS and Chl-a was 3.3 mg/L and 2.7 \u00b5g/L respectively using ANN, whereas RMSEs were 12.7 mg/L and 12.9 \u00b5g/L for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and Chl-a concentrations respectively when C2RCC was applied on Landsat-8 data. Relative variable importance was also conducted to investigate the consistency between in-situ reflectance data and satellite data, and results show that both datasets are similar.

One task that has demonstrated this is the Novel Noun Generalization task. In this task, children are shown an exemplar, it is named, and then the children are asked what other things are called by the same name. Young children extend the name of a solid object to other objects that match the exemplar in shape irrespective of their color, size or material. However, when generalizing the name of a non-solid substance, children consider material to be more important. In brief, young children seem to know that objects and substances are fundamentally different and classified in different ways. Where does this knowledge come from? One proposal is that it comes from innate ideas reflecting an ontological difference between objects of substances. In this research I present evidence for an opposite idea: that it is learned. I propose that the concepts of object and substance emerge as the natural product of associative learning and generalization by similarity. More specifically, I propose that the formative associative mix consists of correlated perceptual properties, syntactic cues, and most notably, the lexical category structure of early learned nouns. I use connectionist networks to simulate both children's performance in the Novel Noun Extension task and the knowledge they bring to the task. In nine experiments with children, neural networks and adults, I support the claim that abstract ideas of object and substance are created by the statistical regularities inherent in the early noun lexicon by: (1) demonstrating that a connectionist network trained on specific instances does act as if it has general knowledge of abstract kinds, (2) demonstrating that these associative processes can explain previous findings in the literature, and (3) generating, testing and verifying new predictions.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Psychological Review", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2560331658", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["7281066", "1041774"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64009383"}

A central assumption in all those algorithms is that the number of latent concepts remains fixed throughout the entire stream. However, this need not be the case. Every incoming batch in the stream may have a different number of latent concepts, and the difference in latent concepts from one tensor batch to another can provide insights into how our findings in a particular application behave and deviate over time.

Collections of data from experiments and first-principle computations have spurred interest in applying machine learning methods to create predictive models capable of mapping from composition and crystal structures to materials properties. Generally, these are regression problems with the input being a 1D vector composed of numerical attributes representing the material composition and/or crystal structure. While neural networks consisting of fully connected layers have been applied to such problems, their performance often suffers from the vanishing gradient problem when network depth is increased. Hence, predictive modeling for such tasks has been mainly limited to traditional machine learning techniques such as Random Forest. In this paper, we study and propose design principles for building deep regression networks composed of fully connected layers with numerical vectors as input. We introduce a novel deep regression network with individual residual learning, IRNet, that places shortcut connections after each layer so that each layer learns the residual mapping between its output and input. We use the problem of learning properties of inorganic materials from numerical attributes derived from material composition and/or crystal structure to compare IRNet's performance against that of other machine learning techniques. Using multiple datasets from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) and Materials Project for training and evaluation, we show that IRNet provides significantly better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches currently used by domain scientists.

Feature generation is a difficult problem, as the connection between the sequence features and the sought property is not known a priori. It is often the task of domain experts or exhaustive feature enumeration techniques to generate a few features whose predictive power is then tested in the context of classification. This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm to effectively explore a large feature space and generate predictive features from sequence data. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on an important component of the gene-finding problem, DNA splice site prediction. This application is chosen due to the complexity of the features needed to obtain high classification accuracy and precision.

In this paper, we propose three novel curriculum learning strategies for training GANs. All strategies are first based on ranking the training images by their difficulty scores, which are estimated by a state-of-the-art image difficulty predictor. Our first strategy is to divide images into gradually more difficult batches. Our second strategy introduces a novel curriculum loss function for the discriminator that takes into account the difficulty scores of the real images. Our third strategy is based on sampling from an evolving distribution, which favors the easier images during the initial training stages and gradually converges to a uniform distribution, in which samples are equally likely, regardless of difficulty. We compare our curriculum learning strategies with the classic training procedure on two tasks: image generation and image translation. Our experiments indicate that all strategies provide faster convergence and superior results. For example, our best curriculum learning strategy applied on spectrally normalized GANs (SNGANs) fooled human annotators in thinking that generated CIFAR-like images are real in 25.0% of the presented cases, while the SNGANs trained using the classic procedure fooled the annotators in only 18.4% cases.

Despite the high dimensionality of the configuration space, many human motion activities lie intrinsically on low dimensional manifolds. Although the intrinsic body configuration manifolds might be very low in dimensionality, the resulting appearance manifolds are challenging to model given various aspects that affects the appearance such as the shape and appearance of the person performing the motion, or variation in the view point, or illumination. Our objective is to learn representations for the shape and the appearance of moving (dynamic) objects that support tasks such as synthesis, pose recovery, reconstruction, and tracking. We studied various approaches for representing global deformation manifolds that preserve their geometric structure. Given such representations, we can learn generative models for dynamic shape and appearance.

Some bacteria are known to have Species-Specific Subsequences (SSS) in their TTs, which are believed containing useful clues to bacterial evolution. The SSS can be identified using biological methods which, however, tend to be costly and time-consuming due to the vast number of subsequences to experiment on. In this paper, we study the problem from a computational perspective and propose a computing method to identify the SSS. Given DNA sequences of a target species, some of which are known to contain a TT while others not, our method uses machine learning techniques and is done in three steps. First, we find all frequent subsequences from the given sequences, and show that this can be efficiently done using generalized suffix trees. Second, we use these subsequences as features to characterize the original DNA sequences and train a classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM), one of the currently most effective machine learning techniques. Using the parameters of the resulting SVM model, we define a measure called subsequence specificity to rank the frequent subsequences, and output the one with the highest rank as the SSS. Our experiments show that the SSS found by the proposed method are very close to those determined by biological experiments. This suggests that our method, though purely computational, can help efficiently locate the SSS by effectively narrowing down the search space.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4236/jbise.2009.23031", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Science and Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2118299582", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15220531", "6015591", "207605508", "7138354", "17836332", "5848965", "195837752", "7725217", "2427083", "5262555", "60993494", "125603875"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62745777"}

To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we investigate the online kernel-based multimodal similarity learning, which aims to integrate multiple kernels for learning multimodal similarity functions, and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for CBIR on several different image datasets.

Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of hyperparameters.

These studies are focusing on the so-called barcode genes, representing a well defined region of the whole genome. Recently, alignment-free techniques are gaining more importance because they are able to overcome the drawbacks of sequence alignment techniques. In this paper a new alignment-free method for DNA sequences clustering and classification is proposed. The method is based on k-mers representation and text mining techniques.MethodsThe presented method is based on Probabilistic Topic Modeling, a statistical technique originally proposed for text documents. Probabilistic topic models are able to find in a document corpus the topics (recurrent themes) characterizing classes of documents. This technique, applied on DNA sequences representing the documents, exploits the frequency of fixed-length k-mers and builds a generative model for a training group of sequences. This generative model, obtained through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, is then used to classify a large set of genomic sequences.Results and conclusionsWe performed classification of over 7000 16S DNA barcode sequences taken from Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) repository, training probabilistic topic models. The proposed method is compared to the RDP tool and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm in a extensive set of trials using both complete sequences and short sequence snippets (from 400 bp to 25 bp). Our method reaches very similar results to RDP classifier and SVM for complete sequences. The most interesting results are obtained when short sequence snippets are considered. In these conditions the proposed method outperforms RDP and SVM with ultra short sequences and it exhibits a smooth decrease of performance, at every taxonomic level, when the sequence length is decreased.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4416183", "pubmed_id": "25916734", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-16-S6-S2", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1539969737", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["39526734", "4337597", "5696296", "6517747", "83047797", "7427058", "42805323", "221927", "15778849", "15624635", "39070882", "10057396", "6621019", "51373", "45169343", "17510294", "1373790", "9348817", "1268803", "77139", "6079026", "6387937", "7329111", "207561477", "2652480", "19002464", "20225164", "15413323", "14925035", "3177797", "13160178", "6009000", "2398806", "16371659", "918872", "5857385", "13832800", "60898467", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["90436562", "12739902", "49564100", "2645023", "14161483", "58589719", "16712827", "211215424", "11308839", "330984", "3845943", "214858576", "11175128"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10204971"}

In competition with biochemical means of modified-site recognition, computational methods are strong contenders in the prediction of SUMOylation-undergoing sites on proteins. In this research, physicochemical properties of amino acids retrieved from AAIndex, especially those involved in docking of modifier and target proteins and optimal presentation of target lysine, in combination with sequence information and random forest-based classifier presented in WEKA have been used to develop a prediction model, SUMOhunt, with statistics significantly better than all previous predictors.

Building on standard tools from numerical analysis we develop very efficient algorithms for inference and learning, as well as a customized technique adapted to the semantic segmentation task.

It is particularly important for the performance analysis of mobile networks. The study in this paper concerns predicting the traffic of mobile network, which is essentially nonlinear, dynamic and affected by immeasurable parameters and variables. The accurate analytical model of the traffic of the mobile network can be hardly obtained. Therefore a predicting method based on history input-output using correlation analysis ideas and Reservoir Computing (RC) is proposed. Correlation analysis is used to select proper input variables of the model. Reservoir Computing is a recent research area, in which a random recurrent topology is constructed, and only the weights of connections in a linear output layer is trained.

Technology trends have allowed for affordable and efficient collection of various sensor data in real time from the vehicle, its surroundings, and devices carried by the driver, such as smartphones. In this paper, we propose to use this sensory data to actively identify and authenticate the driver of a vehicle by determining characteristics which uniquely categorize individuals' driving behavior. Our approach is capable of continuously authenticating a driver throughout a driving session, as opposed to alternative approaches which are either performed offline or as a session starts. This means our modeling approach can be used to detect mid-session driving attacks, such as carjacking, which are beyond the scope of alternative driver authentication solutions. A simulated driving environment was used to collect sensory data of driver habits including steering wheel position and pedal pressure. These features are classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. Our pilot study with 10 human subjects shows that we can use various aspects of how a vehicle is operated to successfully identify a driver under 2.5 minutes with a 95% confidence interval and with at most one false positive per driving day.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CNSM.2016.7818453", "venue": "2016 12th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)", "journal": "2016 12th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2575645436", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["153361862", "108854559", "47291547", "17688156", "55066523", "107779796", "5971302", "4222121", "14485113", "17953649", "47291547", "15858039", "16454250", "2148236", "167042837", "12203625"], "inbound_citations": ["203605423", "202537519", "214641348"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17850081"}

The main objective of this paper is to assess ten machine-learning methods for automated detection of subjects with AF in the UK Biobank dataset.

The combined classical machine-learning and deep learning method achieved an F1 score of 84.8% on the test subset, and a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.83, which is similar to the inter-observer agreement of two human experts.

To control a device through BCI, neural signals of a user must be translated to meaningful control commands using various machine learning components, e.g. feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and classification, that should also be carefully designed for practical use. However, the noise and variability in the neural data pose one of the greatest challenges that in practice previously functioning BCI fails in the subsequent operation requiring re-tuning/optimization. This paper presents an idea of defining multiple feature spaces and optimal decision boundaries therein to account for noise and variability in data and improve a generalization of a learning machine. The spaces are defined in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces induced by a Radial Basis Gaussian function. Then the learning is done via L1-regularized Support Vector Machines. The central idea behind our approach is that a classifier predicts an unseen test examples by learning more rich feature spaces with a suite of optimal hyperparameters.

This study attempts to identify and characterize cognitive subtypes within the ASD population using our Functional Random Forest (FRF) machine learning classification model. This model trained a traditional random forest model on measures from seven tasks that reflect multiple levels of information processing. 47 ASD diagnosed and 58 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 9 and 13 participated in this study. Our RF model was 72.7% accurate, with 80.7% specificity and 63.1% sensitivity. Using the random forest model, the FRF then measures the proximity of each subject to every other subject, generating a distance matrix between participants. This matrix is then used in a community detection algorithm to identify subgroups within the ASD and TD groups, and revealed 3 ASD and 4 TD putative subgroups with unique behavioral profiles. We then examined differences in functional brain systems between diagnostic groups and putative subgroups using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI).

Starting with monocular image stream, our framework produces a 3D volumetric semantic + occupancy map, which is much more useful than a series of 2D semantic label images or a sparse point cloud produced by traditional semantic segmentation and Structure from Motion(SfM) pipelines respectively. We derive a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model defined in the 3D space, that jointly infers the semantic category and occupancy for each voxel. Such a joint inference in the 3D CRF paves the way for more informed priors and constraints, which is otherwise not possible if solved separately in their traditional frameworks.

In this context, we are interested in characterizing which microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expressions change in a coherent manner across the lifespan, and whether the co-expression pattern is affected by environmental exposures. miRNAs contribute to tumor progression via the regulation of post-transcriptional gene expressions. Thus, information on different interaction patterns among miRNAs and mRNAs measured in mammary tissues from chemical exposed vs. non-exposed rats can cast light on how chemical exposures may alter mammary gland development. Specifically, we consider three common environmental chemicals: diethyl phthalate (DEP), methyl paraben (MPB) and triclosan (TCS). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with these chemicals at four windows of susceptibility (prenatal, neonatal, prepubertal and pubertal) respectively with oral doses shown to produce urinary metabolite levels similar to those measured in US population. We implemented a new algorithm, Joint Random Forest (JRF), for simultaneous estimation of multiple related networks to characterize co-expression patterns among mRNAs and miRNAs. JRF is designed to borrow information across different treatment conditions, so that regulatory relationships shared across conditions can be detected with increased power, while those specific to each condition can be detected with fewer false positives. We focused on 1403 mRNAs and 283 miRNAs with larger variability across rats, and derived four co-expression networks of these mRNAs/miRNAs for each environmental chemical treatment plus a control group. Overall we observed a substantial loss of connectivity in networks of chemical exposed groups (DEP: 1813 edges, MPB: 1539 edges and TCS: 1013 edges) compared to that of the control group (2641 edges). Interestingly, despite the overall loss of connectivity in networks of chemical exposed groups, some microRNAs such as rno-miR-126b (MIMAT0017843) and rno-miR-3596b (MIMAT0017871) showed many connecting edges in networks of chemical exposed groups but zero in that of the control group. In particular, rno-miR-3596b is a member of the Let-7 family which is well known to regulate self-renewal and tumorigenicity in breast cancer cells. Findings like this can lead to better understanding of how chemical exposures could alter gene regulatory activities. Our study also demonstrates the great potential of using JRF to investigate changes in gene regulatory system across different conditions.

The study compares four prediction models, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest and naive-Bayes with two approaches for input to these models.

Since the introduction of face recognition, remarkable achievements have been made in academic researches and commercial applications. However, facial expression variations is one of the remaining challenges for recognition. Because existing face databases almost only store neutral faces, the variations in facial expressions can substantially degrade the recognition performance. It is especially the case for robots since the collected facial images from objects are more likely to contain various expressions in contrast to scenarios such as security check at the airport. Thus, for robot applications, ensuring the performance of expression-invariant face recognition is quite important. The key to expression-invariant face recognition is to eliminate the interference of expression variations. Therefore, we propose a GAN-based method called De-Expression Generative Adversarial Network (DEGAN). DEGAN improves the recognition performance by transforming the facial image with expression to its corresponding neutral one.

To address the above issues, we propose a novel approach to image annotation which simultaneously learns a semantic distance by capturing the prior annotation knowledge and propagates the annotation of an image as a whole entity. Specifically, a semantic distance function (SDF) is learned for each semantic cluster to measure the semantic similarity based on relative comparison relations of prior annotations. To annotate a new image, the training images in each cluster are ranked according to their SDF values with respect to this image and their corresponding annotations are then propagated to this image as a whole entity to ensure semantic coherence.

Paddy rice mapping algorithm through the Combined Consideration of Vegetation phenology and Surface water variations (CCVS) has been efficiently applied based on the 8day composites time series datasets. However, the great challenge for phenology-based algorithms introduced by unpromising data availability in middle/high spatial resolution imagery, such as frequent cloud cover and coarse temporal resolution, remained unsolved. This study addressed this challenge through developing an automatic and Adaptive paddy Rice Mapping Method (ARMM) based on the cloud frequency and spectral separability. The proposed ARMM method was tested on the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image (path/row 118/028) in the Songnen Plain in Northeast China in 2015. First, the whole study region was automatically and adaptively subdivided into undisturbed and disturbed regions through a per-pixel strategy based on Landsat image data availability during key phenological stage. Second, image objects were extracted from approximately cloud-free images in disturbed and undisturbed regions, respectively. Third, phenological metrics and other feature images from individual or multiple images were developed. Finally, a flexible automatic paddy rice mapping strategy was implemented. For undisturbed region, an object-oriented CCVS method was utilized to take the full advantages of phenology-based method.

The problem of predicting future or missing relationships in networks is called link prediction. Machine learning studies have mostly approached to this problem as a clustering or a classification task. A few obstacles might be involved in approaching network datasets through machine learning models, including undefined euclidean distance, extracting proper features, unbalanced data classes due to the sparsity of real networks, or embedding graphs to a low dimensional vector space while preserving the structure to study networks. Extensive studies have examined these problems from different aspects and proposed methods some of which might work very well for a specific application but not as a global solution. In this survey, we review the general-purpose techniques at the heart of link prediction problem, which can be combined with domain-specific heuristic methods in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive study which considers all of the mentioned challenges about studying networks and approaching them through machine learning models. We provide a diverse study on feature extraction techniques for network datasets based on similarity metrics, maximum likelihood methods, probabilistic methods and graph representation learning. Our other contributions include proposing a taxonomy to classify link prediction methods and continue with introducing valuable network dataset collections to study the problem of link prediction.

The PMC model assumes that each system's node is tested by a subset of the other nodes, and that at most t of these nodes are permanently faulty. Tests performed by faulty nodes are unreliable, and hence, they can incorrectly diagnose fault-free nodes as faulty or faulty ones as fault-free. In this paper, we describe a new nonlinear support vector machines-based (SVMs) diagnosis algorithm, which exploits the off-line learning phase of SVMs to speed up the diagnosis algorithm. The novel diagnosis approach has been implemented and evaluated using randomly generated diagnosable systems. Results from the thorough simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the nonlinear SVM-based fault diagnosis algorithm, in terms of diagnosis correctness, latency, and scalability.

By classifying paintings based on art movements, information about paintings on the web can be well structured. This will also help us garner insights into more obscure paintings and the styles they embody. This paper discusses a method of classifying paintings into two art movements, namely Cubism and Romanticism, using two texture descriptors: Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The paper also extends the applicability of the method to different classifiers. Some classifiers used for classification are KNN, NuSVC, LinearSVC, GaussNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost and Gradient Boost. A subset of the Pandora database is used as a dataset. From the results, it can be inferred that using the Gradient Boost classifier gives the highest overall accuracy for Cubism and Romanticism when LBP and HOG are used as texture descriptors.

However, this value can only be realised if accurate, quantitative data can be extracted from certificates-an aim hampered by both the volume and variable quality of certificates written in natural language. This paper proposes an automatic classification system for identifying all cancer related causes of death from death certificates. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Detailed features, including terms, n-grams and SNOMED CT concepts were extracted from a collection of 447,336 death certificates. The features were used as input to two different classification sub-systems: a machine learning sub-system using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a rule-based sub-system. A fusion sub-system then combines the results from SVMs and rules into a single final classification. A held-out test set was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the classifiers according to precision, recall and F-measure. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The system was highly effective at determining the type of cancers for both common cancers (F-measure of 0.85) and rare cancers (F-measure of 0.7). In general, rules performed superior to SVMs; however, the fusion method that combined the two was the most effective. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The system proposed in this study provides automatic identification and characterisation of cancers from large collections of free-text death certificates. This allows organisations such as Cancer Registries to monitor and report on cancer mortality in a timely and accurate manner. In addition, the methods and findings are generally applicable beyond cancer classification and to other sources of medical text besides death certificates.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29754799", "doi": "10.1016/j.artmed.2018.04.011", "venue": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "journal": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "mag_id": "2800235673", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["116426654", "54445685", "215370741"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21673697"}

In fact the human face expresses many of the individual\u2019s characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, emotion, age, beauty and health. Makeup is one of the common techniques used by people to alter the appearance of their faces. Analyzing face beauty by computer is essential to aestheticians and computer scientists. ::: The objective of this research is to detect makeup on images of human faces by image processing and pattern recognition techniques. Detecting changes of face, caused by cosmetics such as eye-shadow, lipstick and liquid foundation, are the targets of this study. Having a proper facial database that consists of the information related to makeup is necessary. Collecting the first facial makeup database was a valuable achievement for this research. This database consists of almost 1290 frontal pictures from 21 individuals before and after makeup. Along with the images, meta data such as ethnicity, country of origin, smoking habits, drinking habits, age, and job is provided. The uniqueness of this database stems from, first being the only database that has images of women both before and after makeup, and second because of having light-source from different angles as well as its meta data collected during the process. ::: Selecting the best features that lead to the best classification result is a challenging issue, since any variation in the head pose, lighting conditions and face orientation can add complexity to a proper evaluation of whether any makeup has been applied or not. In addition, the similarity of cosmetic\u2019s color to the skin color adds another level of difficulty. In this effort, by choosing the best possible features, related to edge information, color specification and texture characteristics this problem was addressed. Because hue and saturation and intensity can be studied separately in HSV (Hue, Saturation, and Value) color space, it is selected for this application. ::: The proposed technique is tested on 120 selected images from our new database. A supervised learning model called SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is used and the accuracy obtained is 90.62% for eye-shadow detection, 93.33% for lip-stick and 52.5% for liquid foundation detection respectively. A main highlight of this technique is to specify where makeup has been applied on the face, which can be used to identify the proper makeup style for the individual. This application will be a great improvement in the aesthetic field, through which aestheticians can facilitate their work by identifying the type of makeup appropriate for each person and giving the proper suggestions to the person involved by reducing the number of trials.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "49301500", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10514192", "31194819", "204815806", "14661554", "206743429", "67794994", "204802979"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107419272"}

We show that: the problem is not well defined unless we impose explicit or implicit constraints on either the coding or the decoding operator; orthogonality is not a property of the optimal solution under most constraints; and the signal components may or may not be reconstructed depending on the noise level. As the noise power increases, we observe rank reduction in the optimal solution under most reasonable constraints. In these cases it appears that it is preferable to omit the smaller signal components rather than attempting to reconstruct them.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), known to perform well in pattern recognition, may constitute an effective alternative to the traditional models. The objective of this research was to investigate how ANNs might be used to predict total milk, fat, and protein production for individual cows. Results indicated that ANNs generally performed at least as well overall as the model currently used by Canadian milk recording agencies, especially in the first third of lactation. This has important implications for early identification of superior animals. Predictions from both methods were relatively similar for the later stages of lactation. The addition of nontraditional data inputs such as average milk herd production and weight of cow improved the quality of prediction.

While effective, feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning (30-40\\%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets, leading to further degradation.

In general, change detection aims to identify interesting changes between a given query image and a reference image of the same scene taken at a different time. This problem becomes a challenging one when query and reference images involve different domains (e.g., time of the day, weather, and season) due to variations in object appearance and a limited amount of training examples. In this study, we address the above issue by leveraging a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our key concept is to use a limited amount of training data to train a GAN-based image translator that maps a reference image to a virtual image that cannot be discriminated from query domain images. This enables us to treat the cross-domain change detection task as an in-domain image comparison. This allows us to leverage the large body of literature on in-domain generic change detectors. In addition, we also consider the use of visual place recognition as a method for mining more appropriate reference images over the space of virtual images.

Human subject experiments were conducted, during which five physiological responses (hand skin temperature STh, hand skin conductance SCh, pulse rate PR, blood oxygen saturation SpO2, blood pressure BP) and four subjective responses (thermal comfort, thermal preference, humidity sensation, airflow sensation) were recorded in conjunction with a thermal sensation survey while environmental conditions varied from cold/cool to neutral levels (18\u00b0C \u2212 27 \u2218 C).

Prior work on prediction of mutagenicity has primarily involved identification of toxicophores rather than whole-molecule predictive models. In this work, we examined a range of in silico predictive classification models for prediction of mutagenic properties of compounds, including methods such as J48 and SMO which have not previously been widely applied in cheminformatics. The Bursi mutagenicity data set containing 4337 compounds (Set 1) and a Benchmark data set of 6512 compounds (Set 2) were taken as input data set in this work. A third data set (Set 3) was prepared by joining up the previous two sets. Classification algorithms including Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, J48 and SMO with 10 fold cross-validation and default parameters were used for model generation on these data sets. Models built using the combined performed better than those developed from the Benchmark data set. Significantly, Random Forest outperformed other classifiers for all the data sets, especially for Set 3 with 89.27% accuracy, 89% precision and ROC of 95.3%.

However, the existing sequence-based predictive models demonstrate moderate or unsatisfactory performance, and the gene ontology (GO) based models may take the risk of performance overestimation for novel proteins. Furthermore, many human proteins have multiple subcellular locations, which renders the computational modelling more complicated. Up to the present, there are far few researches specialized for predicting the subcellular localization of human proteins that may reside in multiple cellular compartments. In this paper, we propose a multi-label multi-kernel transfer learning model for human protein subcellular localization (MLMK-TLM). MLMK-TLM proposes a multi-label confusion matrix, formally formulates three multi-labelling performance measures and adapts one-against-all multi-class probabilistic outputs to multi-label learning scenario, based on which to further extends our published work GO-TLM (gene ontology based transfer learning model for protein subcellular localization) and MK-TLM (multi-kernel transfer learning based on Chou's PseAAC formulation for protein submitochondria localization) for multiplex human protein subcellular localization. With the advantages of proper homolog knowledge transfer, comprehensive survey of model performance for novel protein and multi-labelling capability, MLMK-TLM will gain more practical applicability. The experiments on human protein benchmark dataset show that MLMK-TLM significantly outperforms the baseline model and demonstrates good multi-labelling ability for novel human proteins.

Due to the absence of local order parameters, the detection of topological phase transitions remains a challenge. Machine learning may provide effective methods for identifying topological features. In this work, we show that manifold learning can successfully retrieve topological quantum phase transitions in momentum space. Our results show that the Chebyshev distance (CD) between two data points can successfully capture the main features of topological phase transitions, while the widely used Euclidean distance in general fails.

The methodology for soil moisture retrieval is based on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method specifically trained to be able to consider topographic effects of the mountain areas. The comparison with ground measurements collected during field campaigns indicates an RMSE value of around 5% of SMC% while the comparison with fixed ground stations reports an error of around 9% of SMC%. Comparing RADARSAT2 and ASAR SMC, both datasets reveal very similar distributions of SMC values. The cumulative histogram curve for the two datasets shows a slight underestimation of SMC in the ASAR product.

While there is a body of work on drowsiness detection using EEG signals in neuroscience and engineering, there exist unanswered questions pertaining to the best mechanisms to use for detecting drowsiness. Targeting a range of practical safety-awareness applications, this study adopts a machine learning based approach to build support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to distinguish between awake and drowsy states. While broadband alpha, beta, delta, and theta waves are often used as features in the existing work, lack of widely agreed precise definitions of such broadband signals and difficulty in accounting for interpersonal variability has led to poor classification performance as demonstrated in this study. Furthermore, the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness and deeper sleep stages is a complex multifaceted process. The richness of this process calls for inclusion of sub-band features for more accurate drowsiness detection. To shed light on the effectiveness of sub-banding, we quantitatively compare the performances of a large set of SVM classifiers trained upon a varying number of 1Hz sub band features.

In this paper, we propose an approach which categorizes web pages by exploiting plain text and text contained in HTML tags. Our method operates in two steps. In step 1, we use Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) to generate, for each target web page (page to classify), reduced vector representation based on plain text and text from HTML tags.

The intellectual base for the project is a synthesis of cognitive linguistics and structured connectionist modeling [1,2], centered on a three-part Embodiment Hypothesis: (1) many concepts are directly embodied in motor, perceptual, and other neural structures; (2) all other concepts derive their inferential structure via mappings from these embodied structures; and (3) structured connectionist models provide a suitable computational abstraction over such neurally grounded representations. We extend this with a Simulation Hypothesis, that language understanding exploits some of the same neural structures used for action, perception, imagination, memory and other cognitive processes, i.e., linguistic structures provide parameters for simulations drawing on these embodied structures. This talk focuses on the computational requirements for biologically plausible models of language understanding and acquisition. In particular, we explore the idea that the basic unit of linguistic representation is a construction, or mapping between form (sound, gestures, etc.) and meaning (embodied concepts motivated by biological structures and realizable as structured connectionist models). Constructions support a language understanding process modeled as having two distinct phases: utterances are first analyzed to determine which constructions are involved and how their corresponding meanings are related; the events and actions specified by the resulting network of related concepts (or semantic specification) are then simulated to produce inferences using embodied conceptual structures. Simulation itself relies on an active structure called an executing schema (or x-schema) [3]. X-schemas capture hierarchical structure, sequential flow, concurrency and other properties based on models of motor control but also necessary for event structure in general. Results of simulation are used to update a belief network representing the current context. We concentrate on two systems that show how a simulation-based approach to language understanding can drive disparate linguistic phenomena. The first of these is a model of metaphorical inference in news stories [3]. The basic model is extended so that simulationbased inferences in a source domain (e.g., using an x-schema for falling) are projected via metaphorical mappings (e.g., Falling Is Failure) to license inferences in more abstract target domains; the sentence \u201cFrance fell into a recession\u201d is thus understood to involve economic failure. The second model shows how partial interpretations of utterances in context can help children acquire their first multi-unit constructions, represented as structured mappings between linguistic forms and their embodied experience [4]. New mappings are hypothesized to capture bindings available in context but not licensed by an existing construction, and thus omitted from the (partial) semantic specification. Together these models show how embodied conceptual and linguistic structures can be integrated within a simulation-based framework to provide a common representational toolkit for language, cognition and action.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1142/9789812701886_0005", "venue": "Ninth Neural Computation and Psychology Workshop", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2333905457", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["58721903", "55494774", "5912182", "701332", "15913687", "6870264", "1274984", "123882578", "7423629", "210072739", "142299281", "164181279", "12268306", "2685363", "40912475", "16393183", "16444135", "59919842", "59724879"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18216023"}

First, superhigh-dimensional statistical features are extracted from continuous wavelet transform at different scales. The number of the statistical features extracted by using the proposed method is 920 so that the extracted statistical features are superhigh dimensional. To reduce the dimensionality of the extracted statistical features and generate new significant low-dimensional statistical features, a simple and effective method called principal component analysis is used. To further improve identification accuracies of different gear crack levels under different working conditions, support vector machine is employed. Three experiments are investigated to show the superiority of the proposed method. Comparisons with other existing gear crack level identification methods are conducted.

In order to enhance the safety and reliability of aircraft, the health state of the IMA must be estimated accurately. Since IMA is a real-time system, the estimation algorithm should have fast learning speed to satisfy the real-time requirement. In this paper, an enhanced deep extreme learning machine is developed to estimate the health states of IMA. First, the enhanced deep extreme learning machine is built in a novel fashion by using a dropout technique and extreme learning machine autoencoder. Second, multiple-enhanced deep extreme learning machines with different activation functions are employed to estimate the health states, simultaneously. Finally, a synthesis strategy is designed to combine all the results of different enhanced deep extreme learning machines.

In this article, we proposed transportation modes classification method based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to discover seven kinds of transportation modes from GPS trajectory data, including walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a taxi, driving a car, taking the subway and taking a train. First, the original trajectories must be divided into some sub trajectories. There is only one transportation mode label in each sub trajectory. Second, the feature vector of sub trajectory is computed including eight basic and three advanced features. These basic features are distance feature, five velocity-related features and two acceleration-related features. Three advanced features are heading change rate (hcr), stop rate (sr) and velocity change rate (vcr), Final, the LightGBM classifier is used to detect the transportation modes automatically. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and decision tree are also used to verify the efficiency of our method. The experiment data are Geolife provided by Microsoft Research Asia. The results show that the LightGBM and XGBoost methods are more accurate than decision tree method and the LightGBM is better than XGBoost at the classification of car, subway and train.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8557149", "venue": "2018 26th International Conference on Geoinformatics", "journal": "2018 26th International Conference on Geoinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2905242309", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4431030", "8190600", "60385584", "4650265", "3246681", "3815895", "112642214", "6306121", "7955044", "37508575", "13602937", "14512397", "30629974", "4227026", "526342", "6281798", "56089044", "203292316", "6491073", "207169246", "3219429", "2594813", "11149239", "2156441", "17866539", "7955044"], "inbound_citations": ["201810335"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54449447"}

But the noises and multi-scale nature of river inflow data adds an extra layer of complexity towards accurate predictive model. To overcome this issue, we proposed a hybrid model, Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), based on a singular spectrum analysis (SSA) denoising technique. First, SSA his applied to denoise the river inflow data. Second, VMD, a signal processing technique, is employed to decompose the denoised river inflow data into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each with a relative frequency scale. Third, Empirical Bayes Threshold (EBT) is applied on non-linear IMF to smooth out. Fourth, predicted models of denoised and decomposed IMFs are established by learning the feature values of the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, the ensemble predicted results are formulated by adding the predicted IMFs. The proposed model is demonstrated using daily river inflow data from four river stations of the Indus River Basin (IRB) system, which is the largest water system in Pakistan. To fully illustrate the superiority of our proposed approach, the SSA-VMD-EBT-SVM hybrid model was compared with SSA-VMD-SVM, VMD-SVM, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) based i.e., EMD-SVM, SSA-EMD-SVM, Ensemble EMD (EEMD) based i.e., EEMD-SVM and SSA-EEMD-SVM. We found that our proposed hybrid SSA-EBT-VMD-SVM model outperformed than others based on following performance measures: the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Horizon line is a promising visual cue which can be exploited for estimating the rover's position and orientation during planetary missions. By matching the horizon line detected in 2D images captured by the rover with virtually generated horizon lines from 3D terrain models e.g., Digital Elevation MapsDEMs, the localization problem can be solved in principle. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for horizon line detection using edge images and local features i.e., SIFT. Given an image, first we apply Canny edge detection using various parameters and keep only those edges which survive over a wide range of thresholds. We refer to these edges as Maximally Stable Extremal Edges MSEEs. Using ground truth information, we then train an Support Vector Machine SVM classifier to classify MSEE pixels into two categories: horizon and non-horizon. Each MSSE pixel is described using SIFT features which becomes input to the SVM classifier. Given a novel image, we use the same procedure to extract MSSEs; then, we classify each MSEE pixel as horizon or non-horizon using the SVM classifier. MSEE pixels classified as horizon are then provided to a Dynamic Programming shortest path finding algorithm which returns a consistent horizon line. In general, Dynamic Programming returns different solutions i.e., due to gaps when searching for the optimum horizon line in a left-to-right or right-to-left fashion. We use the actual output of the SVM classifier to resolve ambiguities in places where the left-to-right and right-to-left solutions are different. The final solution, is typically a combination of edge segments from the left-to-right or right-to-left solutions. Moreover, we use the SVM classifier to fill in small gaps in the horizon line; this is in contrast to the traditional dynamic programming approach which relies on mere interpolation.

With the large amounts of data companies collect, they are able to develop highly accurate models to predict the behaviours of their customers.

In addition, as this type of techniques finds its way into areas that need to deal with more sensitive information, like the medical industry, the privacy of the data that needs to be classified also has to be ensured. Herein, this topic is addressed by homomorphically evaluating Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, in a way that guarantees that a client learns nothing about the model except for the classification of his data, and that the service provider learns nothing about the data. Whereas, previously, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has mostly focused on either bit-wise or value-wise computations, SVMs present an additional challenge since they combine both: during an initial phase a kernel function is evaluated that makes use of real arithmetic, and during a second phase the sign bit has to be extracted. Novel techniques are herein proposed that allow for speedups of up to 2.7 and 6.6 for the evaluation of polynomials and the determination of sign, respectively, in comparison to the state of the art.

These attempts focused on the detection ofemotions from databases of video clips of users acquiredin controlled environments with deliberately displayedand exaggerated face expressions (e.g. the Kanade-Cohndatabase [4])and usuallyyieldedhighdetectionaccuracy.For example, [11] achieved accuracy values up tp 90%.However, althoughit appearsthat emotiondetection fromface videos can be performed with high accuracy, recentresearch performedon spontaneousfacial expressions (assurveyed by [12]) report lower accuracy. For example,[1], report a drop of the average accuracy from 86 % to65 % when detecting face expressions in posed and spon-taneous datasets.In this paper we present the results of the comparisonof an emotion detection technique on a posed database(the Kanade-Cohn database [4]) and on a spontaneousdatabase (the LDOS-PerAff-1 database [7])1.1 Related workGenerally the approach taken in related work in auto-matic detection of emotions from video clips of users\u2019faces is composed of three stages: (i) a preprocessingstage, (ii) the low level features extraction stage and (iii)the classi\ufb01cation stage. Related work differ mostly in thelast two stages.[1, 11, 13] used Gabor wavelets based features foremotion detection. Beside these, which are mostly used,[13] report the usage of other facial features in relatedwork: active appearance models (AAM), action units,various facial points and motion units, Haar based fea-tures and textures.Various classi\ufb01cation schemes were used success-fully in video emotion detection. [1] employed both theSupport Vector Machine (SVM) and AdaBoost classi-\ufb01ers. [13] used the k- nearest neighbours (k-NN) algo-rithm. Before using the classi\ufb01er they performed a di-mensionality reduction step using the locality preservingprojection (LPP) technique. In their work [11] comparedfour classi\ufb01ers: the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM),the k-NN, neural networks (NN) and Fisher\u2019s Linear Dis-criminant Analysis (FLDA). The latter turned out to yieldthe best performance. The survey [12] reports the use ofother classi\ufb01ers like the C4.5, Bayes Net and rule basedclassi\ufb01ers.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "112895525", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53802648"}

Methods: An innovative technique called Position Balanced Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PB-PPSO) method is introduced for allocating resources. The main intent of PB-PPSO is to find the optimized resources for the set of tasks with less make span and minimum price. The set of rules are generated from the optimized resources for the training process. In the testing process, the resources are allocated to the new users by learning the rules from the training process. Results: PB-PPSO method shows high profit when compared to the existing methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In the PB-PPSO method, the optimized set of resources is determined for the set of tasks by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then the rules are generated for the classification process. If the arrival rate of users is 500, the total profit is 720$ and the response time is 78ms. Based on the comparison and the results from the experiment shows the proposed approach works better than the other existing systems with high profit and less average response time.

There are a lot of modelling techniques that have been discovered by researchers. In this paper, the optimize settings of performance parameters; surface roughness and MRR are done by the Taguchi technique and the experimental result of MRR and SR was predicted by the Multi-layer Feed forward Neural network (MFNN) and Least square support vector machine (LSSVM). For Taguchi analysis three process parameters and two responses, MRR and SR were considered by L18 orthogonal array design and ANOVA result were performed. EN19 material used as the work piece for the experiment. After evaluating MFNN and LSSVM models, the best network found to be Least square support vector machine with RBF kernel.

We conduct 10-fold cross validation and split validation for the experiment. Based on the result, we conclude that SVM-SMO classifier gives the best performance. In the 10-fold cross validation, the result shows that the accuracy of NB, J48, KNN and SVM-SMO are 80.2%, 80.8%, 68.1%, and 85.5% respectively. The same conclusion is also demonstrated by the split validation, the highest accuracy of 86% is also achieved by SVM-SMO.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/isemantic.2016.7873824", "venue": "2016 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (ISemantic)", "journal": "2016 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (ISemantic)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2593930476", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["56303412", "1260035", "25561558", "3914992", "15088940", "54027976", "14782005", "14114922", "30551180", "16256910", "38166371", "2427083"], "inbound_citations": ["55767447", "70282047", "54442713", "54221531", "215722500", "197642462"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18853628"}

First, we perform automatic border detection to delineate the lesion from the background skin. Shape features are then extracted from this border, while colour and texture features are obtained based on a division of the image into clinically significant regions. The derived features are then used in a pattern classification stage for which we employ a dedicated ensemble learning approach to address the class imbalance in the training data. Our classifier committee trains individual classifiers on balanced subspaces, removes redundant predictors based on a diversity measure and combines the remaining classifiers using a neural network fuser.

The self-tuning capability of the fuzzy logic controller is attained by taking advantage of the structural equivalence between the fuzzy logic controller and a counterpropagation network. The second control structure is a more familiar neural adaptive controller based on a feedforward (MLP) network. The neural controller learns the inverse dynamics of the robot joints, and gradually eliminates the model uncertainties and disturbances. Both schemes cooperate with the computed torque control algorithm, and in that way the reduction of their complexity is achieved.

These techniques produce a single multi-class classification decision based on many binary decisions. Our work relies on the simple observation that as dimensionality increases so does the data sparsity and, consequently, a single binary classifier may separate multiple classes. Therefore, we claim that the number of binary decisions can be significantly reduced. We present Divide and Conquer Support Vector Machines (DCSVM), an efficient algorithm for multi-class classification using Support Vector Machines. DCSVM is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on data sparsity in high dimensional space and performs a smart partitioning of the whole training data set into disjoint subsets that are easily separable. A single prediction performed between two partitions eliminates at once one or more classes in one partition, leaving only a reduced number of candidate classes for subsequent steps. The algorithm continues recursively, reducing the number of classes at each step, until a final binary decision is made between the last two classes left in the competition.

In this study we construct two ensemble models for demand prediction with and without accounting for demand censorship. Accounting for sales censorship is based on the idea of censored quantile regression method where the model estimation is splitted on two separate parts: a) prediction of zero sales by classification model; and b) prediction of non-zero sales by regression model. Models with and without accounting for censorship are based on the predictions aggregations of Least squares, Ridge and Lasso regressions and Random Forest model.

There are two main problems, which limit the performance of existing algorithms. The first one is that no appropriate congestion-related feature can reflect the real density in scenes. Though deep learning has been proved to be capable of extracting high level semantic representations, it is hard to converge on regression tasks, since the label is too weak to guide the learning of parameters in practice. Thus, many approaches utilize additional information, such as a density map, to guide the learning, which increases the effort of labeling. Another problem is that most existing methods are composed of several steps, for example, feature extraction and regression. Since the steps in the pipeline are separated, these methods face the problem of complex optimization.

However, contrary to current approaches, we assume that the surrounding thermodynamical conditions are informative for prediction. For that, a model was developed for each location, including in its training information of sensor readings of all other locations, autonomously selecting the most relevant ones (algorithm dependent). We evaluated our approach by training regression and classification models using several machine learning algorithms, many already proposed in the literature for the frost prediction problem, over data from five meteorological stations spread along the Mendoza Province of Argentina. Given the scarcity of frost events, data was augmented using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The experimental results show that selecting the most relevant neighbors and training the models with SMOTE reduces the prediction errors of both regression predictors for all five locations, increases the performance of Random Forest classification predictors for four locations while keeping it unchanged for the remaining one, and produces inconclusive results for logistic regression predictor.

To fill this gap, in this study, a geochemical parent material classification scheme was tested on the watershed area of Lake Balaton, for which soil maps at a finer scale have not yet been created. A parent material map was prepared on the basis of a 1:100 000 surface geology map in order to make the incorporation of soil modelling and mapping possible. Legacy data of 12400 soil sample points was used in order to examine the role of geology in the quantitative distribution of some soil properties and element content (liquid limit, soil organic carbon, pH(KCL), CaCO3, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn). Results confirm that the SiO2 content of the parent material influences the properties of the derived soils. In the second part of the study Random Forest models were developed for three major soil properties (liquid limit, soil organic carbon, pH) with the use of additional environmental covariates: elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic position index (TPI), annual average temperature, annual average precipitation, remote sensing based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover information. The performance and accuracy of the models were evaluated on the basis of the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE), calculated on a randomly selected validation dataset (20% of the database). The models performed with R2 values of 0.72, 0.6 and 0.68 for liquid limit, soil organic carbon and pH respectively.

To address this, here we propose an unsupervised ischemia detection (UID) method which relies on the inherent spatio-temporal correlation between oxygenation and wall motion to formalize a joint learning and detection problem based on dictionary decomposition. Considering input data of a single subject, it treats ischemia as an anomaly and iteratively learns dictionaries to represent only normal observations (corresponding to myocardial territories remote to ischemia). Anomaly detection is based on a modified version of One-class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) to regulate directly the margins by incorporating the dictionary-based representation errors. A measure of ischemic extent (IE) is estimated, reflecting the relative portion of the myocardium affected by ischemia. For visualization purposes an ischemia likelihood map is created by estimating posterior probabilities from the OCSVM outputs, thus obtaining how likely the classification is correct. UID is evaluated on synthetic data and in a 2D CP-BOLD data set from a canine experimental model emulating acute coronary syndromes. Comparing early ischemic territories identified with UID against infarct territories (after several hours of ischemia), we find that IE, as measured by UID, is highly correlated (Pearson's r=0.84) with respect to infarct size.

However, it has some disadvantages, including being ineffective at handling non-Gaussian noise as well as being sensitive to outliers. In this paper, a robust LS-SVM method is proposed and is shown to have more reliable performance when modeling a nonlinear system under conditions where Gaussian or non-Gaussian noise is present. The construction of a new objective function allows for a reduction of the mean of the modeling error as well as the minimization of its variance, and it does not constrain the mean of the modeling error to zero. This differs from the traditional LS-SVM, which uses a worst-case scenario approach in order to minimize the modeling error and constrains the mean of the modeling error to zero. In doing so, the proposed method takes the modeling error distribution information into consideration and is thus less conservative and more robust in regards to random noise. A solving method is then developed in order to determine the optimal parameters for the proposed robust LS-SVM. An additional analysis indicates that the proposed LS-SVM gives a smaller weight to a large-error training sample and a larger weight to a small-error training sample, and is thus more robust than the traditional LS-SVM.

To represent color images efficiently, without prior feature extraction, the weight values linked to a neuron are determined by a 2-D Gaussian function. The activation of a neuron by an image presents the properties of a nonlinear localized receptive field, parameterized with a small number of degrees of freedom. A network composed of a large number of neurons, each associated with a randomly initialized and constant receptive field, induces a remarkable representation of the images. Supervised training determines only the output weights of the network. It is therefore extremely fast, without retropropagation or iterations, adapted to large sets of images.

Conventionally, like most neural networks, both of the aforementioned RNN variants employ the Softmax function as its final output layer for its prediction, and the cross-entropy function for computing its loss. In this paper, we present an amendment to this norm by introducing linear support vector machine (SVM) as the replacement for Softmax in the final output layer of a GRU model.

This paper presents a text mining system for detecting admissions marked as positive for several diseases: Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer, Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Respiratory and Digestive Organs, Multiple Myeloma and Malignant Plasma Cell Neoplasms, Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Embolism. We specifically examine the effect of linking multiple data sources on text classification performance. Methods Support Vector Machine classifiers are built for eight data source combinations, and evaluated using the metrics of Precision, Recall and F-Score. Sub-sampling techniques are used to address unbalanced datasets of medical records. We use radiology reports as an initial data source and add other sources, such as pathology reports and patient and hospital admission data, in order to assess the research question regarding the impact of the value of multiple data sources. Statistical significance is measured using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A second set of experiments explores aspects of the system in greater depth, focusing on Lung Cancer. We explore the impact of feature selection; analyse the learning curve; examine the effect of restricting admissions to only those containing reports from all data sources; and examine the impact of reducing the sub-sampling. These experiments provide better understanding of how to best apply text classification in the context of imbalanced data of variable completeness. Results Radiology questions plus patient and hospital admission data contribute valuable information for detecting most of the diseases, significantly improving performance when added to radiology reports alone or to the combination of radiology and pathology reports.

Ear, a viable new class of biometrics, has certain advantages over other biometrics (e.g. face and fingerprint). An ear can be imaged in 3D using a range sensor and it contains shape information, which makes it possible to develop a robust 3D ear biometrics. In this dissertation, we propose a human recognition system using 3D ear biometrics. These algorithms include: (1) Precise localization of 3D ears: We propose a two-step approach that uses a single reference 3D shape model for precise localization of ear in the 3D range image and the registered color images. In the first step color and range images are fused to locate regions-of-interest (ROIs). In the second step, the reference 3D shape model is adapted to the image by following a global-to-local registration procedure. The local deformation drives the initial global registration towards the target with the topology of the shape model preserved. (2) 3D ear recognition: We propose two representations for ear recognition. These include the ear helix/anti-helix representation obtained from the detection algorithm and the local surface patch (LSP) representation. A local surface descriptor is characterized by a centroid, a local surface type and a 2D histogram. Both shape representations are used to estimate the initial rigid transformation and then an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is run for the verification. (3) Rapid 3D ear recognition: We propose a novel method for rapid 3D ear recognition which combines the feature embedding and the machine learning techniques. The FastMap algorithm embeds LSPs into a low-dimensional space with distance relationships preserved. By searching the nearest neighbors in low dimensions, the similarity between a model-test pair is computed. The similarities for all model-test pairs are ranked using the Support Vector Machines rank learning algorithm to generate a short list of candidate models for verification. ::: The experimental results on the UCR dataset of 155 subjects with 902 images under pose variations and the University of Notre Dame dataset of 302 subjects with time-lapse gallery-probe pairs are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the system.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2460534907", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123925042"}

Application of the SVM method to a children's dataset (68 normal healthy and 88 with spastic diplegia form of CP) and testing on tenfold cross-validation scheme demonstrated that an SVM classifier was able to classify the children groups with an overall accuracy of 83.33% [sensitivity 82.95%, specificity 83.82%, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC=0.88)]. Classification accuracy improved significantly when the gait parameters were normalized by the individual leg length and age, leading to an overall accuracy of 96.80% (sensitivity 94.32%, specificity 100%, AUC-DROC area=0.9924). This accuracy result was, respectively, 3.21% and 1.93% higher when compared to an linear discriminant analysis and an multilayer-perceptron-based classifier.

Several hybrid fuzzyneuro techniques have already proved to be very useful for this purpose, one of them being the fuzzy neural networks. Fuzzy neural networks have important and useful features, such as: adaptive learning, good generalisation, good explanation facilities in form of fuzzy rules, abilities to accommodate both data and existing knowledge about the problem, ability to act autonomously in a dynamically changing environment. In order to design and train a fuzzy neural network for a particular task in a dynamically changing environment, one need to carefully investigate the type of the dynamics, and the level of chaos in the analysed process. This chapter introduces a way of using both chaos theory and a particular fuzzy neural network, called FuNN, for building adaptive, intelligent multimodular systems. A properly designed and trained FuNN can structurally capture major characteristics of a complex process under control. The use of this methodology for building intelligent adaptive systems is illustrated through examples from control and prediction.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4615-6191-0_9", "venue": "Intelligent Hybrid Systems", "journal": "Intelligent Hybrid Systems", "mag_id": "9948832", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17279937", "108174461"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59758107"}

Initialized with a small number of labeled samples, semi-supervised learning treats each new sample as unlabeled data. Classification of new data and updating of the classifier are achieved simultaneously in a co-training framework. The object is represented using independent features and an online support vector machine (SVM) is built for each feature. The predictions from different features are fused by combining the confidence map from each classifier using a classifier weighting method which creates a final classifier that performs better than any classifier based on a single feature. The semi-supervised learning approach then uses the output of the combined confidence map to generate new samples and update the SVMs online. With this approach, the tracker gains increasing knowledge of the object and background and continually improves itself over time. Compared to other discriminative trackers, the online semi-supervised learning approach improves each individual classifier using the information from other features, thus leading to a more robust tracker.

Formulas of the extended calculus are proved to be equivalent in a very strong sense to symmetric networks (like Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines), and efficient algorithms are given for translating back and forth between the two forms of knowledge representation. A fast learning procedure is presented that allows symmetric networks to learn representations of unknown logic formulas by looking at examples. A connectionist inference engine is then sketched whose knowledge is either compiled from a symbolic representation or learned inductively from training examples. Experiments with large scale randomly generated formulas suggest that the parallel local search that is executed by the networks is extremely fast on average.

Line-bisection is a standard test for visuospatial neglect, in which the patient is required to mark the centre of a straight line; in neglect caused by right-hemisphere (RH) damage, bisection points tend to be displaced to the right of centre. Models of neglect have been focussed on dysfunctions following RH damage; however, patients with comparable damage to the left hemisphere (LH) typically present with a different pattern of deficits: (a) damage to the LH less often results in visuospatial neglect, or results in smaller, more variable displacements in line-bisection; (b) when damage to the LH results in neglect, recovery is generally quicker; and (c) damage to the LH often results in neglect dyslexia without more general visuospatial neglect.

Data stream is continuous, ordered sequence of data instances arriving at a rapid rate. One of the key challenges while learning from data streams is the detection of concept drift, i.e., changes in data distribution underlying data streams, observed over time. Drifts being either gradual or sudden, several algorithms have been put forward for detection of different kinds of drift. However, most of them work on only one of these kinds of drift. These algorithms show hampered output if different types of drift are mixed. To solve this issue, there is need of a single system that can handle all drifts simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a system that detects both kinds of drift efficiently. Our system combines features of the online classifier as well as a blockbased classifier to achieve the goal. We further analyzed drifts to find out missing values of attributes to be the root cause.

Physicians make diagnoses by visual examination of ECGs. Analysing huge amounts of ECGs however, can be very time consuming and cumbersome. Hence, developing analytic software is of great importance to automatically analyse these ECG signals to detect efficiently the common cardiac arrhythmias. Methods: Proposed an ensemble learning approach for automatic processing of ECG signals and classification of arrhythmias. Twenty six features (based on wavelets, heartbeat intervals, and RR-intervals) are extracted and three algorithms, namely, Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are utilized for classification. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on ECG signals from 44 recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The overall classification accuracy of the RF, AdaBoost, and ANN are 96.16%, 96.16% and 94.49%, respectively. Additionally, the overall classification accuracy of the ensemble model is improved to 96.18%. Conclusion: Experimental results show that the performance of the ensemble model for ECG heartbeat classification improves the overall accuracy.

In this paper, we observe that seminal works do not perform well, since the quality of pseudo labels on unlabeled data is quite poor, especially when the amount of unlabeled data is significantly larger than that of labeled data. We believe that the quality of pseudo labels is the bottleneck of adversarial learning with unlabeled data. To tackle this bottleneck, we leverage deep co-training, which trains two deep networks and encourages two networks diverged by exploiting peer's adversarial examples. Based on deep co-training, we propose robust co-training (RCT) for adversarial learning with unlabeled data. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets.

During training, the network has only access to data of one task at a time, where each task contains several classes. In this setting, networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting which refers to the drastic drop in performance on previous tasks. The vast majority of methods have studied this scenario for classification networks, where for each new task the classification layer of the network must be augmented with additional weights to make room for the newly added classes. Embedding networks have the advantage that new classes can be naturally included into the network without adding new weights. Therefore, we study incremental learning for embedding networks. In addition, we propose a new method to estimate the drift, called semantic drift, of features and compensate for it without the need of any exemplars. We approximate the drift of previous tasks based on the drift that is experienced by current task data. We perform experiments on fine-grained datasets, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-Subset.

Differential pressure is one of the most important parameters, and accurate acquisition of differential pressure information is of great significance for the flow characteristics analysis and flow state monitoring in these equipments. In the differential pressure acquisition system with small-size pipe, the transmission tube has an approximate geometric scale with the measured pipe. It is necessary to study the dynamic characteristics of differential pressure signals in small-size pipe. In this work, a differential pressure acquisition system is designed and the dynamic characteristics of differential pressure signals for gas-liquid two phase flow in the pipe with 4.0 mm inner diameter are analysed. Then the characteristic vectors are extracted by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). And the flow regime identification is implemented by Support Vector Machines (SVM). The experimental results show that the differential pressure signals can reflect the flow state and can be used in flow regime identification effectively.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ChiCC.2016.7554139", "venue": "2016 35th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)", "journal": "2016 35th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2509488590", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["101504749", "110615255", "124165638", "96255620"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28375711"}

The proposed architecture is based on the Reservoir Computing paradigm for training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It is composed of two randomly generated RNNs (called reservoirs), one for modeling the localization capability and one for learning the navigation skill. The localization module is trained to detect the current and previously visited robot rooms based only on 8 noisy infra-red distance sensors. These predictions together with distance sensors and the desired goal location are used by the navigation network to actually steer the robot through the environment in a goal-oriented manner.

Multiple Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, acquired from the human heart in different states such as in fear, during exercise, etc. are used for simulations. The ECG signals are composed of P, Q, R, S and T waves. They are characterized by several parameters and the important information relies on its HRV (Heart Rate Variability). Human interpretation of such signals requires experience and incorrect readings could result in potentially life threatening and even fatal consequences. Thus a proper interpretation of ECG signals is of paramount importance. This work focuses on designing a machine based classification algorithm for ECG signals. The proposed algorithm filters the ECG signals to reduce the effects of noise. It then uses the Fourier transform to transform the signals into the frequency domain for analysis. The frequency domain signal is then cross correlated with predefined classes of ECG signals, in a manner similar to pattern recognition. The correlated co-efficients generated are then thresholded. Moreover Linear Discriminant Analysis is also applied. Linear Discriminant Analysis makes classes of different multiple ECG signals. LDA makes classes on the basis of mean, global mean, mean subtraction, transpose, covariance, probability and frequencies. And also setting thresholds for the classes. The distributed space area is divided into regions corresponding to each of the classes. Each region associated with a class is defined by its thresholds. So it is useful in distinguishing ECG signals from each other. And pedantic details from LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) output graph can be easily taken in account rapidly. The output generated after applying cross-correlation and LDA displays either normal, fear, smoking or exercise ECG signal. As a result, the system can help clinically on large scale by providing reliable and accurate classification in a fast and computationally efficient manner. The doctors can use this system by gaining more efficiency.

Computer aided diagnosis plays a vital role in all clinical diagnosis and hence used in the proposed work for detection of breast cancer.

The non-Local means filter had been used as it provides the highest PSNR values. Fuzzy clustering method is applied for the segmentation of the denoised image. After segmenting the image into set of clusters fuzzy level set algorithm is applied for more accurate detection of edges in the tumour region. PSNR value of 35.86dB had been obtained after denoising using Non Local mean filter. The mean, entropy and standard deviation parameters are analyzed for the different cluster size of the benign and malignant image. From the results it had been observed that the cluster size 4 provides better segmentation as it provides almost constant parameters for different images. From the cluster that belongs to the region of interest, fuzzy level set algorithm had been applied for minute edge detection. The segmented image after applying fuzzy level set provides better perception compared to the image without level set.

Although these SVR models were accurate on the basis of global prediction statistics and not prone to overfitting, they were found to consistently mispredict highly potent compounds.

Here we examined whether genetic diversity affected hatchability, a population parameter related to reproductive success, in the populations of two pond-breeding amphibian species (Hynobius tokyoensis and Rana ornativentris) affected by urbanization. We surveyed 81 populations in the southwestern Kanto region of Japan. Mean hatchability of the populations was determined and genetic diversities were estimated via mitochondrial or microsatellite DNA analyses. Firstly, Random Forests (an ensemble machine learning method) models were applied to clarify the effects of environmental factors on both hatchability and genetic diversity.

However, autonomous vehicles is a hot field of research both in academic and industrial sectors and entails a step beyond ADAS. Particularly, several challenges arise from autonomous navigation in urban scenarios due to their naturalistic complexity in terms of structure and dynamic participants (e.g. pedestrians, vehicles, vegetation, etc.). Hence, providing image understanding capabilities to autonomous robotics platforms is an essential target because cameras can capture the 3D scene as perceived by a human. In fact, given this need for 3D scene understanding, there is an increasing interest on joint objects and scene labeling in the form of geometry and semantic inference of the relevant entities contained in urban environments. In this regard, this Thesis tackles two challenges: 1) the prediction of road intersections geometry and, 2) the detection and orientation estimation of cars, pedestrians and cyclists. Different features extracted from stereo images of the KITTI public urban dataset are employed. This Thesis proposes a supervised learning of discriminative models that rely on strong machine learning techniques for data mining visual features. For the first task, we use 2D occupancy grid maps that are built from the stereo sequences captured by a moving vehicle in a mid-sized city. Based on these bird?s eye view images, we propose a smart parameterization of the layout of straight roads and 4 intersecting roads. The dependencies between the proposed discrete random variables that define the layouts are represented with Probabilistic Graphical Models. Then, the problem is formulated as a structured prediction, in which we employ Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for learning and convex Belief Propagation (dcBP) and Branch and Bound (BB) for inference. For the validation of the proposed methodology, a set of tests are carried out, which are based on real images and synthetic images with varying levels of random noise. In relation to the object detection and orientation estimation challenge in road scenes, this Thesis goal is to compete in the international challenge known as KITTI evaluation benchmark, which encourages researchers to push forward the current state of the art on visual recognition methods, particularized for 3D urban scene understanding. This Thesis proposes to modify the successful part-based object detector known as DPM in order to learn richer models from 2.5D data (color and disparity). Therefore, we revisit the DPM framework, which is based on HOG features and mixture models trained with a latent SVM formulation. Next, this Thesis performs a set of modifications on top of DPM: I) An extension to the DPM training pipeline that accounts for 3D-aware features. II) A detailed analysis of the supervised parameter learning. III) Two additional approaches: \"feature whitening\" and \"stereo consistency check\". Additionally, a) we analyze the KITTI dataset and several subtleties regarding to the evaluation protocol; b) a large set of cross-validated experiments show the performance of our contributions and, c) finally, our best performing approach is publicly ranked on the KITTI website, being the first one that reports results with stereo data, yielding an increased object detection precision (3%-6%) for the class 'car' and ranking first for the class cyclist.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2627075150", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114751932"}

To understand how these models make predictions, people routinely turn to feature importance measures calculated from tree ensembles. It has long been known that Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), one of the most widely used measures of feature importance, incorrectly assigns high importance to noisy features, leading to systematic bias in feature selection. In this paper, we address the feature selection bias of MDI from both theoretical and methodological perspectives. Based on the original definition of MDI by Breiman et al. for a single tree, we derive a tight non-asymptotic bound on the expected bias of MDI importance of noisy features, showing that deep trees have higher (expected) feature selection bias than shallow ones. However, it is not clear how to reduce the bias of MDI using its existing analytical expression. We derive a new analytical expression for MDI, and based on this new expression, we are able to propose a debiased MDI feature importance measure using out-of-bag samples, called MDI-oob.

The increasing interest in sentiment classification of product reviews is due to its potential application for improving e-commerce services and quality of the products. However, in realistic e-commerce environments, the review-related data are imbalanced, and this leads to a problem in which minority class information tends to be ignored during the training phase of a classification model. To address this problem, we propose a topic sentence-based instance transfer method to process imbalanced Chinese product reviews by using an auxiliary dataset (source dataset). The proposed method incorporates a rule and supervised learning hybrid approach to identify a topic sentence of each product review and adds the feature set of the topic sentence to the feature space of sentiment classification. Next, to measure the transferability of instances in source dataset, a greedy algorithm based on information gain of top-N common features is used to select common features. Then, a common feature-based cosine similarity of instances between source dataset and target dataset is introduced to select the transferable instances. Furthermore, a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (Smote) based method is adopted to overcome feature space inconsistency between the source dataset and target dataset. Finally, we immigrate the instances selected in source dataset into target dataset to form a new dataset for the training of classification model. Two datasets collected from Jingdong and Dangdang are the target dataset and source dataset.

We specifically tested whether dispersal is a better predictor of the distribution of M. tuberculata than climatic predictors. We sampled occurrence records of M. tuberculata to build SDMs and used the distance of each cell to the nearest river (river distance) as a predictor for dispersal. In addition, three bioclimatic predictors that quantify temperature and precipitation were used. We applied five different algorithms (BioClim, Domain, Maxent, SVM, and Random Forest) to model the distribution of M. tuberculata and evaluate the relative influence of each predictor variable.

To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning architecture: Tensor-Generative Adversarial Network (TGAN). We first introduce a transform-based 3D tensor to model fingerprint samples. Instead of those passive methods that construct a fingerprint database as a prior, our model applies artificial neural network with deep learning to train network classifiers and then gives out estimations.

As there are usually multiple relevant domains where knowledge can be transferred, Multiple Source Transfer Learning (MSTL) has recently attracted much attention. Most existing MSTL methods work in an offline fashion in that they have to store all the data on the target domain before learning. However, in some time-critical applications where the data arrive sequentially in large volume, a fast and scalable online method that can transfer knowledge from multiple source domains is much needed. To achieve this end, in this paper, we propose a new framework of Online Multiple Source Transfer Learning (OMS-TL). The framework is based on a convex optimization problem where knowledge transferred from multiple source domains are guided by the information on the target domain.

Negation as Failure (NAF) is a key feature of logic programming which provides a means for nonmonotonic commonsense reasoning under incomplete information. But, so far, most ILP research has been aimed at Horn programs which exclude NAF, and has failed to exploit the full potential of normal programs that allow NAF. By contrast, Abductive Logic Programming (ALP), a related task concerned with explaining observations with respect to a prior theory, has been well studied and applied in the context of normal logic programs. This paper shows how ALP can be used to provide a semantics and proof procedure for nonmonotonic ILP that utilises practical methods of language and search bias to reduce the search space. This is done by lifting an existing method called Hybrid Abductive Inductive Learning (HAIL) from Horn clauses to normal logic programs. To demonstrate its potential benefits, the resulting system, called XHAIL, is applied to a process modelling case study involving a nonmonotonic temporal Event Calculus (EC).", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jal.2008.10.007", "venue": "Journal of Applied Logic", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2009605580", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["11995608", "13350060", "5455272", "14270899", "54857474", "117211232", "26009859", "14991696", "10699982", "15400830", "20622975", "2347104", "10334976", "13036056", "15108829", "23601261", "5053470", "89629033", "5519349", "45006221", "35814534", "7584513", "7246502", "7523281", "17143571", "2823033", "15552348", "9597291", "36661198", "2566977", "12643399", "38178923", "16762143", "44432372", "2575228", "2410211", "44552883", "29986245", "54775", "16338450", "43168195", "11699875", "4606702", "17563330", "22032566", "11984980", "28529002"], "inbound_citations": ["11074103", "8559830", "46959502", "2780275", "10657679", "25753348", "1423183", "7838560", "4999536", "20506195", "7046031", "7882851", "2310169", "1446373", "5990064", "149453147", "7079015", "4659133", "34330178", "14129954", "17267103", "146808060", "15763402", "19276517", "17634232", "3544741", "5328978", "199466116", "16828489", "208880102", "14013222", "7859284", "12930742", "13971520", "43083164", "52008469", "11922968", "109937104", "69818597", "12576714", "53138326", "5240128", "16010463", "13576632", "33402134", "198147980", "2766761", "208542245", "195769632", "52096454", "761187", "27909514", "3451584", "16417254", "17047395", "16154576", "52910196", "7883027", "3333461", "1078214", "199527086", "1389718", "18328579", "19698451", "5564943", "4973098", "15899642", "53875806", "11347607", "6893970", "10067526", "34141297", "58109586"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18449335"}

We investigated the impact of metronidazole (MET) and metronidazole plus azithromycin (MET+AZ) on the microbiota in pediatric CD, and the use of microbiota features as classifiers or predictors of disease remission. Methods 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling was performed on stool samples from a multinational, randomized, controlled, longitudinal, 12-week trial of MET vs. MET+AZ in children with mild to moderate CD. Profiles were analyzed together with disease activity, and then used to construct Random Forest classification models to classify remission or predict treatment response. Results Both MET and MET+AZ significantly decreased diversity of the microbiota and caused large treatment-specific shifts in microbiota structure at week 4. Disease remission was associated with a treatment-specific microbiota configuration. Random Forest models constructed from microbiota profiles pre- and during antibiotic treatment with metronidazole accurately classified disease remission in this treatment group (AUC of 0.879, 95% CI 0.683, 0.9877; sensitivity 0.7778; specificity 1.000, P < 0.001). A Random Forest model trained on pre-antibiotic microbiota profiles predicted disease remission at week 4 with modest accuracy (AUC of 0.8, P = 0.24). Conclusions MET and MET+AZ antibiotic regimens lead to distinct gut microbiota structures at remission. It may be possible to classify and predict remission based in part on microbiota profiles, but larger cohorts will be needed to realize this goal.

Serving as input in image classification, airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data measuring approximately 72 km2 was provided by DREAM LiDAR. Combinations of multi-threshold and multiresolution segmentation enabled the pre-processing stage before moving on with the classification. It was observed that non-ground features are best segmented by giving weights to pit-free CHM, average intensity and number of returns arithmetic. Rule-based approach was implemented in identifying artificial surfaces such as buildings and fences; then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was applied in classifying the remaining non-ground objects.

This study demonstrates that multi-sensor imagery collected by an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) provides a novel data source for assessment of moss health. In this study, we train a Random Forest Regression Model (RFM) with long-term field quadrats at a study site in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica and apply it to UAS RGB and 6-band multispectral imagery, derived vegetation indices, 3D topographic data, and thermal imagery to predict moss health.

The RFM also quantifies the importance of input variables for moss health estimation showing the multispectral sensor data was important for accurate health prediction, such information being essential for planning future field investigations.

One major challenge that arises during temporal data analysis and mining is the comparison of temporal data, which requires to determine a proper distance or (dis)similarity measure. In this context, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has enjoyed success in many domains, due to its \u2019temporal elasticity\u2019, a property particularly useful when matching temporal data. Unfortunately this dissimilarity measure suffers from a quadratic computational cost, which prohibits its use for large scale applications. In addition, DTW does not fit well into Support Vector Machine (SVM), mainly because we cannot derive from its definition a direct positive definite kernel. This work addresses the sparsification of the alignment path search space for DTW-like measures, essentially to lower their computational cost without losing on the quality of the measure. As a result of our sparsification approach, two new (dis)similarity measures, namely SP-DTW (Sparsified-Paths search space DTW) and its kernelization SP- K rdtw (Sparsified-Paths search space K rdtw kernel) are proposed for time series comparison. A wide range of public datasets is used to evaluate the efficiency (estimated in term of speed-up ratio and classification accuracy) of the proposed (dis)similarity measures on the 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms. Our experiment shows that our proposed measures provide a significant speed-up without losing on accuracy.

In this research, the accuracy of the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) Stochastic model has been compared with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and its merged type with Firefly optimization algorithm (SVR-FA) as a meta-innovative model, in long-term forecasting of average monthly temperature. For this, 5 stations from different climates of Iran (according to the Extended De Martonne method) were selected, including Abadan, Anzali, Isfahan, Mashhad, and Tabriz. The data were collected during 1951\u20132011, for training (75%) and testing (25%). After selecting the best models, the average monthly temperature has been forecasted for the period 2012\u20132017. The results showed that the models had better performances in Extra-Arid and Warm (Abadan) and after that Extra-Arid and Cold (Isfahan) climate, in long-term forecasting. The weakest performances of the models were reported in Semi-Arid and Cold climate, including Mashhad and Tabriz. Also, despite the use of the non-linear SVR model and its meta-innovative type, SVR-FA, the results showed that, in the climates of Iran, the linear and classical SARIMA model still offers a more appropriate performance in temperature long-term forecasting. So that it could forecast the average monthly temperature of Abadan with root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.027 \u00b0C, and Isfahan with RMSE = 1.197 \u00b0C for the 6 years ahead. The SVR and SVR-FA models also had good performances.

The core of the scheme is an integration of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) or Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC) with Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) for the extraction of features of NARW up-calls. Several types of wavelets are tested in terms of detection accuracy. Once the up-call features are extracted, popular classifiers such as Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors are applied to classify call types. Detection results show that the upcall detection rate by using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients is 73.82%, and False alarm rate is 2.48%. However, the upcall detection rate and false alarm rate are improved to 92.27% and 1.48% when these are integrated with Discrete Wavelet Transforms for feature extraction. GFCC works better than MFCC as a feature extractor if it is used alone. When both are integrated with DWT, the advantage of the former disappears. Furthermore, it is shown through experimental studies that the proposed detection scheme is superior to those obtained using spectrogram-based techniques in terms of both detection accuracy and speed.

Here, a variant of GTM that uses a graph approximation to the geodesic metric is first defined. This model is capable of representing data of convoluted geometries. The standard GTM is here modified to prioritize neighbourhood relationships along the generated manifold. This is accomplished by penalizing the possible divergences between the Euclidean distances from the data points to the model prototypes and the corresponding geodesic distances along the manifold. The resulting Geodesic GTM (Geo-GTM) model is shown to improve the continuity and trustworthiness of the representation generated by the model, as well as to behave robustly in the presence of noise. We then proceed to the definition of a novel semi-supervised model, SS-Geo-GTM, that extends Geo-GTM to deal with semi-supervised problems. In SS-Geo-GTM, the model prototypes are linked by the nearest neighbour to the data manifold constructed by Geo-GTM. The resulting proximity graph is used as the basis for a class label propagation algorithm. The performance of SS-Geo-GTM is experimentally assessed, comparing positively with that of an Euclidean distance-based counterpart and that of the alternative Laplacian Eigenmaps method.

The two conditions that are important in real time application for a power system are accuracy and response time. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines have been implemented in the past and have achieved satisfying classification accuracy. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system is proposed for TSA to maximize accuracy while minimizing response time to distinguish from older methods of machine learning.

First, we simplify the current fine tuning based approaches which use a combination of classification and distillation losses to compensate for the limited availability of past data. We find that the distillation term actually hurts performance when a memory is allowed. Then, we modify the usual class IL memory component. Similar to existing works, a first memory stores exemplar images of past classes. A second memory is introduced here to store past class statistics obtained when they were initially learned. The intuition here is that classes are best modeled when all their data are available and that their initial statistics are useful across different incremental states. A prediction bias towards newly learned classes appears during inference because the dataset is imbalanced in their favor. The challenge is to make predictions of new and past classes more comparable. To do this, scores of past classes are rectified by leveraging contents from both memories. The method has negligible added cost, both in terms of memory and of inference complexity.

Animal studies have shown that the severity of HSV-1 ocular disease is influenced by three main factors; innate immunity, host immune response and viral strain. We previously showed that mixed infection with two avirulent HSV-1 strains (OD4 and CJ994) resulted in recombinants that exhibit a range of disease phenotypes from severe to avirulent, suggesting epistatic interactions were involved. The goal of this study was to develop a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of HSV-1 ocular virulence determinants and to identify virulence associated SNPs. Blepharitis and stromal keratitis quantitative scores were characterized for 40 OD4:CJ994 recombinants. Viral titers in the eye were also measured. Virulence quantitative trait locus mapping (vQTLmap) was performed using the Lasso, Random Forest, and Ridge regression methods to identify significant phenotypically meaningful regions for each ocular disease parameter. The most predictive Ridge regression model identified several phenotypically meaningful SNPs for blepharitis and stromal keratitis. Notably, phenotypically meaningful nonsynonymous variations were detected in the UL24, UL29 (ICP8), UL41 (VHS), UL53 (gK), UL54 (ICP27), UL56, ICP4, US1 (ICP22), US3 and gG genes. Network analysis revealed that many of these variations were in HSV-1 regulatory networks and viral genes that affect innate immunity. Several genes previously implicated in virulence were identified, validating this approach, while other genes were novel. Several novel polymorphisms were also identified in these genes. This approach provides a framework that will be useful for identifying virulence genes in other pathogenic viruses, as well as epistatic effects that affect HSV-1 ocular virulence.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4786273", "pubmed_id": "26962864", "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1005499", "venue": "PLoS Pathogens", "journal": "PLoS Pathogens", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2296214831", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["44397884", "39768406", "24402632", "26370310", "30085139", "38064968", "156748", "24887717", "24166351", "32666661", "14024663", "17942748", "29347124", "25896709", "6814888", "46113317", "23076171", "22862351", "26676918", "943325", "17964412", "19437812", "11359833", "40409051", "32826217", "23671943", "23254949", "20829823", "4032459", "11954582", "12771014", "10960997", "90499184", "89141", "16162039", "121589596", "15588516", "43152292", "36955883", "12737634", "22556691", "27690361", "22129470", "36819862", "1395041", "19821997", "20336319", "6497219", "24422138", "8562323", "21030990", "215675659", "22207420", "206800246", "206791016", "32563368", "2575843", "11037723", "41481587", "205350618", "30959618", "12206448", "21099157", "32955261", "9484969"], "inbound_citations": ["205614797", "12415349", "464442", "20160359", "203661414", "206798826", "53201048", "53720913", "14557125", "204835159", "2168603", "211473345"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17202665"}

The objective was to link the satellite spectro-temporal data to the plant diversity indices. Among the several diversity indices tested, Simpson and Shannon indices were best predicted with a coefficient of determination around 0.4 using a Random Forest predictor and Sentinel-2 data. The use of Sentinel-1 data was not found to improve significantly the prediction accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm and the Sentinel-2 time series, the prediction of the Simpson index was performed.

In an extensive empirical evaluation we show that OCAS outperforms current state-of-the-art SVM solvers like SVMlight, SVMperf and BMRM, achieving speedup factor more than 1,200 over SVMlight on some data sets and speedup factor of 29 over SVMperf, while obtaining the same precise support vector solution. OCAS, even in the early optimization steps, often shows faster convergence than the currently prevailing approximative methods in this domain, SGD and Pegasos. In addition, our proposed linear multi-class SVM solver, OCAM, achieves speedups of factor of up to 10 compared to SVMmulti-class.

Such systems can be observed at different levels of the functioning of a living organism, e.g.: molecular, genetic, cellular, multicellular, neuronal, brain function, evolution. One of the challenges for information science is to be able to represent the dynamic processes, to model them, and to reveal \u201cthe rules\u201d that govern the adaptation and the variable interaction over time. The paper presents one approach to address the above issues through adaptive, knowledgebased connectionist systems. These systems evolve their structure and functionality through learning from data in both on-line and off-line incremental mode, in both supervised and unsupervised modes, and facilitate data and knowledge integration, rule extraction and rule manipulation. Evolving Connectionist Systems (ECOS) are presented as an example of such systems. The evolving process of an ECOS is defined by parameters, \u201cgenes\u201d [1]. ECOS extend further the classical knowledge-based neural networks [2]. Adaptive, knowledge-based connectionist systems, and ECOS in particular, are applied on data and problems from Bioinformatics and Neuroinformatics to discover rules of adaptation and interaction. Such problems are: microarray gene expression analysis and profiling; gene regulatory network modeling (GRN); medical prognostic systems; modeling visual and auditory perception states of the human brain, etc [1]. Recently new, biologically plausible ECOS have been developed, called computational neurogenetic models [3,4]. In these models the neuronal parameters correspond to real genes expressed in the brain and related to learning processes and brain diseases [3,4]. A dynamic model of a GRN within each neuron is evolved during the modeling process that governs the neuronal processes. All neurons have a spiking behavior to form spiking neural networks, characterized by a spectral profile [3,4]. The computational neurogenetic modeling paradigm is illustrated on a case study of modeling epileptic/normal state transitions and the discovery of the gene interaction networks that are likely to cause this phenomenon. Further directions include: the development of dynamic evolving neurogenetic models; modeling complex brain processes and diseases; cancer prognosis; hardware implementation.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICHIS.2004.38", "venue": "HIS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1504819784", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27831310", "18150023", "9698024"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45839727"}

Our study shows that, SVM-RFE can select a good small subset of peaks with which the classifier achieves high prediction accuracy and the performance is much better than with the feature subset selected by T-statistics. We also found that, the best peak subset selected by SVM-RFE always have in the top ranked peaks by T-statistics while it includes some peaks that are ranked low by T-statistics. However, these peaks together give much better classification performance than the same number of most top ranked peaks by T-statistics. Our experimental comparison of the performance of Support Vector Machine classification algorithm with and without peak selection also consolidates the importance of peak selection for cancer classification with mass spectrometry data. Selecting a small subset of peaks not only improves the efficiency of the classification algorithms, but also improves the cancer classification accuracy, even for classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines, which are capable of handling large number of input variables. In the last decade or so, mass spectrometry (MS) has increasingly become the method of choice for analysis of complex protein samples. Mass spectrometry measures two properties of ion mixtures in the gas phase under a vacuum environment: the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions in the mixture; and the number of ions present at different m/z values. The output is a mass spectrum or chart with a series of spike peaks, each representing the ion(s) of a specific m/z value present in the sample. The heights of the peaks are related to the abundances of the ions in the sample. The heights of peaks and the m/z values of peaks are a fingerprint of the sample. For protein samples, mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio of the ionized proteins (or protein fragments) and their abundances in the sample. The recent advances in mass spectrometry technology are starting to enable high-throughput profiling of the protein content of complex samples. While mass spectrometry has been used intensively on purified, digested samples to identify proteins via peptide mass fingerprints, 1 recently, it has also found promising applications in cancer classification. 2\u20104 Proteins vary between individuals, between cell types, and in the same cell under different stimuli or different disease states.

It is therefore desirable to consider the use of automated systems capable of detection and identification of potential threats. This thesis describes an investigation into acoustic and seismic methods for achieving such a system specifically for commercial road vehicles. Accurate algorithms have been developed for recognition of moving vehicles using fusion of acoustic and seismic signals. It has been found that seismic signals are less susceptible to interfering signals, making them optimal for detection of vehicles. Their much narrower bandwidth also increases processing efficiency and speed. Thus, the algorithm developed utilises firstly only seismic signals to detect vehicle presence, and then employs both acoustic and seismic signals for classifying type of the vehicle. The detection algorithm is purely time domain and uses seismic Log Energy together with a modification of Time Domain Signal Coding. The best detection accuracy obtained was 97.71 % with Support Vector Machine and 99.02 % with Learning Vector Quantisation Neural Networks. The classification algorithm to distinguish between trucks and cars utilises three relatively simple time domain methods: Zero-Crossing Rate, Log Energy and Autocorrelation of seismic signals; combined with LPC coefficients collected from acoustic signals. Classification with either SVM or LVQ reached 93.30 % or 80.80 % respectively.

The main existing approaches propose either to compute a perceptual distance between the rendered image colors, or to estimate the scene colors from the rendered image colors and then to evaluate perceptual distances. However the first approach provides distances that can be far from the scene color differences while the second requires the knowledge of the acquisition conditions that are unavailable for most of the applications. In this paper, we design a new local Mahalanobis-like metric learning algorithm that aims at approximating a perceptual scene color difference that is invariant to the acquisition conditions and computed only from rendered image colors.

Early approaches aimed at closely modeling saliency processing with concepts from biological attention to provide (at least in the long run) general-purpose attention for technical systems. More recent approaches have departed from this agenda, turning to more specific attention-guided tasks, most notably the accurate extraction of salient objects, for which large-scale ground truth datasets make it possible to quantify progress. While the first type of models is troubled by weak performance in these specific tasks, the second type, as we show with a new benchmark, has lost the ability to predict saliency in the original sense, which may be an important factor for future general-purpose attention systems. Here, we describe a new approach using growing neural gas to obtain pre-attentional structures for a scene at an early processing stage. On this basis, traditional saliency concepts can be applied while at the same time they can be linked to mechanisms that make models successful in salient object detection. The model shows high performance at predicting traditional saliency and makes substantial progress toward salient object detection, although it cannot reach the top-level performance of some specialized methods.

However, the significant amount of acquired data leads to difficulties in the diagnosis by the physicians; which can be eased with computer assistance. This paper addresses a method for the automatic detection of tumors in WCE by using a two-step based procedure: Region of Interest selection and classification. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The first step aims to separate abnormal from normal tissue by using automatic segmentation based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A modified version of the Anderson method for convergence acceleration of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed. The proposed features for both segmentation and classification are based on the CIELab color space, as a way of bypassing lightness variations, where the L component is discarded. Tissue variability among subjects, light inhomogeneities and even intensity differences among different devices can be overcome by using simultaneously features from both regions. In the second step, an ensemble system with partition of the training data with a new training scheme is proposed. At this stage, the gating network is trained after the experts have been trained decoupling the joint maximization of both modules. The partition module is also used at the test step, leading the incoming data to the most likely expert allowing incremental adaptation by preserving data diversity. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: This algorithm outperforms others based on texture features selected from Wavelets and Curvelets transforms, classified by a regular Support Vector Machine (SVM) in more than 5%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: This work shows that simpler features can outperform more elaborate ones if appropriately designed. In the current case, luminance was discarded to cope with saturated tissue, facilitating the color perception. Ensemble systems remain an open research field. In the current case, changes in both topology and training strategy have led to significant performance improvements. A system with this level of performance can be used in current clinical practice.

In this paper, the relationship between the classification performance of different PSD algorithms and digitizers' sampling properties (including sampling rate and the effective number of bits) has been researched based on $\\mathrm{LaBr_3}$:Ce scintillation detectors. A self-developed integrated digitizer configured with five different ADCs and a WavePro 404HD oscilloscope were deployed to digitize the waveforms from $\\mathrm{LaBr_3}$:Ce scintillators. Moreover, three PSD methods, charge comparison method (CCM), least square for classification method (LS) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA), based on linear model were applied to discriminate the alpha signals from the intrinsic isotope $^{227}$Ac. With the LS method and a 125 MSPS 14-Bit ADC, the FoM value was 1.424$\\pm$0.042, which is similar to the result from LDA but 31\\% better than the result of CCM. The discrimination results showed that the performances of LS and LDA are less affected by the sampling rate with respect to the CCM method, which reflects in a better PSD capability.

However, due to the particular nature of the problem, i.e. large variability due to factors like different backgrounds, lighting conditions, camera resolutions, spoof materials, etc., these techniques typically fail to generalize to new samples. In this paper, we explicitly tackle this problem and propose a class-conditional domain discriminator module, that, coupled with a gradient reversal layer, tries to generate live and spoof features that are discriminative, but at the same time robust against the aforementioned variability factors. Extensive experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing image- and video-based anti-spoofing techniques, both in terms of numerical improvement as well as when visualizing the learned features.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.07124", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996685560", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9241320", "11371457", "1170020", "206813907", "17234678", "18162823", "206652088", "59843030", "206673965", "19036390", "6591948", "870806", "854745", "3934627", "9440223", "6755881", "2871880", "7923833", "12825123", "1241368", "10337178", "206594692", "9286850", "1236102", "206529811", "207763512", "6037691", "21657229", "52833113", "4624345", "18678873", "1702967", "52956008", "38984674", "52959208", "4458647", "7256998", "3172259", "2630174", "7408373", "1447805", "10531341", "7560785", "296696", "206771654", "196173893", "41548657", "38050089", "53238684", "206848346", "14124313", "30166626", "206592484", "14126228", "58014172", "17169365", "15057556", "19445036", "13777916", "16417937", "15559918", "6588728"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209376175"}

During the operation of the vessel, improvements in energy use can be achieved by not only by technical upgrades, but also through behavioural changes in the way the crew on board is operating the vessels.

This article proposes a supervised learning model for identifying the presence of energy efficient operations. Positive and negative patterns of energy efficient operations were identified and verified through discussions with senior officers and technical superintendents. Based on this data, the high dimensional parameter space that describes vessel operations was first reduced by means of feature selection algorithms. Afterwards, a model based on Multi- Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) was constructed and the efficacy of the approach is shown through the application of a test set.

Unlike existing methods that to verify questioned signatures of an individual merely consider the training samples of that class, DMML uses the knowledge from the similarities and dissimilarities between the genuine and forged samples of other classes too. To this end, using the idea of multitask and transfer learning, DMML train a distance metric for each class together with other classes simultaneously. DMML has a structure with a shared layer acting as a writer-independent approach, that is followed by separated layers which learn writer-dependent factors. We compare the proposed method against SVM, writer-dependent and writer-independent Discriminative Deep Metric Learning method on four offline signature datasets (UTSig, MCYT-75, GPDSsynthetic, and GPDS960GraySignatures) using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Discrete Radon Transform (DRT) features.

The diagnosis is an important yet complicated task that needs to be done accurately and efficiently. The automation of this system is very much needed to help the physicians to do better diagnosis and treatment. Computer aided diagnosis systems are widely discussed as classification problems. The objective is to reduce the number of false decisions and increase the true ones. In this study, we evaluate the performance of Bayesian classifier (BN) in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease. Bayesian networks are selected as they are able to produce probability estimates rather than predictions. These estimates allow predictions to be ranked and their expected costs to be minimized. The major advantage of BN is the ability to represent and hence understand knowledge. The cardiovascular dataset is provided by University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. It consists of 303 instances of heart disease data each having 76 variables including the predicted class one.

The resulting model comprises non-linear univariate and bivariate partial responses derived from the original Multi-Layer Perceptron. The responses are combined using the Lasso and further optimised within a modular structure. The approach is generic and provides a constructive framework to simplify and explain the Multi-Layer Perceptron for any data set, opening the door for validation against prior knowledge. Experimental results on benchmarking datasets indicate that the partial responses are intuitive to interpret and the Area Under the Curve is competitive with Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. The performance improvement compared with a fully connected Multi-Layer Perceptron is attributed to reduced confounding in the second stage of optimisation of the weights.

The generalization error on linearly separable tasks, the capacity, the typical number of Support Vectors, the margin, and the robustness or noise tolerance of a class of Support Vector Machines are determined in the framework of Statistical Mechanics. The robustness is shown to be closely related to the generalization properties of these machines. Support Vector Machines, recently proposed to solve the problem of learning classification tasks from examples, have aroused a great deal of interest due to the simplicity of their implementation, and to their remarkable performances on difficult tasks [1,2]. Classification of data is a very general problem, as many real-life applications, like pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, etc., may be cast as classification tasks. In the last few years, much work has been done to understand how highperformance learning may be achieved, mainly within the paradigm of neural networks. These are systems composed of interconnected neurons, which are two-state units like spins. The neuron\u2019s state is determined, like in magnets, by the sign of the weighted sum of its inputs, which acts as an external field, and of the states of its neighbors. Learning with neural networks means determining their connectivity and the weights of the connections. The aim is to classify correctly not only the examples, or training patterns, but also new data, as we expect that the learning system will be able to generalize. A single neuron connected to its inputs, the simple perceptron (SP), is the elementary neural network. It separates the input patterns in two classes by a hyperplane orthogonal to a vector whose components are the connection weights. Thus, the SP can learn without errors only Linearly Separable (LS) tasks. Most classification problems are not LS, requiring learning machines with more degrees of freedom. However, the relationship between the machine\u2019s complexity, its learning capacity and its generalization ability is still an open problem. Feedforward layered networks, the multilayered perceptrons, are the most popular learning machines. Their architecture is usually found through a trial and error procedure, in which the weights are determined with Backpropagation [3], a learning algorithm that performs a gradient descent on a cost function. Its main drawback is that it usually gets trapped in metastable states.

A robust POS tagger plays an important role in most NLP problems and applications, including syntactic parsing, semantic parsing, machine translation, and question answering. Although a lot of efficient POS taggers has been developed for general, conventional text, little work has been done for social media text. In this paper, we present an empirical study on POS tagging for Vietnamese social media text, which shows several challenges compared with tagging for general text. Social media text does not always conform to formal grammars and correct spelling. It also uses abbreviations, foreign words, and emoticons frequently. A POS tagger developed for conventional text would perform poorly on such noisy data. We address this problem by proposing a tagging model based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with various kinds of features for Vietnamese social media text. We also investigate the effect of features extracted from word clusters under the Brown and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based clustering in semi-supervised settings. We introduce an annotated corpus for POS tagging, which consists of more than four thousand sentences from Facebook, the most popular social network in Vietnam. Using this corpus, we performed a series of experiments to evaluate the proposed model. Our model achieved 88.26% and 88.92% tagging accuracy in supervised and semi-supervised scenarios, respectively, which are nearly 12% improvement over vnTagger, a state-of-the-art and most widely used Vietnamese POS tagger developed for general, conventional text.

Modeling the structure of data and its hidden representations by independently identically distributed samples, our goal is to study fundamental limits of the so-called Two-way Collaborative Representation Learning (TW-CRL) and the Collaborative Distributed Representation Learning (CDRL) problems. The TW-CRL problem consists of two distant encoders that separately observe marginal (dependent) components $X_1$ and $X_2$ and can cooperate through multiple exchanges of limited information with the aim of learning hidden representations $(Y_1,Y_2)$, which can be arbitrarily dependent on $(X_1,X_2)$. On the other hand, in CDRL there are two cooperating encoders and the learner of the hidden representation $Y$ is a third node which can listen the exchanges between the two encoders. The relevance (figure-of-merit) of such learned representations is measured in terms of a normalized (per-sample) multi-letter mutual information metric. Inner and outer bounds to the complexity-relevance region of these problems are derived from which optimality is characterized for several cases of interest.

In this context, the recent introduction of Deep Echo State Networks (DeepESNs) within the Reservoir Computing paradigm, enabled to study the intrinsic properties of hierarchically organized RNN architectures.In this paper we investigate the DeepESN model under a dynamical system perspective, aiming at characterizing the important aspect of stability of layered recurrent dynamics excited by external input signals.To this purpose, we develop a framework based on the study of the local Lyapunov exponents of stacked recurrent models, enabling the analysis and control of the resulting dynamical regimes. The introduced framework is demonstrated on artificial as well as real-world datasets. The results of our analysis on DeepESNs provide interesting insights on the real effect of layering in RNNs. In particular, they show that when recurrent units are organized in layers, then the resulting network intrinsically develops a richer dynamical behavior that is naturally driven closer to the edge of criticality.

Computational methods for modeling and predicting the effects of mutations are available, with several Machine Learning approaches achieving good predictions. However, most such methods, including ensemble based approaches that are based on multiple classifier models instead of a single-expert system, are dependent on large datasets for training the model. In this work, we motivate and demonstrate the utility of several voting-based models that rely on the predictions of a Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models for inferring the effects of single amino acid substitutions.

In Germany, a regional or state-wide method for an accurate, fast and cost-effective quantification and assessment of impervious surfaces is still missing. Thus, we researched into the characterization of impervious surfaces based on an automated analysis of Landsat-7 data by means of a model-based estimation with Support Vector Machines (SVM). The approach provides a semi-automated method to model the impervious surface via Landsat data based on an automated training procedure. Additionally, the technique facilitates the supplementation of vector-data in order to enable the consideration of small-scale infrastructure, the aggregation of the gathered information to user-defined spatial units and the combination with socioeconomic data. The study area includes the entire region of the German federal state of Bavaria covering an area of 75.500 km. The analysis targets the degree of impervious surface for the total of residential, industrial and transport areas as well as the area of impervious surface per head. This information is referenced to various administrative and landscape-related units. The validation of the modeled degree of impervious surface based on the Landsat data shows a mean absolute error of 14 percent. The combination of the impervious surface raster and vector information on linear infrastructure such as roads and railways showed a difference of one percent from according reference information. The result of this study documents that the proposed approach is qualified for a highly automated and area-wide mapping of the degree of impervious surface. * T. Esch.

In order to assess embryo viability, several embryo scoring systems have been developed.

In this paper, we propose a method for image segmentation (the dividing of an image into its meaningful constituent regions) and classification of human blastocyst images with the aim of automating embryo grading. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The delineation of the boundaries (segmentation) of the zona pellucida, trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) were performed using advanced image analysis techniques (level set, phase congruency and fitting of ellipse methods). The fractal dimension and mean thickness of TE and ICM image texture descriptors (texture spectrum and grey-level run lengths) were calculated to characterize the main morphological features of the blastocyst with the aim of automatic grading using Support Vector Machine classifiers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The fractal dimension calculated from the delineated TE boundary provided a good indication of cell number (presented a 0.81 Pearson correlation coefficient with the number of cells), a feature closely associated with blastocyst quality. The classifiers showed different accuracy levels for each grade. They presented accuracy ranges from 0.67 to 0.92 for the embryo development classification, 0.67-0.82 for the ICM classification and 0.53-0.92 for the TE classification. The value 0.92 was the highest accuracy achieved in the tests with 73 blastocysts. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Semi-automatic grading of human blastocysts by a computer is feasible and may offer a more precise comparison of embryos, reducing subjectivity and allowing embryos with apparently identical morphological scores to be distinguished.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22736327", "doi": "10.1093/humrep/des219", "venue": "Human reproduction", "journal": "Human reproduction", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2112198083", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25145060", "7634808", "23761421", "35837129", "29522405", "906452", "2822415", "62642944", "30632555", "39947186", "119525164", "23674316", "26393955", "2702042", "18736522", "34599736", "26581201", "15326934", "43921368", "11195146", "28314393", "205274883", "15398302"], "inbound_citations": ["3455302", "91261019", "12140088", "10448790", "56177779", "62776448"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15147351"}

Currently, faults such as leak detection are being done using the N-16 method.

In this work, we present a diverse and implementable data-driven Support Vector Regression (SVR) model whose capability compensates for the weaknesses in the already established N-16 methods in the nuclear plant. The method can be integrated with the conventional N-16 method to form a robust hybrid diagnostic system, effective for detecting both incipient and large leakage in the steam generator. The purpose of the SVR model is to estimate uncertain parameters that are sensitive to certain faults, and the parameter estimation efficiency is evaluated using the mean squared error values (MSE). To obtain efficient predictive model capable of supporting decision-making process and to further optimize the model, minimize false alarm rate and reduce computation cost, we also utilized Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, Sequential Feature Selection algorithm, and Genetic Algorithm for feature selection purposes.

From the result of simulation experiments, SVR has better generalization than RBF neural network; the controller based on SVR-NMPC has better adaptability and robustness in tracking performance as well as the capacity of anti-interference and anti-noise, compared with PID controller.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IAEAC47372.2019.8997855", "venue": "2019 IEEE 4th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 4th Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3006291231", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["109884054", "21983536", "37968573", "21773744"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211206859"}

Using this encoding, we show that the reservoir generalizes its rich dynamical activity toward signature action/movements enabling it to learn from few training examples. We evaluate our approach on the UCF-101 dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed reservoir achieves 81.3%/87% Top-1/Top-5 accuracy, respectively, on the 101-class data while requiring just 8 video examples per class for training.

However, high dimensionality of hyperspectral data, usually coupled with limited reference data available, limits the performances of supervised classification techniques. The commonly used pixel-wise classification lacks information about spatial structures of the image. In order to increase classification performances, integration of spatial information into the classification process is needed. In this paper, we propose to extend the watershed segmentation algorithm for hyperspectral images, in order to define information about spatial structures. In particular, several approaches to compute a one-band gradient function from hyperspectral images are proposed and investigated. The accuracy of the watershed algorithms is demonstrated by the further incorporation of the segmentation maps into a classifier. A new spectral-spatial classification scheme for hyperspectral images is proposed, based on the pixel-wise Support Vector Machines classification, followed by majority voting within the watershed regions. Experimental segmentation and classification results are presented on two hyperspectral images. It is shown in experiments that when the number of spectral bands increases, the feature extraction and the use of multidimensional gradients appear to be preferable to the use of vectorial gradients. The integration of the spatial information from the watershed segmentation in the hyperspectral image classifier improves the classification accuracies and provides classification maps with more homogeneous regions, compared to pixel-wise classification and previously proposed spectral-spatial classification techniques. The developed method is especially suitable for classifying images with large spatial structures.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2010.01.016", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2149471024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["117710212", "205907253", "62165049", "23184872", "13273116", "14121466", "69937176", "206718767", "111306363", "128408531", "14495716", "15480403", "5799578", "13284902", "37082642", "205011878", "1128166", "35444475", "133185316", "12097631", "62676031", "63741", "32733281", "17427057", "9831910", "52996602", "56390210", "52085768", "8800299", "17823033", "15774343", "27436953", "2699242", "14814090", "122741390", "63011194", "63046180", "35923092", "15436061", "1423507", "8610054", "128848964", "9512038", "7993309", "207100144", "1446316", "110345543", "961425", "14004541", "7443466", "129307120", "26985497", "16391910"], "inbound_citations": ["25752915", "214623849", "2371266", "15670727", "17695901", "10913825", "52896002", "6850474", "120644722", "46985552", "8407776", "21987379", "196686127", "5855440", "28238631", "211103843", "126016251", "131666461", "96431805", "46896299", "60377049", "56241081", "11764744", "34684544", "5132252", "30903374", "21226851", "25997592", "11133773", "23167523", "19420814", "11195528", "11195528", "3825668", "3693618", "4271039", "40357413", "10712715", "149466049", "17983374", "15617677", "25491635", "2534191", "33657281", "4860875", "206693610", "21075725", "23740566", "9024618", "2263785", "12977648", "8266241", "16957544", "17143921", "14866486", "13105455", "4804375", "1253982", "17347221", "61811033", "42492444", "33081943", "17119954", "126917885", "214401645", "16528798", "24791583", "12413424", "2174662", "104293093", "121862125", "55639778", "4858208", "33100676", "59671750", "11871445", "13801828", "16746510", "49529446", "362468", "15902311", "206444654", "54010069", "7147218", "14893757", "10732258", "5881847", "11686145", "34807273", "129945358", "104293026", "2606681", "52158960", "454589", "610460", "7607321", "22833918", "8373875", "9905454", "46785498", "3999666", "59554864", "9712149", "4331966", "206911246", "7771801", "122584459", "56963138", "25006293", "52985321", "60778735", "125324657", "42593833", "52986572", "196206270", "4721296", "9541762", "49656909", "53250358", "17379122", "12237395", "6611907", "18535622", "134426590", "12857002", "195772436", "33324806", "12208116", "15416784", "1459366", "62195445", "18103428", "21245057", "153316301", "9721467", "16008390", "40203692", "44627939", "53231651", "14163375", "8041358", "11766022", "16121160", "64362640", "13159971", "40713541", "27377588", "28320509", "14129081", "34539393", "36867871", "60584220", "6037389", "18398511", "60101286", "132130467", "212422586", "2298564", "9557250", "15992317", "34856165", "5404918", "152282996", "18843561", "22781544", "55535414", "129113925", "15913622", "12056789", "70068534", "313379", "4500849", "37451449", "35517493", "122941430", "12109469", "1081305", "201848621", "2376950", "14940211", "32703598", "42121709", "47016867", "40132269", "52954798", "1258360", "38603555", "22884059", "8185553", "28861978", "41654913", "209438688", "4840483", "7686490", "7996993", "9453881", "199018454", "5625136", "9448631", "10229553", "39403764", "13538269", "22891552", "52899380", "52113020", "41646216", "1178000", "5040336", "30964550", "52836919", "235859", "1028544", "203655495", "198408769", "1897537", "33012839", "2154821", "126238111", "4290580", "498838", "54452669", "58488241", "24872853", "15673444", "202503", "215384865", "4629611", "52860505", "6151017", "19242603", "128389199", "51907682", "8001782", "55734800", "210970603", "54580488", "3965319", "204771922", "27372439", "4175692", "10843390", "52830662", "10156713", "32726847", "203614342", "10439393", "173176823", "14496820", "53693765", "9362608", "38392195", "206692718", "180943", "202564706", "49405134", "38706612", "3007533", "3741946", "6372823", "33952113", "56877555", "10005378", "56025551", "16637604", "54532167", "31715126", "206400957", "16183578", "146074069", "1900124", "36756299", "22259362", "1443913", "126394944", "125816304", "15030339", "1448716"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26615105"}

Among popular social networking portals, Twitter has been the point of attraction to several researchers in important areas like prediction of democratic electoral events, consumer brands, movie box office, stock market, popularity of celebrities etc. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers a fast and efficient way of monitoring the public sentiment. In this paper, we introduce the novel approach of exploiting the user influence factor in order to predict the outcome of an election result. We also propose a hybrid approach of extracting opinion using direct and indirect features of Twitter data based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Artificial Neural Networks based supervised classifiers. We combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with SVM in an attempt to perform dimensionality reduction. This paper shows two different case studies of entirely different social scenarios, US Presidential Elections 2012 and Karnataka Assembly Elections 2013. We conclude the conditions under which Twitter may fail or succeed in predicting the outcome of elections. Experimental results demonstrate that Support Vector Machines outperform all other classifiers with maximum successful prediction accuracy of 88% in case of US Presidential Elections held in November 2012 and maximum prediction accuracy of 58% in case of Karnataka State Assembly Elections held in May 2013.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/COMSNETS.2014.6734907", "venue": "2014 Sixth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)", "journal": "2014 Sixth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2079281079", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["550498", "3264224", "493963", "8133224", "18250409", "207186115", "5868583", "206338076", "17757692", "12979818", "484335", "14727192", "6540537", "574041"], "inbound_citations": ["17517703", "210995633", "169035190", "7232197", "46798029", "4709115", "58005381", "15838723", "77374109", "36219875", "56309363", "212556901", "86384912", "148572843", "7215574", "204843381", "19407052", "15625594", "14829868", "150809485", "55889411", "195832572", "6146823", "52042337", "66970437", "46778437", "210910955", "25694149", "15501114"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14694317"}

Objective We propose BREM (Bayesian Regression and Expectation Maximization) algorithm for software effort prediction and two embedded strategies to handle missing data. Method The MDT (Missing Data Toleration) strategy ignores the missing data when using BREM for software effort prediction and the MDI (Missing Data Imputation) strategy uses observed data to impute missing data in an iterative manner while elaborating the predictive model. Results Experiments on the ISBSG and CSBSG datasets demonstrate that when there are no missing values in historical dataset, BREM outperforms LR (Linear Regression), BR (Bayesian Regression), SVR (Support Vector Regression) and M5\u2032 regression tree in software effort prediction on the condition that the test set is not greater than 30% of the whole historical dataset for ISBSG dataset and 25% of the whole historical dataset for CSBSG dataset. When there are missing values in historical datasets, BREM with the MDT and MDI strategies significantly outperforms those independent imputation techniques, including MI, BMI, CMI, MINI and M5\u2032. Moreover, the MDI strategy provides BREM with more accurate imputation for the missing values than those given by the independent missing imputation techniques on the condition that the level of missing data in training set is not larger than 10% for both ISBSG and CSBSG datasets. Conclusion The experimental results suggest that BREM is promising in software effort prediction.

We investigate how to use lexical features extracted from imperfect ASR transcriptions, together with acoustic features extracted from the speech itself, to form extractive summaries with the structure of meeting minutes. Each business item in the minute is modeled as a rhetorical chunk which consists of smaller rhetorical units. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) graphs of both acoustic and lexical features in meeting speech show clear self-clustering of speech utterances according to the underlying rhetorical state-for example acoustic and lexical feature vectors from the question and answer or motion of a parliamentary speech, are grouped together. We then propose a Conditional Random Fields (CRF)-based approach to perform both rhetorical structure modeling and extractive summarization in one step, by chunking, parsing and extraction of salient utterances. Extracted salient utterances are grouped under the labels of each rhetorical state, emulating meeting minutes to yield summaries that are more easily understandable by humans. We compare this approach to different machine learning methods. We show that our proposed CRF-based one step minute generation system obtains the best summarization performance both in terms of ROUGE-L F-measure at 74.5% and by human evaluation, at 77.5% on average.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TASL.2012.2215592", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1967620574", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5946584", "6882298", "10004508", "14574370", "5776046", "732264", "8682888", "5379434", "15544040", "1272193", "1500891", "8014853", "52802182", "14789599", "277918", "15877205", "11255772", "734475", "7118723", "16201512", "15581871", "17070041", "14143658", "7620529", "7147705", "10683763", "13936575", "9483510", "12587097", "961425", "9699301", "964287", "2159433", "11077516", "15119437", "5879376", "9609474", "12066622", "15727118", "11818253", "7402680", "11680756", "5905597", "2503061", "2717698", "1467105", "1967279", "14821600", "10647458"], "inbound_citations": ["24238967", "39971461", "211566732", "18417343", "976475", "199385502"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15790573"}

A desirable property of these models is their ability to effectively decouple natural sources of variation, in particular identity and expression. While factorized representations have been proposed for that purpose, they are still limited in the variability they can capture and may present modeling artifacts when applied to tasks such as expression transfer. In this work, we explore a new direction with Generative Adversarial Networks and show that they contribute to better face modeling performances, especially in decoupling natural factors, while also achieving more diverse samples. To train the model we introduce a novel architecture that combines a 3D generator with a 2D discriminator that leverages conventional CNNs, where the two components are bridged by a geometry mapping layer. We further present a training scheme, based on auxiliary classifiers, to explicitly disentangle identity and expression attributes. Through quantitative and qualitative results on standard face datasets, we illustrate the benefits of our model and demonstrate that it outperforms competing state of the art methods in terms of decoupling and diversity.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2019.00951", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2936759181,2991380014", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5651453", "53346414", "207637109", "1744666", "15262527", "207226489", "206804955", "33817910", "4605056", "947451", "493744", "13685361", "52986334", "62841624", "1033682", "9206137", "207567120", "10894094", "52198976", "1135252", "44073530", "15000608", "6628106", "9882090", "1004057", "1099052", "11758569", "50790278", "1725730", "206592766", "58981587", "50859197", "52095607", "6138149", "666009", "206593693", "4564472", "53234718", "5492734", "51867190", "7634490", "15408906"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119313959"}
