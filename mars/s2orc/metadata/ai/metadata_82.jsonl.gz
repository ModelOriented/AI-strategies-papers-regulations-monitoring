Since depth images represent only the shape of the objects, in turn, the intensity image is relative to viewpoint, texture and lighting condition. Thus, it is essential to firstly bring 2D and 3D representations to common features and then match them to find the correct view. In this paper, we used the concept of curvilinear saliency, related to curvature estimation, for extracting the shape information of both modalities. However, matching the features extracted from an intensity image to thousand(s) of depth images rendered from a 3D model is an exhausting process. Consequently, we propose to cluster the depth images into groups based on Clustering Rule-based Algorithm (CRA). In order to reduce the matching space between the intensity and depth images, a 2D/3D registration framework based on multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then used. SVM predicts the closest class (i.e., a set of depth images) to the input image. Finally, the closest view is refined and verified by using RANSAC.

To solve this, machine learning techniques can model solutions treating each target as a separated problem based only on the input features. Nonetheless, modelling inter-target correlation can improve predictive performance. When performing MTR tasks using the statistical dependencies of targets, several approaches put aside the evaluation of each pair-wise correlation between those targets, which may differ for each problem. Besides that, one of the main drawbacks of the current leading MTR method is its high memory cost. In this paper, we propose a novel MTR method called Multi-output Tree Chaining (MOTC) to overcome the mentioned disadvantages. Our method provides an interpretative internal tree-based structure which represents the relationships between targets denominated Chaining Trees (CT). Different from the current techniques, we compute the outputs dependencies, one-by-one, based on the Random Forest importance metric. Furthermore, we proposed a memory friendly approach which reduces the number of required regression models when compared to a leading method, reducing computational cost. We compared the proposed algorithm against three MTR methods (Single-target - ST; Multi-Target Regressor Stacking - MTRS; and Ensemble of Regressor Chains - ERC) on 18 benchmark datasets with two base regression algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Regression). The obtained results show that our method is superior to the ST approach regarding predictive performance, whereas, having no significant difference from ERC and MTRS.

In contrast to direct acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) images of such medium, obtaining its sub-region (s) like two-dimensional (2D) images or several small areas could be much feasible. Therefore, reconstructing whole images from the limited information is a primary technique in such cases. Specially, in practice the given data cannot generally be determined by users and may be incomplete or partially informed, thus making existing reconstruction methods inaccurate or even ineffective. To overcome this shortcoming, in this study we proposed a deep learning-based framework for reconstructing full image from its much smaller sub-area(s). Particularly, conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is utilized to learn the mapping between input (partial image) and output (full image). To preserve the reconstruction accuracy, two simple but effective objective functions are proposed and then coupled with the other two functions to jointly constrain the training procedure. Due to the inherent essence of this ill-posed problem, a Gaussian noise is introduced for producing reconstruction diversity, thus allowing for providing multiple candidate outputs. Extensively tested on a variety of porous materials and demonstrated by both visual inspection and quantitative comparison, the method is shown to be accurate, stable yet fast ($\\sim0.08s$ for a $128 \\times 128$ image reconstruction).

However, the mobility of vehicles may increase the offloading delay and even reduce the success rate of offloading, because vehicles may access another road side unit (RSU) before finishing offloading. Therefore, an offloading algorithm with low time complexity is required to make the offloading decision quickly. In this paper, we put forward an efficient offloading algorithm based on Support Vector Machine (SVMO) to satisfy the fast offloading demand in vehicular networks. The algorithm can segment a huge task into several sub-tasks through a weight allocation method according to available resources of MEC servers. Then each sub-task is decided whether it should be offloaded or executed locally based on SVMs. As the vehicle moves through several MEC servers, sub-tasks are allocated to them by order if they are offloaded. Each server ensures the sub-task can be processed and returned in time. Our proposed algorithm generate training data through Decision Tree.

However, the lack of a generative model of neural activity limits the generality of these discriminative classifiers for understanding the underlying neural representation. In this study, we propose a generative classifier that models the hidden factors that underpin the neural representation of objects, using a multivariate multiple linear regression model. The results indicate that object features derived from an independent behavioral feature norming study can explain a significant portion of the systematic variance in the neural activity observed in an object-contemplation task. Furthermore, the resulting regression model is useful for classifying a previously unseen neural activation vector, indicating that the distributed pattern of neural activities encodes sufficient signal to discriminate differences among stimuli. More importantly, there appears to be a double dissociation between the two classifier approaches and within- versus between-participants generalization. Whereas an SVM-based discriminative classifier achieves the best classification accuracy in within-participants analysis, the generative classifier outperforms an SVM-based model which does not utilize such intermediate representations in between-participants analysis. This pattern of results suggests the SVM-based classifier may be picking up some idiosyncratic patterns that do not generalize well across participants and that good generalization across participants may require broad, large-scale patterns that are used in our set of intermediate semantic features. Finally, this intermediate representation allows us to extrapolate the model of the neural activity to previously unseen words, which cannot be done with a discriminative classifier.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20451625", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.04.271", "venue": "NEUROIMAGE", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2145887413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3177797", "207165665", "47390681", "17638165", "16634243", "9889958", "2653347", "3247960", "54469209", "15595072", "207846993", "1909790", "6105164", "8837025", "17258322", "12894137", "16871046"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7204651"}

In addition, most existing approaches for automatically acquiring verb classes fail to associate the verb classes produced with an explicit characterisation of the syntactic and semantic properties shared by the class members. Here we propose a novel approach to verb clustering which addresses these shortcomings. We classify French verbs using two clustering methods, a symbolic method called Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and a probabilistic neural clustering method called Incremental Growing Neural Gas with Feature Maximisation (IGNGF). The obtained classes group together verbs, subcategorisation frames and thematic grids. We apply this approach to French data consisting of roughly 4000 verbs and 350 subcategorisation frames, and evaluate both the clusters obtained (i.e., verb classes) and the features labeling each cluster (i.e., syntactic frames and thematic grids). The results suggest that both classification methods can be used to bootstrap a Verbnet style classification for French such that the verb classes it contains (i) are reasonably clean and (ii) associate verbs with partial information about subcategorisation frames and thematic grids. The obtained classifications are complementary.

The increasing concern to the ADRs has motivated the development of statistical, data mining and machine learning methods to detect the Adverse Drug Reactions.

In this study, we selected the most suitable species distribution model for bustards using climate envelopes from four machine learning models, combining two modelling approaches (TreeNet and Random Forest) with two sets of variables (correlated variables removed or not). We used common evaluation methods area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) as well as independent test data to identify the most suitable model. As often found elsewhere, we found Random Forest with all environmental variables outperformed in all assessment methods. When we projected the best model to the latest IPCC-CMIP5 climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 in three Global Circulation Models (GCMs)), and averaged the project results of the three models, we found that suitable wintering habitats in the current bustard distribution would increase during the 21st century. The Northeast Plain and the south of North China were projected to become two major wintering areas for bustards. However, the models suggest that some currently suitable habitats will experience a reduction, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin. Although our results suggested that suitable habitats in China would widen with climate change, greater efforts should be undertaken to assess and mitigate unstudied human disturbance, such as pollution, hunting, agricultural development, infrastructure construction, habitat fragmentation, and oil and mine exploitation.

However, as the number of service antennas and users tend to infinity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cell and intra-cell interferences. Handling these interferences are challenging due to the large channel dimensionality and the high complexity associated with implementing large precoding/combining matrices. Moreover, two-tier massive MIMO is computationally demanding, as the high antenna count results in high-dimensional matrix operations when conventional MIMO hybrid precoding is applied. In this paper, a manifold learning two-tier beamforming (MLTB) scheme is proposed to enable efficient and low-complexity operation in large scale dimensional MIMO systems. Users of multi-cell are clustered into several regions of user groups by manifold learning. Most of the high-dimensional channels are embedded in the low-dimensional subspace by manifold learning, while retaining the potential spatial correlation of the high-dimensional channels. The nonlinearity of high-dimensional channel is transformed into local linearity to achieve dimensionality reduction. Through proper user clustering, the beamformers are split into outer beamformers and inner beamformers. The outer beamformers can minimize inter-cell interference and the inner beamformers can minimize multi-user interference of intra-groups. The high signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is achieved and the computational complexity is reduced by avoiding the conventional schemes to deal with high-dimensional channel parameters. Performance evaluations show that the proposed MLTB scheme can obtain near-optimal sum-rate and considerably higher energy efficiency than the conventional schemes.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964615", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2999041311", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18379931", "18473390", "13189670", "2063973", "30720722", "12771184", "205463182", "32245413", "10307837", "206828092", "62665804", "12466368", "9697421", "3096341", "22131316", "18505393", "21700820", "13714916", "639202", "52963005", "142532", "29087960", "49728216", "67856591", "15049524", "16151119", "14765452", "6603444", "115858308", "50539"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211060528"}

We also developed a deep-learning architecture and trained it on the same data set. We computed the receiver-operator characteristic for discrimination of non-tumor from tumor followed by conditional discrimination of necrotic from viable tumor and found our models performing exceptionally well. We then used the trained models to identify regions of interest on image-tiles generated from test whole slide images. The classification output is visualized as a tumor-prediction map, displaying the extent of viable and necrotic tumor in the slide image.

Our method, basically consists of two main parts: firstly, we detect faces and then recognize the detected faces. In the detection step, we use the skin color segmentation combined with AdaBoost algorithm, which is fast and also more accurate compared to the other known methods. Also, we use a series of morphological operators to improve the face detection performance. Recognition part consists of three steps: dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), feature selection using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification. Combination of PCA and LDA is used for improving the capability of LDA when a few samples of images are available. We test the system on the face databases. Experimental results show that the system is robust enough to detect faces in different lighting conditions, scales, poses, and skin colors from various races.

For Text-Conv, the initial detection is based on convolutional feature maps similar to those used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but learned using Convolutional k-means. Convolution masks defined by local and neighboring patch features are used to improve detection accuracy. The Word-Graph algorithm uses contextual information to both improve word segmentation and prune false character/word detections.

This general formulation is useful in that it can be applied without regard to variance differences between the classes. Ignoring these differences is not optimal, however, as the general SVM will give the class with lower variance an unjustifiably wide berth. This increases the chance of misclassification of the other class and results in an overall loss of predictive performance.

This novel method based on leader discrete wavelet coefficients for the estimation of the singularity spectrum is a well-suited technique for nonstationary and non-linear signals.

Regarding possible applications, adaptive hands have been successfully used for the execution of both robust grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks. However, the particular class of hands also suffers from certain shortcomings and drawbacks. For example, the use of underactuation leads to a post-contact reconfiguration of the fingers that may affect the force exertion capabilities of the hands during pinch grasping. In this paper, we focus on methods to predict the contact forces exerted by adaptive hands in pinch grasps, using their postcontact reconfiguration profile. The bending profiles of the fingers are recorded using ArUco trackers and IMU sensors that are embedded on the adaptive fingers and which are used to train appropriate regression models. More precisely, we examine the efficiency of the machine learning technique (Random Forests) in predicting the exerted contact forces during the reconfiguration phase of an adaptive finger.

In this regard, an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely applied to assess individuals' stress by analyzing brain waves in the clinical domains. With recent advancements in wearable EEG devices, EEG's ability can be extended to field workers, particularly by non-invasively assessing construction workers' stress. This study proposes a procedure to automatically recognize workers' stress in construction sites using EEG signals. Specifically, the authors collected construction field workers' EEG signals and preprocessed them to capture high-quality signals. Workers' salivary cortisol, a stress hormone, was also collected to label low or high-stress levels when they work at sites. Time and frequency domain features from EEG signals were calculated using fixed and sliding windowing approaches. Finally, the authors applied several supervised learning algorithms to recognize workers' stress while they are working at sites. The results showed that the fixed windowing approach and the Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) yielded the highest classification accuracy of 80.32%, which is very promising given the similar accuracy of stress recognition in clinical domains where extricate and wired EEG devices were used and the subjects engage in minimal body movement.

Neuroimaging studies have consistently revealed alterations in brain structure and function of individuals with ASD; however, it remains difficult to ascertain the extent and localization of affected brain networks. In this context, the application of Machine Learning (ML) classification methods to neuroimaging data has the potential to contribute to a better distinction between subjects with ASD and typical development controls (TD). This study is focused on the analysis of resting-state fMRI data of individuals with ASD and matched TD, available within the ABIDE collection. To reduce the multiple sources of heterogeneity that impact on understanding the neural underpinnings of autistic condition, we selected a subgroup of 190 subjects (102 with ASD and 88 TD) according to the following criteria: male children (age range: 6.5-13 years); rs-fMRI data acquired with open eyes; data from the University sites that provided the largest number of scans (KKI, NYU, UCLA, UM). Connectivity values were evaluated as the linear correlation between pairs of time series of brain areas; then, a Linear kernel Support Vector Machine (L-SVM) classification, with an inter-site cross-validation scheme, was carried out. A permutation test was conducted to identify over-connectivity and under-connectivity alterations in the ASD group. The mean L-SVM classification performance, in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), was 0.75 \u00b1 0.05. The highest performance was obtained using data from KKI, NYU and UCLA sites in training and data from UM as testing set (AUC = 0.83). Specifically, stronger functional connectivity (FC) in ASD with respect to TD involve (p < 0.001) the angular gyrus with the precuneus in the right (R) hemisphere, and the R frontal operculum cortex with the pars opercularis of the left (L) inferior frontal gyrus. Weaker connections in ASD group with respect to TD are the intra-hemispheric R temporal fusiform cortex with the R hippocampus, and the L supramarginal gyrus with L planum polare. The results indicate that both under- and over-FC occurred in a selected cohort of ASD children relative to TD controls, and that these functional alterations are spread in different brain networks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6763745", "pubmed_id": "31616322", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00620", "venue": "Front.

Our comparison shows that the proposed algorithm is just as accurate as these solvers, while being significantly faster, especially for large datasets.

By using support vectors from a learned SVM it is possible in our approach to use any standard Radial Basis Function (RBF) learning technique for the rule extraction, whilst avoiding the overlapping between classes problem. We will show that merging node centers and support vectors explanation rules can be obtained in the form of ellipsoids and hyper-rectangles. Next, in a dual form, following the framework developed for RBFNN, we construct an algorithm for SVM. Taking SVM as the main paradigm, geometry in the input space is defined from a combination of support vectors and prototype vectors obtained from any clustering algorithm. Finally, randomness associated with clustering algorithms or RBF learning is avoided by using only a learned SVM to define the geometry of the studied region.

However, ELM can only deal with cases where training and testing data are from identical distribution, while in real world situations, this assumption is often violated. As a result, ELM performs poorly in domain adaptation problems, in which the training data (source domain) and testing data (target domain) are differently distributed but somehow related. In this paper, an ELM-based space learning algorithm, domain space transfer ELM (DST-ELM), is developed to deal with unsupervised domain adaptation problems. To be specific, through DST-ELM, the source and target data are reconstructed in a domain invariant space with target data labels unavailable. Two goals are achieved simultaneously. One is that, the target data are input into an ELM-based feature space learning network, and the output is supposed to approximate the input such that the target domain structural knowledge and the intrinsic discriminative information can be preserved as much as possible. The other one is that, the source data are projected into the same space as the target data and the distribution distance between the two domains is minimized in the space. This unsupervised feature transformation network is followed by an adaptive ELM classifier which is trained from the transferred labeled source samples, and is used for target data label prediction. Moreover, the ELMs in the proposed method, including both the space learning ELM and the classifier, require just a small number of hidden nodes, thus maintaining low computation complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and text datasets are conducted and verify that our approach outperforms several existing domain adaptation methods in terms of accuracy while maintaining high efficiency.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29993853", "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2018.2816981", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2798199013", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["43580383", "1858029", "15978939", "14688775", "62354027", "740063", "2777306", "12456582", "14627863", "59566327", "13798326", "407822", "19869763", "9440223", "7176806", "14456120", "888650", "70831", "10613452", "19490133", "22122750", "195908774", "6892981", "4475252", "15589402", "116858", "8795925", "33342809", "15037168", "12020462", "206757279", "795927", "29984772", "12450925", "207114445", "10361983", "10906016", "25890860", "41024131", "14911849", "2916298", "33215860", "1993257", "125453005", "5726206", "206742596", "6742009", "118828957", "17105302", "961425", "6161478"], "inbound_citations": ["57759374", "195847412", "86717787", "208158334", "199442206", "13750248", "208648917", "210845124"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51612227"}

At the canopy level, RF was the classifier with an optimal balance of Sensitivity (0.75) and PPV (0.75). The most relevant vegetation indices were linked to the biochemical parameters chlorophyll, water, nitrogen, and cellulose as well as vegetation cover, which is in line with biochemical and ecophysiological properties reported for A. longifolia.

Traditional optimization methods cannot be directly applied in these cases, mainly due to memory restrictions.

This framework exploits the equivalence of the resulting learning problem with the task of building a minimal enclosing ball (MEB) problem in a feature space, where data is implicitly embedded by a kernel function. In this paper, we improve on the CVM approach by proposing two novel methods to build SVMs based on the Frank\u2013Wolfe algorithm, recently revisited as a fast method to approximate the solution of a MEB problem. In contrast to CVMs, our algorithms do not require to compute the solutions of a sequence of increasingly complex QPs and are defined by using only analytic optimization steps. Experiments on a large collection of datasets show that our methods scale better than CVMs in most cases, sometimes at the price of a slightly lower accuracy. As CVMs, the proposed methods can be easily extended to machine learning problems other than binary classification.

Basically, OCC algorithms achieve training by means of a single class sample, with potentially some additional counter-examples. The current OCC models give satisfaction in terms of performance, but there is an increasing need for the development of interpretable models. In the present work, we propose a one-class model which addresses concerns of both performance and interpretability. Our hybrid OCC method relies on density estimation as part of a tree-based learning algorithm, called One-Class decision Tree (OC-Tree). Within a greedy and recursive approach, our proposal rests on kernel density estimation to split a data subset on the basis of one or several intervals of interest.

The epidemiology of sudden cardiac death has been well studied, and efforts are shifting to risk assessment. This study aimed to test whether assessment of acute changes during hemodialysis that are captured in electronic health records improved risk assessment. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Data were collected from all hemodialysis sessions of patients 66 years and older receiving hemodialysis from a large national dialysis provider between 2004 and 2008. The primary outcome of interest was sudden cardiac death the day of or day after a dialysis session. This study used data from 2004 to 2006 as the training set and data from 2007 to 2008 as the validation set. The machine learning algorithm, Random Forests, was used to derive the prediction model. Results In 22 million sessions, 898 people between 2004 and 2006 and 826 people between 2007 and 2008 died on the day of or day after a dialysis session that was serving as a training or test data session, respectively. A reasonably strong predictor was derived using just predialysis information (concordance statistic=0.782), which showed modest but significant improvement after inclusion of postdialysis information (concordance statistic=0.799, P Conclusion Subtle changes in the experience of hemodialysis aid in the assessment of sudden cardiac death and are captured by modern electronic health records.

This scenario occurs in many real-world applications. For example, in some disease diagnosis, the cost of erroneously diagnosing a patient as healthy is much higher than that of diagnosing a healthy person as a patient. Also, the acquisition of labeled data requires medical diagnosis which is expensive, while the collection of unlabeled data such as basic health information is much cheaper. We propose the CS4VM (Cost-Sensitive Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine) to address this problem. We show that the CS4VM, when given the label means of the unlabeled data, closely approximates the supervised cost-sensitive SVM that has access to the ground-truth labels of all the unlabeled data. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm which first estimates the label means and then trains the CS4VM with the plug-in label means by an efficient SVM solver.

Two sets of experiments were collected on 22 subjects walking on a treadmill at an intermediate velocity using a \\unit[25]{GHz} CW radar. In one set, a clean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$-D spectrum is collected for each subject by placing the radar at a close distance to the subject. In the other set, variations are introduced in the experiment setup to introduce different noise and clutter effects on the spectrum by changing the distance and placing reflective objects between the radar and the target. Synthetic paired noisy and noise-free spectra were used for training, while validation was carried out on the real noisy measured data.

So the most efficient algorithm that can be applied for classification of microarray is SVM-RFE [3][8], which is an embedded method, which performs backward single gene elimination as well as classification of the dataset. A new modified algorithm is proposed with less computation over SVM-RFE. SVM-RFE generates the rank of the features and eliminates one lowest rank irrelevant feature, in each iteration.

This work elaborates on this distinction and gives an overview of various existing distributed SVM approaches developed in both kinds of scenarios.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-41706-6_5", "venue": "Solving Large Scale Learning Tasks", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2484996182", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52550919", "28895752", "52048922"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20372805"}

We propose two extensions to the standard stacking approach. In the first extension we combine a set of standard stacking approaches into an ensemble of ensembles using a two-step ensemble learning in the regression setting. The second extension consists of two parts. In the initial part a diversity mechanism is injected into the original training data set, systematically generating different training subsets or partitions, and corresponding ensembles of ensembles. In the final part after measuring the quality of the different partitions or ensembles, a max-min rule-based selection algorithm is used to select the most appropriate ensemble/partition on which to make the final prediction. We show, based on experiments over a broad range of data sets, that the second extension performs better than the best of the standard stacking approaches, and is as good as the oracle of databases, which has the best base model selected by cross-validation for each data set.

However, it is not always practical to acquire a sufficient corpus of labelled examples to train these methods. For these cases we describe an unsupervised method for text classification based on two hypotheses. Firstly, we propose that the class of a document may be determined by calculating its constituent features' similarity with prototypical examples of each class. Secondly, we note the importance of class priors in NaBayes classifiers, and hypothesize that class distributions might be estimated using the relative frequency of prototype words. Performing experiments on a corpus of biomedical abstracts with topic information derived from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), we investigate the charac- teristics of the method when used in conjunction with basic, linguistic and knowledge-based features, and find that the performance of the unsupervised method is approximately 80% that of NaBayes.

Once a road sign is detected in a video frame, it is continuously tracked from the next frame until it is disappeared. The 2-D position of a detected sign in the next frame is predicted by the 3-D motion of the vehicle. Here, the 3-D vehicle motion is acquired by using the 3-D pose information of the detected sign. Finally, the predicted 2-D position is corrected by template-matching of the scaled template of the detected sign within a window area around the predicted position.

An added benefit is that RF can also learn the subjective component of a user's search preferences. However for good retrieval performance, RF may require a large amount of user feedback for activity search. We address this issue by introducing Transfer Learning (TL) into RF.

We have applied statistical analysis and Association rules on real estate actual data and found that if we consider only customer demographic and professional details then relationship among various attributes are not that strong and it only predicts the customers who are in higher income group are willing to invest. After removing demographic details like caste, status, religion etc. we found that the relationship among remaining attributes become much stronger and its shows that customer in middle income group, house owners are also willing to invest. Further not only a person's professional details helps to identify a potential customer, in Indian context, his other responsibilities, expenditure heads also plays a crucial role .It is further proven that by taking into account the bank transaction details and buying interest of a customer, there is a drastic improvement in the results i.e. not only those customers, who are in high income group and potentially strong enough to invest but because of their other social responsibilities they are not able to do so and at the same time those who are following in middle or lower income group or having rented house with other investment are also likely to invest.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2558692425", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["57146809", "441296", "7541402", "64259583", "18840579", "60993494"], "inbound_citations": ["17818929", "16937586"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16603256"}

In this work, direct transferring from past users is investigated and applied to multiclass motor imagery BCI. Then, active learning (AL) driven informative instance transfer learning has been attempted for multiclass BCI. Informative instance transfer shows better performance than direct instance transfer which reaches the benchmark using a reduced amount of training data (49% less) in cases of 6 out of 9 subjects. However, none of these methods has superior performance for all subjects in general. To get a generic transfer learning framework for BCI, an optimal ensemble of informative and direct transfer methods is designed and applied. The optimized ensemble outperforms both direct and informative transfer method for all subjects except one in BCI competition IV multiclass motor imagery dataset.

First, the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm groups the inventory plots into strata with corresponding harvest probabilities. Second, Random Forest algorithms generate individual harvest probabilities for the plots of each stratum. Third, the plots with the highest individual probabilities are selected as harvested until the harvest probability of the stratum is fulfilled. Fourth, the harvested volume of these plots is predicted with a linear regression model trained on harvested plots only. To illustrate the pros and cons of this method, it is compared to a direct harvested volume prediction with linear regression, and a combination of logistic regression and linear regression. Direct harvested volume regression predicts comparable volume figures, but generates these volumes in a way that differs from business-as-usual.

Recent regional and global assessments indicate that groundwater extraction (GWE) for irrigation has increased more rapidly than surface water extraction (SWE), potentially resulting in groundwater depletion. Irrigated agriculture in semi-arid and arid regions is usually from a combination of stored surface water and groundwater. This paper assesses the usefulness of remotely-sensed (RS) derived information on both irrigation dynamics and rates of actual evapotranspiration which are both input to a river-reach water balance model in order to quantify irrigation water use and water provenance (either surface water or groundwater). The assessment is implemented for the water-years 2004/05-2010/11 in five reaches of the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia); a heavily regulated basin with large irrigated areas and periodic droughts and floods. Irrigated area and water use are identified each water-year (from July to June) through a Random Forest model which uses RS vegetation phenology and actual evapotranspiration as predicting variables. Both irrigated areas and actual evapotranspiration from irrigated areas were compared against published estimates of irrigated areas and total water extraction (SWE+GWE).The river-reach model determines the irrigated area that can be serviced with stored surface water (SWE), and the remainder area (as determined by the Random Forest Model) is assumed to be supplemented by groundwater (GWE). Model results were evaluated against observed SWE and GWE. The modelled SWE generally captures the observed interannual patterns and to some extent the magnitudes, with Pearson's correlation coefficients >0.8 and normalised root-mean-square-error<30%.

Acacia longifolia is an invasive shrub/small tree well known for its negative ecological impacts in several places around the world. The recent introduction of a biocontrol agent (Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae), an Australian bud-galling wasp which decreases flowering of A. longifolia, in Portugal, demands the development of a cost-efficient method to monitor its establishment. We tested how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can be used to map A. longifolia flowering. Our core assumption is as the population of the biocontrol agent increases, its impacts on the reduction of A. longifolia flowering will be increasingly visible. Additionally, we tested if there is a simple linear correlation between the number of flowers of A. longifolia counted in field and the area covered by flowers in the UAV imagery. UAV imagery was acquired over seven coastal areas including frontal dunes, interior sand dunes and pine forests considering two phenological stages: peak and off-peak flowering season. The number of flowers of A. longifolia was counted, in a minimum of 60 1m2 quadrats per study area. For each study area, flower presence/absence maps were obtained using supervised Random Forest. The correlation between the number of flowers and the area covered by flowering plants could then be tested. The flowering of A. longifolia was mapped using UAV mounted with RGB and CIR Cannon IXUS/ELPH cameras (Overall Accuracy > 0.96; Cohen\u2019s Kappa > 0.85) varying according to habitat type and flowering season. The correlation between the number of flowers counted and the area covered by flowering was weak (r2 between 0.0134 and 0.156). This is probably explained, at least partially, by the high variability of A. longifolia in what regards flowering morphology and distribution. The very high accuracy of our approach to map A. longifolia flowering proved to be cost efficient and replicable, showing great potential for detecting the future decrease in flowering promoted by the biocontrol agent. The attempt to provide a low-cost method to estimate A. longifolia flower productivity using UAV failed, but it provided valuable insights on the future steps.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5853265", "pubmed_id": "29568305", "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2018.00293", "venue": "Front.

Specifically this thesis aims to determine the joint positions of a non-augmented ::: hand. This thesis focuses on the use of depth, performing localisation of the parts of the hand for efficient fitting of a kinematic model and consists of four main contributions. The first contribution presents an approach to Multi-touch(less) tracking, where the objective is to track the fingertips with a high degree of accuracy without sensor contact. ::: Using a graph based approach, the surface of the hand is modelled and extrema of the hand are located. From this, gestures are identified and used for interaction. We briefly discuss one use case for this technology in the context of the Making Sense demonstrator inspired by the film \u201dThe Minority Report\u201d. This demonstration system ::: allows an operator to quickly summarise and explore complex multi-modal multimedia data. The tracking approach allows for collaborative interactions due to its highly efficient tracking, resolving 4 hands simultaneously in real-time. ::: The second contribution applies a Randomised Decision Forest (RDF) to the problem of pose estimation and presents a technique to identify regions of the hand, using ::: features that sample depth. The RDF is an ensemble based classifier that is capable of generalising to unseen data and is capable of modelling expansive datasets, learning ::: from over 70,000 pose examples. The approach is also demonstrated in the challenging application of American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling recognition. ::: The third contribution combines a machine learning approach with a model based method to overcome the limitations of either technique in isolation. A RDF provides initial segmentation allowing surface constraints to be derived for a 3D model, which is subsequently fitted to the segmentation. This stage of global optimisation incorporates ::: temporal information and enforces kinematic constraints. Using Rigid Body Dynamics for optimisation, invalid poses due to self-intersection and segmentation noise are resolved. ::: Accuracy of the approach is limited by the natural variance between users and the use of a generic hand model. The final contribution therefore proposes an approach to ::: refine pose via cascaded linear regression which samples the residual error between the depth and the model.

We divide the evaluation in three steps: 1) Descriptor Extraction, where we evaluate SIFT, SURF, DAISY, and Semantic Textons. 2) Visual Word Assignment, where we compare a k-means visual vocabulary with a Random Forest and evaluate subsampling, dimension reduction with PCA, and division strategies of the Spatial Pyramid. 3) Classification, where we evaluate the \u03c72, RBF, and Fast Histogram Intersection kernel for the SVM. Apart from the evaluation, we accelerate the calculation of densely sampled SIFT and SURF, accelerate nearest neighbor assignment, and improve accuracy of the Histogram Intersection kernel. We conclude by discussing whether further acceleration of the Bag-of-Words pipeline is possible.

This study uses a self-organizing connectionist model to simulate children\u2019s learning of Chinese characters. There are two major goals of our study: (1) To evaluate the degree to which connectionist models can inform us of the complex structural and processing properties of the Chinese orthography. One of the most difficult tasks in achieving this goal is how to faithfully capture the orthographic similarities of Chinese characters. We derived our character representations on the basis of analyzing a large-scale character database that can be readily mapped to school children\u2019s orthographic acquisition. (2) To test the utility of self-organizing neural networks in orthographic acquisition. Most previous connectionist models of orthographic processing have relied on the use of feed-forward networks. Results from our simulations present positive evidence for both of our goals. In particular, we show that our model demonstrates early regularity effects and frequency effects in the acquisition of Chinese characters, matching up with acquisition patterns from empirical research. Introduction In recent years there have been growing interests in the psycholinguistic study of orthographic acquisition in Chinese (see Yang & Peng, 1997; Shu & Anderson, 1998; Shu, Anderson, & Wu, 2000). A unique feature of the Chinese orthography is that it uses characters rather than alphabetic letters as the basic writing unit, in square configurations that map mostly onto meaningful morphemes rather than spoken phonemes. Processing or acquisition within this \u201cfractal\u201d organization of characters may differ in important ways from that of English and other alphabetic languages (Shu & Anderson, 1998). There are four major types of Chinese characters: pictographic, referential, associative compounds, and ideophonetic compounds. The last type, also known as the semantic-phonetic compounds or, simply, phonetic compounds, is the most interesting and important. In the Dictionary of Modern Chinese Frequent Characters (National Language Commission, 1988), there are 5,631 ideophonetic characters, accounting for 81% of the total 7,000 frequent characters in the dictionary (Li & Kang, 1993). Shu, Chen, Anderson, Wu, and Xuan (in press) collected 2,570 characters listed in the Elementary School Textbooks used in Beijing to establish the \u201cSchool Chinese Corpus\u201d. They categorized and labeled every character in this corpus, on dimensions such as phonetic part, phonetic type, position of the phonetic part in the character, age at which the character is taught, and frequency of the character. Shu et al.\u2019s analyses reveal that most of the Chinese characters taught in elementary schools are ideophonetics, as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Ratios of ideophonetics in each grade (Shu, Chen, Anderson, Wu, & Xuan, in press) Grade Ratio Mean Given the prominence of ideophonetics in Chinese orthography, it is thus important for us to understand the functions of these characters. Ideophonetics consist of two major components: the semantic part (often called a radical) that gives information about the character\u2019s meaning, and the phonetic part that gives partial information about the whole character\u2019s pronunciation. We say \u201cpartial\u201d, because the phonetic radical may or may not indicate the true pronunciation of the whole character, in one of three ways: (a) Regular: the whole character is pronounced the same as the phonetic radical in isolation \u2013 that is, the same as the phonetic radical when it is being used as a simple character; for example, \u201c /qing1/ and \u201c /qing1/\u201d. (b) Semi-regular: the whole character is pronounced partly as the phonetic radical, with a different", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4324/9781315782379-198", "venue": "Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society", "journal": "Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2625889667", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["36081219", "14005388", "69847728", "8611016", "10764579", "557347", "30165868", "204381096", "143694367", "33875978", "149382330"], "inbound_citations": ["14141038", "18107787", "4948213", "10410510"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15654449"}

Support Vector Machines (SVM) methodology was used for model development. A new methodology for elaboration of retention function models is proposed. Alternative to previous attempts known from literature, the \u03bd-SVM method was used for model development and the results were compared with the formerly used the C-SVM method. For the purpose of models' parameters search, genetic algorithms were used as an optimisation framework. A new form of the aim function used for models parameters search is proposed which allowed for development of models with better prediction capabilities. This new aim function avoids overestimation of models which is typically encountered when root mean squared error is used as an aim function. Elaborated models showed good agreement with measured soil water retention data. Achieved coefficients of determination values were in the range 0.67-0.92.

Many remote sensing image SR algorithms based on deep learning have been proposed recently, which can effectively improve the spatial resolution under the constraints of HR images. However, images acquired by remote sensing imaging devices typically have lower resolution. Hence, an insufficient number of HR remote sensing images are available for training deep neural networks. In view of this problem, we propose an unsupervised SR method that does not require HR remote sensing images. The proposed method introduces a generative adversarial network (GAN) that obtains SR images through the generator; then, the SR images are downsampled to train the discriminator with low resolution (LR) images.

The experimental methods in determining protein\u2013protein interactions are time-consuming and costly, which has motivated vigorous development of computational approaches for predicting protein\u2013protein interactions. A set of recently developed bioinformatics methods utilizes coevolutionary information of the interacting partners (e.g., as exhibited in the form of correlations between distance matrices, where, for each protein, a matrix stores the pairwise distances between the protein and its orthologs in a group of reference genomes). We proposed a novel method to account for the intra-matrix correlations in improving predictive accuracy. The distance matrices for a pair of proteins are transformed and concatenated into a phylogenetic vector.

Specifically, the color labels are propagated between regions sharing the same reflectance, and the direction of propagation is promoted to be from regions under full illumination and normal view angles to abnormal regions. We detect shadowed and highlighted regions as well as pairs of regions that have similar reflectance. A joint inference process is adopted to trim the inconsistent identities and connections.

{"paper_id": "150327489", "title": "Detection, avoidance, and compensation - three studies on extreme response style", "authors": [{"first": "Florian", "middle": [], "last": "Pargent", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Extreme Response Style (ERS) describes individual differences in selecting extreme response options in Likert scale items, which are stable over time (Weijters et al., 2010b; Wetzel, Ludtke, et al., 2016) and across different psychological constructs (Wetzel, Carstensen, & Bohnke, 2013). This thesis contains three empirical studies on the detection, avoidance, and compensation of ERS: ::: ::: In the first study, we introduce a new method to detect ERS which uses an ERS index from heterogeneous items as covariate in partial credit trees (PC trees; Komboz et al., 2016). This approach combines the objectivity of ERS indices from heterogeneous items (Greenleaf, 1992) with the threshold interpretation of ERS known from analyses with the ordinal mixed-Rasch model (Rost, 1991). We analyzed personality facets of 11714 subjects from the German nonclinical normative sample of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Ostendorf & Angleitner, 2004), and 3835 participants of the longitudinal panel of the GESIS - Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences (GESIS, 2015), who filled out the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Krohne et al., 1996), and the Questionnaire of Spatial Strategies (Munzer & Holscher, 2011). ERS was detected in all analyzed scales. The resulting pattern suggests that ERS reflects a stable trait with a continuous structure. ::: ::: In the second study, we investigate whether data from items with dichotomous response formats are unaffected by ERS, as has been assumed in the literature (Wetzel, Carstensen, & Bohnke, 2013). In a paper and pencil questionnaire, 429 German psychology students completed the Shyness scale from the Revised Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and the Achievement Orientation scale from the Revised Freiburger Persohnlichkeitsinventar (Fahrenberg et al., ::: 2001). ERS was assessed by an ERS index from heterogeneous items, a binary ERS measure based on the classification of an ordinal mixed-Rasch model, and a binary self-report measure of ERS. ERS measures were used as covariates in Rasch trees (Strobl et al., 2013) and DIF Lasso models (Tutz & Schauberger, 2015) of the dichotomous scales. We did not find any effect of ERS on dichotomous item responses. Adopting dichotomous response formats seems to be a reasonable strategy to avoid ERS. ::: ::: In the third study, we test whether instructions to give more or less extreme responses depending on participants\u2019 individual response tendencies, can counterbalance the impact of ERS. In an online questionnaire, 788 German subjects completed the Impulsivity and ::: Order facets of the NEO-PI-R three times under different ERS instructions. In the first round, a standard instruction was used. Participants in the experimental group received instructions for more or less extreme responses in the second and third round, while subjects in the control group responded under neutral instructions. ERS was measured by an ERS index from heterogeneous items and a self-report measure of ERS. Binary ERS classifications were used to create artificial datasets in which participants received an instruction which should either compensate or aggravate their individual response tendencies. Predictive performance of Random Forest models (Breiman, 2001), in which self-reported impulsive and orderly behaviors were predicted by the item responses, was compared between the compensation, aggravation, and control settings.

Furthermore, croplands are known as water guzzlers by consuming anywhere between 70% and 90% of all human water use globally. Given these facts and the increase in global population to nearly 10 billion by the year 2050, the need for routine, rapid, and automated cropland mapping year-after-year and/or season-after-season is of great importance. The overarching goal of this study was to generate standard and routine cropland products, year-after-year, over very large areas through the use of two novel methods: (a) quantitative spectral matching techniques (QSMTs) applied at continental level and (b) rule-based Automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) with the ability to hind-cast, now-cast, and future-cast. Australia was chosen for the study given its extensive croplands, rich history of agriculture, and yet nonexistent routine yearly generated cropland products using multi-temporal remote sensing. This research produced three distinct cropland products using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m normalized difference vegetation index 16-day composite time-series data for 16 years: 2000 through 2015. The products consisted of: (1) cropland extent/areas versus cropland fallow areas, (2) irrigated versus rainfed croplands, and (3) cropping intensities: single, double, and continuous cropping. An accurate reference cropland product (RCP) for the year 2014 (RCP2014) produced using QSMT was used as a knowledge base to train and develop the ACCA algorithm that was then applied to the MODIS time-series data for the years 2000\u20132015. A comparison between the ACCA-derived cropland products (ACPs) for the year 2014 (ACP2014) versus RCP2014 provided an overall agreement of 89.4% (kappa = 0.814) with six classes: (a) producer\u2019s accuracies varying between 72% and 90% and (b) user\u2019s accuracies varying between 79% and 90%. ACPs for the individual years 2000\u20132013 and 2015 (ACP2000\u2013ACP2013, ACP2015) showed very strong similarities with several other studies. The extent and vigor of the Australian croplands versus cropland fallows were accurately captured by the ACCA algorithm for the years 2000\u20132015, thus highlighting the value of the study in food security analysis.

A ray-tracing software is employed to generate samples for multiple routes in a typical urban environment, and different altitudes of Tx and Rx UAVs are taken into consideration. Two machine-learning algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, are exploited to build prediction models on the basis of the training data. The prediction performance of trained models is assessed on the test set according to the metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, two empirical models are presented for comparison. It is shown that the machine-learning-based models are able to provide high prediction accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency in the AA scenario.

The goal of this work is to build a computational model to predict mortality based on a series of SOFA scores. In addition, we examined the possibility of improving the prediction by incorporating a new component designed to measure the performance of the gastrointestinal system, added to the other six components. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this retrospective study, we used patients' three latest SOFA scores recorded during an individual ICU stay as input to different machine learning models and ensemble learning models. We added three validated parameters representing gastrointestinal failure. Among others, we used classification models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and a penalty function used to increase model robustness in regard to certain extreme cases, which may be found in ICU population. We used the Area under Curve (AUC) performance metric to examine performance. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We found an ensemble model of linear and logistic regression achieves a higher AUC compared related works in past years. After incorporating the gastrointestinal failure score along with the penalty function, our best performing ensemble model resulted in an additional improvement in terms of AUC metrics. We implemented and compared 36 different models that were built using both the information from the SOFA score as well as that of the gastrointestinal system. All compared models have approximately similar and relatively large AUC (between 0.8645 and 0.9146) with the best results are achieved by incorporating the gastrointestinal parameters into the prediction models. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Our findings indicate that gastrointestinal parameters carry significant information as a mortality predictor in addition to the conventional SOFA score.

The increased availability of sequence data for various eukaryotic organisms in recent years has necessitated for better tools and techniques for the prediction and analysis of promoters in eukaryotic sequences. Many promoter prediction methods and tools have been developed to date but they have yet to provide acceptable predictive performance. One obvious criteria to improve on current methods is to devise a better system for selecting appropriate features of promoters that distinguish them from non-promoters. Secondly improved performance can be achieved by enhancing the predictive ability of the machine learning algorithms used.ResultsIn this paper, a novel approach is presented in which 128 4-mer motifs in conjunction with a non-linear machine-learning algorithm utilising a Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to distinguish between promoter and non-promoter DNA sequences. By applying this approach to plant, Drosophila, human, mouse and rat sequences, the classification model has showed 7-fold cross-validation percentage accuracies of 83.81%, 94.82%, 91.25%, 90.77% and 82.35% respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity value of 0.86 and 0.90 for plant; 0.96 and 0.92 for Drosophila; 0.88 and 0.92 for human; 0.78 and 0.84 for mouse and 0.82 and 0.80 for rat demonstrate that this technique is less prone to false positive results and exhibits better performance than many other tools. Moreover, this model successfully identifies location of promoter using TATA weight matrix.ConclusionThe high sensitivity and specificity indicate that 4-mer frequencies in conjunction with supervised machine-learning methods can be beneficial in the identification of RNA pol II promoters comparative to other methods. This approach can be extended to identify promoters in sequences for other eukaryotic genomes.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2575220", "pubmed_id": "18834544", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-414", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2114090084", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9714763", "10156585", "40048108", "24439900", "8260975", "16355300", "81159334", "19150588", "21241292", "82192538", "215524634", "5705150", "12428267", "2464720", "2227441", "8200032", "17994432", "921245", "207165665"], "inbound_citations": ["10923207", "17944915", "17281926", "2968712", "58552820", "1885187", "52056384", "15346009", "14250181", "13101266", "31944376", "196349553", "199663763", "14601363", "7682154", "11214747", "15537034", "21686661", "206095758"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18789758"}

It is based on code words identified with the LZW universal text compressor. The LZW-Kernel is an alignment-free method, it is always symmetric, is positive, always provides 1.0 for self-similarity and it can directly be used with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in classification problems, contrary to normalized compression distance, which often violates the distance metric properties in practice and requires further techniques to be used with SVMs. The LZW-Kernel is a one-pass algorithm, which makes it particularly plausible for big data applications. Our experimental studies on remote protein homology detection and protein classification tasks reveal that the LZW-Kernel closely approaches the performance of the Local Alignment Kernel (LAK) and the SVM-pairwise method combined with Smith-Waterman (SW) scoring at a fraction of the time. Moreover, the LZW-Kernel outperforms the SVM-pairwise method when combined with Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) scores, which indicates that the LZW code words might be a better basis for similarity measures than local alignment approximations found with BLAST. In addition, the LZW-Kernel outperforms n-gram based mismatch kernels, hidden Markov model based SAM and Fisher kernel and protein family based PSI-BLAST, among others. Further advantages include the LZW-Kernel's reliance on a simple idea, its ease of implementation, and its high speed, three times faster than BLAST and several magnitudes faster than SW or LAK in our tests. ::: ::: ::: Availability and implementation ::: LZW-Kernel is implemented as a standalone C code and is a free open-source program distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from https://github.com/kfattila/LZW-Kernel. ::: ::: ::: Supplementary information ::: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Online.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29741583", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bty349", "venue": null, "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2800188919", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14441902", "33697418", "18396190", "911", "16441888", "190432", "14727192", "15215295", "33695205", "2632224", "195813716", "14864309", "10239406", "49022", "5612883", "902098", "15482342", "1871892", "9725578", "1192563", "12010325", "221927", "1111309", "669209", "44220459", "13647897", "35730151", "20031248", "6265817", "6707129", "7171788", "9267632"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13695511"}

As such, a major effort of this study was to collect data for the missing variables for analysis. Data were collected on over 7,000 miles of segments and over 1,000 intersections across Florida. Random Forest algorithm, which works well with highly-correlated data and data with many interactions, was applied to prioritize data variables based on their impacts on safety predictions.

Austerweil (Joseph Austerweil@Brown.edu) Brown University, Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Providence, RI 02912 Abstract not due to lack of interest, but rather the difficulty of empir- ically comparing these models. Some challenges include the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible clusterings for even a small number of items (e.g., there are more than 100,000 possible clusterings for 10 items; Pitman, 2002), the indirect and at times weak effect of cluster construction pro- cesses, and the sensitivity of the clusters reported by partici- pants to instructions (e.g., providing a number of clusters af- fects participants\u2019 responses; Pothos et al., 2011). In this article, I present one of the first empirical experi- ments that directly tests the psychological validity of com- putational models that construct clusters to group observa- tions. This new approach avoids the combinatorial explo- sion of having to test an insurmountably large number of stimuli on some measure. Instead, I test people\u2019s prior ex- pectations for constructing clusters and compare them to model predictions using an adaptive experimental technique, Markov chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP, which is also called iterated learning; Griffiths & Kalish, 2007; San- born, Griffiths, & Shiffrin, 2010). In this method, participant responses are used to guide the experiment towards testing clusters that are consistent with their prior expectations. Pre- vious work has shown that MCMCP is especially effective for eliciting peoples prior expectations over a large set of possi- bilities despite the combinatorial explosion (e.g., happy and sad faces; Martin, Griffiths, & Sanborn, 2012). In this article I first describe previous work testing models that construct clusters. Next, I explain MCMCP and present the experimental methods. Then, I describe the models tested in this paper (Bayesian nonparametric models, SUSTAIN, and a few alternatives). Last, I discuss the results and con- clude with implications and directions for future work. To generalize from one experience to the next in a world where the underlying structures are ever-changing, people construct clusters that group their observations and enable information to be pooled within a cluster in an efficient and effective man- ner. Despite substantial computational work describing poten- tial domain-general processes for how people construct these clusters, there has been little empirical progress comparing dif- ferent proposals to each other and to human performance. In this article, I empirically test some popular computational pro- posals against each other and against human behavior using the Markov chain Monte Carlo with People methodology. The re- sults support two popular Bayesian nonparametric processes, the Chinese Restaurant Process and the related Dirichlet Pro- cess Mixture Model. Keywords: Clustering, Bayesian modeling, Connectionist modeling, Categorization Introduction A child observing a 3-tined fork for the first time easily infers its function. She infers that it is more similar to the 4-tined forks she typically uses than to other eating utensils such as spoons and knives. To generalize information from one ob- servation (e.g., a 4-tined fork) to another observation (e.g., a 3-tined fork), people group their observations into clusters (e.g. forks). A cluster summarizes the information common to the stimuli within it, which enables efficient generaliza- tion and learning. In the example above, the child represents the category of utensils as a combination of three clusters: forks, spoons, and knives. A novel property learned about one fork should be generalized more to other forks (within- cluster) than to other utensils that are not forks. Given that underlying structures of the world are ever-changing and in- dividuals only observe limited information, the clusters that encode these structures need to be flexible to accommodate new types of items. However, a new item can be too different to fit in any existing cluster, and a new cluster must be con- structed. For example, when the child sees her first pair of chopsticks, she knows they are part of the category utensils, but they do not fit within her current set of clusters (forks, spoons, and knives). So she must create a new cluster to rep- resent chopsticks. How does the mind construct clusters to represent observations? Cognitive scientists have proposed several domain-general cluster construction processes with in a variety of domains, such as categorization (Anderson, 1991; Love, Medin, & Gureckis, 2004), associative learning (Gershman, Blei, & Niv, 2010), causal inference (Kemp, Tenenbaum, Niyogi, & Griffiths, 2010), perceived orientation (Austerweil, Friesen, & Griffiths, 2011), and word segmentation (Goldwater, Grif- fiths, & Johnson, 2009). Despite the proliferation of differ- ent proposals, there have been few attempts to compare the proposals and evaluate their psychological validity. This is Previous Empirical Work There are few empirical tests comparing human behavior to different computational models that construct clusters. One exception is Pothos et al. (2011), who tested how people construct clusters in the domain of unsupervised categoriza- tion without instructing participants to use a certain num- ber of clusters. Participants were asked to sort nine two- dimensional stimuli (spider-like images varying in the length of their \u201cbody\u201d and \u201clegs\u201d) into groups that felt intuitive. The authors compared participant sortings to their \u201cgoodness\u201d ac- cording to several unsupervised category learning models. Their results were equivocal, but generally, they supported SUSTAIN and a few other models better than the Rational Model of Categorization (a Dirichlet process mixture model using a particular approximation method; Anderson, 1991; Neal, 1998). Their results are an informative first comparison of human and model clustering in unsupervised categoriza-", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2408371135", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11625632", "181433975", "13157953", "12900028", "123196399", "60959233", "9777424", "18132921", "204176125", "7923429", "8040991", "13279794", "606503", "27148249", "12129013", "8869524", "2752821", "9726859", "145083336"], "inbound_citations": ["27609587", "1497375"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6180203"}

Designing a highly effective and efficient computational system, especially for identifying protein subcellular localization for gram-negative bacteria, is an important research field.In this paper, we propose a new computational system which combines a well-known classifier, support vector machines (SVMs), a protein descriptor, DP-PSSM (Directional Property-PSSM), and an optimal tool for system tuning.

Inaccuracy in estimating the thermal conductivity of frost on parallel surface channels will increase the error in predictions of frost thickness and density. In the present study, a mathematical method known as Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is utilized in order to develop a robust model for predicting the thermal conductivity of frost formation on parallel surface channels. Six key factors affecting the thermal conductivity of frost, namely, frost porosity, wall temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and time duration, are considered as the inputs to the model. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to determine the optimized hyper parameters (\u03b3 and \u03c32) of the LSSVM model. The reliability of the GA-LSSVM model is evaluated by comparing the model results with those of existing empirical correlations. The obtained mean square error, root mean square error, and relative root mean square error for the GA-LSSVM model are found to be 1.10e\u221205, RMSE = 3.3e\u221203, and RRMSE = 2.42%, respectively.

We evaluate the performance of ICGA-PSO-ELM and compare our results with existing methods in the literature. An investigation into the functions of the selected genes, using a systems biology approach, revealed that many of the identified genes are involved in cell signaling and proliferation. An analysis of these gene sets shows a larger representation of genes that encode secreted proteins than found in randomly selected gene sets. Secreted proteins constitute a major means by which cells interact with their surroundings. Mounting biological evidence has identified the tumor microenvironment as a critical factor that determines tumor survival and growth.

However, collecting and labeling so much data might be infeasible in many cases. In this paper, we introduce a deep transfer learning scheme, called selective joint fine-tuning, for improving the performance of deep learning tasks with insufficient training data. In this scheme, a target learning task with insufficient training data is carried out simultaneously with another source learning task with abundant training data. However, the source learning task does not use all existing training data. Our core idea is to identify and use a subset of training images from the original source learning task whose low-level characteristics are similar to those from the target learning task, and jointly fine-tune shared convolutional layers for both tasks. Specifically, we compute descriptors from linear or nonlinear filter bank responses on training images from both tasks, and use such descriptors to search for a desired subset of training samples for the source learning task. Experiments demonstrate that our deep transfer learning scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual classification tasks with insufficient training data for deep learning. Such tasks include Caltech 256, MIT Indoor 67, and fine-grained classification problems (Oxford Flowers 102 and Stanford Dogs 120).

A classification scheme based on the extraction of spatial, spectral and textural features previous to a hierarchical classification by Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed. The scheme extracts the spatial-spectral information by means of a segmentation algorithm based on superpixels and by computing morphological operations over the bands of the image in order to generate an Extended Morphological Profile (EMP). The texture features extracted help in the classification of vegetation classes as the spatial-spectral features for these classes are not discriminant enough.

Methods The concentration standard curve of the MRSA and MSSA was prepared. The bacteria were amplified and prepared into the same concentration according to the concentration formula. Near-infrared spectroscopy data of the MRSA and MSSA were collected and pretreated with first derivative, smoothing, normalization and baseline correction. After the pretreatment, the correlation analysis of the two kinds of bacteria was executed. The spectral data of bacteria with the wavelength from 900 to 2200 nm were analyzed by principal components. According to the results of cumulative contribution rate, the first three principal components were extracted and used as the input vector to establish Support Vector Machine models in three classifiers (linear, polynomial and RBF) and then a comparison of the three models was performed. Results The correlation coefficient of the pretreatment spectral curve of MRSA and MSSA was as high as 1.000. The training and test accuracies of the models were all over 95% after using the principal component analysis and Support Vector Machine models in three classifiers (linear, polynomial and RBF). The RBF classifier had the highest accuracy, and the result was 99.72%\u00b10.21% for training accuracy and 99.47%\u00b10.00% for the test accuracy.

The striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) has been shown to be involved in the internalization of the receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDR) and thus is associated with the disease.

The preliminary experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3184558.3186902", "venue": "WWW", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2798911628", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13842274"}

{"paper_id": "15900537", "title": "Processing Unification-based Grammars in a Connectionist Framework", "authors": [{"first": "Andreas", "middle": [], "last": "Stolcke", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "We present an approach to the processing of unification-based grammars in the connectionist paradigm. The method involves two basic steps: (1) Translation of a grammar\u2019s rules into a set of structure fragments, and (2) encoding these fragments in a connectionist network such that unification and rule application can take place by spreading activation. Feature structures are used to constrain sentence generation by semantic and/or grammatical properties. The method incorporates a general model of unification in connectionist networks. INTRODUCTION In recent years connectionist models have achieved notable results in modeling various aspect of perception and cognition. Although natural language processing has not been among the most prominent of its applications, there are a fair number of connectionist models of both language analysis and generation (Charniak & Santos, 1987; Cottrell, 1985; Dell, 1985; Fanty, 1985; Gasser, 1988; Kalita & Shastri, 1987; McClelland & Kawamoto, 1986). However, most of these models have a very narrow coverage, and hardly any attempts to take into account current linguistic theories of grammar (other than the basic context-free framework), for the most part adopting some ad-hoc linguistic formalism. This paper\u2019s connectionist approach to natural language is based on unification-based grammar, a formal framework which has gained wide acceptance within the linguistic community within the last decade through its various variants (Kay, 1984; Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982; Gazdar et al., 1985). Although it is legitimate to argue that, by their very natures, formal grammar and connectionist models have different objectives (being competence versus performance theories, respectively), this work is intended as a first step towards a reconciliation of the two paradigms. UNIFICATION-BASED GRAMMARS Lack of space does not allow a self-contained overview of the formal linguistic apparatus underlying this work (Shieber (1986) gives an excellent introduction). Instead, we will present the basic features of the formalism by way of a simple example, upon which further discussion can be based. The version of unification-based grammar used here is essentially the one found in the PATR-II system (Shieber et al., 1983). Feature Structures Unification-based grammar extends traditional context-free grammars by introducing additional structure to the language it describes. The usual tree-like phrase structure of a sentence (or sentential form) is referred to as its c-structure. Additionally, each node in the c-structure (i.e. each constituent) has assigned to it a matrix of feature-value pairs encoding grammatical properties, semantic content, etc., referred to as its feature structure or f-structure. Features and values can be any (mnemonically chosen) atomic labels. For example, the propositional semantics used in the sample grammar below will be encoded as f-structures of the form shown in Figure 1a. a.

This paper aims to solve the issue of data uncertainty, temporal behavior, and the absence of system order by developing a novel evolving recurrent fuzzy neural network, called evolving type-2 recurrent fuzzy neural network (eT2RFNN). eT2RFNN is constructed in a new recurrent network architecture, featuring double recurrent layers. The new recurrent network architecture evolves a generalized interval type-2 fuzzy rule, where the rule premise is built upon the interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function, whereas the rule consequent is crafted by the nonlinear wavelet function. The eT2RFNN adopts a holistic concept of evolving systems, where the fuzzy rule can be automatically generated, pruned, merged, and recalled in the single-pass learning mode. eT2RFNN is capable of coping with the problem of high dimensionality because it is equipped with online feature selection technology.

The incorporation of such views may inject subjectivity to the modeling phase. There is a recent literature on generating the views with financial forecasting methods, which employ either econometric or learning algorithms. In this research, we aim to propose a hybrid approach to the stream, in which GARCH modeling is used for predicting indicators for the stocks, followed by translating the indicator forecasts to return forecasts through Support Vector Regression. The obtained return forecasts are then fed into Black\u2013Litterman modeling as investor views vector in order to generate portfolios with rolling data. The proposed model is tested in two markets: an emerging market (BIST-30 index of Istanbul Stock Exchange) and a developed market (Dow Jones Index of US Stock Market). In general, the results reveal better portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios than the index return for different holding periods, as well as better portfolio returns than randomly generated portfolios.

However, existing graph CNNs generally use a fixed graph which may be not optimal for semi-supervised learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Learning-Convolutional Network (GLCN) for graph data representation and semi-supervised learning. The aim of GLCN is to learn an optimal graph structure that best serves graph CNNs for semi-supervised learning by integrating both graph learning and graph convolution together in a unified network architecture. The main advantage is that in GLCN, both given labels and the estimated labels are incorporated and thus can provide useful 'weakly' supervised information to refine (or learn) the graph construction and also to facilitate the graph convolution operation in GLCN for unknown label estimation. Experimental results on seven benchmarks demonstrate that GLCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traditional fixed structure based graph CNNs.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.09971", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2901359197", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15483870", "16902615", "17682909", "3016223", "1690180", "5575601", "10443309", "8316147", "6628106", "3144218", "18268744", "301319", "16852518", "5226376", "3051291", "1415308", "62016134", "3292002", "1052837"], "inbound_citations": ["201067462"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53786988"}

A feasibility study reveals that such a procedure is indeed easily and speedily mastered by naive listeners, but more difficult for word-level prominences. We furthermore examine whether \u201cdrummed\u201d annotations are comparable to those gathered with more established annotation protocols based on cumulative naive impressions and fine-grained expert ratings. These comparisons reveal high correspondences across all prominence annotation protocols, thus corroborating the general usefulness of the gestural approach. The analyses also reveal that all annotation protocols are strongly driven by structural linguistic considerations. We then use Random Forest Models to investigate the relative impact of signal and structural cues to prominence annotations. We find that expert ratings of prosodic prominence are guided comparatively more by structural concerns than those of naive annotators, that word-level annotations are influenced more by structural linguistic cues than syllable-level ones, and that \u201cdrummed\u201d annotations are driven least by structural cues.

However, the depth estimation of skin surface, using a light field camera that creates multiple images with a micro-lens array, is a difficult problem due to low-resolution images resulting in erroneous disparity matching. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Multiple low-resolution images decoded from a light field camera have limitations to accurate 3D surface reconstruction needed for haptic palpation. To overcome this, a deep learning method, Generative Adversarial Networks, was employed to generate super-resolved skin images that preserve surface detail without blurring, and then, accurate skin depth was estimated by taking multiple subsequent steps including lens distortion correction, sub-pixel shifted image generation using phase shift theorem, cost-volume building, multi-label optimization, and hole filling and refinement, which is a new approach for 3D skin surface reconstruction. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Experimental results of the deep-learning-based super-resolution method demonstrated that the textural detail (wrinkles) of super-resolved skin images is well preserved, unlike other super-resolution methods. In addition, the depth maps computed with our proposed algorithm verify that our method can produce more accurate and robust results compared to other state-of-the-art depth map computation methods. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Herein, we first proposed depth map estimation of skin surfaces using a light field camera and subsequently tested it with several skin images.

The effect of this phenomenon can be observed in other physiological signals like the heart rate variability, oxygen saturation, and the respiratory effort signals. In this study, features from these signals were extracted from 50 control and 50 OSA patients from the Sleep Heart Health Study database and implemented for minute and subject classifications. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used with linear and second-order polynomial kernels. For the minute classification, the respiratory features had the highest sensitivity while the oxygen saturation gave the highest specificity. The polynomial kernel always had better performance and the highest accuracy of 82.4% (Sen: 69.9%, Spec: 91.4%) was achieved using the combined-feature classifier. For subject classification, the polynomial kernel had a clear improvement in the oxygen saturation accuracy as the highest accuracy of 95% was achieved by both the oxygen saturation (Sen: 100%, Spec: 90.2%) and the combined-feature (Sen: 91.8%, Spec: 98.0%).

Among commonly detected symptoms on mammograms, mass detection is a challenging problem as the task is affected by high complexity of breast tissues, the presence of pectoral muscles as well as varying shape and size of masses. In this research, a novel framework is proposed which automatically detects mass(es) from mammogram(s) even in the presence of pectoral muscles.

These plasma metabolites and metabolic hormones, however, are difficult to measure on farm. Instead, easily obtained on-farm cow data, such as milk production traits, have the potential to predict metabolic status. Here we aimed (1) to investigate whether metabolic status of individual cows in early lactation could be clustered based on their plasma values and (2) to evaluate machine learning algorithms to predict metabolic status using on-farm cow data. Through lactation wk 1 to 7, plasma metabolites and metabolic hormones of 334 cows were measured weekly and used to cluster each cow into 1 of 3 clusters per week. The cluster with the greatest plasma BHB and FFA and the lowest plasma glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 was defined as poor metabolic status; the cluster with the lowest plasma BHB and FFA and the greatest plasma glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 was defined as good metabolic status; and the intermediate cluster was defined as average metabolic status. Most dairy cows were classified as having average or good metabolic status, and a limited number of cows had poor metabolic status (10\u201350 cows per lactation week). On-farm cow data, including dry period length, parity, milk production traits, and body weight, were used to predict good or average metabolic status with 8 machine learning algorithms. Random Forest (error rate ranging from 12.4 to 22.6%) and Support Vector Machine (SVM; error rate ranging from 12.4 to 20.9%) were the top 2 best-performing algorithms to predict metabolic status using on-farm cow data. Random Forest had a higher sensitivity (range: 67.8\u201382.9% during wk 1 to 7) and negative predictive value (range: 89.5\u201393.8%) but lower specificity (range: 76.7\u201388.5%) and positive predictive value (range: 58.1\u201378.4%) than SVM. In Random Forest, milk yield, fat yield, protein percentage, and lactose yield had important roles in prediction, but their rank of importance differed across lactation weeks. In conclusion, dairy cows could be clustered for metabolic status based on plasma metabolites and metabolic hormones. Moreover, on-farm cow data can predict cows in good or average metabolic status, with Random Forest and SVM performing best of all algorithms.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31477295", "doi": "10.3168/jds.2018-15791", "venue": "Journal of dairy science", "journal": "Journal of dairy science", "mag_id": "2970380333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201805571"}

To verify this hypothesis, we add a text detector module to a visual attention model and test if the inclusion increases the model\u2019s ability to predict eye fixation positions, particularly in scenes without any text. A model including text detector, saliency, and center bias is found to predict viewers\u2019 eye fixations better than the same model without text detector, even in text- absent images. Furthermore, adding the text detector \u2013 which was designed for English texts \u2013 improves the prediction of both English- and Chinese-speaking viewers\u2019 attention but with a stronger effect for English-speaking viewers. These results support the conclusion that, due to the viewers\u2019 everyday reading training, their attention in natural scenes is biased toward text features. Keywords: real-world scenes; text detector; eye movements; visual attention. Introduction When inspecting real-world scenes, human observers continually shift their gaze to retrieve information. Viewers\u2019 attention has been found to be biased toward visually salient locations, e.g., high-contrast areas, during scene viewing or search (Itti & Koch, 2001) or toward the center of the screen when viewing scenes on computer monitors (Tatler, 2007). Since it is also known that viewers pay a disproportionate amount of attention to faces (Cerf, Frady, & Koch, 2009), Judd, Ehinger, Durand, and Torralba (2009) equipped their model of visual saliency with a face detector (Viola & Jones, 2004) and a person detector (Felzenszwalb, McAllester, & Ramanan, 2008). In those images that contained depictions of people, their model with all features combined outperformed models trained on typical saliency features such as color, orientation, intensity, and contrast. Cerf et al. (2009) refined the \u201cstandard\u201d saliency model by adding a channel of manually-defined regions of faces, texts, and cellphones, and demonstrated that the enhancement of the model significantly improved its ability to predict eye fixations in natural images. Besides depictions of people, texts in natural scenes are usually important pieces of information, which could be shown on depictions of signs, banners, advertisement billboards, license plates, and other objects. Human text detection in natural scenes is critically important for people to survive in everyday modern life, for example, by drawing attention to traffic signs or displays showing directions to a hospital or grocery store. Our previous studies (Wang & Pomplun, 2011; under revision) suggested that attention seems disproportionately attracted by texts but that the specific visual features of texts, e.g., edge density, rather than typically salient features such as color, orientation, intensity, or contrast, are the main attractors of attention. This finding was in line with the results in Baddeley and Tatler (2006) that high spatial frequency edges, not contrasts, predict where we fixate. Automatic text detection has been a hot topic in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition for its practical applications. The special features of texts, e.g., the small variation of the stroke width (see Epshtein, Ofek, & Wexler, 2010; Jung, Liu, & Kim, 2009) or edge density (Lu, submitted) have been used to develop text detectors. Although many text detection techniques, i.e., texture- based, region-based, and stroke-based methods, have been reported, many non-text objects, such as windows, fences, or brick walls, easily cause false alarms (see Lu, submitted; Ye, Jiao, Huang, & Yu, 2007, for a review). Furthermore, many established text detectors are restricted under commercial patents. Therefore, only few text detectors are freely available or have been tested in visual attention studies. Lu, Wang, Lim, and Pomplun (submitted) developed specialized text features, e.g., histograms of edge width and edge density, trained with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The study reported better performance compared with earlier studies (e.g., Epshtein, et al., 2010; Jung, et al., 2009) on public text-detecting competition datasets (ICDAR2003 and ICDAR2005). In the present study, we used the automatic text detector developed by Lu et al. (submitted) to test whether it can improve the prediction of viewers\u2019 fixations. This detector employs contrast of strokes over background, width of strokes, joints of horizontal and vertical strokes, and stroke structure as key variables Although manually-defined regions of texts were shown to improve the prediction of eye fixations in text-present images (Cerf et al., 2009), it is unclear if viewers\u2019 attention is biased toward any non-text objects which share some features of texts, particularly in text-absent images.

Images were acquired following the path 193 and row 52, from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Images processing were done using 350 training sample for both; the purpose of supervised classification and accuracy assessment. Random Forest Algorithm (RFA) procedures in R-Software (version 3.3.2) were used for images classification. Furthermore, survey data were collected through group discussions and individual interviews with a 271 head of household respondents (pastoralists and agro-pastoralists) to investigate respondents\u2019 perceptions on land uses and covers changes and its impacts on their pastoral and agro pastoral resources and animal husbandry practices. Results showed that Land use dynamics was characterized by an increase in croplands at an average rate of 46.7 % per year, between 1989 and 2015. On the contrary a decline of pasture lands was observed since 2001 at an average rate of 6.0 % per year. Similar trends in land uses changes were observed by interviewed respondents who depicted an increase in cropping lands (98.5 % of respondents) to the detriment of pasture lands (97.8 % of respondents). To overcome these land use/land cover changes and it subsequent consequences, respondent pastoralists and agro pastoralists have developed local adaptations strategies. Thus, some measures are still needed at government level to sustain local pastoralist and agro-pastoralist efforts and strengthen their adaptive capacity.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5296/jas.v6i3.13474", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Animal Science", "mag_id": "2886303103", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201211973"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56251662"}

Through a special projection layer, FCN outputs are effectively aggregated across multiple views and scales, then are projected onto the 3D object surfaces. Finally, a surface-based CRF combines the projected outputs with geometric consistency cues to yield coherent segmentations. The whole architecture (multi-view FCNs and CRF) is trained end-to-end.

In this study for the first time, all effective predictors in Satellite Convection Analysis and Tracking version 2 (SATCASTv2) and NWP were applied over Iran from 22nd March 2015 to 9th January 2016. In applying SATCASTv2 over Iran, it was necessary to make some modifications to the algorithm, such as removing case specific thresholds of satellite predictors and rearranging COIN predictors. Then, SATCASTv2 was tested and evaluated with both the full and reduced set of predictors. The results suggested that using fixed thresholds for temporal difference predictors could miss COIN in some cases. To investigate the possibility of improving computational efficiency, a dimension reduction was conducted by Factor Analysis (FA) and the number of predictors was reduced from 22 to 11. The NWP-satellite, reduced NWP-satellite, and satellite predictors were used as input in Random Forest (RF), as a parametric machine learning method, for COIN evaluation. The Combination of NWP model and satellite predictors had lower false alarm rates in contrast with satellite predictors. This is in agreement with previous studies. The results from statistical metrics showed that the reduced NWP-satellite predictors had comparable performance to the NWP-satellite predictors over study area, but decreased the run time by almost 50%.

A critical step in automatic shoe-print identification is extraction of the shoe-print pattern.

The problem is formulated as one of labeling the regions of a shoeprint image as foreground/background. It is formulated as a machine learning task which is approached using a probabilistic model, i.e., conditional random fields (CRFs). Since the model exploits the inherent long range dependencies that exist in the shoe-print it is more robust than other approaches, e.g., neural networks and adaptive thresholding of grey-scale images into binary.

Many approaches have been proposed to classify the posted content. Most of them are based on a single classifier. However, it has been proved that combining multiple classifiers and ensemble learning may give better performance. It is noticed from the literature, that sentiment classification in Arabic language based on the ensemble learning has not been well explored. Therefore, we aim through this study to improve the Arabic sentiment classification by combining different classification algorithms. So, we investigated the benefit of multiple classifier systems on Moroccan sentiment classification. First, three classification algorithms, called Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and support vector machines, are adopted as base-classifiers. Second, stacking generalization is introduced based on those algorithms with different settings and compared with the majority voting.

In this paper, we propose a modified feature extraction step by using velocity and acceleration of root growth. In the second step, for plant classification, we employed different Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels and two hybrid systems of neural networks. Gated Negative Correlation Learning (GNCL) and Mixture of Negatively Correlated Experts (MNCE) are two ensemble methods based on complementary feature of classical classifiers; Mixture of Expert (ME) and Negative Correlation Learning (NCL). The hybrid systems conserve of advantages and decrease the effects of disadvantages of NCL and ME.

The ability to classify PET tissues, as normal versus abnormal tissues, is crucial for medical analysis and interpretation. For this reason, a system for classifying PET area is implemented and validated. The proposed classification is carried out using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method with the stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation strategy to enhance the classifier reliability. A dataset of eighty oncological patients are collected for system training and validation. For every patient, lesion (abnormal tissue) and background (normal tissue around the lesion) are contoured on PET images using a semi-automatic method. Then 160 vectors are obtained to train and validate the KNN. Each vector is composed by thirty Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs) characterizing the area under investigation (lesion or background). In one case, vectors are labeled as normal or abnormal tissues by a nuclear medicine physician using a semi-automatic method; in other cases, Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and k-means are used for labelling vectors in an unsupervised manner. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier comparing it to the Linear Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM).

Processing of MRI/PET images for brain pathology detection is a challenging task for radiologists. To address this issue the performance of various segmentation techniques has been analyzed with Independent component analysis (ICA) as a pre-processing step for removal of salt and pepper and speckle noise at 5dB noise level. There are so many segmentation methodology used for medical diagnosis, which comes under the classification strategy like supervised and unsupervised segmentation, region and edge based segmentation. The methodologies considered in this paper will cover the main classification strategy of segmentation for brain abnormality. Mean Shift (MS), Fuzzy C Means (FCM), Hough Transform (HT), Normalized Graph Cut (NGC), Thresholding by Histogram (ThH) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are taken here for performance analysis. Experimental results suggest that, for PET images, pathology detection is found good while using ICA as denoising method for removing salt and pepper and speckle noise at 5dB and SVM as segmentation technique. Whereas for MRI images the performance of both ThH and SVM goes hand in hand as a segmentation methodology with ICA as noise removal method. The evaluation measure used here are Jaccard and Dice Coefficient, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Global Consistency Error (GCE), Under Segmentation (UnS), Over segmentation (OvS) and Incorrect Segmentation (InC), Selectivity, Specificity, Accuracy, Positive predictive value (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV) .

An exploratory study involving 60 participants was performed, recording electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals using wearable devices. The real vs. virtual psychological comparison was performed using self-assessment emotional response tests, whereas the physiological comparison was performed through Support Vector Machine algorithms, endowed with an effective feature selection procedure for a set of state-of-the-art metrics quantifying cardiovascular and brain linear and nonlinear dynamics. We included an initial calibration phase, using standardized 2D and 360\u00b0 emotional stimuli, to increase the accuracy of the model. The self-assessments of the physical and virtual museum support the use of IVEs in emotion research. The 2-class (high/low) system accuracy was 71.52% and 77.08% along the arousal and valence dimension, respectively, in the physical museum, and 75.00% and 71.08% in the virtual museum.

This is feasible because of the similar operating system environments provided by Linux and Java. Also, the increasing capability of onboard computational systems allows for the hosting of complex algorithms onboard. The advantage of this approach is a reduction in the downlink data set. With increasing onboard systems capability, higher-order data products can be downlinked, as opposed to raw data. I. Introduction his report describes the process and results of the implementation of an image classification algorithm on a prototype onboard computer architecture. The application was implemented in Java, and ran on a Java virtual machine under the Linux operating system. The target onboard hardware was the FlatSat, a prototypical onboard computer architecture provided by the Orbiting Missions as Nodes on the Internet (OMNI) Project, at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The implementation modeled a scanning multispectral instrument, connected via an onboard local area Network (LAN) to the computer. The computer ran a classifier algorithm to preprocess and reduce the raw data to selected data sets of interest. This data was then \"downlinked\" to a ground system via transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) transport mechanism, and displayed. The implementation was accomplished very rapidly due to the use of standard hardware, software, and communication protocol interfaces, with ground-space commonality. The processing throughput agreed with expected results. The potential data reduction achieved ranged from 70% to 90%, which would manifest as a reduction of downlink bandwidth, and/or reduced usage of onboard storage resources. This demonstration demonstrated the value of using standardized software environments across similar hardware platforms, with standard communication protocols, to leverage ground-space commonality for rapid prototyping and migration.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2514/1.4099", "venue": "JACIC", "journal": "JACIC", "mag_id": "2045008718", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32616151"}

This paper presents Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for Feature Extraction (FE) from single-channel EMG for ten class wrist movements and handgrips. Two classification schemes were applied based on Time Domain-Auto Regression (TDAR) features (a commonly used approach in the Literature) and EMD, with Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. With the use of only one single-channel EMG, the EMD achieved an improvement in the classification rate for a single flexor and extensor EMG channel of 11.2% (from 83.7% to 94.4%) and 13% (from 80.16% to 93.16%), respectively. The results suggested that EMD remarkably improves the classification performance for a single-channel EMG over the traditional time domain FE technique.

Therefore, we propose an approach to use Fluorescein Fundus (FF) images, which are non-invasive and safe, to synthesize the invasive and harmful FFA images. Additionally, since paired data are rare and time-consuming to get, the proposed method uses unpaired data to synthesize FFA images in an unsupervised way. Previous unpaired image synthesis methods treat image translation between two domains in two separate ways and thus ignore the implicit feature correlation in the translation process. To solve that, the proposed method first disentangles domain features into domain-shared structure features and domain-independent appearance features. Guided by the adversarial learning, two generators will learn to synthesize FFA-like images and FF-like images correspondingly. Perceptual loss are introduced to preserve the content consistency during translation.

We propose an enhanced cycle-GAN based method with a novel auxiliary input for the generator by computing a stain color matrix for every H&E image in the training set. The matrix guides the translation in the generator, and thus stabilizes the cycle consistency loss. We applied our proposed method as a pre-processing step for a breast metastasis classification task on a dataset from five medical centers and achieved the highest performance compared to other color normalization methods. Furthermore, our method is template-free and may be applied to other datasets without finetuning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32239-7_77", "venue": "MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2980170728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204027764"}

Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand. Moreover, the interactive effects of demand-side management programs on load factor (load curve) and price signal are investigated by numerical indices.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.083", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Energy", "mag_id": "2268377817", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["115999881", "84839986", "36388569", "54952804", "56462081", "54897659", "54583998", "18505269", "215542036", "116312401", "211131097", "201135832", "57364287", "58673038", "212431227", "208212068", "115367358", "36735836", "11325825", "52899641", "96431351", "201741777", "25149061", "85463336", "116825806", "203583702", "117381676", "49268522", "51895444"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112407450"}

Over decades, a large number of research studies have concentrated on improving the accuracy of classification model. This is the case as several types of classifiers prove to be useful in real-life problems, including the prediction of system failure risk and microarray-based cancer diagnosis. Despite this, the accuracy of existing classifiers has been constrained by uninformative variables typically observed in modern data. In addition to feature selection, one may transform the original data to another variation, where only key feature components are included. Unlike conventional transformation-based techniques found in the literature, this paper presents a novel method that makes use of cluster ensembles, specifically the summarized information matrix, as the transformed data for the following classification step. Among different state-of-the-art methods, the link-based cluster ensemble approach (LCE) provides a highly accurate clustering, and thus particularly employed here. This is uniquely coupled with a diversity-driven generation of ensemble, which provides informative and diverse sets of clusterings. The performance of this transformation model is evaluated on published synthetic, standard and gene expression datasets; using C4.5, Naive Bayes, KNN, Neural Network and Random Forest classifiers; in comparison with benchmark techniques.

While the results obtained in this way are very promising, the use of the FIM relies on the assumptions that (a) the FIM can be approximated by its diagonal, and (b) that FIM diagonal entries are related to the variance of a DNN parameter in the context of Bayesian neural networks. In addition, the FIM is notoriously difficult to compute in automatic differentiation (AD) systems frameworks like TensorFlow, and existing implementations require an excessive use of memory due to this problem.

Data of 607 patients was randomly divided into training and test set applying 10-fold cross-validation. Using training sets, all three models were applied. Using Log-Rank test, ST was constructed by searching for optimal cutoffs. PT was selected plotting error rate versus minimum sample size in terminal nodes. In construction of RSF, 1000 bootstrap samples were drawn from the training set. C-index and integrated Brier score (IBS) statistic were used to compare models. Results. ST provides the most overoptimized statistics. Mean difference between C-index in training and test set was 0.237. Corresponding figure in PT and RSF was 0.054 and 0.007.

In this paper Probe Person data collected by 46 participants in three different cities of Japan, namely Niigata, Gifu and Matsuyama, was used. Although the data, comprising of acceleration and GPS information, was collected by a wearable device but the same can be achieved very easily with the help of smartphones. In order to address the most important problem of continuously changing position of smartphone during the trip, only resultant acceleration was taken.

Random Forest was applied for the purpose of prediction. 70% of the data was randomly selected to train the algorithm and rest 30% was used to test it.

In previous studies, the construction cost are estimated by statistical methods. Among the statistical methods, support vector regression (SVR) has attracted a lot of attentions because of the generalization ability in the field of cost estimation. However, despite the simplicity of the parameter to be adjusted, it is not easy to find optimal parameters. Therefore, to build an effective SVR model, SVR\u2019s parameters must be set properly without additional data handling loads. So this study proposes a novel approach, known as genetic algorithm (GA), which searches SVR\u2019s optimal parameters, then adopt the parameters to the SVR model for estimating cost in the early stage of apartment housing projects. The aim of this study is to propose a GA-SVR model and examine the feasibility in cost estimation by comparing with multiple regression analysis (MRA).

Users would likely assume that their activities (for example, the program or app they are using) and personal information (including age, religion, sexuality and gender) would remain confidential when using an encrypted network. However, we demonstrate how the analysis of encrypted traffic patterns can allow an observer to infer potentially sensitive data remotely, passively, undetectably, and without any network credentials. Without the ability to read encrypted WiFi traffic directly, the limited side-channel data available is processed. Following an investigation to determine what information is available and how it can be represented, it was determined that the comparison of various permutations of timing and frame size information is sufficient to distinguish specific user activities. The construction of classifiers via machine learning (Random Forests) utilising this side-channel information represented as histograms allows for the detection of user activity despite WiFi encryption. Studies showed that Skype voice traffic could be identified despite being interleaved with other activities. A subsequent study then demonstrated that mobile apps could be individually detected and, concerningly, used to infer potentially sensitive information about users due to their personalised nature. Furthermore, a full prototype system is developed and used to demonstrate that this analysis can be performed in real-time using low-cost commodity hardware in real-world scenarios. Avenues for improvement and the limitations of this approach are identified, and potential applications for this work are considered. Strategies to prevent these leaks are discussed and the effort required for an observer to present a practical privacy threat to the everyday WiFi user is examined.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2334014281", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4085789"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43437063"}

In the second step, three different features including 1- structural features based on single frame information, 2- features based on spatiotemporal volume and 3-motion-based features, are extracted for each episode of video. The PCA-LDA method is then applied to reduce the size of structural features and select more distinctive features. For the final step, we use fuzzy or a Weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM) classifier to identify video episodes. We also employ a multilayer Kohonen network as an initial clustering algorithm to increase the ability to discriminate between the extracted features into two classes of videos. Features based on motion and periodicity characteristics increase the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in videos with bad illumination and skin colour variation.

The opinions can be processed as a sentiment analysis to determine the positive opinions and negative opinions. The opinion will then be analyzed to determine factors that are the main cause of the ineligibility use of public transport as well as the factors that make the public choose to use this type of transport. By upgrading of facilities and services based on the results of sentiment analysis, it is expected that people will switch to use city public transportation, which would reduce the traffic jam. This research used SVM method to process sentiment analysis. The result has shown SVM accuracy reaches 78.12%, which indicates that the results of this reserach deserve to be considered.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21108/IJOICT.2016.21.85", "venue": "International Journal on Information and Communication Technology (IJoICT)", "journal": "International Journal on Information and Communication Technology (IJoICT)", "mag_id": "2485328771", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["58578436"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168513352"}

Hourly values of NO and NO 2 concentrations, as well as meteorological variables were recorded in a cross-road monitoring station with heavy traffic in Szeged in order to build a model for predicting NO and NO 2 concentrations several hours in advance. The prediction of NO and NO 2 concentrations was performed partly on the basis of their past values, and partly on the basis of temperature, humidity and wind speed data. Since NO can be predicted more accurately, its values were considered primarily when forecasting NO 2 . Time series prediction can be interpreted in a way that is suitable for artificial intelligence learning. Two effective learning methods, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Regression are used to provide efficient non-linear models for NO and NO 2 times series predictions. Multi-Layer Perceptron is widely used to predict these time series, but Support Vector Regression has not yet been applied for predicting NO and NO 2 concentrations. Grid search is applied to select the best parameters for the learners. To get rid of the curse of dimensionality of the spatial embedding of the time series Principal Component Analysis is taken to reduce the dimension of the embedded data. Three commonly used linear algorithms were considered as references: one-day persistence, average of several-day persistence and linear regression. Based on the good results of the average of several-day persistence, a prediction scheme was introduced, which forms weighted averages instead of simple ones. The optimization of these weights was performed with linear regression in linear case and with the learning methods mentioned in non-linear case. Concerning the NO predictions, the non-linear learning methods give significantly better predictions than the reference linear methods. In the case of NO 2 the improvement of the prediction is considerable; however, it is less notable than for NO.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.simpat.2008.08.006", "venue": "Simul.

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as a promising technology to provide a low-cost authentication for such devices. By exploiting intrinsic manufacturing process variations, PUFs are able to generate unique and apparently random chip identifiers. Strong-PUFs represent a variant of PUFs that have been suggested for lightweight authentication applications. Unfortunately, many of the Strong-PUFs have been shown to be susceptible to modelling attacks (i.e., using machine learning techniques) in which an adversary has access to challenge and response pairs. In this study, we propose an obfuscation technique during post-processing of Strong-PUF responses to increase the resilience against machine learning attacks. We conduct machine learning experiments using Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks on two Strong-PUFs: a 32-bit Arbiter-PUF and a 2-XOR 32-bit Arbiter-PUF. The predictability of the 32-bit Arbiter-PUF is reduced to \u2248 70% by using an obfuscation technique. Combining the obfuscation technique with 2-XOR 32-bit Arbiter-PUF helps to reduce the predictability to \u2248 64%. More reduction in predictability has been observed in an XOR Arbiter-PUF because this PUF architecture has a good uniformity.

In the first analysis, 197 artemisinin compounds were divided into training set and test set together with structural descriptors generated by DRAGON 6.0 software had been used to develop three QSAR models. Statistics of the models were (r2/ rtest 2) 0.790/0.853 for Forward Stepwise-Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), 0.807/0.789 for Genetic Algorithm (GA)-MLR and 0.795/0.811 for GA-Partial Least Square (PLS). The rigorously validated QSAR models were then applied to mine a chemical database which resulted in four potential new anti-malarial agents. The same artemisinin data set was then classified into active and less active compounds to develop reliable predictive classification models and to investigate the consequences of using various data splitting and data pre-processing methods on classification. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and boundary plot had been utilized to visualize the four classifiers namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). Kennard-Stone data splitting and standardization had produced better results in terms of percent correctly classified (% CC) compared to Duplex data-splitting and mean-centering. Moreover, LDA was found to be superior as compared to the other three classifiers with lower risk of over-fitting. Lastly, multiblock analysis methods such as Multiblock PLS and Consensus PCA have been implemented on polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs) data set together with their respective descriptors blocked into three groups labelled as X1D, X2D, X3D and a property block, Y which consists of log PL (Pa, 25\u00b0C), log KOW (25\u00b0C) and log SWL (mol/L, 25\u00b0C). Their performance were then compared to single block methods that is PLS and PCA. The PLS models of each descriptor block with respect to each property were statistically best-fitted and well predicted with rtrain 2 values greater than 0.96 while the rtest 2 values range from 0.86 to 0.98. It is interesting to note that the combination of the three descriptor blocks into a single block to produce Multiblock PLS superscores (MBSS) model which was superior than Multiblock PLS block-scores (MBBS) yielded slightly better rtrain 2 value and significantly better prediction with higher rtest 2 as compared to PLS model of individual descriptor block. In addition, three measures of block similarity such as Mantel Test, Rv coefficient and Procrustes analysis were used to investigate similarity and correlation between the blocks along with Monte Carlo simulations to determine their significance. Based on the similarity index between two blocks, X1D descriptors resembled Y block better while X2D was more correlated to X1D block. In short, the chemometric methods had been applied successfully on both data sets using various descriptors generated by DRAGON software and yielded promising results beneficial not only in chemometrics area but also in drug design.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2341687913", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112057944"}

Hospitals and cardiac centers rely heavily on ECG as a regular tool for evaluating and diagnosing Heart failure disease as an initial stage. The process of Heart failure disease identification from the ECG signal aims to reduce the time of the diagnostic process for patients with heart failure and to improve the outcomes of the detection process applied to these patients. The information acquired from the ECG signal simplifies the laboratory evaluation and other traditional diagnosis methods to evaluate and diagnose Heart failure disease. Unluckily, the problem of segmentation of the ECG signal is complicated because of similarities in time interval and amplitude between several ECG signal as well as the presence of noise in ECG signals. Most cardiologists use the ECG signal to identify Heart failure disease and their decision depends on the identification process, to determine whether surgery or medical treatment is required. This paper offers a new identification technique to overcome the current problems, such as overlapping in heart rate duration from the time interval from one PQRST wave to the next. In this study, the aim is to develop a new automatic method using improved support vector machine to diagnosis HFD from ECG signals. This is particularly relevant to ECG signals for the diagnosis of HFD as the first step to treatment and care of patients in general and specifically those with early heart disease to increase their overall survival. This paper outlines a hybrid approach of dual SVM and nonparametric algorithm to spot HFD in ECG signals leading to increase reliability and accuracy of identification and diagnosis of heart failure classes in the early stages using the proposed algorithm. The nonparametric algorithm is used to train SVM and its dual to get two models of SVM. The dual problem gives a different view that is better and sometimes simpler than the original problem. This feature is used to detect Heart failure disease in ECG signals by comparing the outputs of SVM model and those of dual SVM model. Experiments show that the hybrid approach produces good results, is more efficient and increases accuracy of Heart failure disease detection with an acceptable accuracy of 94.97% when compared with other algorithms to which the paper refers to.

Chemoinformatics methods could be efficiently used to establish a relationship between the reagent structures and the required reaction conditions, which would allow synthetic chemists to waste less time and resources in trying out various protocols in search for the appropriate one. In order to address this problem, a number of 2-classes classification models have been built on a set of 198 Michael reactions retrieved from literature. Trained models discriminate between processes that are compatible and respectively processes not feasible under a specific reaction condition option (feasible or not with a Lewis acid catalyst, feasible or not in hydrophobic solvent, etc.). Eight distinct models were built to decide the compatibility of a Michael addition process with each considered reaction condition option, while a ninth model was aimed to predict whether the assumed Michael addition is feasible at all. Different machine-learning methods (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest) in combination with different types of descriptors (ISIDA fragments issued from Condensed Graphs of Reactions, MOLMAP, Electronic Effect Descriptors, and Chemistry Development Kit computed descriptors) have been used.

In the literature, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) serve as a successful technique to simultaneously learn the spatio-temporal features. However, due to the expensive computations, usually the kernel size of the convolutions used in 3D CNNs is rather small, and thus largely limits their learning capability. To address this issue, in this paper we attempt to enhance the learning capability of 3D CNNs for extracting the dynamic features. We capture the long-distance information by modeling the temporal and spatial features as graphs, and then learn the dynamic graph structure information from the feature maps of 3D CNNs. This corresponds to the powerful Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), whose adjacent matrix is determined dynamically based on the feature maps. With the learnt dynamic graph, we introduce and fuse a framewise GCN and a channel-wise GCN to enhance the temporal and spatial feature learning of 3D CNNs. Our proposed spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) works as a general module that can be embedded into the popular 3D CNNs architectures (e.g., ResNeXt, P3D).

The results for both of these size regression experiments are consistent across a wide range of predictive time windows, indicating that the magnetic complexity features may be persistent in appearance long before flare activity.

Specifically, we show that an RCN trained to identify relationships between image-pairs drawn from a subset of digits from the MNIST database or the depth maps of subset of visual scenes from a moving camera generalizes the learned transformations to images of digits unseen during training or depth maps of different visual scenes. We infer, using Principal Component Analysis, that the high dimensional reservoir states generated from an input image pair with a specific transformation converge over time to a unique relationship. Thus, as opposed to training the entire high dimensional reservoir state, the reservoir only needs to train on these unique relationships, allowing the reservoir to perform well with very few training examples. Thus, generalization of learning to unseen images is interpretable in terms of clustering of the reservoir state onto the attractor corresponding to the transformation in reservoir space. We find that RCNs can identify and generalize linear and non-linear transformations, and combinations of transformations, naturally and be a robust and effective image classifier. Additionally, RCNs perform significantly better than state of the art neural network classification techniques such as deep Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) in generalization tasks both on the MNIST dataset and more complex depth maps of visual scenes from a moving camera.

Collective inference is one approach to exploit relational correlation patterns and significantly reduce classification error. However, much of the work on collective learning and inference has focused on discrete prediction tasks rather than continuous. %target values has not got that attention in terms of collective inference.

The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter Gardenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches. Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. Gardenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. Gardenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics.

At first, methods based on Supervectors (SVs) related to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) used as a discriminative model are described along with the Nuisance Attribute Projection (NAP). NAP was proposed to suppress undesirable influences of high channel variabilities between several sessions of a speaker. Next, recent methods focusing on the extraction of so called i-vectors (low dimensional representations of GMM based SVs) are discussed. The space in which i-vectors lie is denoted the Total Variability Space (TVS) since it contains both between-speaker and session/channel variabilities. Once i-vectors have been extracted a Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) model is trained in the TVS. In the training phase of PLDA the TVS is decomposed to a channel and a speaker subspace, hence each i-vector is supposed to be composed from a speaker identity component and a channel component. The complementarity of PLDA and SVM based modelling techniques is examined utilizing the linear logistic regression as a fusion tool used to combine the verification scores of individual systems leading to significant reductions in error rates of the SR system.

In this thesis, the mathematical model of full vehicle nonlinear active suspension systems with hydraulic actuators is derived to take into account all the motions of the vehicle and the nonlinearity behaviours of the active suspension system and hydraulic actuators. Four robust control types are designed and the comparisons among the robustness of ::: those controllers against different disturbance types are investigated to select the best controller among them. The MATLAB SIMULINK toolboxes are used to simulate the proposed controllers with the controlled model and to display the responses of the controlled model under different types of disturbance. The results show that the neurofuzzy controller is more effective and robust than the other controller types. The implementation of the neurofuzzy controller using FPGA boards has been investigated in this work. The Xilinx ISE program is employed to synthesis the VHDL codes that describe the operation of the neurofuzzy controller and to generate the configuration file used to program the FPGA. The ModelSim program is used to simulate the operation of the VHDL codes and to obtain the expected output data of the FPGA boards. To confirm that FPGA the board used as the neurofuzzy controller system operated as expected, a MATLAB script file is used to compare the set of data obtained from the ModelSim program and the set of data obtained from the MATLAB SIMULINK model. The results show that the FPGA board is effective to be used as a neurofuzzy controller for full vehicle nonlinear active suspension systems. The active suspension system has a great performance for vibration isolation. However the main drawback of the active suspension is that it is high energy consumptive. Therefore, to use this suspension system in the proposed model, this drawback should be solved. Electromagnetic actuators are used to convert the vibration energy that arises from the rough road to useful electrical energy to reduce the energy consumption by the active suspension systems. The results show that the electromagnetic devices act as a power generator, i.e. the vibration energy excited by the rough road surface has been converted to a useful electrical energy supply for the actuators. Furthermore, when the nonlinear damper models are replaced by the electromagnetic actuators, riding comfort and the road handling quality are improved. As a result, two targets have been achieved by using hydraulic actuators with electromagnetic suspension systems: increasing fuel economy and improving the vehicle performance.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "780038358", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["19223338", "8657604"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107087022"}

The increased information content of PolSAR provides more potential inputs for machine learning and classification applications; however, polarimetric parameters tend to be simply used as input variables and the optimum parameters to efficiently separate land classes and their physical meaning has received little attention. This research application proposes a Multi-temporal Binary-Tree Classification framework (MBTC) to identify and integrate optimum scattering parameters and machine learning methods in a meaningful way. First, the optimum scattering mechanism that most effectively distinguishes pairs of land classes is derived by a Lagrange multiplier. Next, for each pair of classes, machine learning classifiers are trained by the optimum scattering power ratio and elevated by Out-Of-Bag (OOB) cross validation. Three machine learning algorithms- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neutral Network (NN)- are investigated. Finally, a multi-temporal binary-tree classifier is constructed, in which each pair of land classes are distinguished by the optimized machine learning algorithms. Two independent study sites in Canada are used for evaluating the MBTC framework using RADARSAT-2 observations. The London site with 6 classes is used to analyze the optimum scattering mechanisms and execute a simple classification. The Carman site with 10 classes allows for an indepdent and comprehensive assessment of the MBTC by comparing against an advanced Model-Based Decomposition (MBD). At the London site, the MBTC achieves the maximum power ratio with the optimum scattering mechanism between each pair of classes and high overall accuracy (OA) of 91% and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.9. At the Carman site, comparisons indicate that MBTC significantly outperforms the MBD with NN and SVM classifiers but has a similar accuracy to the MBD for RF classifier with OA of 85% and Kappa of 0.82.

It is found that soft margin SVM like C-SVM, in the presence of outliers and class imbalance, give suboptimal results. Fuzzy SVM (FSVM) and class imbalance learning (CIL) appears to solve these problems of outliers and class imbalance respectively. The strength of FSVM in absorbing the effect of outliers strongly depends on how well we assign fuzzy membership values to the training samples. In this paper, we present a novel method for assigning these fuzzy membership values. The objective of our method is to assign membership values in the range (0, 1) to only those samples which are possibly outliers and not otherwise. For this, first density based clustering is performed to find the probable outliers and then assign them membership values based on one of the two heuristics. The heuristics use Hausdorff distance of the probable outliers from their own class. The proposed method was evaluated on three real world datasets.

However, most existing methods still have difficulties in learning representative features from the raw data. In addition, they assume that the feature distribution of training data in source domain is the same as that of testing data in target domain, which is invalid in many real-world bearing fault diagnosis problems. Since deep learning has the automatic feature extraction ability and ensemble learning can improve the accuracy and generalization performance of classifiers, this paper proposes a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) ensemble learning. Firstly, time domain vibration signals are converted into two dimensional (2D) gray-scale images containing abundant fault information by continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Secondly, a CNN model based on LeNet-5 is built to automatically extract multi-level features that are sensitive to the detection of faults from the images. Finally, the multi-level features containing both local and global information are utilized to diagnose bearing faults by the ensemble of multiple RF classifiers. In particular, low-level features containing local characteristics and accurate details in the hidden layers are combined to improve the diagnostic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by two sets of bearing data collected from reliance electric motor and rolling mill, respectively.

A combination of Moving Smoothing and Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) was applied as the pretreatment method.

Severe fire occurred more frequently at higher elevations and on north-facing, steep slopes and at locally wet, cool sites, which suggests that moisture limitations on productivity in the southwestern US interact with topography to influence vegetation density and fuel production that in turn influence burn severity. We use the Random Forest algorithm and a stratified random sample of burn severity pixels with corresponding pixels from 15 topographic layers as predictor variables to build an empirical model predicting the probability of occurrence for severe burns across the entire 1.4 million ha study area. Our model correctly classified severity with a classification accuracy of 79.5% when burn severity pixels were classified as severe vs. not severe (two classes). Because our model was derived from data sampled across many fires over a 20-year period, it represents average probability of severe fire occurrence and is unlikely to predict burn severity for individual fire events.

Classical VAD architectures used either temporal VAD or cepstral one to eliminate the silent segments in audio documents. In this work, we propose to use the both VAD in order to reduce silent detection errors. This new VAD architecture is evaluated on speaker diarization and detection systems using the BIC distance (Bayesian Information Criterion), two different classifiers, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier for the segmentation task and Hierarchical Ascending Clustering (HAC) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the clustering task. A comparative investigation was done between our new proposed VAD architecture and the classical ones applied in the preprocessing step of the speaker diarization/detection systems. For the evaluation task, the different VAD architectures were tested on telephonic conversations extracted from the NIST-2005 corpus. The results of experiments have shown that the new VAD architecture has considerably enhanced the performances of speaker diarization/detection systems, comparing to the classical VAD architectures.

Thus, this research applied Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) feature selection for Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to address the estimation problem and limitation of survival analysis of lymphoma cancer. The PSO-SVM is a procedure that identifies the most significant lymphoma information in terms of lymphoma features by calculating the fitness values and accuracy average of the features classification.

In this research, PSO-SVM outperformed classification of SVM without feature selection with improvements of survival accuracy between 0.09% and 22.28%. Apart from that, the survival analysis results could be extracted and interpreted into a more understandable explanation by using Decision Tree.

However, WOA suffers from the same problem faced by many other optimization algorithms and tend to fall in local optima. To overcome these problems, two improvements for WOA algorithm are proposed in this paper. The first improvement includes using Elite Opposition-Based Learning (EOBL) at initialization phase of WOA. The second improvement involves the incorporation of evolutionary operators from Differential Evolution algorithm at the end of each WOA iteration including mutation, crossover, and selection operators. In addition, we also used Information Gain (IG) as a filter features selection technique with WOA using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to reduce the search space explored by WOA.

In this paper, a time-varying identification model for crack monitoring data is built using support vector regression (SVR) and the Bayesian evidence framework (BEF). First, the SVR method is adopted for better modeling of the nonlinear relationship between the crack opening displacement (COD) and its influencing factors. Second, the BEF approach is applied to determine the optimal SVR modeling parameters, including the penalty coefficient, the loss coefficient, and the width coefficient of the radial kernel function, under the principle that the prediction errors between the monitored and the model forecasted values are as small as possible. Then, considering the predicted COD, the historical maximum COD, and the time-dependent component, forewarning criteria are proposed for identifying the time-varying behavior of cracks and the degree of abnormality of dam health. Finally, an example of modeling and forewarning analysis is presented using two monitoring subsequences from a real structural crack in the Chencun concrete arch-gravity dam.

As is known,rock burst is a kind of primary hazards that are likely to take place in the underground construction,which makes it necessary to forecast the likely frequency and intensity of such bursts efficiently and timely. Our approach lies in the following key points: The first, we have done an analysis of the influential factors and the relevant distinct criteria of such hazards in line with the features of the rock burst in underground construction. In doing so,we have set up the three discriminating factors,including \u03c3\u03b8/ \u03c3c,the ratio of the surrounding rock maximum circumferential stress to the rock compressive strength,\u03c3c/ \u03c3t,the ratio of the rock compressive strength to the tensile strength and the elastic energy index for classifying the rock burst intensity into three degrees,that is,none,inferior and medium. The second,we are going to introduce the OS-ELM briefly for forecasting the underground geological rock burst. In doing so, we have chosen 15 groups of typical geological rock burst sampling data collected both at home and abroad as the model input with the model output which should be regarded as the rock burst intensity. And,the third,we have established a corresponding OS-ELM discrimination model based on the said input and output data for the targeted rock burst. And,the fourth,when the sampling data was substituted into the model,the result we have gained from the model training would be able to reach the forecast precision,that is,as high as 97. 98%. Comparative analysis between the OS-ELM model and the SVM model and that between the OS-ELM model and the BP model in terms of the discriminating precision and training time shows that the result of OS-ELM model helped to improve the prediction accuracy and takes far less time than the other two models. And,fifthly,when we managed to apply the OS-ELM model to forecasting the two rock bursts in the construction of underground tunnels in China,the results we gained turned out well in accord with the corresponding in-situ conditions measured. Therefore,it can be said that the OS-ELM discrimination model we have developed enjoys better forecasting accuracy and training efficiency,which makes it both applicable and efficient in the rock burst intensity forecast.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Mechanics and Materials", "mag_id": "2386110031", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115002131"}

Cognitive testing scores were normalized based on data obtained from 43 healthy female controls and then used to categorize patients as impaired or not based on longitudinal changes. We measured clustering coefficient, a measure of local connectivity, by applying graph theory to baseline resting state fMRI and entered these metrics along with relevant patient-related and medical variables into random forest classification. Incidence of cognitive impairment at 1 year follow-up was 55% and was predicted by classification algorithms with up to 100% accuracy (p < 0.0001). The neuroimaging-based model was significantly more accurate than a model involving patient-related and medical variables (p = 0.005).

To address these problems, a Selective Multiple Kernel Learning (SMKL) method, inspired by Ensemble Learning (EL), is proposed. Comparing MKL with Lp - norm ( p \u2265 2 ) , SMKL obtains a sparse solution by a pre-selection procedure. Comparing MKL with L1-norm, SMKL preserves the sub-kernels with complementary information by guaranteeing the high discrimination and large diversity of pre-selected sub-kernels. For quantifying the discrimination and diversity of sub-kernels, a new kernel evaluation is designed. SMKL reduces the scale of MKL optimization and saves the memory storing of the sub-kernels, which extends the scale of problem that MKL could solve. Specially, a fast SMKL method using L \u221e - norm constraint is focused, which needs no MKL optimization process.

We explore different training approaches and demonstrate how, in CNN-based segmentation, multiple datasets can be effectively combined through transfer learning techniques, allowing for improved segmentation quality. The proposed method was evaluated using two different public datasets and compared favorably to existing methodologies. In the EADC-ADNI HarP dataset, the correspondence between the method\u2019s output and the available ground truth manual tracings yielded a mean Dice value of 0.9015, while the required segmentation time for an entire MRI volume was 14.8 seconds. In the MICCAI dataset, the mean Dice value increased to 0.8835 through transfer learning from the larger EADC-ADNI HarP dataset.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30877605", "doi": "10.1007/s12021-019-09417-y", "venue": "Neuroinformatics", "journal": "Neuroinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2920794225", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2909582", "15729548", "63061", "14012027", "22957049", "8297367", "39071403", "2356865", "10111903", "43185179", "37510752", "26239085", "34426665", "764149", "1815599", "1414682", "9629554", "3104625", "207195055", "5575601", "12388920", "247457", "206594692", "36888309", "5808102", "3272607", "814606", "148067", "6628106", "142792", "195908774", "8287991", "1761791", "14542261", "6250857", "18106824", "869181", "56507745", "215577571", "10840552", "3150599", "2869548", "9375363", "15539264", "6178557", "22850879", "3923111", "6383532", "3719281", "2930547", "20365179", "3090412", "2938537", "10150924", "2995286", "6842201", "1023605", "2751960", "4377181", "10293736", "9919502", "16295841", "10841677", "3743288", "10595020", "206418115", "91024", "10283138", "29029548"], "inbound_citations": ["211004026", "212672450", "210701837", "207987948"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:78093958"}

Given the stochastic behavior and high uncertainty of wind speed, in modern power systems with high penetration of wind power, precise wind speed forecasting is necessary for the power utility managers. To ensure that the prediction results are sufficiently precise, in this study, a multi-modal method is designed based on denoising and prediction modules. In denoising module, at first, the optimal configuration of Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders (SDAEs) is determined based on Genetic Algorithm (GA), and, then, SDAEs are applied for pre-training the data to reduce the input data noise. Due to the fact that different data sources have different noise bases, the optimal structure of the denoising module is arranged completely independent of various input data. In the forecasting module, the Sinusoidal Rough-Neural Network (SR-NN) is utilized to predict wind speed. After that, denoising and forecasting modules are stacked together to make the holistic deep structure network. In this study, the Deep Learning (DL) approach has been utilized to extract more robust features from the input data in the denoising process. To handle the high intermittent behavior of wind speed, the rough neurons are considered. Rough neurons are made up of two pairs of conventional neurons that are known to be upper and lower bound neurons. Since the wind speed has a periodic and nonlinear behavior, an ANN, based on the sinusoidal activation function, is more accurate than the typical type of sigmoid activation function. In this paper, weather data from Ahar, Iran, which has a high potential wind power, is considered. In modern power systems, the extra short-term forecasting is also needed; therefore, in this study, wind speed forecasting in one hour and 10-minute intervals are employed. Input data are selected based on Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA), and according to the GCA result, in addition to wind speed data at various heights, environmental data such as humidity and temperature are also considered. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, the simulation results are compared with other structures of ANNs and benchmarking machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) methods in different scenarios. In this comparison, the impact of DL has been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, the comparison of the performance of deep and shallow network structures has been studied.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.seta.2019.100601", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments", "mag_id": "3005209402", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214550643"}

Some researchers have gone so far as to claim that this paradigm poses a serious challenge to central tenets of cognitive science, including the widely held view that the mind can be analyzed in terms of abstract computational principles. On the other hand, computational approaches to the study of mind have led to the development of specific models that help researchers understand complex cognitive processes at a level of detail that theories of embodied cognition (EC) have sometimes lacked. Here we make the case that connectionist architectures in particular can illuminate many surprising results from the EC literature. These models can learn the statistical structure in their environments, providing an ideal framework for understanding how simple sensory-motor mechanisms could give rise to higher-level cognitive behavior over the course of learning. Crucially, they form overlapping, distributed representations, which have exactly the properties required by many embodied accounts of cognition. We illustrate this idea by extending an existing connectionist model of semantic cognition in order to simulate findings from the embodied conceptual metaphor literature. Specifically, we explore how the abstract domain of time may be structured by concrete experience with space (including experience with culturally-specific spatial and linguistic cues).

In order to expedite the process of discovering yield issues, companies have started looking for ways to perform early prediction for such issues. This paper suggests the use of the support vector machines (SVMs) for early wafer classification. The choice of SVM is motivated by the model's ability to effectively classify multivariate, multimodal, and inseparable data points. This model uses multidimensional hyperplanes to separate and classify wafers into low-yield and high-yield classes. This paper includes a proposal for how the classification model can be applied for yield classification and how it can be adaptively updated in a manufacturing environment. We show how the values for the SVM parameters can be selected for best yield classification. Furthermore, performance evaluation is conducted on real manufacturing data, comparing the proposed SVM classifier to state of the art.

SKEL optimally and sparsely weights and aggregates an ensemble of individual SVM classifiers which independently conduct learning within their corresponding randomly selected spectral feature sub-space using a Gaussian kernel. This ensemble decision is fully optimal, if the dimensionality of the randomly selected feature subspaces and the initial number of the sub-classifiers are determined optimally and is sub-optimal, otherwise. This suboptimality issue is addressed by taking a bottom-up approach. Individual sub-classifiers are added one-by-one optimally to the ensemble until the ensemble converges. The feature subspace of each individual classifier is optimally selected. The ensemble is modeled as a Quadratically-Constrained Linear Programming (QCLP) problem and optimized by combining Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) with a greedy, non-linear integer programming method for non-monotonic sparse feature sub-space selection.

Actions should be taken for prevention and self-management. Analysis of warning factors is beneficial for patients, on which some previous studies focused. They generally used the professional medical test factors or complete factors to predict and prevent, but it was inconvenient and impractical for patients to self-manage. With this in mind, this study built a Bayesian network (BN) model, from the perspective of diabetic patients\u2019 self-management and prevention, to predict six complications of T2DM using the selected warning factors which patients could have access from medical examination. Furthermore, the model was analyzed to explore the relationships between physiological variables and T2DM complications, as well as the complications themselves. The model aims to help patients with T2DM self-manage and prevent themselves from complications. Methods : The dataset was collected from a well-known data center called the National Health Clinical Center between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2009. After preprocess and impute the data, a BN model merging expert knowledge was built with Bootstrap and Tabu search algorithm. Markov Blanket (MB) was used to select the warning factors and predict T2DM complications. Moreover, a Bayesian network without prior information (BN-wopi) model learned using 10-fold cross-validation both in structure and in parameters was added to compare with other classifiers learned using 10-fold cross-validation fairly. The warning factors were selected according the structure learned in each fold and were used to predict. Finally, the performance of two BN models using warning features were compared with Naive Bayes model, Random Forest model, and C5.0 Decision Tree model, which used all features to predict. Besides, the validation parameters of the proposed model were also compared with those in existing studies using some other variables in clinical data or biomedical data to predict T2DM complications. Results : Experimental results indicated that the BN models using warning factors performed statistically better than their counterparts using all other variables in predicting T2DM complications. In addition, the proposed BN model were effective and significant in predicting diabetic nephropathy (DN) (AUC: 0.831), diabetic foot (DF) (AUC: 0.905), diabetic macrovascular complications (DMV) (AUC: 0.753) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DK) (AUC: 0.877) with the selected warning factors compared with other experiments.

In this paper I present a view of the connectionist approach that implies that the level of analysis at which uniform formal principles of cognition can be found is the subsymbolic level, intermediate between the neural and symbolic levels. Notions such as logical inference, sequential firing of production rules, spreading activation between conceptual units, mental categories, and frames or schemata turn out to provide approximate descriptions of the coarse-grained behaviour of connectionist systems. The implication is that symbol-level structures provide only approximate accounts of cognition, useful for description but not necessarily for constructing detailed formal models.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/BF00130011", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence Review", "journal": "Artificial Intelligence Review", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2019004430", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61400596", "207056183", "59674429", "62285311", "15118845", "209396626", "4642944", "40702643", "62537074", "145241471", "2484615", "209396626", "14915217"], "inbound_citations": ["15874388", "195847902", "5231046", "6685911", "14262165", "189479663", "27073741", "9201290", "18224532", "25782371", "16776823", "28672093", "5035780", "61533105", "5105134", "165154509", "52230596", "202541243", "214723042", "26226812", "215152433", "212644998", "215050429", "12854704", "195667729", "154648", "67310184", "53209597", "18856610", "1968756", "9521371", "17941440", "7062572", "73563609"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27428025"}

This paper assesses the effectiveness of the Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm in identifying a class differentiating gene set for sample classification. PBIL is based on iteratively evolving the genome of a search population by updating a probability vector, guided by the extent of class-separability demonstrated by a combination of features. PBIL is compared, both to standard Genetic Algorithm (GA), as well as to an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The algorithms are tested on a publically available three-class leukaemia microarray data set (n=72). After running 30 repeats of both GA and PBIL, PBIL was able to find an average feature-space separability of 97.04%, while GA achieved an average class-separability of 96.39%. PBIL also found smaller feature-spaces than GA, (PBIL \u2014 326 genes and GA \u2014 2652) thus excluding a large percentage of redundant features. It also, on average, outperformed the ANOVA approach for n = 2652 (91.62%), q < 0.05 (94.44%), q < 0.01 (93.06%) and q < 0.005 (95.83%). The best PBIL run (98.61%) even outperformed ANOVA for n = 326 and q < 0.001 (both 97.22%).

In this study, a semi-supervised feature learning pipeline is proposed to improve the performance of writer identification by training with extra unlabeled data and the original labeled data simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a weighted label smoothing regularization (WLSR) method for data augmentation, which assigns a weighted uniform label distribution to the extra unlabeled data. The WLSR method regularizes the convolutional neural network (CNN) baseline to allow more discriminative features to be learned to represent the properties of different writing styles.

Furthermore, because of environmental problems and intrinsic noise of spatio-temporal features, videos of similar actions may suffer from huge intra-class variations. In this paper, we address these problems by introducing the Energy-based Least Square Twin Support Vector Machine (ELS-TSVM) algorithm.

R.", "middle": [], "last": "Williamson", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "A neural model suggests how horizontal and interlaminar connections in visual cortical areas V1 and V2 develop within a laminar cortical architecture and give rise to adult visual percepts. The model suggests how mechanisms that control cortical development in the infant lead to properties of adult cortical anatomy, neurophysiology and visual perception. The model clarifies how excitatory and inhibitory connections can develop stably by maintaining a balance between excitation and inhibition. The growth of long-range excitatory horizontal connections between layer 2/3 pyramidal cells is balanced against that of short-range disynaptic interneuronal connections. The growth of excitatory on-center connections from layer 6-to-4 is balanced against that of inhibitory interneuronal off-surround connections. These balanced connections interact via intracortical and intercortical feedback to realize properties of perceptual grouping, attention and perceptual learning in the adult, and help to explain the observed variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes emitted by cortical neurons.

Quantitative citation analysis approaches have been used over the decades to measure the impact factor of journals, to rank researchers or institutions, to discover evolving research topics etc. Researchers doubted the pure quantitative citation analysis approaches and argued that all citations are not equally important; citation reasons must be considered while counting. In the recent past, researchers have focused on identifying important citation reasons by classifying them into important and non-important classes rather than individually classifying each reason. Most of contemporary citation classification techniques either rely on full content of articles, or they are dominated by content based features. However, most of the time content is not freely available as various journal publishers do not provide open access to articles. This paper presents a binary citation classification scheme, which is dominated by metadata based parameters. The study demonstrates the significance of metadata and content based parameters in varying scenarios. The experiments are performed on two annotated data sets, which are evaluated by employing SVM, KLR, Random Forest machine learning classifiers. The results are compared with the contemporary study that has performed similar classification employing rich list of content-based features. The results of comparisons revealed that the proposed model has attained improved value of precision (i.e., 0.68) just by relying on freely available metadata.

The class of DMOPs whose objective functions change over time steps, in ways that exhibit some hidden patterns has gained much attention. Their predictability indicates that the problem exhibits some correlations between solutions obtained in sequential time periods. Most of current approaches use linear models or similar strategies to describe the correlations between historical solutions obtained, and predict the new solutions in the following time period as an initial population from which the MOEA can begin searching in order to improve its efficiency. However, nonlinear correlations between historical solutions and current solutions are more common in practice, and a linear model may not be suitable for the nonlinear case. In this paper, we present a Support Vector Regression-based predictor to generate the initial population for the MOEA in the new environment. The basic idea of this predictor is to map the historical solutions into a high-dimensional feature space via a nonlinear mapping, and to do linear regression in this space. Support Vector Regression is used to implement this process. We incorporate this predictor into the Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) to construct a novel algorithm for solving the aforementioned class of DMOPs.

However, the quality of a classification is not always increased by considering a higher number of features. The experts are then used to define classification rules based on a laborious \"trial-and-error\" process. In this paper, we test a methodology to automatically determine an optimal subset of features for discriminating features. This method assumes that a reference land cover map (or at least training samples) is available. Two approaches were considered: a rule-based approach and a Support Vector Machine approach. For each approach, the method consists in ranking the features according to their potential for discriminating two classes. This task was performed thanks to the Jeffries-Matusita distance and Support Vector Machine-Ranking Feature Extraction (SVM-RFE) algorithm. Then, it consists in training and validating a classification algorithm (rule-based and SVM), with an increasing number of features: first only the best-ranked feature is included in the classifier, then the two best-ranked features, etc., until all the N features are included. The objective is to analyze how the quality of the classification evolves according to the numbers of features used. The optimal subset of features is finally determined through the analysis of the Akaike information criterion. The methodology was tested on two classes (urban an non urban areas) on a Spot5 image regarding a study area located in the La Reunion island.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "128466749", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["20208298", "61649919", "8924079", "12163199", "129024135", "7881621"], "inbound_citations": ["22807661", "207820125"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14406090"}

In this paper we present a new computerised system for automated Ki-67 LI estimation in meningiomas as an aid for histological grading of meningiomas and potential standard method of Ki-67 LI assessment. We also discuss the concordance of Ki-67 LI results obtained by presented computerized system and expert pathologist, as well as possible pitfalls and mistakes in automated counting of immunopositive or negative cells. For the quantitative evaluation of digital images of meningiomas the designed software uses an algorithm based on mathematical description of cell morphology. This solution acts together with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) used in the classification mode for the recognition of immunoreactivity of cells. The applied sequential thresholding simulated well the human process of cell recognition. The same digital images of randomly selected tumour areas were parallelly analysed by computer and blindly by two expert pathologists. Ki-67 labeling indices were estimated and the results compared. The mean relative discrepancy between the levels of Ki-67 LI by our system and by the human expert did not exceed 14% in all investigated cases. These preliminary results suggest that the designed software could be an useful tool supporting the diagnostic digital pathology.

The citrus flatid planthopper (CFP; Metcalfa pruinosa (Say, 1830)) is an invasive species in many countries. Predicting potential occurrence areas of the species related to environmental conditions is important for effective forest ecosystem management. In this study, we evaluated the occurrence patterns of the CFP and predicted its potential occurrence areas in South Korea using a random forest model for a hazard rating of forests considering meteorological and landscape variables. We obtained the occurrence data of the CFP in South Korea from literature and government documents and extracted seven environmental variables (altitude, slope, distance to road (geographical), annual mean temperature, minimum temperature in January, maximum temperature in July, and annual precipitation (meteorological)) and the proportion of land cover types across seven categories (urban, agriculture, forest, grassland, wetland, barren, and water) at each occurrence site from digital maps using a Geographic Information System. The CFP occurrence areas were mostly located at low altitudes, near roads and urbanized areas. Our prediction model also supported these results. The CFP has a high potential to be distributed over the whole of South Korea, excluding high mountainous areas. Finally, factors related to human activities, such as roads and urbanization, strongly influence the occurrence and dispersal of the CFP. Therefore, we propose that these factors should be considered carefully in monitoring and surveillance programs for the CFP and other invasive species.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/f10070583", "venue": null, "journal": "Forests", "mag_id": "2958345637", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207909787", "202011282", "203603683"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202031992"}

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

However, current speech recognition systems still generate erroneous output, which hinders the wide adoption of speech applications. Given that the goal of error-free output can not be realized in near future, mechanisms for automatically detecting and even correcting speech recognition errors may prove useful for amending imperfect speech recognition systems. This dissertation research focuses on the automatic detection of speech recognition errors for monologue applications, and in particular, dictation applications. ::: Due to computational complexity and efficiency concerns, limited linguistic information is embedded in speech recognition systems. Furthermore, when identifying speech recognition errors, humans always apply linguistic knowledge to complete the task. This dissertation therefore investigates the effect of linguistic information on automatic error detection by applying two levels of linguistic analysis, specifically syntactic analysis and semantic analysis, to the post processing of speech recognition output. Experiments are conducted on two dictation corpora which differ in both topic and style (daily office communication by students and Wall Street Journal news by journalists). ::: To catch grammatical abnormalities possibly caused by speech recognition errors, two sets of syntactic features, linkage information and word associations based on syntactic dependency, are extracted for each word from the output of two lexicalized robust syntactic parsers respectively. Confidence measures, which combine features using Support Vector Machines, are used to detect speech recognition errors. A confidence measure that combines syntactic features with non-linguistic features yields consistent performance improvement in one or more aspects over those obtained by using non-linguistic features alone. ::: Semantic abnormalities possibly caused by speech recognition errors are caught by the analysis of semantic relatedness of a word to its context. Two different methods are used to integrate semantic analysis with syntactic analysis. One approach addresses the problem by extracting features for each word from its relations to other words. To this end, various WordNet-based measures and different context lengths are examined. The addition of semantic features in confidence measures can further yield small but consistent improvement in error detection performance. The other approach applies lexical cohesion analysis by taking both reiteration and collocation relationships into consideration and by augmenting words with probability predicted from syntactic analysis. Two WordNet-based measures and one measure based on Latent Semantic Analysis are used to instantiate lexical cohesion relationships. Additionally, various word probability thresholds and cosine similarity thresholds are examined. The incorporation of lexical cohesion analysis is superior to the use of syntactic analysis alone. ::: In summary, the use of linguistic information as described, including syntactic and semantic information, can provide positive impact on automatic detection of speech recognition errors.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2118618626", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32670610"}

These algorithms also enable effective computer vision tasks for future robotic surgery. In this paper, we present a new unsupervised learning framework for high-quality pixel-wise smoke detection and removal. One of the well recognized grand challenges in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image processing is to obtain intra-operative medical imaging datasets for network training and validation, but availability and quality of these datasets are scarce. Our novel training framework does not require ground-truth image pairs. Instead, it learns purely from computer-generated simulation images. This approach opens up new avenues and bridges a substantial gap between conventional non-learning based methods and which requiring prior knowledge gained from extensive training datasets. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), we have developed a novel generative-collaborative learning scheme that decomposes the de-smoke process into two separate tasks: smoke detection and smoke removal. The detection network is used as prior knowledge, and also as a loss function to maximize its support for training of the smoke removal network. Quantitative and qualitative studies show that the proposed training framework outperforms the state-of-the-art de-smoking approaches including the latest GAN framework (such as PIX2PIX).

These findings may provide the clinician with guidelines for dental implant surgical procedures (i.e., to determine whether a one-stage or a two-stage protocol is required). Forty-five designated implant sites were selected. In each site texture features were extracted using gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM), Run length matrices, Histogram based ridgelet analysis, Minkowski dimensions (MDs). The operator subjectively rated the bone density during the osteotomy procedure. Then, Support Vector Machine, LDA networks are employed to build the mapping relationships between these features and quality of the bone respectively. A very difficult problem in classification techniques is the choice of features to distinguish between classes. Principal component analysis, ridgelet based feature vector algorithm and gray level features are compared in terms of the best recognition rate achieved and the optimal number of features.

The method exploits the notion of widely linear estimation to model the input-out relation for complex-valued data and considers two cases: 1) the complex data are split into their real and imaginary parts and a typical real kernel is employed to map the complex data to a complexified feature space and 2) a pure complex kernel is used to directly map the data to the induced complex feature space. The recently developed Wirtinger\u2019s calculus on complex reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is employed to compute the Lagrangian and derive the dual optimization problem. As one of our major results, we prove that any complex SVM/SVR task is equivalent with solving two real SVM/SVR tasks exploiting a specific real kernel, which is generated by the chosen complex kernel. In particular, the case of pure complex kernels leads to the generation of new kernels, which have not been considered before. In the classification case, the proposed framework inherently splits the complex space into four parts. This leads naturally to solving the four class-task (quaternary classification), instead of the typical two classes of the real SVM. In turn, this rationale can be used in a multiclass problem as a split-class scenario based on four classes, as opposed to the one-versus-all method; this can lead to significant computational savings.

In this paper, we propose a parallel random forest training framework on supercomputers called DistForest which can utilize multiple nodes to train random forest with large data sets concurrently. Firstly, DistForest applies master-slave architecture in which system will select some nodes as the primary node to distribute the large tasks to other slave nodes. Secondly, DistForest exploits a multilevel parallel strategy which pushes small tasks to a task queue rather than continues to distribute them among other slaves. Thirdly, DistForest can use the heterogeneous architecture of supercomputers to accelerated training process.

How to help people quickly find information from text data and how to help people discover new knowledge from text data has become an enormously important issue. Many research efforts have been made on text information extraction, retrieval, and mining; and significant progress has made in recent years. A large number of new methods have been proposed, and many systems have been developed and put into practical uses. This tutorial is aimed at giving an overview on two central topics of the area: namely Information Extraction (IE) and Information Retrieval (IR). Important technologies on them will be introduced. Specifically, models for IE such as Maximum Entropy Markov Model and Conditional Random Fields will be explained. Models for IR such as Language Model and Learning to Rank will be described. A brief survey on recent work on both IE and IR will be given. Finally, some recent work on the combined uses of IE and IR technologies will also be introduced.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11939993_6", "venue": "ISCSLP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1505174326", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22776726"}

The structured representation leads to a model that marries benefits traditionally associated with a discriminative approach, such as feature selection, with those of a generative model, such as principled regularization and ability to handle missing data. The factorization is provided by representing data in terms of aligned pairs of observations as different views. This provides means for selecting a representation that separately models topics that exist in both views from the topics that are unique to a single view. This structured consolidation allows for efficient and robust inference and provides a compact and efficient representation. Learning is performed in a Bayesian fashion by maximizing a rigorous bound on the log-likelihood. Firstly, we illustrate the benefits of the model on a synthetic dataset.

It brings contributions to the machine learning community using modern statistical techniques based on progress in the study of empirical processes.

The behavior of the reconstruction error is studied with a non-asymptotic point of view and concentration inequalities of the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix are provided. All these results correspond to fast convergence rates. Non-asymptotic results concerning the eigenspaces of KPCA themselves are also provided. A new algorithm of classification has been designed in the second part: the Kernel Projection Machine (KPM). It is inspired by the Support Vector Machines (SVM). Besides, it highlights that the selection of a vector space by a dimensionality reduction method such as KPCA regularizes suitably. The choice of the vector space involved in the KPM is guided by statistical studies of model selection using the penalized minimization of the empirical loss. This regularization procedure is intimately connected with the finite dimensional projections studied in the statistical work of Birge and Massart.

The random forest model achieved a classification accuracy of 80% and identified 29 FC connections (among 66 connections per frequency band), 3 neuropsychological variables from VST (total number of correctly performed trials in forward and backward sequences and average time for correct trials in forward sequence) and all four impulsivity scores (motor, non-planning, attentional, and total) as significantly contributing to classifying individuals as either AUD or CTL. Although there was a significant age difference between the groups, most of the top variables that contributed to the classification were not significantly correlated with age. The AUD group showed a predominant pattern of hyperconnectivity among 25 of 29 significant connections, indicating aberrant network functioning during resting state suggestive of neural hyperexcitability and impulsivity. Further, parahippocampal hyperconnectivity with other DMN regions was identified as a major hub region dysregulated in AUD (13 connections overall), possibly due to neural damage from chronic drinking, which may give rise to cognitive impairments, including memory deficits and blackouts. Furthermore, hypoconnectivity observed in four connections (prefrontal nodes connecting posterior right-hemispheric regions) may indicate a weaker or fractured prefrontal connectivity with other regions, which may be related to impaired higher cognitive functions. The AUD group also showed poorer memory performance on the VST task and increased impulsivity in all factors compared to controls. Features from all three domains had significant associations with one another. These results indicate that dysregulated neural connectivity across the DMN regions, especially relating to hyperconnected parahippocampal hub as well as hypoconnected prefrontal hub, may potentially represent neurophysiological biomarkers of AUD, while poor visual memory performance and heightened impulsivity may serve as cognitive-behavioral indices of AUD.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7139327", "pubmed_id": "32121585", "doi": "10.3390/bs10030062", "venue": "Behavioral Sciences", "journal": "Behavioral Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3009156215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["19409554", "3302375", "30486465", "14449076", "11856099", "9039584", "18536950", "128352880", "206966662", "1384448", "205154879", "14422844", "1523432", "52016488", "10538335", "209442961", "215421460", "151699316", "5053948", "24746521", "15180124", "1589766", "40498947", "22606485", "4670896", "214989030", "5011125", "83463708", "3578117", "46897868", "96433464", "2986744", "203929201", "89141", "26195150", "10663751", "70281313", "125984085", "2154749", "8355653", "147018164", "12496872", "1062439", "1946981", "215196904", "22532289", "7007185", "24731145", "11170628", "211474641", "145421074", "3733630", "19004730", "13722638", "12471072", "23777705", "44561845", "30889772", "40631023", "45251132", "1843498", "144156880", "147899538", "75328283", "12750991", "15414860", "3167595", "15202283", "5624301", "14055217", "3581570", "2344806", "93003798", "6361030", "12529212", "36692034", "17499307", "197421898", "1404875", "33082414", "10041770", "7707179", "2789548", "39646615", "205241864", "21770096", "1129313", "1117445", "28702815", "18600099", "5805341", "38782055", "15559994", "1810128", "7704178", "12224382", "52184584", "16680736", "40276749", "25003556", "18863596", "20916536", "5207836", "2061114", "23068837", "8564623", "40554503", "14835087", "21095820", "44470619", "18581958", "10650761", "13923418", "41486031", "7301474", "151551102", "30243052", "6487072", "45273564", "11474898", "16958300", "9784631", "8143801", "4403097", "207755787", "140840614", "145156496", "35416563", "142541770", "22334929", "42377719", "40068804", "26052409", "44451312", "5906359", "993145", "144943445", "44201543", "17072374", "13661246", "14000274", "10702274", "125728108", "1415949", "11685471", "6996937", "53721427"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211832189"}

The reconstruction of the original wiring for the target domain is a heavy burden due to the size of interconnections across neurons. We propose a distributed scheme that tunes the convolutional filters individually while backpropagates them jointly by means of basic probability assignment. Some of the most recent advances in evidence theory show that in a vast variety of the imbalanced regimes, optimizing of some proper objective functions derived from contingency matrices prevents biases towards high-prior class distributions. Therefore, the original filters get gradually transferred based on individual contributions to overall performance of the target domain. This largely reduces the expected complexity of transfer learning whilst highly improves precision.

Building on Random Forests (RF), Random Intersection Trees (RITs), and through extensive, biologically inspired simulations, we developed the iterative Random Forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order interactions with same order of computational cost as RF. We demonstrate the utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems: enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of primary transcripts in human derived cell lines. In Drosophila, among the 20 pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80% have been previously reported as physical interactions. Moreover, novel third-order interactions, e.g. between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived cells, iRF re-discovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated splicing regulation, and identified novel 5th and 6th order interactions, indicative of multi-valent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing regulation.

To investigate the determinants of AGB, we analyzed variables related to forest management, stand structure, topography, and climate. We developed linear (LM), generalized additive (GAM), and Random Forest (RF) empirical models to derive spatially explicit estimates and their uncertainty, and compared them. AGB was strongly influenced by forest management, as LiDAR-derived stand structure and stand age explained 80.9% to 89.8% of its spatial variability. The spatial heterogeneity of AGB varied positively with stand structural complexity and age in the managed forests. The type of predictive model had an impact on estimates of total AGB in our study site, which varied by as much as 19%. AGB densities varied from 0 to 492 \u00b1 17 Mg ha\u22121 and the highest values were predicted by GAM. Uncertainty was not spatially homogeneously distributed and was higher with higher AGB values. Spatially explicit AGB estimates and their association with management and other variables in the study site can assist forest managers in planning thinning and harvesting schedules that would maximize carbon stocks on the landscape while continuing to provide timber and other ecosystem services.

A wide range of variant annotations can be used for filtering call sets in order to improve the precision of the variant calls, but the choice of the appropriate filtering thresholds is not straightforward. Variant quality score recalibration provides an alternative solution to hard filtering, but it requires large-scale, genomic data. We evaluated germline variant calling pipelines based on BWA and Bowtie 2 aligners in combination with GATK UnifiedGenotyper, GATK HaplotypeCaller, FreeBayes and SAMtools variant callers, using simulated and real benchmark sequencing data (NA12878 with Illumina Platinum Genomes). We argue that these pipelines are not merely discordant, but they extract complementary useful information. We introduce VariantMetaCaller to test the hypothesis that the automated fusion of measurement related information allows better performance than the recommended hard-filtering settings or recalibration and the fusion of the individual call sets without using annotations. VariantMetaCaller uses Support Vector Machines to combine multiple information sources generated by variant calling pipelines and estimates probabilities of variants. This novel method had significantly higher sensitivity and precision than the individual variant callers in all target region sizes, ranging from a few hundred kilobases to whole exomes. We also demonstrated that VariantMetaCaller supports a quantitative, precision based filtering of variants under wider conditions. Specifically, the computed probabilities of the variants can be used to order the variants, and for a given threshold, probabilities can be used to estimate precision. Precision then can be directly translated to the number of true called variants, or equivalently, to the number of false calls, which allows finding problem-specific balance between sensitivity and precision. VariantMetaCaller can be applied to small target regions and whole exomes as well, and it can be used in cases of organisms for which highly accurate variant call sets are not yet available, therefore it can be a viable alternative to hard filtering in cases where variant quality score recalibration cannot be used.

With a variety of applications, sensor networks have the potential to influence everyone's life in the near future. However, in order for sensor network applications to realize this potential, there are a number of issues in deployment and exploitation of these networks that must be dealt with. Localization of the sensor nodes, which is the subject of this paper, is one of the basic problems that must be solved in order for sensor networks to be effectively used. This paper proposes to use a method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and probability to gain a fairly accurate localization of sensor nodes, while no extra equipment is assumed on the sensor nodes, as opposed to many of the existing methods. We demonstrate that Probabilistic SVM method (or PSVM) provides a significant improvement over existing localization methods, particularly in sparse networks and rough environments. In addition, we are proposing a post processing step for PSVM called ARPoFiL, which provides even more improvement to the accuracy of the location of sensor nodes.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734030", "venue": "2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications", "journal": "2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2148194546", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10964458", "2708820", "14933089", "3094631", "52874011", "10073761", "2767103", "209399974", "9995682", "15148150", "571135", "58695550"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23604925"}

From signal characteristics, it is found that energy distribution scatters in the cough spectrum, which is obviously different from speech signals. However, almost all feature extraction methods for cough detection in previous works are derived from the speech recognition domain. In this article, subband features are obtained by using gammatone filterbank and an audio feature extraction method.

We describe how we used GPS and tri-axial accelerometer (sampling at 64 Hz) collars to monitor behaviors of free-ranging pumas (Puma concolor), which are difficult or impossible to observe in the wild. We attached collars to twelve pumas in the Santa Cruz Mountains, CA from 2010-2012. By implementing Random Forest models, we classified behaviors in wild pumas based on training data from observations and measurements of captive puma behavior. We applied these models to accelerometer data collected from wild pumas and identified mobile and non-mobile behaviors in captive animals with an accuracy rate greater than 96%. Accuracy remained above 95% even after downsampling our accelerometer data to 16 Hz. We were further able to predict low-acceleration movement behavior (e.g. walking) and high-acceleration movement behavior (e.g. running) with 93.8% and 92% accuracy, respectively. We had difficulty predicting non-movement behaviors such as feeding and grooming due to the small size of our training dataset. Lastly, we used model-predicted and field-verified predation events to quantify acceleration characteristics of puma attacks on large prey. These results demonstrate that accelerometers are useful tools for classifying the behaviors of cryptic medium and large-sized terrestrial mammals in their natural habitats and can help scientists gain deeper insight into their fine-scale behavioral patterns. We also show how accelerometer measurements can provide novel insights on the energetics and predation behavior of wild animals. Lastly we discuss the conservation implications of identifying these behavioral patterns in free-ranging species as natural and anthropogenic landscape features influence animal energy allocation and habitat use.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4337468", "pubmed_id": "25709837", "doi": "10.1186/s40462-015-0030-0", "venue": "Movement Ecology", "journal": "Movement Ecology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2152779085", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["55183908", "13969863", "3160316", "13356805", "10251682", "32342781", "4330642", "17855461", "82394396", "145485736", "35064396", "83685292", "40500235", "13722664", "86651751", "3523229", "18667494", "1291647", "86300923", "85848866", "8457660", "7210412", "127181517", "6698407", "17297407", "56410299", "89141", "3626971", "18600099", "60993494"], "inbound_citations": ["92420818", "28400827", "215270286", "208561123", "52927707", "19410335", "204128202", "109929929", "91027579", "44178988", "214897901", "53084488", "53079407", "33062351", "215180480", "17959749", "211085144", "24683898", "214934871", "45729968", "90901704", "16778021", "195190363", "215093232", "89981772", "3969351", "102486947", "212743289", "4713913", "209473816", "53645166", "53569826", "2239283", "215033507", "199087657", "13747035", "92529297", "59223731"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10627722"}

Firstly, the raw signal is divided into a group of oscillatory components through SWD algorithm. The first component has the richest fault information and perceived as the principal oscillatory component (POC). Secondly, the MEDE value of the POC is calculated and used to describe the characteristics of signal. Ultimately, the obtained MEDE values of various states are trained and recognized by being input as the feature vectors into the RF classifier to achieve the automatic identification of rolling bearing fault under different operation states.

Consequently, anticipation of cyanotoxins presence is a matter of importance to prevent risks. The aim of this study is to build a cyanotoxin diagnostic model by using support vector machines and multilayer perceptron networks from cyanobacterial concentrations determined experimentally in the Trasona reservoir (recreational reservoir used as a high performance training centre of canoeing in the Northern Spain). The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each biological and physical-chemical variables on the cyanotoxins presence in the reservoir is presented through the model. Secondly, a predictive model able to forecast the possible presence of cyanotoxins is obtained. The agreement of the model with experimental data confirmed its good performance.

The learning of finite-state languages (FSL) from example strings is a domain which has been extensively studied and might provide an opportunity to help understand connectionist learning. A major problem is that traditional FSL learning assumes the storage of all examples and thus violates connectionist principles. This paper presents a provably correct algorithm for inferring any minimum-state deterministic finite-state automata (FSA) from a complete ordered sample using limited total storage and without storing example strings. The algorithm is an iterative strategy that uses at each stage a current encoding of the data considered so far, and one single sample string. One of the crucial advantages of our algorithm is that the total amount of space used in the course of learning for encoding any finite prefix of the sample is polynomial in the size of the inferred minimum state deterministic FSA. The algorithm is also relatively efficient in time and has been implemented. More importantly, there is a connectionist version of the algorithm that preserves these properties. The connectionist version requires much more structure than the usual models and has been implemented using the Rochester Connectionist Simulator. We also show that no machine with finite working storage can iteratively identify the FSL from arbitrary presentations.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1022642911489", "venue": null, "journal": "Machine Learning", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189901273"}

This separation of the 2 classes in multiple radial directions naturally motivates the development of Radial DWD.

Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more appropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary. Simulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better generalizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional kernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods essentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape of the separating boundary.

These features were used as the input parameters in classifying the dorsal and ventral surface at horizontal position. A new prediction model using decision rule was developed for identification of the dorsal and ventral surface. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were also used for the classification. Based on the results, a new prediction model gave the best percentage of classification with 83.5% successful compared to ANN (67.9%) and SVM (61.5%).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2937518230", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["15179648", "18954922", "18577332", "7040745", "22491915", "14579663"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145905696"}

Therefore, this thesis is focused to analyse affective behaviours on head and face. To this end, head and facial movements are encoded by using appearance based tracking methods. Specifically, a wise combination of deformable models captures rigid and non-rigid movements of different kinematics; 3D head pose, eyebrows, mouth, eyelids and irises are taken into account as basis for extracting features from databases of video sequences. This approach combines the strengths of adaptive appearance models, optimization methods and backtracking techniques. ::: ::: For about thirty years, computer sciences have addressed the investigation on human emotions to the automatic recognition of six prototypic emotions suggested by Darwin and systematized by Paul Ekman in the seventies. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) which uses discrete movements of the face (called Action units or AUs) to code the six facial emotions named anger, disgust, fear, happy-Joy, sadness and surprise. However, human emotions are much complex patterns that have not received the same attention from computer scientists. ::: ::: Simon Baron-Cohen proposed a new taxonomy of emotions and mental states without a system coding of the facial actions. These 426 affective behaviours are more challenging for the understanding of human emotions. Beyond of classically classifying the six basic facial expressions, more subtle gestures, facial actions and spontaneous emotions are considered here. By assessing confidence on the recognition results, exploring spatial and temporal relationships of the features, some methods are combined and enhanced for developing new taxonomy of expressions and emotions. ::: ::: The objective of this dissertation is to develop a computer vision system, including both facial feature extraction, expression recognition and emotion understanding by building a bottom-up reasoning process. Building a detailed taxonomy of human affective behaviours is an interesting challenge for head-face-based image analysis methods. In this paper, we exploit the strengths of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to enhance an on-line head-face tracker. A relationship between head pose and local facial movements is studied according to their cognitive interpretation on affective expressions and emotions. Active Shape Models are synthesized for AAMs based on CCA-regression. Head pose and facial actions are fused into a maximally correlated space in order to assess expressiveness, confidence and classification in a CBR system. The CBR solutions are also correlated to the cognitive features, which allow avoiding exhaustive search when recognizing new head-face features. Subsequently, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Bayesian Networks are applied for learning the spatial relationships of facial expressions. Similarly, the temporal evolution of facial expressions, emotion and mental states are analysed based on Factorized Dynamic Bayesian Networks (FaDBN). ::: ::: As results, the bottom-up system recognizes six facial expressions, six basic emotions and six mental states, plus enhancing this categorization with confidence assessment at each level, intensity of expressions and a complete taxonomy.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "26730981", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140878043"}

Also, in addition to the features related to the color of the lesion, features of the tissue are extracted from the three sub-areas of central, middle, and marginal of lesion. Subsequently, in order to select the best features, a sequential forward selection algorithm, which is carried out based on the classification error by a classifier, is employed. Finally, considering the optimal selected features, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to detect melanoma diagnosis.

In this context, learning robot behaviors in an imitation based approach would be desirable in the perspective of service robotics as well as of learning robots. In this work, we use Reservoir Computing (RC) for learning robot behaviors by demonstration. In RC, a randomly generated recurrent neural network, the reservoir, projects the input to a dynamic temporal space. The reservoir states are mapped into a readout output layer which is the solely part being trained using standard linear regression. In this paper, we use a two layered modular structure, where the first layer comprises two RC networks, each one for learning primitive behaviors, namely, obstacle avoidance and target seeking. The second layer is composed of one RC network for behavior combination and coordination. The hierarchical RC network learns by examples given by simple controllers which implement the primitive behaviors. We use a simulation model of the e-puck robot which has distance sensors and a camera that serves as input for our system.

The semantic orientation of a review can be positive, negative, or neutral. We examine the effect of valence shifters on classifying the reviews. We examine three types of valence shifters: negations, intensifiers, and diminishers. Negations are used to reverse the semantic polarity of a particular term, while intensifiers and diminishers are used to increase and decrease, respectively, the degree to which a term is positive or negative. The first method classifies reviews based on the number of positive and negative terms they contain. We use the General Inquirer to identify positive and negative terms, as well as negation terms, intensifiers, and diminishers. We also use positive and negative terms from other sources, including a dictionary of synonym differences and a very large Web corpus. To compute corpus-based semantic orientation values of terms, we use their association scores with a small group of positive and negative terms. We show that extending the term-counting method with contextual valence shifters improves the accuracy of the classification. The second method uses a Machine Learning algorithm, Support Vector Machines. We start with unigram features and then add bigrams that consist of a valence shifter and another word. The accuracy of classification is very high, and the valence shifter bigrams slightly improve it. The features that contribute to the high accuracy are the words in the lists of positive and negative terms. Previous work focused on either the term-counting method or the Machine Learning method.

The samples for model training were obtained from 3-D transient thermal analyses through finite element method (FEM) under different single-step currents. A temperature-rise test of 15 kV three-core cable joint was carried out and the estimated temperature based on SVR agrees well with the measured result with a maximum error of about 4 \u00b0C. Besides, the proposed model could accurately estimate the joint temperature even though the thermal conductivity of armor wrap used in thermal analysis for model training differs from its real value. The accuracies and calculation speed of the proposed model were compared with those of FEM, showing a better generality of our model. A temperature-rise test under unbalanced three-phase currents was performed and the temperature estimation errors are within 6 \u00b0C, indicating the applicability of the method.

Among many of DNN structures, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are currently the main tool used for the image analysis and classification purposes. Although great achievements and perspectives, deep neural networks and accompanying learning algorithms have some relevant challenges to tackle. In this paper, we have focused on the most frequently mentioned problem in the field of machine learning, that is the lack of sufficient amount of the training data or uneven class balance within the datasets. One of the ways of dealing with this problem is so called data augmentation. In the paper we have compared and analyzed multiple methods of data augmentation in the task of image classification, starting from classical image transformations like rotating, cropping, zooming, histogram based methods and finishing at Style Transfer and Generative Adversarial Networks, along with the representative examples. Next, we presented our own method of data augmentation based on image style transfer. The method allows to generate the new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of a base image with the appearance of another ones. The newly created images can be used to pre-train the given neural network in order to improve the training process efficiency.

Notably, two patients with ICN presented cysts. In the discovery phase, the urine of 11 MSK and 10 controls, were randomly selected, processed, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Subsequently, several statistical algorithms were undertaken to select the most discriminative proteins between the two study groups. ELISA, performed on the entire patients' cohort, was used to validate the proteomic results. After an initial statistical analysis, 249 and 396 proteins were identified exclusive for ICN and MSK, respectively. A Volcano plot and ROC analysis, performed to restrict the number of MSK-associated proteins, indicated that 328 and 44 proteins, respectively, were specific for MSK. Interestingly, 119 proteins were found to differentiate patients with cysts (all patients with MSK and the two ICN with renal cysts) from ICN without cysts. Eventually, 16 proteins were found to be common to three statistical methods with laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA-2) reaching the higher rank by a Support Vector Machine, a binary classification/prediction scheme.

They are classified in outer and inner retina diseases, and often cause blindness in childhood. The diagnosis for this type of illness is challenging, given the wide range of clinical and genetic causes (with over 200 causative genes). It is routinely based on a complex pattern of clinical tests, including invasive ones, not always appropriate for infants or young children. A different approach is thus needed, that exploits Chromatic Pupillometry, a technique increasingly used to assess outer and inner retina functions. This paper presents a novel Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), based on Machine Learning using Chromatic Pupillometry in order to support diagnosis of Inherited retinal diseases in pediatric subjects. An approach that combines hardware and software is proposed: a dedicated medical equipment (pupillometer) is used with a purposely designed custom machine learning decision support system. Two distinct Support Vector Machines (SVMs), one for each eye, classify the features extracted from the pupillometric data. The designed CDSS has been used for diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa in pediatric subjects. The results, obtained by combining the two SVMs in an ensemble model, show satisfactory performance of the system, that achieved 0.846 accuracy, 0.937 sensitivity and 0.786 specificity.

In mountain catchments, precipitation-runoff forecasts are limited by the intrinsic complexity of the processes involved, particularly its high rainfall variability. While process-based models are hard to implement, there is a potential to use the random forest algorithm due to its simplicity, robustness and capacity to deal with complex data structures. Here a step-wise methodology is proposed to derive parsimonious models accounting for both hydrological functioning of the catchment (eg, input data, representation of antecedent moisture conditions) and random forest procedures (eg, sensitivity analyses, dimension reduction, optimal input composition). The methodology was applied to develop short-term prediction models of varying time duration (4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 h) for a catchment representative of the Ecuadorian Andes. Results show that the derived parsimonious models can reach validation efficiencies (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) from 0.761 (4-h) to 0.384 (24-h) for optimal inputs composed only by features accounting for 80% of the model\u2019s outcome variance.

However, when the face pose changes largely, the performance of existing methods drop drastically. Efforts on pose-robust face recognition are highly desirable, especially when each face class has only one frontal training sample. In this study, we propose a 2D face fitting-assisted 3D face reconstruction algorithm that aims at recognizing faces of different poses when each face class has only one frontal training sample. For each frontal training sample, a 3D face is reconstructed by optimizing the parameters of 3D morphable model (3DMM). By rotating the reconstructed 3D face to different views, pose virtual face images are generated to enlarge the training set of face recognition. Different from the conventional 3D face reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm utilizes automatic 2D face fitting to assist 3D face reconstruction. We automatically locate 88 sparse points of the frontal face by 2D face-fitting algorithm. Such 2D face-fitting algorithm is so-called Random Forest Embedded Active Shape Model, which embeds random forest learning into the framework of Active Shape Model. Results of 2D face fitting are added to the 3D face reconstruction objective function as shape constraints. The optimization objective energy function takes not only image intensity, but also 2D fitting results into account. Shape and texture parameters of 3DMM are thus estimated by fitting the 3DMM to the 2D frontal face sample, which is a non-linear optimization problem. We experiment the proposed method on the publicly available CMUPIE database, which includes faces viewed from 11 different poses, and the results show that the proposed method is effective and the face recognition results toward pose variants are promising.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00500-009-0523-0", "venue": null, "journal": "Soft Computing", "mag_id": "2022154621", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10867640", "14398231", "24286709", "15742962", "16187654"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3283102"}

In attempt to satisfy both requirements, we propose a novel framework, called APS (standing for Analysis of Past States), which provides agent with learning capabilities with respect to saving system resources. The new solution is based on incremental association rule mining and maintenance. The APS process runs periodically in a cycle, in which phases of agent's normal performance intertwine with learning phases. During the former ones an agent stores observations in a history. After a learning phase has been triggered, the history facts are analyzed to yield new association rules, which are added to the knowledge base by the maintenance algorithm. Then the old observations are removed from the history, so that in the next learning runs only recent facts are processed in search of new association rules.

We extract from the sentence syntactic parse the subtrees that span potential argument structures of the target predicate and classify them in incorrect or correct structures by means of tree kernel based SVMs. Experiments on the PropBank collection show that the classification accuracy of correct/incorrect structures is remarkably high and helps to improve the accuracy of the SRL task.

Its challenges arise from high intra-class variability, illumination change, background clutter and occlusion. To solve this problem, we propose a novel solution that integrates the 2D information (RGB images), the 3D information (RGB-D images) and the object/scene context information together, and call it the Context-Assisted 3D (C3D) method. In the proposed C3D method, we first use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to jointly detect a 3D object in a scene and its scene category. Then, we improve the detection result furthermore with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model that incorporates the object potential, the scene potential, the scene/object context, the object/object context, and the room geometry. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed C3D method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection against the SUN RGB-D benchmark dataset.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jvcir.2018.05.019", "venue": "J.

Methods of variable selection are, therefore, of great significance in microarray data analysis.

This method identifies key variables most discriminative for each class, which offers possibility of unraveling the biological implication of selected genes. A salient advantage of the new strategy over existing methods is the capability of selecting genes that, though possibly exhibit a multimodal distribution, are the most discriminative for the classes of interest, considering that the expression levels of some genes may reflect systematic difference in within-class samples derived from different pathogenic mechanisms...", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19645418", "doi": "10.1021/ci900032q", "venue": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "mag_id": "2080736917", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3853674", "19349587", "208073466", "1854893", "27957119", "215451224"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:965590"}

Due to the rate-limiting provider for proinflammatory mediators, it is a particularly attractive target for drug development. Studies have revealed that indol derivate compounds can inhibit the activities of Cytosolic phospholipase A 2 \u03b1. However, few papers on the relationship between the molecular structure and the activity of inhibitor were reported. In this study, the Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) of indole derivates has been performed based on the dataset of 49 compounds. By using stepwise multiple linear regression, 5 descriptors were selected from 1777 molecular descriptors, including GGI5 (Topological charge index G 5 ), TIE(dssC) (sum of E-State of atom type dssC: \u00a6 2 S(dssC)), RDF115a (the atomic Sanderson ALOGP), RDF100c (the atomic charge), and RDF065p (the atomic polarizability). Subsequently, Partial Least Squares (PLS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were adopted to build the QSAR model, respectively. The independent test indicated that the SVM can give the best statistical results.

For the case that the frequency of the HF signal is much higher than that of the LF signal, under the adiabatic approximation condition, the expression of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with respect to the LF signal is obtained. It is shown that, the SNR is a non-monotonous function of the amplitude and frequency of the HF signal. In addition, the SNR varies non-monotonically with increasing the intensities of the multiplicative and additive noise, with increasing the delayed-time as well as increasing the system parameters of the FHN model.

To solve above problems, a dual-core CMF transmitter is developed with a DSP chip and an FPGA chip. The FPGA is used to realize a digital drive method for driving the flowtube to vibrate normally. The DSP is utilized to realize a zero-crossing detection algorithm for calculating the mass flowrate. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is adopted to establish the mass flow measurement error (MFME) model for on-line real-time correction. The experimental results show that the developed transmitter improves the update speed of the drive signal and drive efficiency, and reduces the execution time of the algorithm.

For this purpose, statistical tests have often been applied to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by the employment of the state-of-the-art learning machines including the Support Vector Machines (SVM) in particular. The SVM is a typical sample-based classifier whose performance comes down to how discriminant samples are. However, DEGs identified by statistical tests are not guaranteed to result in a training dataset composed of discriminant samples. To tackle this problem, a novel gene ranking method namely the Kernel Matrix Gene Selection (KMGS) is proposed. The rationale of the method, which roots in the fundamental ideas of the SVM algorithm, is described. The notion of ''the separability of a sample'' which is estimated by performing [Formula: see text]-like statistics on each column of the kernel matrix, is first introduced. The separability of a classification problem is then measured, from which the significance of a specific gene is deduced. Also described is a method of Kernel Matrix Sequential Forward Selection (KMSFS) which shares the KMGS method's essential ideas but proceeds in a greedy manner.

In recent literature, a multitude of supervised embedded feature selection procedures has been proposed. Regardless if they are configured as Single Objective (SOO) or Multi-Objective Optimizations (MOO), the embedded methods assess the quality of feature vectors by directly verifying their usefulness on a specific classifier. In this context, defining objective functions independent of the classifier model is almost impossible, meaning that feature selection is inherently disturbed by the incorporated classification method. This paper solves the EEG n-back memory task classification using a new embedded feature selection procedure based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The optimization method provides a more robust verification of the competing attributes, by using a switching mechanism which permits assessing the quality of the solutions on multiple classifiers, without significantly increasing the computational time of individuals' evaluation. The approach is exemplified for Random Forests (RF) and Support Vectors Machine (SVM); these two classifiers are interesting for feature selection problems because they offer limited indications regarding the relevance/ irrelevance of the features. This paper also discusses the design of EEG signal preprocessing, meant for enhancing the relevance of the samples for the n-back memory task EEG classification.

However, the same vector cannot accurately capture a user's varying preferences on all items, especially when considering the diverse characteristics of various items. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Attentive Metric Learning (MAML) method to model user diverse preferences for various items. In particular, for each user-item pair, we propose an attention neural network, which exploits the item's multimodal features to estimate the user's special attention to different aspects of this item. The obtained attention is then integrated into a metric-based learning method to predict the user preference on this item. The advantage of metric learning is that it can naturally overcome the problem of dot product similarity, which is adopted by matrix factorization (MF) based recommendation models but does not satisfy the triangle inequality property. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the attention mechanism cannot only help model user's diverse preferences towards different items, but also overcome the geometrically restrictive problem caused by collaborative metric learning.

An online small leakage detection method based on chaos characteristics and Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) is proposed in this paper. For the first time, the relationship between the chaos characteristics of pipeline inner pressures and the small leakages is investigated and applied in the pipeline detection method. Firstly, chaos in the pipeline inner pressure is found. Relevant chaos characteristics are estimated by the nonlinear time series analysis package (TISEAN). Then LS-SVM with a hybrid kernel is built and named as hybrid kernel LS-SVM (HKLS-SVM). It is applied to analyze the chaos characteristics and distinguish the negative pressure waves (NPWs) caused by small leaks. A new leak location method is also expounded. Finally, data of the chaotic Logistic-Map system is used in the simulation. A comparison between HKLS-SVM and other methods, in terms of the identification accuracy and computing efficiency, is made. The simulation result shows that HKLS-SVM gets the best performance and is effective in error analysis of chaotic systems. When real pipeline data is used in the test, the ultimate identification accuracy of HKLS-SVM reaches 97.38% and the position accuracy is 99.28%, indicating that the method proposed in this paper has good performance in detecting and locating small pipeline leaks.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.chaos.2016.09.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Chaos Solitons & Fractals", "mag_id": "2516588358", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["150228023", "201812149", "209386328", "49652337", "3329179", "52078393", "46758586", "41413165"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125695339"}

To infer such a tree architecture, we employ the constrained large margin clustering procedure which enforces samples belonging to the same class to locate at the same side of the hyper plane while maximizing the margin between these two partitioned class subsets.

Existing network embedding methods can partially address the problem by: (1) regarding a region as a node in order to reformulate the problem into node embedding; (2) regarding a region as a graph in order to reformulate the problem into graph embedding. However, these studies can be improved by preserving (1) intra-region geographic structures, which are represented by multiple spatial graphs, leading to a reformulation of collective learning from relational graphs; (2) inter-region spatial autocorrelations, which are represented by pairwise graph regularization, leading to a reformulation of adversarial learning.

Neurofuzzy models combine the mathematical structure of Associative Memory Networks (AMNs) with the transparency of fuzzy systems. This produces a modelling technique to which mathematical analysis can be applied, while being more transparent than traditional black box models. Unfortunately, conventional neurofuzzy models suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where the size and complexity of the model grows exponentially with the input dimension. This curse restricts the use of neurofuzzy systems to low dimensional problems. Parsimony is an important issue in modelling where the best models are obtained using the simplest possible structure. This principle can often be employed to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, where an alternative more representative neurofuzzy system can be employed. Several alternative neurofuzzy systems that try to exploit structural dependencies are presented in this report. Another problem, common to most modelling techniques, is model identification, i.e. finding the appropriate model structure (and representation) that best performs the modelling task. This report presents some algorithms that construct parsimonious neurofuzzy systems off-line from a set of system observations. The aim is to construct a parsimonious neurofuzzy model, hence alleviating the curse of dimensionality and providing a qualative insight into the physical behaviour of the system in the form of fuzzy rules.

We present a novel, inexpensive, and feasible method for separating UE functional use from nonfunctional movement after stroke using a single wrist-worn accelerometer. Methods Ten controls and 10 individuals with stroke performed a series of minimally structured activities while simultaneously being videotaped and wearing a sensor on each wrist that captured the linear acceleration and angular velocity of their UEs. Video data provided ground truth to annotate sensor data as functional or nonfunctional limb use. Using the annotated sensor data, we trained a machine learning tool, a Random Forest model. We then assessed the accuracy of that classification. Results In intrasubject test trials, our method correctly classified sensor data with an average of 94.80% in controls and 88.38% in stroke subjects. In leave-one-out intersubject testing and training, correct classification averaged 91.53% for controls and 70.18% in stroke subjects. Conclusions Our method shows promise for inexpensive and objective quantification of functional UE use in hemiparesis, and for assessing the impact of UE treatments. Training a classifier on raw sensor data is feasible, and determination of whether patients functionally use their UE can thus be done remotely. For the restorative treatment trial setting, an intrasubject test/train approach would be especially accurate.

The model\u2019s ability to perform such inferences arises from (i) its structure, (ii) its use of mutual inhibition among \u201csibling\u201d types, entities, and rules, (iii) the use of temporal synchrony for representing dynamic bindings, and (iv) its ability to rapidly modify weights in response to convergent activity. Introduction Consider the following simple narrative: \u201cJohn fell in the hallway. Tom had cleaned it. He got hurt.\u201d Upon hearing the above narrative most of us would infer that Tom had cleaned the hallway, John fell because he slipped on the wet hallway floor, and John got hurt because of the fall. These inferences allow us to establish causal and referential coherence among the events and entities involved in the narrative. They help us explain John\u2019s fall by making plausible inferences that the hallway floor was wet as a result of the cleaning and John fell because he slipped on the wet floor. They help us causally link John\u2019s hurt to his fall. They help us determine that \u201cit\u201d in the second sentence refers to the hallway, and \u201cHe\u201d in the third sentence refers to John, and not to Tom. Empirical data strongly suggests that inferences required to establish referen- tial and causal coherence occur automatically during language understanding (see e.g., Just & Carpenter 1977; Keenan, Bail- let, and Brown 1984; Kintsch 1988; McKoon & Ratcliff 1980, 1992; Potts, Keenan, & Golding, 1988). Any system that attempts to explain our ability to establish causal coherence during language understanding must pos- sess a number of properties: First, such a system must be representationally adequate. It must be capable of encoding specific facts and events and expressing general regularities (aka rules) that capture the causal structure of the environ- ment. In particular, the system should be capable of encoding context-dependent and evidential cause-effect relationships. Second, the system should be inferentially adequate, that is, it should be capable of drawing a range of explanatory inferences by combining evidence and arriving at coherent interpretations that are quasi-optimal with reference to a cost- function (Hobbs et. al, 1993). Third, the system should be capable of establishing referential coherence. In particular, it should be able to unify entities and events by recognizing that multiple designations might refer to the same entity or event. Fourth, the system should be capable of learning and fine- tuning its causal model based on experience, instruction, and exploration. Finally, the system should be scalable and com- putationally effective. The causal model underlying human language understanding would be extremely large. Yet we understand language at the rate of several hundred words per minute (Just & Carpenter 1977). Hence, a system for estab- lishing causal coherence should also be capable of encoding a large causal model and rapidly performing the requisite in- ferences within fractions of a second. This paper describes several key extensions to the con- nectionist model SHRUTI that enable it to draw the sorts of inferences described above. SHRUTI is a neurally plausible system capable of expressing causal knowledge involving n- place relations, limited quantification, and type restrictions. It encodes specific events as well as context-sensitive priors over events. It expresses dynamic bindings via the synchronous fir- ing of appropriate node clusters and performs inferences via the propagation of rhythmic activity over node clusters. This propagation amounts to a parallel breadth first activation of the underlying causal graph, and hence, the reasoning in SHRUTI is extremely fast. The use of weighted links and activation combination functions at nodes allow SHRUTI to encode soft rules and perform evidential inference. SHRUTI supports su- pervised learning which allows it to fine-tune its causal model in a data-driven manner (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993; Shastri & Grannes, 1996; Shastri, 1999; Shastri & Wendelken, 1999; Wendelken & Shastri, 2000). In order to carry out inferences for establishing referential and causal coherence, however, SHRUTI \u2019s core functionality had to be extended in a number of ways. These include the ability to (i) unify entities and relational instances (events) (ii) posit the existence of entities that are left implicit in the utter- ance, and (iii) favor interpretations that are more plausible and more likely over others that are less so. These functional ex- tensions were realized in part by introducing mutual-exclusion clusters in the encoding of types and entities and by modifying the behavior of node-types. But more importantly, SHRUTI \u2019s inferential behavior was modified by (i) introducinginhibitory interactions among rules sharing a common consequent (ef- fect) and (ii) modeling short-term-potentiation, a biological phenomena whereby synaptic strengths (link weights) un- dergo rapid but short-lived changes in response to convergent activity. Both these changes play a critical role in favoring coherent and more-likely interpretations over less coherent and less likely ones. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents SHRUTI \u2019s basic representational machinery. This is followed by an elaboration of evidential reasoning in SHRUTI . Next we discuss mechanisms particularly aimed at the problem of establishing coherence and illustrate the functioning of the model with the help of an example.

Prior to this, an up-to-date state-of-the-art review on the available datasets and forecasting techniques of water and natural gas consumption, is conducted. A collection of techniques (Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Belief Networks, Echo State Networks, Support Vector Regression, Genetic Programming and Extended Kalman Filter-Genetic Programming), partially selected from the state-of-the-art ones, are evaluated using the few publicly available datasets. The tests are performed according to two key aspects: homogeneous evaluation criteria and application of heterogeneous data. Experiments with heterogeneous data obtained combining multiple types of resources (water, gas, energy and temperature), aimed to short-term prediction, have been possible using the Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (AMPds). On the contrary, the Energy Information Administration (E.I.A.) data are used for long-term prediction combining gas and temperature information. At the end, the selected approaches have been evaluated using the sole Tehran water consumption for long-term forecasts (thanks to the full availability of the dataset). The AMPds and E.I.A. natural gas results show a correlation with temperature, that produce a performance improvement. The ANN and SVR approaches achieved good performance for both long/short-term predictions, while the EKF-GP showed good outcomes with the E.I.A. datasets. Finally, it is the authors' purpose to create a valid starting point for future works that aim to develop innovative forecasting approaches, providing a fair comparison among different computational intelligence and machine learning techniques.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2015.04.098", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2209638817", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38423599"}

Extracted features from raw sensors are often large and some of them can be irrelevant and redundant. Therefore, it's important to perform feature selection to select the most relevant features in order to increase the recognition accuracy. However, classical feature selection methods are generally linear and sequential and they do not consider existing dependencies and interactions among activities (classes). To overcome this shortcoming, a feature selection based on Choquet integral for HAR is proposed in this paper. The Choquet integral is a non linear and a non additive method. It's employed to determine scores for features by modeling interactions between activities through the fuzzy measure theory. Classification results on HAR dataset using Random Forest classifier indicate that the recognition accuracy remains stable using half of the features. Moreover, classification performance is further improved.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015432", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2746612610", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6975432", "2215820", "89141", "215179277", "38916788", "2209189", "2002707", "715020", "7328295", "206583924", "6117989", "206831332", "34039974", "140109802", "16946622", "6870922", "16940389", "26376251"], "inbound_citations": ["126156189", "52127604"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31027961"}

However, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and the MapReduce programming model are designed to manage large files and suffer performance penalty while rendering and storing small files in a rendering system. Therefore, a method that merges small files based on two intelligent algorithms is proposed to solve the problem. The method uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to select the optimal merge values for multiple sets of scenes and then uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to generate a general SVM model which can be used to get the optimal merge value for any scene, by mainly considering the rendering time, memory limitation and other indicators. Then, the method takes advantage of frame-to-frame coherence to merge files in the same scene in an interval-based way with the optimal merge value. Finally, the proposed method is compared with the naive method under three different render scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of small files and render tasks, and improves the storage efficiency and computing efficiency.

We present an approach for the classification of USTs at the level of urban blocks based on high-resolution spaceborne radar imagery. Images obtained at the satellite\u2019s ascending and descending orbits were used for extracting line and polygon features from each block. Most of the attributes considered in the classification concern the geometry of these features, as well as their spatial disposition inside the blocks. Furthermore, assuming the UST classes of neighboring blocks are probabilistically dependent, we explored the framework of probabilistic graphical models and propose different context-based classification models. These models differ with respect to (i) their type, i.e., Markov or conditional random fields, (ii) their parameterization and (iii) the criterion applied for establishing pairwise neighboring relationships between blocks. In our experiments, 1,695 blocks from the city of Munich (Germany) and five representative UST classes were considered.

In order to test the usefulness and effectiveness of the SVM, two study areas were carefully selected: the PyeongChang and Inje areas of Gangwon Province, Korea. This is because, not only did many landslides (2098 in PyeongChang and 2580 in Inje) occur in 2006 as a result of heavy rainfall, but the 2018 Winter Olympics will be held in these areas. A variety of spatial data, including landslides, geology, topography, forest, soil, and land cover, were identified and collected in the study areas. Following this, the spatial data were compiled in a GIS-based database through the use of aerial photographs. Using this database, 18 factors relating to topography, geology, soil, forest and land use, were extracted and applied to the SVM. Next, the detected landslide data were randomly divided into two sets; one for training and the other for validation of the model. Furthermore, a SVM, specifically a type of data-mining classification model, was applied by using radial basis function kernels. Finally, the estimated landslide susceptibility maps were validated. In order to validate the maps, sensitivity analyses were carried out through area-under-the-curve analysis. The achieved accuracies from the SVM were approximately 81.36% and 77.49% in the PyeongChang and Inje areas, respectively. Moreover, a sensitivity assessment of the factors was performed. It was found that all of the factors, except for soil topography, soil drainage, soil material, soil texture, timber diameter, timber age, and timber density for the PyeongChang area, and timber diameter, timber age, and timber density for the Inje area, had relatively positive effects on the landslide susceptibility maps.

Temperature variation in piglet ear bases can be used as the indicator of a piglet\u2019s health status. However, piglet skin temperatures in thermal windows in the existing research are obtained manually from infrared thermal images captured by a thermography. This has put an obstacle at the automatic identification of piglets with health disorder. An algorithm was proposed in this paper to extract ear base temperature automatically from top view piglet thermal images. Firstly, a SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier was trained to identify piglet head part. Then, two ear base points were located based on the shape feature of the head part contour. Finally, two maximum temperatures inside the two circles centered by ear base points were extracted as the ear base temperatures. The proposed algorithm was implemented in Matlab\u00ae (R2016a) and applied to 100 testing images. The extracted ear base temperatures were compared with those extracted manually by using Fluke SmartView 3.14 (FLUKE Systems). Comparison results showed that for left and right ear base respectively, 97% and 98% of the testing images had an error within 0.4 \u00b0C.

For some classification methods, this can often be taken care of simply with a change of thresholds for others, additional effort is required.

Theoretical justification for the procedure is provided.

However, they require a large number of training samples to guarantee good performance, which costs a large amount of time and human labor, motivating researchers to reuse labeled samples from the mass of pre-existing related images. Transfer learning methods can adapt knowledge in the existing images to solve the classification problem in new yet related images, and have drawn increasing interest in the remote sensing field. However, the existing methods in the RS field require that all the images share the same dimensionality, which prevents their practical application. This paper focuses on the transfer learning problem for heterogeneous spaces where the dimensions are different. We propose a novel iterative reweighting heterogeneous transfer learning (IRHTL) framework that iteratively learns a common space for the source and target data and conducts a novel iterative reweighting strategy to reweight the source samples.

However, measuring histogram similarity is a challenging task for streaming data, where the elements of a histogram are observed in a streaming manner. First, the ever-growing cardinality of histogram elements makes any similarity computation inefficient. Second, the concept-drift issue in the data streams also impairs the accurate assessment of the similarity. In this paper, we propose to overcome the above challenges with HistoSketch, a fast similarity-preserving sketching method for streaming histograms with concept drift. Specifically, HistoSketch is designed to incrementally maintain a set of compact and fixed-size sketches of streaming histograms to approximate similarity between the histograms, with the special consideration of gradually forgetting the outdated histogram elements. We evaluate HistoSketch on multiple classification tasks using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our method is able to efficiently approximate similarity for streaming histograms and quickly adapt to concept drift. Compared to full streaming histograms gradually forgetting the outdated histogram elements, HistoSketch is able to dramatically reduce the classification time (with a 7500x speedup) with only a modest loss in accuracy (about 3.5%).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2017.64", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2772632044", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23544307", "26881819", "6713452", "6146974", "2667511", "17872069", "506023", "15962439", "37767068", "5671282", "6749559", "8363980", "12651957", "8441326", "1046344", "207208264", "15355119", "34940131", "357490", "35735447", "16078381", "35381627", "999108", "1159048", "1578969", "5009798", "9970906", "5005080", "52897747", "193949882", "65053942", "5874117", "17172244"], "inbound_citations": ["162168897", "92107077", "207873559", "4561453", "201066899", "196176794", "51880642", "53287480", "209414895", "209862334", "204941526", "4558403", "202566945", "81976427", "52101501", "211010975"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40737517"}

The local weighting of the distance accounts for the variation in local scaling and discriminative power along each feature. Such generalization makes HyperBF networks capable of interpolating decision functions with high accuracy. However, such complexity makes HyperBF networks susceptible to overfitting. Moreover, training a HyperBF network demands weights, centers and local scaling factors to be optimized simultaneously. In the case of a relatively large dataset with a large network structure, such optimization becomes computationally challenging. ::: In this work, a new regularization method that performs soft local dimension reduction and weight decay is presented. The regularized HyperBF (Reduced HyperBF) network is shown to provide classification accuracy comparable to a Support Vector Machines (SVM) while requiring a significantly smaller network structure. Furthermore, the soft local dimension reduction is shown to be informative for ranking features based on their localized discriminative power. ::: In addition, a practical training approach for constructing HyperBF networks is presented. This approach uses hierarchal clustering to initialize neurons followed by a gradient optimization using a scaled Rprop algorithm with a localized partial backtracking step (iSRprop). Experimental results on a number of datasets show a faster and smoother convergence than the regular Rprop algorithm. ::: The proposed Reduced HyperBF network is applied to two problems in bioinformatics. The first is the detection of transcription start sites (TSS) in human DNA. A novel method for improving the accuracy of TSS recognition for recently published methods is proposed. This method incorporates a new metric feature based on oligonucleotide positional frequencies. ::: The second application is the accurate classification of microarray samples. A new feature selection algorithm based on a Reduced HyperBF network is proposed. The method is applied to two microarray datasets and is shown to select a minimal subset of features with high discriminative information. The algorithm is compared to two widely used methods and is shown to provide competitive results. ::: In both applications, the final Reduced HyperBF network is used for higher level analysis.

State of the art approaches like [1] have their main limitation when dealing with occluded parts of the body, producing mistaken body poses when parts are not seen by the camera. Proposal We propose an approach that combines two different algorithms to parse the human body. First, using Random Forests we perform a per-pixel classification in the depth image [1] to create part proposals, which are positions in the image where each body part has high probability of appearing. Second, proposals are used to infer the final human pose using an AND/OR graph [2]. Discussion The obtained results show that we are able to recover the human pose reducing the number of false positives detection of limb proposals using a bottom-up parsing of the AND/OR graph.

Some researchers proposed models, based on mammography features and personal information, that help identify pre-biopsy invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Recently, a differential discriminating ability between invasive and DCIS has been linked to age. Based on this finding, we use an age-stratified mammography and biopsy relational dataset and apply Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques to learn age-specific logical rules that classify invasive and DCIS occurrences. We then use statistical modeling to retrieve rules that have a significantly different performance across age-stratas. These final rules reveal a number of interesting results. Although a palpable lump is more commonly associated with younger patients, it turns out to be a better predictor of invasive cancer in older women. A recurrence has a higher probability to be invasive in older and middle-aged women. A previously unreported rule revealed by our technique is that recurrence is more likely a DCIS predictor in younger women. This younger DCIS predicting rule effectively links the current diagnostic mammogram to older studies, and provides opposite predictions across the age divide. The resulting rules are age-specific, can help patients and their physicians make more informed decisions about managing their breast health, and constitute a personalized predictive model.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1882992.1883005", "venue": "IHI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2130209183", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["31196861", "74694227", "1698980", "1846033", "21069175", "1268789", "19825448", "10249281", "78799234", "25965927", "36237350", "19779624", "18130621", "37208117", "9191472", "25553505", "558704", "31548653"], "inbound_citations": ["49397075", "13447978", "2373781", "1814966", "40059093", "10249283", "143431968", "8520512", "14762124", "1648357"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2112731"}

Based on infrared (IR) spectroscopic/sensing techniques, we propose an advanced regression model based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm for quantitative chemometric analysis. The proposed model makes two contributions to the field of advanced chemometrics. First, an ELM-based autoencoder (AE) was developed for reducing the dimensionality of spectral signals and learning important features for regression. Second, the fast regression ability of ELM architecture was directly used for constructing the regression model. In this contribution, nitrogen oxide mixtures (i.e., N2O/NO2/NO) found in vehicle exhaust were selected as a relevant example of a real-world gas mixture. Both simulated data and experimental data acquired using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were analyzed by the proposed chemometrics model.

Ways to take advantage of a-priori knowledge in the design of those models are first considered. Then algorithms for some recurrent networks are described since they are well-suited to handling temporal dependences such as those found in speech. Some simple methods that accelerate the convergence of gradient descent with the back-propagation algorithm are discussed. An alternative approach to speed-up the networks are systems based on Radial Basis Functions (local representation). Detailed results of several experiments with these networks on the recognition of phonemes for the TIMIT database are presented. In conclusion, a cognitively relevant model is proposed.

First, vibration data at multiple points are used to calculate the wavelet packet node energies and construct a non-negative damage feature matrix. Second, to increase the damage detection accuracy, the NMF technique is employed to obtain the reduced dimensional representation of the non-negative damage feature matrix and extract the underlying features. Last, the RVM, a powerful tool for classification and regression, that can obtain the probability estimation for classification, is used to determine the relationship between features extracted with NMF and the corresponding damage patterns by considering the measurement noise. The trained RVMs are then used to perform damage pattern identification and classification of an unknown state structure. Numerical study on the Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge is carried out to validate the ability of the proposed method in damage detection. The results show that the RVM can achieve a high accuracy in damage pattern identification accuracy using the features extracted by NMF.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.249-250.137", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Mechanics and Materials", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2016465711", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["123722306", "11378459", "108931663", "122365907", "109220977", "31546733", "122976106", "110828221", "194951", "7596571", "28579388", "13893581", "4428232", "5901113", "109083717", "121500213"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:122347240"}

So the prediction of disease from imbalanced data becomes difficult to handle. In this proposal Classifier ensemble method (Random Forest algorithm) can be used to overcome existing classifier techniques. Multiple classifier system is more accurate and robust than an existing classifier technique. The ensemble method proves to be very efficient in classification of records from available imbalanced healthcare patient data, as it involves the process of considering opinion from multiple base classifiers, as opposed to the single classifier method. This method gives a very accurate and precise inference, as unrelated data's are removed because of multiple base classifiers.

This work presents a deep transfer learning approach to overcome the channel mismatch problem and transfer knowledge from a large dataset to a small cohort to study automatic sleep staging with single-channel input. We employ the state-of-the-art SeqSleepNet and train the network in the source domain, i.e. the large dataset. Afterwards, the pretrained network is finetuned in the target domain, i.e. the small cohort, to complete knowledge transfer. We study two transfer learning scenarios with slight and heavy channel mismatch between the source and target domains. We also investigate whether, and if so, how finetuning entirely or partially the pretrained network would affect the performance of sleep staging on the target domain. Using the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) database consisting of 200 subjects as the source domain and the Sleep-EDF Expanded database consisting of 20 subjects as the target domain in this study, our experimental results show significant performance improvement on sleep staging achieved with the proposed deep transfer learning approach. Furthermore, these results also reveal the essential of finetuning the feature-learning parts of the pretrained network to be able to bypass the channel mismatch problem.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.05945", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/EUSIPCO.2019.8902977", "venue": "2019 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)", "journal": "2019 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2936523059,2984023268", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["52894597", "215254500", "837298", "54556647", "53291459", "53287765", "53103013", "24064532", "78939623", "21690736", "11607380", "215634307", "206761818", "206632658", "53102227", "1998416", "5590763", "740063", "5707386", "53094267", "28642705"], "inbound_citations": ["199000813", "207847192", "215548178"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119313685"}

Three different segmentation algorithms which are selected from object, learning and pixel-based methods. They have been exploited to obtain land and water classes which have been used as an input data for parameter estimation.

In the first step of the study, Mean-Shift, Random Forest and Whale Optimization algorithms have been employed to obtain water and land classes from the SENTINEL-2A image. Water and land classes derived from each algorithm \u2013 are used as input data, and then the required parameters for the fuzzy clustering of SENTINEL-1A SAR image, were calculated. Lake Constance, Germany has been chosen as the study area. In this study, additionally an interface plugin has been developed and integrated into the open source Quantum GIS software platform. The developed interface allows non-experts to process and extract the shorelines without using any parameters. But, this system requires pre-segmented data as input.
