Based on analyzing the demand of intelligent transportation system and the problems of the exiting recognition methods, the intelligent real-time recognition method of chaos in traffic flow was proposed. The principle and the structure of the system are briefly introduced. There are online recognition subsystem and offline recognition subsystem mainly. Normal methods are used in the offline recognition model. The online recognition model was established using reduced support vector machine, which the wavelet packet energy features vector of the anterior time series of traffic flow in every training samples were used as input variables. The reduced samples are treated as the final training sample. When the new samples are appended, the reduced set may be updated. The rules of models can be updated and the problem of large sample size could be solved. The simulation result shows that the method is correct and feasible.

To model hidden trends and predict deterioration failure utilizing volatile state indicators, an adaptive support vector regression (ASVR) machine is proposed. In ASVR, the width of an error-insensitive tube, which is a constant in the traditional support vector regression, is set as a variable determined by the transient distribution boundary of local regions in the training time series. Thus, the localized regions are obtained using a sliding time window, and their boundaries are defined by a robust measure known as the truncated range. Utilizing an adaptive error-insensitive tube, a stabilized tolerance level for noise is achieved, whether the time series occurs in low-volatility regions or in high-volatility regions. The proposed method is evaluated by vibrational data measured on descaling pumps. The results show that ASVR is capable of capturing the local trends of the volatile time series of state indicators and is superior to the standard support vector regression for state prediction.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2015/469165", "venue": null, "journal": "Shock and Vibration", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1945045481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["109806429", "13313961", "110914734", "3120379", "40355419", "17977694", "15480929", "122086361", "2065303", "35064397", "15701633", "55921652", "9693039", "29544070", "119751638"], "inbound_citations": ["7829500"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56034438"}

The RSU computes the statistics of the receptions and is able to compute the percentage of successful transmissions versus the distance between the vehicle and the RSU and the transmission rate. Starting from this statistic, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) scheme can produce a model. Then, given a transmission rate and a distance between the vehicle and the RSU, the SVM technique can estimate the probability of a succcessful reception. This probability can be used to build an adaptive technique which optimizes the expected throughput between the vehicle and the RSU. Instead of using transmission values of a real experiment, we use the results of an analytical model of CSMA that is customized for 1D VANETs. The model we adopt to perform this task uses a Matern selection process to mimic the transmission in a CSMA IEEE 802.11p VANET. With this model we obtain a closed formula for the probability of successful transmissions.

Most existing person re-identification (re-ID) models often fail to generalize well from the source domain where the models are trained to a new target domain without labels, because of the bias between the source and target domain. This issue significantly limits the scalability and usability of the models in the real world. Providing a labeled source training set and an unlabeled target training set, the aim of this paper is to improve the generalization ability of re-ID models to the target domain. To this end, we propose an image generative network named identity preserving generative adversarial network (IPGAN). The proposed method has two excellent properties: 1) only a single model is employed to translate the labeled images from the source domain to the target camera domains in an unsupervised manner; 2) The identity information of images from the source domain is preserved before and after translation. Furthermore, we propose IBN-reID model for the person re-identification task. It has better generalization ability than baseline models, especially in the cases without any domain adaptation. The IBN-reID model is trained on the translated images by supervised methods.

However, in some applications with restrictions of: area, and/or power and/or training time, a hardware implementation is necessary, for example, in some mobile or portable applications. In related previous works, the SVMs were trained in hardware using sets of only tens of examples, and in only one implementation the SMO algorithm was employed. In this work, a modified version of the SMO algorithm, named here the Multiple Pairs SMO (MP-SMO) algorithm, for the SVM training acceleration is presented. The training time reduction is obtained optimizing per iteration one or more pairs of coefficients known as Lagrange Multipliers, instead of only one pair as in the original SMO algorithm. The MP-SMO algorithm has the following features: 1) the optimization of each pair is as simple as in the original SMO algorithm because of the use of the same analytical method. 2) the solution for the pairs of coefficients selection can be chosen between two adapted heuristics for the SMO algorithm. The algorithm was tested optimizing up to two, three and four pairs of coefficients per iteration, and the training time was improved, when compared against the SMO algorithm. The tests for seven benchmarks showed an improvement that ranged from 22.5% to 42.8%. The reduction of the training time of the SMO algorithm executed in hardware is also treated in this dissertation. The algorithms SMO and MP-SMO were completely implemented in dedicated hardware for the Tic-tac-toe endgame benchmark. This benchmark is composed of 958 examples, a number greater than the used in the previous hardware implementations. The implementation of the MP-SMO algorithm is intended to reduce the number of iterations, as in the software implementation, and to include parallelism in the hardware implementation. In order to reduce the iteration execution time, the pipeline and parallel architectures were realized. Sixteen different architectures were implemented and tested on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device, combining or not the SMO or MP-SMO algorithm with pipelining and/or parallelism. The training time was reduced to 1.8% of that obtained with the SMO algorithm without neither pipelining nor parallelism, that is, more than 50 times. This dissertation also presents an analysis of the area and power cost of the training speed increase.

In this paper, a novel type of fuzzy information granule involving a time-dependent (non-stationary) membership function is proposed to structure numerical time series into granular time series. We show that the underlying arithmetic along with the concept of distance for this type of information granules can be expressed in a simple way, which facilitates the ensuing processing of information granules.

The structural influences' in this method are defined based on the root mean square value of vibration obtained from a simplified lumped-mass model of the gearbox. The structural influences are then converted to fuzzy variables, to account for the approximate nature of the lumped-mass model, and used as the weights of a connectionist network. Diagnosis in this Structure-Based Connectionist Network (SBCN) is performed by propagating the abnormal vibration features through the weights of SBCN to obtain fault possibility values for each component in the gearbox. Upon occurrence of misdiagnoses, the SBCN also has the ability to improve its diagnostic performance.

Different terrain classification techniques have been developed. The techniques include the use of different exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors with different classification methods.

Achieving soft-terrain classification will expand the operational range of walking robots. Thus, in this study, we propose a new technique to classify various terrains including soft ones. The technique exploits haptic feedback (expressed only through ground contact force measurement of a legged robot) and neurodynamics with the temporal memory of a reservoir computing-based recurrent neural network. We used six different terrains to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. The terrains include sand (loose ground), foams with different softness levels (soft ground), and floor (hard ground). The experimental results show that we can successfully classify all terrains with an accuracy of above 70%.

In this research, we proposed a system that allows users to draw a polygon around a food item for segmentation. After segmented, the region is then classified using an automated voting system. Different features will then be extracted from the specified area. Support Vector Machines will be issued for each feature type. This system is a proof-of-concept and is designed to research the effectiveness of employing multiple feature detection algorithms to classify food images. To classify food regions a Bag-of-features (BoFs) approach will be used for each. Speeded Up Robust Features point detection and descriptors was used along with colour spatial features, and also MSER region detection with SURF. Each of these methods will have their own BoF to train an SVM. The aim of this research was to create a voting classification system that utilises each feature detection algorithm to ultimately identify the segmented food region through plurality (or majority) vote. Testing showed that the system achieved 75% accuracy when combining each feature SVM to create a voting system. The system outperforms two of the feature classifiers (SURF and MSER with SURF).

The current work utilized the serial reaction time task, in which participants press keys in response to visual cues that appear in sequence. The first study examined the ability to transfer to new sequences after practicing sequences in a repetitive order compared to a non-repeating interleaved order. Interleaved practice resulted in better performance on repetitive or interleaved novel sequences than repetitive practice. Interleaved training may reduce interference from sequence-specific knowledge when the learner is faced with new variations of a task. In the second study, participants practiced interleaved sequences in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner and received a transfer test of novel sequences. Transfer ability was positively correlated with cerebellar blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity during practice, indicating that greater engagement of the cerebellum during training resulted in better subsequent transfer performance. The cerebellum is thought to contribute to error-based learning through the instantiation of internal models (Wolpert, Miall, & Kawato, 1998). When novel variations of a task are encountered, it is hypothesized that relevant features from other previously-formed internal models are selected and form the basis for performance on the novel task (Imamizu, Higuchi, Toda, & Kawato, 2007). Those learners in which internal models are more readily formed may be better at later tests of transfer. Based on these results, the cerebellum was targeted with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during training in order to enhance transfer learning. Results indicate that anodal tDCS can lead to better transfer to novel sequences, but this change was apparent only after a delay. On the other hand, cathodal tDCS had a detrimental online effect on learning. These results are consistent with the theory that the cerebellum plays a large role particularly in the early learning stage of fine motor skills. Overall, this work demonstrates that easily implementable and relatively inexpensive manipulations can improve transfer learning of motor sequences.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2484913234", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:148254973"}

The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine if a specific passage in the text shows positive, negative or neutral sentiment towards the subject. Social media platforms, like Twitter, offer a wide ability that allows users to express their thoughts by employing figurative language devices such as sarcasm to achieve different communication purposes. Dealing with such kind of content represents a big challenge for computational linguistics. Due to these difficulties and the inherently tricky nature of sarcasm, it is generally ignored during social network analysis. As a result, the outcome of such analysis is affected adversely. Also, nowadays, Customers use twitter as a platform to express their emotions and opinions about social issues, products or services. Lexicon based methods of text mining can at times fail to recognize sarcasm used by customers online. This has direct implications for companies using text mining on online content to identify new customers, address customer problems, and reduce customer turn rates or for any other CRM (Customer Relationship Management) activities. Thus, sarcasm detection poses to be one of the most critical problems which we need to overcome while trying to yield high accuracy insights from abundantly available data. This work considers sarcastic tweets (including those based on products) and proposes an effective approach to detect sarcasm. The system utilizes 21 features based on context, contrast, and emotions. The results show that sarcastic tweets inclined to have more polarity flips than Non-sarcastic tweets. Also, it is found that MLP and the Random Forest classifier tend to perform better than other classifiers with an accuracy of 94%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology", "mag_id": "2942537851", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:156004536"}

Generalization experiments were performed testing point density, occlusion, and between-site domain variance factors, and all factors showed a significant influence on generalization accuracy. Several methods for improving classifier generalization accuracy were tested and compared, including combining training data from multiple sites, imposing probability thresholds, and a Domain Adaptation methodology known as Active Learning. It was found that incorporating data from multiple sites resulted in improved generalization accuracy, but in most cases the largest improvements in accuracy were associated with adding new training data from the target site.

Since the anesthetic drugs act mainly on the central nervous system, the analysis of brain activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) is very useful. This paper proposes a novel automated method for assessing the DoA using EEG. First, 11 features including spectral, fractal, and entropy are extracted from EEG signal and then, by applying an algorithm according to exhaustive search of all subsets of features, a combination of the best features (Beta-index, sample entropy, shannon permutation entropy, and detrended fluctuation analysis) is selected. Accordingly, we feed these extracted features to a new neurofuzzy classification algorithm, adaptive neurofuzzy inference system with linguistic hedges (ANFIS-LH). This structure can successfully model systems with nonlinear relationships between input and output, and also classify overlapped classes accurately. ANFIS-LH, which is based on modified classical fuzzy rules, reduces the effects of the insignificant features in input space, which causes overlapping and modifies the output layer structure. The presented method classifies EEG data into awake, light, general, and deep states during anesthesia with sevoflurane in 17 patients. Its accuracy is 92% compared to a commercial monitoring system (response entropy index) successfully. Moreover, this method reaches the classification accuracy of 93% to categorize EEG signal to awake and general anesthesia states by another database of propofol and volatile anesthesia in 50 patients. To sum up, this method is potentially applicable to a new real-time monitoring system to help the anesthesiologist with continuous assessment of DoA quickly and accurately.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28574372", "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2017.2709841", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2616875318", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23259470", "18534356", "45725467", "23054598", "15972878", "26807111", "37410872", "30900482", "5976222", "52980801", "31957039", "22064024", "10614303", "46944062", "20677617", "23567295", "38267138", "20333718", "2487670", "17107123", "6111122", "19366417", "553208", "14345934", "1785653", "35340779", "25628933", "4453931", "17402875", "7426738", "3558910", "5785692", "2389971", "89141", "110750408", "23290529", "7269729"], "inbound_citations": ["115201101", "174807536", "199017952", "201283358", "164602703", "184486261"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19115206"}

Given a video, the goal is to accurately assign a semantic class label to every pixel in the video within a specified time budget. Typical approaches to such labeling problems, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), focus on maximizing accuracy but do not provide a principled method for satisfying a time budget. For video data, the time required by CRF and related methods is often dominated by the time to compute low-level descriptors of supervoxels across the video. Our key contribution is the new budgeted inference framework for CRF models that intelligently selects the most useful subsets of descriptors to run on subsets of supervoxels within the time budget. The objective is to maintain an accuracy as close as possible to the CRF model with no time bound, while remaining within the time budget. Our second contribution is the algorithm for learning a policy for the sparse selection of supervoxels and their descriptors for budgeted CRF inference. This learning algorithm is derived by casting our problem in the framework of Markov Decision Processes, and then instantiating a state-of-the-art policy learning algorithm known as Classification-Based Approximate Policy Iteration.

To address this intractable problem, we propose a novel Many-to-Many Generative Adversarial Transfer Learning method (M2M-GAN) that takes multiple source sub-domains and multiple target sub-domains into consideration and performs each sub-domain transferring mapping from the source domain to the target domain in a unified optimization process. The proposed method first translates the image styles of source sub-domains into that of target sub-domains, and then performs the supervised learning by using the transferred images and the corresponding annotations in source domain.

It can also provide an evaluation of the results in terms of misclassification error or root mean squared error. We tested the applicability of ClaReT in two case studies. In the first one, we used ClaReT in classification mode to identify the better subset of landslide conditioning variables (LCVs) and to obtain a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) of the Arno river basin (Italy). In the second case study, we used ClaReT in regression mode to produce a soil thickness map of the Terzona catchment, a small sub-basin of the Arno river basin. In both cases, we performed a validation of the results and a comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques.

If the scene property is described by a set of discrete values in each image, then the corresponding vision task is an image labeling problem. A key issue in image labeling concerns how to exploit the context information in images, as local evidence is often insufficient to determine the label value. This thesis takes a statistical learning approach to the labeling problem, focusing on two main issues in incorporating context into the labeling process: (1) what are the efficient representations of contexts for labeling? and (2) how do we learn the context representations for a labeling task from data? ::: We discuss two learning situations based on different degrees of data availability. In the first case, enough fully-labeled data are available for learning. So we develop a discriminative labeling framework based on a Conditional Random Field (CRF), in which multiscale feature functions are proposed to capture the image/label contexts at several spatial scales. Those feature functions affect the labeling from local to global levels: some aspects of the contexts concern co-occurrence of objects in the image, while other aspects concern the geometric relationships between objects. To extend the range of object classes and image database size that the system can handle, we also propose a modular CRF model that integrates the bottom-up image cues and top-down categorical information. The second case has a less strict requirement on the training data, including not only a small number of fully-labeled data, but also a large number of coarsely-labeled ones. We present a hybrid unsupervised-supervised approach that combines a generative topic model with discriminative label classifiers. The topic model is used to model the co-occurring image features for representing image context, and it is extended such that the topics are not only applied to image features but also to labels. We examine the performance of our models on several real-world image databases, and compare our systems to baseline methods.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2185191019", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["37415944", "61491955", "9164049", "11778270", "4772712", "16345215", "15139328"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61780684"}

That is, the median duration of survival for the group treated with FOLFOX has been reported to be about 20 months, compared with 8 months for the best supportive care group. However, the rate of effect is not so high and has been reported to be approximately 50%. Molecular characterization using gene expression profiling will undoubtedly improve the prediction of treatment responses and ultimately the clinical outcome of cancer patients, which has never been accomplished by conventional clinicopathological classification. The aim of this study was to identify responders for FOLFOX therapy by applying Random Forests (RF) algorithm to gene expression data. Sixty-six unresectable colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were included, which were divided into training and test sets. Evaluated by computed tomography after 4 courses of FOLFOX therapy, 25 patients were diagnosed as responders and 25 patients as non-responders, respectively, in 50 training samples. Using RF, 22 of 25 responders (88.0% sensitivity) and 24 of 25 non-responders (96.0% specificity) were correctly classified, with an accuracy of 92.0% in out-of-bag cross-validation, and predictor genes were identified for FOLFOX therapy. Based on the predictor genes, proximities could clearly classify tumor samples into three subtypes, responders, non-responders, and outliers. After getting 5 outliers out of 50 training samples, RF was performed again with identification of predictor genes, such as RDX, SMURF2, and PEG10. In order to validate these predictor genes, we applied these decision tree analyses to independent 16 test samples, and achieved 75.9% sensitivity, 88.9% specificity, and 84.6% of classification accuracy. Based on these predictor genes, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and found activated pathways such as \u2018hematopoietic stem cell genes\u2019 pathway (including CIRBP and NPEPPS). Furthermore, we investigated survival benefit of the patients who were diagnosed as responders for FOLFOX therapy by RF algorithm and found the survival distribution for unresectable CRC outcome. Taken together, RF on gene expression data for unresectable CRC patients could effectively stratify responders for FOLFOX therapy with high accuracy rate, and pharmacogenomics in anticancer therapy is definitely the first step for personalized therapy.

These features can then be interpreted by a linear readout layer that is trained by a gradient descent method. In comparison to traditional neural networks, only the output layer needs to be trained, which leads to a significant computational advantage. In addition, the short term memory of the reservoir dynamics has the ability to transform a complex temporal input state space to a simple non-temporal representation. Adaptive real-time systems are multi-stage decision problems that can be used to train an agent to achieve a preset goal by performing an optimal action at each timestep. In such problems, the agent learns through continuous interactions with its environment. Conventional techniques to solving such problems become computationally expensive or may not converge if the state-space being considered is large, partially observable, or if short term memory is required in optimal decision making. The objective of this thesis is to use reservoir computers to solve such goaldriven tasks, where no error signal can be readily calculated to apply gradient descent methodologies. To address this challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning approach in combination with reservoir computers built from simple Boolean components. Such reservoirs are of interest because they have the potential to be fabricated by self-assembly techniques. We evaluate the performance of our approach in both Markovian and non-Markovian environments. We compare the performance of an agent trained through traditional Q-Learning.

For that purpose different aggregation methods were proposed and tested on study sites spread on different continents. The initial classifications were performed with Random Forest classifier on individual Sentinel-2 images from a time series. In the following step the resulting land cover maps were aggregated pixel by pixel using three different combinations of information on the number of occurrences of a certain land cover class within a time series and the posterior probability of particular classes resulting from the Random Forest classification.

Three main challenges exist including spatial (image) feature representation, temporal information representation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown by Carreira and Zisserman that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrained on ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial and temporal representation learning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs are much more expensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speed and accuracy by building an effective and efficient video classification system through systematic exploration of critical network design choices. In particular, we show that it is possible to replace many of the 3D convolutions by low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speed and accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom of the network, suggesting that temporal representation learning on high-level \u201csemantic\u201d features is more useful. Our conclusion generalizes to datasets with very different properties. When combined with several other cost-effective designs including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating, our system results in an effective video classification system that that produces very competitive results on several action classification benchmarks (Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well as two action detection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1712.04851", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-01267-0_19", "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2883429621,2951060209", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["195908774", "14124313", "206594692", "206592218", "834612", "1710722", "18061547", "206596127", "206596999", "2375110", "12670695", "8485068", "6070160", "15080417", "6291314", "16119010", "19119291", "6940861", "196158220", "206597034", "36306843", "11797475", "474607", "8554929", "18321045", "4245530", "12289712", "23922674", "2815465", "10611376", "59605920", "5711057", "22044313", "15250191", "26375302", "19132897", "206769852", "7197134", "6070160", "195346008", "22782524", "1995092", "10328909", "688013", "13000587", "7698871", "206595627", "6079438"], "inbound_citations": ["53719258", "211146478", "202729821", "51876625", "211146155", "204576198", "209900877", "202718971", "203593466", "196470794", "204575694", "198229642", "168169623", "214594106", "201124677", "208134035", "214745923", "186206603", "53217392", "210970843", "215238520", "208526956", "202539417", "191520291", "211069690", "209366252", "204958503", "204837280", "211269591", "211059347", "199001018", "189762091", "214727846", "204792429", "208210657", "214713863", "204837313", "54463947", "209370497", "189928239", "53306051", "56517364", "208512897", "195223243", "202540342", "204970595", "210868003", "211146346", "199465841", "54434554", "207900988", "209140428", "170079235", "211554248", "214794974", "211069479", "182952746", "102351090", "195187119", "207895493", "160009882", "211069177", "211146101", "210472737", "202712789", "152282370", "208158431", "119303257", "174802916", "203594898", "195354198", "196188559", "195699421", "210994161", "208909702", "173188103", "165163902", "210839446", "214713862", "195541409", "199001195", "214794905", "201140141", "199465768", "53714115", "208202400", "127680231", "198922093", "67855277", "131775495", "209370672", "199369010", "209853614", "204833919", "208526958", "212747675", "212703218", "202537154", "210692421", "210692421", "199472793", "209140501", "211731467", "204837073", "54040787", "211252520", "210700968", "208921095", "198165329", "209376248", "90262102", "209140244", "155100341", "201058496", "197464476", "198935972", "212725237", "53781105", "102353690", "198147604", "54610560", "203171600", "199501839", "208547825", "67855676", "210839755", "146121036", "199550795"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51863579"}

It is difficult to perform in line with the human perception due the complex and nonlinear nature of the human auditory system. The challenge lies in representing speech signals using appropriate features and subsequently mapping these features into a quality score. This paper proposes a nonintrusive metric for the quality assessment of noise-suppressed speech. The originality of the proposed approach lies primarily in the use of Mel filter bank energies (FBEs) as features and the use of support vector regression (SVR) for feature mapping.

The majority of studies that addressed the task of chemical compound extraction used machine-learning techniques. The key challenge behind using machine-learning techniques lies in employing a robust set of features. In fact, the literature shows that there are numerous types of features used in the task of chemical compound extraction. Such dimensionality of features can be determined via data representation. Some researchers have used N-gram representation for biomedical-named entity recognition, where the most significant terms are represented as features. Meanwhile, others have used detailed-attribute representation in which the features are generalized. As a result, identifying the best combination of features to yield high-accuracy classification becomes challenging. This paper aims to apply the Wrapper Subset Selection approach using two data representations\u2014N-gram and detailed-attributes. Since each data representation would suit a specific classification algorithm, two classifiers were utilized\u2014Naive Bayes (for detailed-attributes) and Support Vector Machine (for N-gram).

The market is susceptible to quick changes, causing seemingly random fluctuations in the Bitcoin price. Due to the chaotic and highly volatile nature of Bitcoin behavior, investments come with high risk. To minimize the risk involved, knowledge of the Bitcoin price movement in the future is desirable. Different studies have shown that Machine Learning algorithms can predict, to varying degrees, the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. However, most researches do not explore the relationship between the price and other features outside the transaction network, such as market capitalization, Bitcoin mining speed, or entity behavior. Also, most of the features are extracted from the network level, which means obtaining the number of transactions, users, Bitcoins mined, etc. In this research, we focus on additional features, such as features outside the transaction network and node-based features inside the transaction network, which could improve the price prediction of Bitcoin. The investigated features are the \u201cfairness and goodness\u201d measure and the \u201c1-ARW-betweenness cen- trality\u201d measure. Fairness and goodness are entity behavior measures. The goodness of a Bitcoin address captures how much this address is liked/trusted by other addresses, while the fairness of a Bitcoin address captures how fair the address is in rating other addresses\u2019 likeability or trust level. The 1-ARW-betweenness centrality is a feature based on absorbing random walks. The feature captures the extent to which a Bitcoin address has control over the money flow between different addresses. A benchmark, based on the machine learning algorithm Random Forest with commonly used features, is used to test the impact of the additional features. The Random Forest tries to predict the sign (up-down movement) of the price per day, using data from the two previous days. Comparing this benchmark with a similar model, but then including the additional features, will gain more information about how these additional features influence the Bitcoin price.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2953786728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198319733"}

The speech-based end-of-turn detection estimates whether a target speaker's utterance is ended or not using speech information. In previous studies, the speech-based end-of-turn detection models were trained using only speech data sets that contained manually annotated end-of-turn labels. However, since the amounts of annotated speech data sets are often limited, the end-of-turn detection models were unable to correctly handle a wide variety of speech patterns. In order to mitigate the data scarcity problem, our key idea is to leverage punctuated text data sets for building more effective speech-based end-of-turn detection. Therefore, the proposed method introduces cross-modal representation learning to construct a speech encoder and a text encoder that can map speech and text with the same lexical information into similar vector representations. This enables us to train speech-based end-of-turn detection models from the punctuated text data sets by tackling text-based sentence boundary detection.

Then, by considering the physical meaning and characteristics of the extracted features, instead of performing feature selection directly, we further extract some deep features describing the statistical difference of the texture features of different tumors for subtype estimation. 213 subjects are divide into cross validation cohort and independent testing cohort to validate the proposed method. The proposed method achieves encouraging performance, with the accuracy of 91.43% and 88.57% by using T1 contrast-enhanced and T2-Flair MR images, respectively.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-11723-8_22", "venue": "BrainLes@MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2914814449", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59943035"}

The high volume of items makes it impossible for any expert to handle it manually. Therefore there is great interest to automate the classification process and produce relevant documents to a topic. Text classification is the task of automatically assigning a document set to a predefined set of classes or topics. Specifically, in a supervised text classification problem, a machine learning algorithm is trained with examples in order to perform class assignments with unknown documents automatically. A large number of techniques have been used and tested for text classification, including Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Among them, SVM has been recognized as one of the most powerful and promising machine learning methods. In other studies, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been used to describe the statistical properties of a sequential random process. They are known for their application in language problems like speech recognition. However, their application has been extended to fields of text processing such as information extraction, information retrieval, text categorization, and text classification. A Hidden Markov Model is a statistical tool used to model generative sequences that can be characterised by an underlying hidden process. It can be seen as a state diagram that consists of a set of states and transitions between them, where each state can emit an output observation with a certain probability. Thus, two processes take place when generating sequences in an HMM. The first process describes the unobservable state sequence, i.e. the hidden layer represented by the state transition probability. The second process links each state to observations creating the observable layer represented by the output observation probability. One of the common tasks that can be addressed by deploying an HMM in text analysis is to infer the internal structure of the documents. This task is related to the decoding problem for HMMs, where the hidden state transitions must be deduced given an HMM and an observation sequence. Another text processing task that is solved with the use of HMMs is to perform text sequence classification, in which the HMM is commonly treated as a word generator and receives as input a sequence of units belonging to a document. This task is related to the evaluation problem for HMMs, where the probability of an observation sequence must be calculated given a trained HMM. In general, HMMs cannot be used directly in a text classification process. Previous HMM related techniques provide a way of applying these models to a text processing task; however, they are specifically suited for information retrieval problems or need to use prior knowledge to achieve significant results. One of the goals of this thesis work is to create a simpler and more effective text classifier based on Hidden Markov Models that can categorize documents according to their content. In addition to the classification problem itself, document classifiers must handle text preprocessing issues that arise from the document corpora. Of all these, there are two major difficulties which the classifiers must deal with: the representation of the documents and the amount of training data. The accuracy of text learning systems is clearly affected by how the documents are represented. Documents have to be transformed into a format that automatic classifiers can handle. Document representation is usually (at its simplest) done through term-document frequencies, or bags-of-words, representations, which for efficiency are implemented over sparse matrices. In this case, every document is represented by a vector of its more relevant terms (feature words). This classical representation is hindered by the practical limitations of big text corpora. The time and space efficiency of the text classification largely depends on the size of the aforementioned vectors. Generally, not all words have a significant contribution to discriminately represent a text. It is possible to apply filtering algorithms to the initial feature word set in order to reduce its dimensionality. Some of these techniques can remove redundant or irrelevant features using statistical filtering methods such as Information Gain. Another type of feature reduction methods, as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), creates new attributes as a combination of the original attributes. Generally, these algorithms increase the classification accuracy and reduce the computational cost of the process, although they are very costly processes for high-dimensional datasets. On the other hand, the amount of available training data affects the classiffication performance in multiple ways. The class imbalance problem occurs when only a very small number of cases represents one class compared to the others. The classification techniques usually assume that data are uniformly distributed between different classes. A classifier performs well if it is applied to a dataset evenly distributed among classes, but when encounters unbalanced data the performance often decreases. In this case, the classifier tends to ignore rare classes and predict the larger ones. Sampling strategies such as over- and undersampling are popular in tackling the problem of class imbalance [?]. The undersampling algorithms artificially decrease the number of samples that belong to larger classes, while the oversampling algorithms increase the number of instances of rare classes by taking the larger classes into account. In general, these techniques can improve the classification performance when the corpus is not balanced. However, it is possible to lose valuable information for the classifier (undersampling case) or increase the time needed for the training phase and overfit the model (oversampling case). Aside from building an HMM-based classifier, this thesis work also explores how the previously mentioned problems affect its classification performance and how can the model be applied in other text preprocessing steps such as feature reduction and class balancing.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2954375764", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198345430"}

The success of deep neural networks has led to advances in using fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) to extract buildings from the high-resolution image.

To solve this problem, some methods try to refine the results of FCN by using probability graph models such as fully connected CRF (Conditional Random Fields). Nevertheless, many fully connected CRF based methods are too time-consuming and not suitable for building segmentation tasks in some situations. In this paper, we propose a novel time-efficient end-to-end CRF model with the domain transform algorithm called DT-CRF. In the proposed model, in order to accelerate the message passing in the mean-field approximate inference algorithm, we take the edge maps as the joint image for DT-CRF and use the domain transformation algorithm to calculate the pair-wise potential instead of the Gaussian kernel function. Meanwhile, we design a multi-task network which can generate masks and edges simultaneously, and the network can make the DT-CRF to easily optimize the segmentation results using model information.

However, traditional methods ignore the correlation information between different channels, and cannot fully capture the long-term dependencies and contextual information of EEG signals. To address the problems, this paper proposes a deep belief-conditional random field (DBN-CRF) framework which integrates the improved deep belief networks with glia chains (DBN-GC) and conditional random field. In the framework, the raw feature vector sequence is firstly extracted from the multi-channel EEG signals by a sliding window. Then, parallel DBN-GC models are utilized to obtain the high-level feature sequence of the multi-channel EEG signals. And the conditional random field (CRF) model generates the predicted emotion label sequence according to the high-level feature sequence. Finally, the decision merge layer based on K-nearest neighbor algorithm is employed to estimate the emotion state. According to our best knowledge, this is the first attempt that applies the conditional random field methodology to deep belief networks for emotion recognition. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available emotional datasets which include AMIGOS, SEED and DEAP. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can mine inter correlation information of multiple-channel by the glia chains and catch inter channel correlation information and contextual information of EEG signals for emotion recognition. In addition, the classification accuracy of the proposed method is compared with several classical techniques. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms most of the other deep classifiers.

Specifically, we focus on seven conventional machine learning and deep learning methods and compare their generalization power in the presence of concept drift. Our results show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) outperform conventional methods, even when compared to an idealized upper bound on their performance created in a piecewise manner by selecting the best method and its best configuration at each point in time, thus mimicking the output of a perfect meta-learning architecture.

In our work we are applying machine learning methods to longitudinal records of MS patients to build a classifier that predicts whether a patient will have a significant increase in disability at the five year mark using information from the first two years of clinical visits. This prediction is key for choosing among the available treatments as some have more troubling side-effect profiles. Two challenges arise while learning with this data. First, patient data involves the physician\u2019s (possibly subjective) evaluation. Because a patient\u2019s data may come from one doctor on the first visit and different doctors on subsequent visits, it can be difficult to form an accurate predictor of disease outcome. In particular, some physicians may be biased in one direction, scoring each patient as more severe than would other physicians, while others may be biased in the opposite direction. Another challenge is that it is much easier to classify the cases with low future disability compared to cases with high future disability at early stages of the disease. This asymmetric property is due to the nature of the disease rather than class imbalance. In this paper we introduce a new transfer learning approach to handle these challenges. The algorithm builds a single SVM classifier for each doctor by dividing the entire dataset into primary (instances from the doctor) and auxiliary (instances from other doctors) sets.

Various types of epigenetic information including histone modification have been utilized in the construction of enhancer prediction models based on a diverse panel of machine learning schemes. However, DNA methylation profiles generated from the whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) have not been fully explored for their potential in enhancer prediction despite the fact that low methylated regions (LMRs) have been implied to be distal active regulatory regions. ::: Method ::: In this work, we propose a prediction framework, LMethyR-SVM, using LMRs identified from cell-type-specific WGBS DNA methylation profiles and a weighted support vector machine learning framework. In LMethyR-SVM, the set of cell-type-specific LMRs is further divided into three sets: reliable positive, like positive and likely negative, according to their resemblance to a small set of experimentally validated enhancers in the VISTA database based on an estimated non-parametric density distribution. Then, the prediction model is obtained by solving a weighted support vector machine. ::: Results ::: We demonstrate the performance of LMethyR-SVM by using the WGBS DNA methylation profiles derived from the human embryonic stem cell type (H1) and the fetal lung fibroblast cell type (IMR90). The predicted enhancers are highly conserved with a reasonable validation rate based on a set of commonly used positive markers including transcription factors, p300 binding and DNase-I hypersensitive sites. In addition, we show evidence that the large fraction of the LMethyR-SVM predicted enhancers are not predicted by ChromHMM in H1 cell type and they are more enriched for the FANTOM5 enhancers. ::: Conclusion ::: Our work suggests that low methylated regions detected from the WGBS data are useful as complementary resources to histone modification marks in developing models for the prediction of cell-type-specific enhancers.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5035071", "pubmed_id": "27662487", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0163491", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950565866", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:454433"}

This paper describes the development of a gender-independent laugh detector with the aim to enable automatic emotion recognition. Different types of features (spectral, prosodic) for laughter detection were investigated using different classification techniques (Gaussian Mixture Models, Support Vector Machines, Multi Layer Perceptron) often used in language and speaker recognition. Classification experiments were carried out with short pre-segmented speech and laughter segments extracted from the ICSI Meeting Recorder Corpus (with a mean duration of approximately 2s). Equal error rates of around 3% were obtained when tested on speaker-independent speech data. We found that a fusion between classifiers based on Gaussian Mixture Models and classifiers based on Support Vector Machines increases discriminative power. We also found that a fusion between classifiers that use spectral features and classifiers that use prosodic information usually increases the performance for discrimination between laughter and speech.

Firstly, a keypoints tracking based scale estimation method is proposed to handle the target scale variation during tracking. Secondly, the powerful and efficient features including intensity, Fast Histogram of Oriented Gradient (FHOG) and Discriminative color Descriptors (DD) are integrated to further boost the tracking performance. Thirdly, dynamic updating mechanism is introduced to better adapt the correlation filter to the appearance changes. Moreover, to handle the drift brought by severe occlusion, we train an online ELM based classifier to re-initialize object in case of tracking failure.

Among these methods, online learning is one set of instrumental methods that could fit such learning scenarios through training one example at a time. Specifically, online support vector regression (SVR) is a typical online learning method that has been developed on the basis of support vector machines (SVM) and is able to achieve effective performance. However, it fails to adequately utilize a large mass of unlabelled data. Meanwhile, it has been shown that manifold learning enables us to exploit the geometry of the data distribution, but it remains a challenge to explore the online manifold process. In this paper, we propose a new online method that incorporates standard online SVR in a manifold regularized framework, which we call online Laplacian-regularized SVR (online LapSVR). Our online LapSVR algorithm can tackle the problems described above and avoid the repeated calculations of batch methods, which require intensive computation, especially with data of massive size or dimensions.

The capability of features to express different relevance facets (query- or document-dependent) can explain such a success story. Such models are most of the time supervised, thus requiring a learning phase. To leverage the advantages of feature-based representations of documents, we propose TournaRank , an unsupervised approach inspired by real-life game and sport competition principles. Documents compete against each other in tournaments using features as evidences of relevance. Tournaments are modeled as a sequence of matches, which involve pairs of documents playing in turn their features. Once a tournament is ended, documents are ranked according to their number of won matches during the tournament. This principle is generic since it can be applied to any collection type. It also provides great flexibility since different alternatives can be considered by changing the tournament type, the match rules, the feature set, or the strategies adopted by documents during matches. TournaRank was experimented on several collections to evaluate our model in different contexts and to compare it with related approaches such as Learning To Rank and fusion ones: the TREC Robust2004 collection for homogeneous documents, the TREC Web2014 (ClueWeb12) collection for heterogeneous web documents, and the LETOR3.0 collection for comparison with supervised feature-based models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ipm.2017.11.006", "venue": "Inf.

The main idea is to build on an existing image representation and to learn a metric that reflects the visual camera-to-camera transitions, allowing for a more powerful classification. The goal of this chapter is twofold. We first review the main ideas of Mahalanobis metric learning in general and then give a detailed study on different approaches for the task of single-shot person re-identification, also comparing to the state of the art. In particular, for our experiments, we used Linear Discriminant Metric Learning (LDML), Information Theoretic Metric Learning (ITML), Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN), Large Margin Nearest Neighbor with Rejection (LMNN-R), Efficient Impostor-based Metric Learning (EIML), and KISSME. For our evaluations we used four different publicly available datasets (i.e., VIPeR, ETHZ, PRID 2011, and CAVIAR4REID).

An ensemble of three binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers arranged in one-against-all strategy, were used to classify the feature vector among three categories, according to its origin from some breathing events like normal, apnea and hypopnea. The consecutive decisions of classifier model on time sequenced consecutive overlapped windows were combined by some heuristic rules to identify abnormal breathing events from normal breathings.

The identification of biomarker profiles can be translated into simplified tests for the early diagnosis of diseases such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). ::: ::: Aim To evaluate the feasibility of a diagnostic protocol for chronic GVHD (cGVHD) based on the metabolic profile of blood serum from patients (pts) submitted to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ::: ::: Methodology The study included a prospective, nested cohort of 41 adult pts who had undergone first full-match allogeneic HSCT at Hospital de Cl\u2019nicas/ University of Campinas between August, 2011-January, 2013 and had signed the Consent Form. Blood serum samples were prospectively collected on the day of hospitalization (D-8), day of transplantation (D0), NADIR phase (D+10) and D+100 post-HSCT. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic experiments were performed at the Brazilian Biosciences National Laboratory (LNBio/CNPEM). Samples were previously filtered on a 3 kDa cut off filter, diluted 3X on 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, referenced with 10% D2O and 0.5 mM DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid) for further absolute quantification of metabolites. The acquisition of 1D spectra was performed on a Agilent/Varian INOVA spectrometer operating at 1H resonance frequency of 600MHz. The spectra processing, identification and quantification of metabolites were performed by using the application package Chenomx NMR Suite and the target profiling approach (Chenomx, Inc). Samples from pts who developed chronic GVHD, at anytime, were marked as \u201ccGVHD group\u201d, and those who did not develop chronic GVHD, \u201ccGVHD-free group\u201d . Blood samples from pts who died up to 200 days after HSCT and did not develop chronic GVHD were excluded from the analysis, as were also all samples from pts whose sample collection was lacking at least in one period. T-tests (p<0.05) were applied at each sampling time in order to select metabolites and perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering and calculate Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for cGVHD diagnosis model using the software Pirouette\u00a8 4.0 (Infometrix, Inc) and the web tools MetaboAnalyst 2.0 and ROCCET. ::: ::: Results Median age was 41(18-69) years old and 61% were male. 18/41(44%) pts matched the inclusion criteria for the study. 6/18 (33%) pts had undergone cGVHD therapy. Seventy-three metabolites were identified and quantified in the blood serum samples. 8 metabolites were selected by T-test application at each studied time (2 metabolites from D-8, 2 from D0, 3 from D+10 and 1 from D+100). Using the selected metabolites the PCA showed clear separation between pts from \u201ccGVHD\u201d and \u201ccGVHD-free\u201d groups as well as hierarchical clustering ([Fig. 1][1]), confirmed by ROC analysis as a high sensitivity and specificity model for cGVHD diagnosis (AUC 0.99 and CI 0.93-1.00) ([Fig. 2][2]). ::: ::: ![Fig. 1][3] ::: ::: Fig. 1 ::: Clustering result shown as dendrogram (distance measure using Pearson, and clustering algorithm using Ward). P#: patient ID in this study; red: GVHD group; green: GVHD-free group. ::: ::: ::: ::: ![Fig. 2][3] ::: ::: Fig. 2 ::: Multivariate ROC analyses by Support Vector Machine (SVM). Monte-Carlo cross validation (MCCV) with multiple iterations are employed to compute ROC curves and to calculate confidence intervals of their AUC. ::: ::: ::: ::: Conclusion Metabolic differences were found in both studied groups. These differences may be used as a biomarker profile for cGVHD diagnosis up 100 days post-HSCT. Our results demonstrated that the statistical model using combined prospective time-series analysis is a powerful metabolomic model for early cGVHD diagnosis. ::: ::: Disclosures: Alborghetti: Sao Paulo Research Foundation: Research Funding. da Silva: Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES): Research Funding. ::: ::: [1]: #F1 ::: [2]: #F2 ::: [3]: pending:yes", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.V122.21.3304.3304", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2254639665", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56841978"}

Engineering problems involve more and more complex computer codes and the evaluation of the probability of failure may require very time-consuming computations. Metamodels are used to reduce these computation times. To assess reliability, the most popular approach remains the numerous variants of response surfaces. Polynomial Chaos [1] and Support Vector Machine [2] are also possibilities and have gained considerations among researchers in the last decades. However, recently, Kriging, originated from geostatistics, have emerged in reliability analysis. Widespread in optimisation, Kriging has just started to appear in uncertainty propagation [3] and reliability [4] , [5] studies. It presents interesting characteristics such as exact interpolation and a local index of uncertainty on the prediction which can be used in active learning methods. The aim of this paper is to propose an iterative approach based on Monte Carlo Simulation and Kriging metamodel to assess the reliability of structures in a more efficient way. The method is called AK-MCS for Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation. It is shown to be very efficient as the probability of failure obtained with AK-MCS is very accurate and this, for only a small number of calls to the performance function. Several examples from literature are performed to illustrate the methodology and to prove its efficiency particularly for problems dealing with high non-linearity, non-differentiability, non-convex and non-connex domains of failure and high dimensionality.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.strusafe.2011.01.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Structural Safety", "mag_id": "2007535697", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["117318466", "198328845", "214619097", "61976955", "209313541", "56234651", "52034671", "212645221", "73466068", "55281213", "199509568", "196113149", "211199101", "63729855", "57415647", "73566156", "182255567", "119952065", "59600828", "88513380", "199276198", "125438694", "126450679", "112931852", "186342513", "133332749", "189924284", "211029418", "29270922", "52221787", "132137662", "115436700", "54534407", "198438218", "21346600", "54653623", "46911272", "214667138", "210972487", "3492831", "57402186", "211990534", "201144829", "9349446", "126261183", "59393785", "7063888", "53341695", "34050283", "13406941", "54660567", "88515391", "211055445", "117288960", "15797551", "3917011", "30354270", "123156459", "96425906", "2804421", "198345688", "203588327", "211044005", "126769056", "116148220", "59393059", "201875993", "125737022", "11063516", "35748385", "7328433", "53143467", "88517114", "207513659", "88521349", "55607173", "203595971", "201646108", "211566724", "155091817", "122329022", "14621767", "55537519", "114185425", "33057005", "55962847", "125427338", "116408517", "118872943", "159042617", "123876034", "124318200", "211104200", "118868856", "195877825", "88518940", "9412858", "112932609", "195791834", "55977555", "88521887", "67350400", "127368120", "56175699", "532005", "10020347", "53462165", "29734887", "25266555", "59458905", "205896050", "115939823", "55917893", "26143307", "7658085", "67426888", "211568158", "2575919", "56374705", "199002535", "88514105", "22290832", "63991772", "125981553", "44155358", "160015830", "124010200", "117377750", "203836902", "203173929", "124206556", "202143470", "17180082", "126319826", "203647297", "207981045", "207989825", "59479427", "18640422", "56021602", "26133889"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119798548"}

Empirical evidence has been taken to support a model which includes two separate lexicons working in parallel (Smith, 1991; Gerard and Scarborough, 1989).

We introduce an end-to-end algorithm for jointly learning the weights of the CRF model, which include action classification and action transition costs, as well as an overcomplete dictionary of mid-level action primitives.

However, collecting and annotating these large real-world pedestrian datasets is costly in both time and labor. This paper describes a novel method using a stochastic sampling-based simulation to train DNNs for pedestrian trajectory prediction with social interaction. Our novel simulation method can generate vast amounts of automatically-annotated, realistic, and naturalistic synthetic pedestrian trajectories based on small amounts of real annotation. We then use such synthetic trajectories to train an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art deep learning approach Social GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to perform pedestrian trajectory prediction. Our proposed architecture, trained only using synthetic trajectories, achieves better prediction results compared to those trained on human-annotated real-world data using the same network.

The support vector approach is data-based and is therefore robust to process knowledge. It is based on structural risk minimization which enhances generalization even with small training data set and it allows for process nonlinearity by using flexible kernels. In this work, a radial basis function is used as the kernel. Different parts of the process are investigated including actuators and sensors faults. With duplicated sensors, sensor faults in blade pitch positions, generator and rotor speeds can be detected. Faults of type stuck measurements can be detected in 2 sampling periods. The detection time of offset/scaled measurements depends on the severity of the fault and on the process dynamics when the fault occurs. The converter torque actuator fault can be detected within 2 sampling periods. Faults in the actuators of the pitch systems represents a higher difficulty for fault detection which is due to the fact that such faults only affect the transitory state (which is very fast) but not the final stationary state. Therefore, two methods are considered and compared for fault detection and isolation of this fault: support vector machines and a Kalman-like observer. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. On one hand, support vector machines training of transitory states would require a big amount of data in different situations, but the fault detection and isolation results are robust to variations in the input/operating point. On the other hand, the observer is model-based, and therefore does not require training, and it allows identification of the fault level, which is interesting for fault reconfiguration. But the observability of the system is ensured under specific conditions, related to the dynamics of the inputs and outputs.

With this purpose, we follow a five-step evaluation methodology: (1) a custom-designed, non-invasive, electromechanical device was used in the data collection from 50 subjects; (2) the acquired position and amplitude of onset, Systolic Peak (SP), Point of Inflection (Pi) and Dicrotic Wave (DW) were used for the computation of some morphological attributes; (3) pre-processing work on the datasets was performed in order to reduce the number of input features and increase the model accuracy by selecting the most relevant ones; (4) classification of the dataset was carried out using four different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, BayesNet (probabilistic), J48 (decision tree) and RIPPER (rule-based induction); and (5) we evaluate the trained models, using the majority-voting system, comparatively to the respective calculated Augmentation Index (AIx). Classification algorithms have been proved to be efficient, in particular Random Forest has shown good accuracy (96.95%) and high area under the curve (AUC) of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (0.961).

The proposed method, open set model with incremental learning (OSmIL), is an ensemble classifier so it is able to be updated only by the new data. For saving the computational time and storage source, a new exemplar selection method is introduced for model simplifying. Edge samples are selected to cover training classes; as a result, the model size is deduced and controlled. Moreover, because extreme value theory (EVT) is suitable to fit a classification model that includes open space risk, the decision function based on EVT makes an open set classifier for identifying the new classes.

In the proposed approach, a Neural Fuzzy inference system (NF) was used to establish the forest fire model whereas Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was adopted to investigate the best values for the model parameters. Tropical forest at the province of Lam Dong (Central Highland of Vietnam) was used as a case study. For this purpose, historic forest fires and ten ignition factors (slope, aspect, elevation, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, distance to road, distance to residence area, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall) were collected from various sources to construct a GIS database, and then, the database was used to develop and validate the proposed model. The performance of the forest model was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical measures. The results showed that the proposed model performs well, both on the training dataset (AUC = 0.932) and the validation dataset (AUC = 0.916). The usability of the proposed model was further assessed through comparisons with those derived from two benchmark state-of-the art machine learning methods, Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Because the performance of the proposed model is better than the two benchmark models, we concluded that the PSO-NF model is a valid alternative tool that should be considered for tropical forest fire susceptibility modeling.

We can efficiently express a wide variety of real-world situations, events, and behaviors by compositionally constructing the meaning of a complex expression from a finite number of elements. Previous studies have analyzed how machine-learning models, particularly neural networks, can learn from experience to represent compositional relationships between language and robot actions with the aim of understanding the symbol grounding structure and achieving intelligent communicative agents. Such studies have mainly dealt with the words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs) that directly refer to real-world matters. In addition to these words, the current study deals with logic words, such as ``not\", ``and\", and ``or\" simultaneously. These words are not directly referring to the real world, but are logical operators that contribute to the construction of meaning in sentences. In human--robot communication, these words may be used often. The current study builds a recurrent neural network model with long short-term memory units and trains it to learn to translate sentences including logic words into robot actions. We investigate what kind of compositional representations, which mediate sentences and robot actions, emerge as the network's internal states via the learning process. Analysis after learning shows that referential words are merged with visual information and the robot's own current state, and the logical words are represented by the model in accordance with their functions as logical operators. Words such as ``true\", ``false\", and ``not\" work as non-linear transformations to encode orthogonal phrases into the same area in a memory cell state space. The word ``and\", which required a robot to lift up both its hands, worked as if it was a universal quantifier. The word ``or\", which required action generation that looked apparently random, was represented as an unstable space of the network's dynamical system.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5744442", "pubmed_id": "29311891", "doi": "10.3389/fnbot.2017.00070", "venue": "Front.

Variable importance analysis indicated that mean texture measure of PC1 and PC3, and spectral information of MS band 8 (NIR 2) were the most important predictor layers for bamboo mapping.

Its many interrelated wetland types undergo seasonal and longer-term changes due to weather and climate variations as well as anthropogenic land use such as grazing and burning. Mapping and monitoring of these wetlands has not been previously undertaken due primarily to their relative isolation and lack of resources. This study investigated the potential of remote sensing based classification for mapping the primary vegetation groups in the Dabus Wetlands using a combination of dry and wet season data, including optical (Landsat spectral bands and derived vegetation and wetness indices), radar (ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter), and elevation (SRTM derived DEM and other terrain metrics) as inputs to the non-parametric Random Forest (RF) classifier. Eight wetland types and three terrestrial/upland classes were mapped using field samples of observed plant community composition and structure groupings as reference information. Various tests to compare results using different RF input parameters and data types were conducted. A combination of multispectral optical, radar and topographic variables provided the best overall classification accuracy, 94.4% and 92.9% for the dry and wet season, respectively. Spectral and topographic data (radar data excluded) performed nearly as well, while accuracies using only radar and topographic data were 82\u201389%. Relatively homogeneous classes such as Papyrus Swamps, Forested Wetland, and Wet Meadow yielded the highest accuracies while spatially complex classes such as Emergent Marsh were more difficult to accurately classify.

We introduced five new domain-independent feature sets and experimented with six machine learning models to estimate the new satisfaction metric. ::: Using Response Quality annotation scheme, across randomly sampled single and multi-turn conversations from 26 domains, we achieved high inter-annotator agreement (Spearman's rho 0.94). The Response Quality labels were highly correlated (0.76) with explicit turn-level user ratings. Gradient boosting regression achieved best correlation of ~0.79 between predicted and annotated user satisfaction labels.

This paper proposes an effective GAN-based personalised ranking model, named as PRGAN that leverages both user behavior information (such as user-item interaction or other implicit feedback) and user demographic information to enhance the recommendation accuracy. Because of data sparsity, we employ extended version of factorization machine i.e. deepFM as the generator. DeepFM not only can be effectively trained in the case of sparse data, but also can learn high-dimensional features. Compared with traditional FM, deepFM utilize user information more effectively to generate accurate user expressions. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) as our discriminator. After a minimax iteration game, PRGAN finally generates a high-quality ranking list of items according to user performance.

Identifying LVO in the pre-hospital setting or early stage of hospitalization would increase the patients\u2019 chance of receiving appropriate reperfusion therapy and thereby improve neurological recovery. Methods To enable rapid identification of LVO, we established an automated evaluation system based on all recorded AIS patients in Hong Kong Hospital Authority\u2019s hospitals in 2016. The 300 study samples were randomly selected based on a disproportionate sampling plan within the integrated electronic health record system, and then separated into a group of 200 patients for model training, and another group of 100 patients for model performance evaluation. The evaluation system contained three hierarchical models based on patients\u2019 demographic data, clinical data and non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. The first two levels of modeling utilized structured demographic and clinical data, while the third level involved additional NCCT imaging features obtained from deep learning model. All three levels\u2019 modeling adopted multiple machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost). The optimal cut-off for the likelihood of LVO was determined by the maximal Youden index based on 10-fold cross-validation. Comparisons of performance on the testing group were made between these techniques. Results Among the 300 patients, there were 160 women and 140 men aged from 27 to 104 years (mean 76.0 with standard deviation 13.4). LVO was present in 130 (43.3%) patients. Together with clinical and imaging features, the XGBoost model at the third level of evaluation achieved the best model performance on testing group. The Youden index, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.638, 0.800, 0.953, 0.684, 0.804, and 0.847, respectively. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study combining both structured clinical data with non-structured NCCT imaging data for the diagnosis of LVO in the acute setting, with superior performance compared to previously reported approaches.

As one potential candidate among different alternative \u201cgreen energy\u201d solutions for sustainable development, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has received extensive research attention for many years for energy and transportation applications. However, the relatively short lifespan of PEMFCs operating under non-steady-state conditions (for vehicles, for example) impedes its massive use. The accurate prediction of their aging mechanisms can thus help to design proper maintenance patterns of PEMFCs by providing foreseeable performance degradation information. In addition, the prediction could also help to avoid or mitigate the unwanted degradation of PEMFC systems during operation. In this paper, an advanced self-adaptive relevance vector machine (RVM) has been developed and demonstrated to predict the performance degradation of PEMFCs. In order to prove the versatility of proposed RVM method, the predictive results are experimentally validated using two different PEMFC stacks aging data under different operating patterns. Furthermore, the obtained results are compared with results from both classic support vector machine and original RVM methods in order to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed self-adaptive RVM method with a modified design matrix. A comparison between single-step-ahead and multiple-step-ahead predictions of the proposed method is also given and discussed.

We adapt common representation learning techniques used in other domains and find that representations inspired by language models enable a 3.5% mean improvement in AUROC on five clinical outcomes compared to standard baselines, with the average improvement rising to 19% when only a small number of patients are available for training a prediction model for a given clinical outcome.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.05295", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3000098859", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["206524522", "4940768", "30952425", "215272518", "108292839", "13432738", "215360950", "4404566", "17891422", "9437678", "13409466", "3763233", "31457108", "5307128", "207795070", "52967411", "1957433", "16447573", "13694466", "15460579", "40100965", "52967399", "53037206", "5842463", "4404566", "17699480", "205228801", "18593743", "43685115", "123532178", "12480360", "2359786", "1326925", "49313245", "10659969", "3815895", "41483981"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210703044"}

Since AOD products, however, are only provided under high-quality conditions, missing values usually exist in areas such as clouds, cloud shadows, and bright surfaces. In this study, spatially continuous AOD and subsequent PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated over East Asia using satellite- and model-based data and auxiliary data in a Random Forest (RF) approach. Data collected from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI; 8 times per day) in 2016 were used to develop AOD and PM models. Three schemes (i.e. G1, A1, and A2) were proposed for AOD modeling according to target AOD data (GOCI AOD and AERONET AOD) and the existence of satellite-derived AOD. The A2 scheme showed the best performance (validation R2 of 0.74 and prediction R2 of 0.73 when GOCI AOD did not exist) and the resultant AOD was used to estimate spatially continuous PM concentrations. The PM models with location information produced successful estimation results with R2 of 0.88 and 0.90, and rRMSE of 26.9 and 27.2% for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The spatial distribution maps of PM well captured the seasonal and spatial characteristics of PM reported in the literature, which implies the proposed approaches can be adopted for an operational estimation of spatially continuous AOD and PMs under all sky conditions.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31951839", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136516", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "2999165852", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210708886"}

Current detectors typically use binary discriminants such as Support Vector Machines or Boosting to implement each stage of the cascade. These treat the positive and negative classes symmetrically. We argue that this is suboptimal because object detectors typically see a great many negative windows with extremely diverse contents and only a few positive ones with comparatively coherent contents. We show that asymmetric representations that focus on tightly modeling the extent of the rare, coherent positive class can lead to simpler classifiers and faster rejection. Our cascades use asymmetric classifiers based on simple convex models to progressively tighten the bound on the positive class. They typically start with a conventional linear SVM for initial pruning, followed by a cascade of linear distance-to-hyperplane and interior-of-hypersphere classifiers and finishing with a kernelized hypersphere classifier. We show that the resulting detectors have competitive performance on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset and state-of-the-art performance on the FDDB face detection, ESOGU face detection and INRIA Person datasets.

Randomization is explicitly introduced into this algorithm, such that applying the algorithm several times on the same training data results in diversified models. An ensemble classification model is constructed using multiple randomized decision trees via majority voting. In order to show the performance of different models in classification, we propose the usage of precision, recall, F-Measure, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Gini coefficient as evaluation indexes of the classifying performance on the Iris dataset. The experimental results show that classification with Random Forests model has generally better performance than that with the Boosting Tree model and other three popular algorithms: KNN, SMO and Simple Cart.

We aimed to generate and validate a risk tool that predicts adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Using logistic regression models, we generated a risk tool in a representative population cohort (ALSPAC - UK, 5113 participants, followed from birth to age 17) using childhood clinical and sociodemographic data with internal validation. Predictors included sex, socioeconomic status, single-parent family, ADHD symptoms, comorbid disruptive disorders, childhood maltreatment, ADHD symptoms, depressive symptoms, mother's depression and intelligence quotient. The outcome was defined as a categorical diagnosis of ADHD in young adulthood without requiring age at onset criteria. We also tested Machine Learning approaches for developing the risk models: Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Network. The risk tool was externally validated in the E-Risk cohort (UK, 2040 participants, birth to age 18), the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort (Brazil, 3911 participants, birth to age 18) and the MTA clinical sample (USA, 476 children with ADHD and 241 controls followed for 16 years from a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 26 years old). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The overall prevalence of adult ADHD ranged from 8.1 to 12% in the population-based samples, and was 28.6% in the clinical sample. The internal performance of the model in the generating sample was good, with an area under the curve (AUC) for predicting adult ADHD of 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.83). Calibration plots showed good agreement between predicted and observed event frequencies from 0 to 60% probability. In the UK birth cohort test sample, the AUC was 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78). In the Brazilian birth cohort test sample, the AUC was significantly lower -0.57 (95% CI 0.54-0.60). In the clinical trial test sample, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.80). The risk model did not predict adult anxiety or major depressive disorder. Machine Learning approaches did not outperform logistic regression models. An open-source and free risk calculator was generated for clinical use and is available online at https://ufrgs.br/prodah/adhd-calculator/. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The risk tool based on childhood characteristics specifically predicts adult ADHD in European and North-American population-based and clinical samples with comparable discrimination to commonly used clinical tools in internal medicine and higher than most previous attempts for mental and neurological disorders.

If diverse and complex anomalies (i.e., bugs and failures) cannot be detected and eliminated efficiently, the running workflows and transactions, even the system, would break down. Therefore, anomaly detection has become increasingly significant and attracted a lot of research attention. However, current approaches concentrate on the anomaly detection in a high-level granularity of logs (i.e., session) instead of detecting log-level anomalies which weakens the efficiency of responding anomalies and the diagnosis of system failures. To overcome the limitation, we propose a sequence-based generative adversarial network for anomaly detection based on system logs named LogGAN which detects log-level anomalies based on the patterns (i.e., the combination of latest logs). In addition, the generative adversarial network-based model relieves the effect of imbalance between normal and abnormal instances to improve the performance of capturing anomalies. To evaluate LogGAN, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach to log-level anomaly detection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-34637-9_5", "venue": "SciSec", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2993658339", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11380990", "53035198", "207172599", "10290328", "206716402", "4232579", "1033682", "69536356", "7806503", "14466898", "10476185", "6505449", "17985759", "3097367", "207191250", "610902", "3331356", "67700841", "2239051", "6635923", "53211579"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209324846"}

It is well-known that automation of roadside vegetation classification is one of the important issues emerging strongly in improving the fire risk and road safety. Hence, the application presented in this paper is significantly important for identifying fire risks and road safety. The images collected from outdoor environments such as roadside, are affected for a high variability of illumination conditions because of different weather conditions. This paper proposes a novel texture feature based robust expert system for vegetation identification. It consists of five steps, namely image pre-processing, feature extraction, training with multiple classifiers, classification, validation and statistical analysis. In the initial stage, Co-occurrence of Binary Pattern (CBP) technique is applied in order to obtain the texture feature relevant to vegetation in the roadside images. In the training and classification stages, three classifiers have been fused to combine the multiple decisions. The first classifier is based on Support Vector Machine, the second classifier is based on feed forward back-propagation neural network (FF-BPNN) and the third classifier is based on -Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). The proposed technique has been applied and evaluated on two types of vegetation images i.e. dense and sparse grasses.

Machine learning algorithms have been extensively applied to classification and pattern recognition problems in the past years.

Most of these works were based on the comparison of measured vibration data such as natural frequencies and vibration modes in undamaged and damaged states of the structure. This methodology has proven to be efficient in various studies presented in the literature. However, its application may not be the most adequate in cases where the engineer needs to know with certain imperativeness the condition of a given structure. This paper proposes a novel approach introducing the concept of Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) to manipulate raw vibration data (signals, i.e. acceleration measurements). These quantities (transformed into symbolic data) are combined to three well-known classification techniques: Bayesian Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The objective is to explore the efficiency of this combined methodology. For this purpose, only raw information are used for feature extraction. In order to attest the robustness of this approach, experimental tests are performed on a simply supported beam considering different damage scenarios.

In this paper, SVM was applied to predict 5-year survival status of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after treatment, we expect to find a new way for prognosis studies in cancer so as to assist right clinical decision for individual patient. Methods: Two modelling methods were used in the study; SVM network and a standard parametric logistic regression were used to model 5-year survival status. And the two methods were compared on a prospective set of patients not used in model construction via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The SVM1, trained with the 25 original input variables without screening, yielded a ROC area of 0.868, at sensitivity to mortality of 79.2% and the specificity of 94.5%. Similarly, the SVM2, trained with 9 input variables which were obtained by optimal input variable selection from the 25 original variables by logistic regression screening, yielded a ROC area of 0.874, at a sensitivity to mortality of 79.2% and the specificity of 95.6%, while the logistic regression yielded a ROC area of 0.751 at a sensitivity to mortality of 66.7% and gave a specificity of 83.5%. Conclusion: SVM found a strong pattern in the database predictive of 5-year survival status. The logistic regression produces somewhat similar, but better, results.

One of the fundamental challenges in the control of tuberculosis is therefore to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of latency and/or reactivation. We have attempted to address this problem at the systems level by a combination of predicted functional protein\u2236protein interactions, integration of functional interactions with large scale gene expression studies, predicted transcription regulatory network and finally simulations with a Boolean model of the network. Initially a prediction for genome-wide protein functional linkages was obtained based on genome-context methods using a Support Vector Machine. This set of protein functional linkages along with gene expression data of the available models of latency was employed to identify proteins involved in mediating switch signals during dormancy. We show that genes that are up and down regulated during dormancy are not only coordinately regulated under dormancy-like conditions but also under a variety of other experimental conditions. Their synchronized regulation indicates that they form a tightly regulated gene cluster and might form a latency-regulon. Conservation of these genes across bacterial species suggests a unique evolutionary history that might be associated with M. tuberculosis dormancy. Finally, simulations with a Boolean model based on the regulatory network with logical relationships derived from gene expression data reveals a bistable switch suggesting alternating latent and actively growing states. Our analysis based on the interaction network therefore reveals a potential model of M. tuberculosis latency.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3309013", "pubmed_id": "22448278", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0033893", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2091847893", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["52867876", "25925389", "24558191", "693411", "21383026", "8693899", "38620539", "18424701", "581039", "8235265", "2567402", "6311275", "6979112", "14382936", "3546895", "46425086", "58676826", "18069005", "7716304", "8342575", "22908584", "31330837", "26820020", "16640869", "37905122", "23919021", "13914910", "13940922", "38672942", "5787753", "39085932", "28571866", "2390402", "42094185", "37768781", "7134013", "36943426", "9673964", "13792099", "42071248", "26515111", "5920798", "11304178", "2427474", "206576298", "24589177", "31497107", "2004849", "35157814", "33219841", "9345886", "19171386", "11424982", "207644982", "17612496", "19313576", "13901857", "13578860", "62913649", "15478415", "31122152", "7958901", "14050074"], "inbound_citations": ["208191424", "215576405", "15786214", "7779880", "210863254", "986995", "51726565", "215434752", "18296230"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2373731"}

Routine screening identifies suspicious breast lesions in some women, but the pain and risk associated with follow-up biopsies along with the poor accuracy of traditional histopathology urgently call for improved approaches to breast cancer screening. This is especially important for those high-risk patients for whom mammography is of limited value. We describe a non-invasive liquid biopsy method of profiling plasma exosome preps designed to improve the accuracy and safety of breast cancer screening for women with dense breast tissue. Results: We incubated plasma samples (300 microliters per sample) from breast cancer patients (n=60) and a control cohort (n=60) with a high-complexity DNA aptamer library using a modified SELEX scheme, termed \u201cadaptive dynamic artificial poly-ligand targeting (ADAPTTM)\u201d. Differentially bound (cancer vs. non-cancer) aptamers were recovered from precipitated exosomes and were identified by deep sequencing. Two thousand aptamer sequences were resynthesized and used to probe a larger set of 500 plasma samples from a patient cohort (n=206) and a control cohort comprised of self-reported healthy volunteers (n=117) and patients whose biopsies led to a diagnosis of non-cancer (n=177). We employed several statistical models to build a cancer/non-cancer predictor, including a Random Generalized Linear Model (RGLM) and a Random Forest Model (RFM). Both models yielded an equivalent classification performance with areas under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.7. Testing the prediction performance by 100 Out-of-Bag permutations or by pre-filtered (read cutoff and estimated sample size) cross-validation (CV) resulted in ROC AUC values of 0.66 and 0.62, respectively. When samples were randomly assigned to groups, the aptamers were no longer able to distinguish the groups (ROC AUC = 0.54), indicating that the underlying information driving the model is truly specific to cancer. Importantly, incorporation of BIRAD results as a clinical covariate did not influence model performance, signifying that predictions by ADAPTTM were independent of breast tissue density. Conclusions: We have identified a set of 2000 DNA aptamers that distinguish women with breast cancer from women without breast cancer. Our liquid biopsy approach requires only 300 microliters of plasma and is amenable to high-throughput processing. By employing a number of statistical approaches including rigorous cross-validation, we consistently achieve cross validation ROC AUC values approaching 0.7. The performance of the predictor was not affected by BIRAD scores, supporting its potential utility in difficult cases where imaging is insufficient, such as in women with dense breast tissue. Further optimization of the aptamer library and testing on additional samples should improve performance. Upon complete validation, an ADAPTTM \u2013 derived breast cancer test may serve as a vital diagnostic adjunct that can be easily incorporated into standard clinical practice.

It means that each sample or instance belongs to more than one class label simultaneously. Therefore, it represents complex objects that have multiple meanings. It helps in capturing more information by labeling some basic and hidden patterns. In this respect, multilabel classification is very useful in medical data analysis. It addresses the problem of diagnosis, surgery, anatomy, disease progress, analysis, and teaching purposes in medicine. There are many patients have many diseases at the same time, maybe in the same organ, such as ocular diseases. On the other side, the multilabel classification is a challenging issue by nature. This is due to high dimensionality, sparseness, and imbalance of available data. Some problems with labels are raised, such as label dependency, locality, interlabel diversity, and similarity. Therefore, our survey introduces significant topics of the multilabel classification in medical image analysis field. Notably, most of the literature did not show how multilabel classification affect the medical image analysis. In this chapter, we presented the different examples of medical image classification by the multilabel methods. We present the detailed analysis and discussions of the literature findings. The performance of the methods is compared on five publicly available data sets such as yeast, scene, genebase, corel5k and BibTex of multilabel classification using famous measures. Moreover, we intend to give the researcher a computer-aided CAD system framework for the existing multilabel classification research.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-0-12-816086-2.00009-6", "venue": "Machine Learning in Bio-Signal Analysis and Diagnostic Imaging", "journal": "Machine Learning in Bio-Signal Analysis and Diagnostic Imaging", "mag_id": "2909644922", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164475723"}

The training times of traditional back propagation algorithms, mostly used to model such processes, are far slower than desired for implementation of an on-line control system. Use of slow gradient based learning methods and iterative tuning of all network parameters during the learning process are the two major causes for such slower learning speed. An extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, which randomly selects the input weights and biases and analytically determines the output weights, is used in this work to train the SLFNs. Performance comparisons of the networks trained with ELM algorithm and standard error back propagation algorithms are presented. It is found that networks trained with ELM have good generalization performance, much shorter training times and stable performance with regard to the changes in number of hidden layer neurons.

Then, to overcome premature convergence, an adaptive stagnation avoidance strategy is proposed. The strategy consists of two parts: (1) information entropy. It is used to measure the diversity of GAACO; (2) a cooperative game model. When the value of information entropy is less than threshold value, the cooperative game model will be used to select the appropriate pheromone matrix for different colonies to improve the accuracy. Finally, to further accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, the initial pheromone matrix is preprocessed to increase the pheromone of the optimal path for each iteration in the early stage. And according to reinforcement learning method, each colony increases the pheromone of the global optimal path at the end of each iteration.

Edge texture features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied to detect the discriminated landmarks of the liver, including both surface and internal points. Using the information of liver shape, 3D gray level co-occurrence matrix is calculated into texture features, from which the most informatics there features are selected by our optimization algorithm for choosing a sub-set of features from a high dimensional feature set.

NDVI can be retrieved from publicly available data repositories of optical sensors such as Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and several commercial satellites. Studies that are heavily dependent on optical sensors are subject to data loss due to cloud coverage. Specifically, cloud contamination is a hindrance to long-term environmental assessment when using information from satellite imagery retrieved from visible and infrared spectral ranges. Landsat has an ongoing high-resolution NDVI record starting from 1984. Unfortunately, this long time series NDVI data suffers from the cloud contamination issue. Though both simple and complex computational methods for data interpolation have been applied to recover cloudy data, all the techniques have limitations. In this paper, a novel Optical Cloud Pixel Recovery (OCPR) method is proposed to repair cloudy pixels from the time-space-spectrum continuum using a Random Forest (RF) trained and tested with multi-parameter hydrologic data. The RF-based OCPR model is compared with a linear regression model to demonstrate the capability of OCPR. A case study in Apalachicola Bay is presented to evaluate the performance of OCPR to repair cloudy NDVI reflectance. The RF-based OCPR method achieves a root mean squared error of 0.016 between predicted and observed NDVI reflectance values. The linear regression model achieves a root mean squared error of 0.126. Our findings suggest that the RF-based OCPR method is effective to repair cloudy pixels and provides continuous and quantitatively reliable imagery for long-term environmental analysis.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9060527", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2617469950", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["4235679", "39753568", "99531487", "2329477", "129202094", "128409590", "140183285", "1823767", "29229862", "10419029", "128470077", "13777973", "8997009", "207109722", "135457807", "129259184", "129030625", "11137998", "15705917", "7932578", "23090519", "11113264", "118074928", "17423581", "129615642", "89141", "129281451", "6336016", "83763493", "85131116", "55360270", "153748474", "9142533", "129909424", "140618071", "60246745", "15325047", "3705703", "1290347", "3093707", "12211379", "131994568", "10659969", "25394342", "206439014"], "inbound_citations": ["210693089"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7436443"}

A typical approach for this difficult problem is represented by a random under-sampling approach, where the cardinality of the majority set is reduced to that of the minority set through random sampling, thereby enabling one to utilize standard classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. When the resulting segmentation algorithm is applied to a set of testing data with the original imbalanced-ness, however, its performance could be rather limited. So as to improve the performance, a bagged under-sampling (BUS) approach has been introduced where a random under-sampling is repeated M times, though the effect of BUS turns out to be still not quite satisfactory. The first purpose of this paper is to enhance the performance of BUS by developing a novel way where BUS is employed in a repetitive manner. While the performance improvement of this approach (R-BUS) over BUS is recognizable, it is still not sufficient enough from a practical point of view, especially when the dimension of underlying binary profile vectors is quite large. The second purpose of this paper is to establish a rank reduction (RR) approach for reducing this large dimension.

While improvements have been made in handling dynamics and non-linearities, correct fault diagnosis of the process disturbance remains a difficult issue. In this work, a new data-driven diagnosis technique is developed using an LS-SVMs based statistical classifier.

Index Terms\u2014Local Binary Pattern operator, face recognition, discriminative feature weighting, multi-class classification. I. INTRODUCTION The main blocks of the biometric recognition systems are the feature extraction module and the classification module (1). Both of these aspects are the fields of extensive research and are addressed in this paper. On of popular approaches for the design of the feature extractor in the filed of face recognition is based on the texture classifier, namely Local Binary Patterns (LBP). The LBP operator was introduced in (2) and later utilized for the face recognition problem by many researchers. A lot of extensions of the LBP paradigm were developed since it was introduced, for example Multi-scale Local Binary Patterns (MSLBP) (3) and Multi-scale Block Local Binary Patterns (MB-LBP) (4). Both of these techniques partially degrades the dependence of LBP-based descriptor from the scale of the input image, which is a positive moment in the task of multi scale face recognition. The combination of the MSLBP and MB-LBP is proposed in this paper in order to develop robust scale invariant face recognition algorithm. This combination is based on the MSLBP operator itself and low- pass filtering of the input image. Another challenging aspect in the field of face recognition is the design of the classification module. The usual identification approaches are based on various Nearest Neighbor Classifiers (NNC) (5), (6). The use of complicated classifiers, such as Artificial Neural Networks or Support Vector Machine, is often inconvenient or even impossible due to insufficient intra-class information and significant amount of classes / individuals in the database. An algorithm for the weighting of discriminative features (DFW) is developed in (1) in order to compensate the statistical incompleteness of the NNC by utilizing the information from all classes. An extension of the DFW principle is proposed in this paper. The extended version of the algorithm is more stable, predictable and provides better recognition results. The improvement is based on the special procedure of the learning data selection, which allows to maximize the distance between feature vectors, which are most likely to cause the misclassification. The information obtained in the process of weights learning is incorporated in the recognition process by the use of weighted nearest neighbor classifier (WNNC). The DFW principles are utilized in two levels: block-level and feature-level weighting. The problem of the effective memory usage is also ad- dressed in this paper. The proposed data compression method- ology is based on the PCA principles and the usage of L1 distance in the recognition module. This combination results in the significant reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space with a minimal loss in the identification precision.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2292946401", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["24899189", "26881819", "9948029", "6415081", "6793014", "16445061", "148387458", "497801", "16268198", "7571706"], "inbound_citations": ["33953719", "51615810", "20121710", "17898657", "7345630"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18921352"}

The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model for mastitis incidence, independent from Somatic Cell Count (SCC), to provide an alternative, simple, and cost-effective approach for mastitis risk management based on available milking parameters. The test-day Somatic Cell Count (SCC) is the most common indicator for Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) surveillance in dairy industries worldwide. However, SCC is highly variable between days, raising major concerns for its reliability. This caveat highlights the need for longitudinal/frequent monitoring of SCC and/or developing alternative approaches for SCM surveillance. A considerable proportion of available milking data such as Milk Volume, Protein, Lactose, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Milking Time, and Peak Flow provide the possibility of pattern recognition and model discovery towards mastitis occurrence. Developing a predictive model involves: (1) finding the threshold (cutoff) of different predictive milking parameters and (2) finding the best combination of features that lead to mastitis and their hierarchical pattern/order. Here, in a large-scale study on 346,248 milking records, for the first time, we evaluated four different decision tree algorithms (Decision Tree, Stump Decision Tree, Parallel Decision Tree and Random Forest Decision Tree) with four different criteria (Accuracy, Info Gain, Gini Index and Gain Ratio) run on 11 datasets (original dataset and 10 created datasets by attribute weighting selection algorithms). Therefore, 572 models were evaluated and compared by 10-fold cross validation. The performance of each decision tree in drawing an inverted tree; with the most important feature at the root and less important variables as the leaf; was calculated by 10-fold cross validation. Random Forest Decision Tree with Gini Index criterion was the best model for predicting mastitis from milking parameters with a high accuracy of 90%. Decision Tree models identified a strong pattern for SCM in milking data where all (100%) of cows with low levels of lactose (Lactose4.5g/L) and low milk volume (Volume21.7L) had mastitis. In addition, a significant pattern was found for identifying healthy cows by high levels of lactose (Lactose4.5g/L) and low levels of EC (EC5.2). This study doccuments that milking parameters mined by the Decision Tree Random Forest model can be utilised to accurately predict SCM. The findings can be employed to increase the reliability of test-day SCC or as SCC-independent and cost-effective predictors of SCM.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2018.02.003", "venue": "Comput.

This step presents various complex and unsolved challenges, namely the selection of informative features, the representation of the textual context, and the selection of a specific event type for a trigger word given this context.ResultsWe propose TrigNER, a machine learning-based solution for biomedical event trigger recognition, which takes advantage of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with a high-end feature set, including linguistic-based, orthographic, morphological, local context and dependency parsing features. Additionally, a completely configurable algorithm is used to automatically optimize the feature set and training parameters for each event type. Thus, it automatically selects the features that have a positive contribution and automatically optimizes the CRF model order, n-grams sizes, vertex information and maximum hops for dependency parsing features.

These rankings provide explorers with an additional line of reasoning to complement conventional, geophysical and geochemical interpretation workflows. The approach shows potential to aid in identifying important criteria for distinguishing geological map units during early stage exploration. This can assist in directing subsequent expenditure towards the acquisition and further development of datasets which will be the most productive for mapping. In this case study, we use Random Forests to classify the lithology of a project in the Central African Copper-Belt, Zambia. The project area boasts extensive magnetic, radiometric, electromagnetic and multi-element geochemical coverage but only sparse geological observations. Under various training data paradigms, Random Forests produced a series of varying but closely related lithological maps. In this study, training data were restricted to outcrop, simulating the data available at the early stages of the project. Variable ranking highlighted those datasets which were of greatest importance to the result. Both geophysical and geochemical datasets were well represented in the highest ranking variables, reinforcing the importance of access to both data types. Further analysis showed that in many cases, the importance of high ranking datasets had a plausible geological explanation, often consistent with conventional interpretation.

Specifically, we first formulate a matrix completion problem to produce a complete parallel document-term matrix for all documents in two languages, and then induce a low dimensional cross-lingual document representation by applying latent semantic indexing on the obtained matrix. We use a projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the formulated matrix completion problem with convergence guarantees.

One key strength of ELM algorithm is that there is only one parameter, the number of hidden nodes, to be determined while it has the significantly low computational time required for training new classifiers and good generalization performance. However, there is no effective method for finding the proper and universal number of hidden nodes. In order to address this problem, we propose a self-adaptive extreme learning machine (SELM) algorithm. SELM algorithm determines self-adaptively the number of hidden nodes and constructs Gaussian function as activation functions of hidden nodes. And in this algorithm, rough set theory acts as the pre-treatment cell to eliminate the redundant attributes of data sets. Then, affinity propagation clustering (AP Clustering) is used to self-adaptively determine the number of hidden nodes, while the centers and widths of AP clustering are utilized to construct a Gaussian function in the hidden layer of SLFNs. Empirical study of SELM algorithm on several commonly used classification benchmark problems shows that the proposed algorithm can find the proper number of hidden nodes and construct compact network classifiers, comparing with traditional ELM algorithm.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-016-9409-5", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2341229363", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["40731222", "3211017", "12133270", "14802053", "37226394", "15589402", "116858", "6111332", "8715388", "12450925", "23155638", "13306516", "2891159", "5117817", "7310387", "6502291"], "inbound_citations": ["54450499", "37415944", "52898881", "52908897", "9866416", "126375418", "3540803"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3936439"}

Malaysia is one of the developing countries strives towards development and industrialization. Air pollution is becoming a major environmental issue in Malaysia due to the increasing number of vehicles, open burning, release of chemical toxics from factories. All these air pollutants have a big impact on human health as it is reflected in the increase of hospital admissions particularly the respiratory, cardiovascular diseases and also to the surrounding environment. This study focused on the formulation of Cumulative Index (CI), comparative analysis of the proposed CI with the existing Air Quality Index (AQI) and classify the classes of CI. Monthly data of five air quality parameters which are Carbon dioxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and Particular Matter less than 10 microns (PM10) in 37 monitoring stations for four years from 2013 to 2016 were gathered from Department of Environment (DOE). Microsoft Office Excel was used to run the AQI and CI. Thus, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed to classify CI. Classification classes are divided into two types which are good and harmful. This classification classes were derived from the helped by Rattle with R. The Radial Bias Function (RBF) is more accurate compared to Linear Function in order to classify the accuracy of the CI data. In a nutshell, from the research the classifier performs well to classify the quality of air.

However, the execution of random forest requests introducing manually the number of trees as a parameter user, which is considered as a major drawback of this method, since often the user did not find the optimal tree value.

The proposed system involves four main steps namely data collecting of ECG signal, pretreatment and denoising this data, feature extraction and classifying this signal using the enhanced random forest approach.

However, time-varying spatiotemporal dynamics and the nonlinear relationships between spatial points are currently not given much consideration in the existing data-driven modeling methods. Thus, accurately modeling a nonlinear DPS with time-varying spatiotemporal dynamics using these current methods is challenging. Here, we propose a spatiotemporal extreme learning machine (ELM) to accurately model time-varying and nonlinear DPSs. First, we develop the nonlinear spatial activation function to describe the nonlinear relationships between spatial points. As a result, in contrast to the traditional ELM method which is only used to model the temporal dynamics, the spatiotemporal ELM inherently takes the spatial information into consideration. Next, an online time coefficient model is developed, which accounts for the time-varying temporal dynamics of the DPS. After the integration of the spatial activation function with the time coefficient model, this modeling method is able to adapt to real-time spatiotemporal variation. Unlike the existing data-driven DPS modeling approaches, the proposed method has the capability to accurately represent the nonlinear relationships between spatial points and has the adaptive ability for modeling time-varying dynamics.

It calls upon the development from static graph signal studies to the joint space-time analysis. In this paper, we study the problem of learning graphs from time-varying graph signals. Based on the correlated properties in observed signals, a dynamic graph-based model is first presented, which particularly takes into account space-time interactions in signal representation. Considering the case that the time correlation pattern is unavailable, the graph learning problem is cast as a joint correlation detecting and graph refining problem. Then it is solved by the proposed correlation-aware and spatiotemporal smoothness-based graph learning method (CASTS), which novelly introduces the spatiotemporal smooth prior to the field of time-vertex signal analysis.

The aim of this study is to estimate the vulnerability under climate change of a localized and endemic tree species Pinus cembra that occurs in the alpine timberline. We used the Random Forest ensemble classifier and available bioclimatic and ecological data to model present and future suitable areas for P. cembra and estimate its current and future vulnerability. Future projections for years 2020, 2050 and 2080 were simulated using two IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios run under four global climate models. The suitability model described the optimal environmental conditions for P. cembra. Model scores (\u03ba = 0.77, sensitivity = 0.99 and specificity = 0.80) are robust. The main factors defining the model were Kira's warmth index and summer temperatures. Results show that there is potential for P. cembra to regenerate and persist in currently suitable areas. Future trends analysis suggested a cumulated mean loss of suitable areas of between 53% and 72% for different scenarios. All modeled projections predicted an upslope shift of the optimally suitable P. cembra belt and no downslope shift. We discuss environmental factors/plant interactions, the theoretical assumptions behind the model, model strengths and limitations, and we highlight the conservative traits of our analysis.

The trained model is then used to evaluate a separate set of testing data. There are two main ideas underlying the SVM for discriminant-type problems. The first is an optimum linear separating hyperplane that separates the data patterns. The second is the use of kernel functions to convert the original non-linear data patterns into the format that is linearly separable in a high-dimensional feature space. In this paper, an overview of the SVM, both one-class and two-class SVM methods, is first presented followed by its use in landslide susceptibility mapping. A study area was selected from the natural terrain of Hong Kong, and slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, profile curvature of slope, lithology, vegetation cover and topographic wetness index (TWI) were used as environmental parameters which influence the occurrence of landslides. One-class and two-class SVM models were trained and then used to map landslide susceptibility respectively. The resulting susceptibility maps obtained by the methods were compared to that obtained by the logistic regression (LR) method. It is concluded that two-class SVM possesses better prediction efficiency than logistic regression and one-class SVM. However, one-class SVM, which only requires failed cases, has an advantage over the other two methods as only \u201cfailed\u201d case information is usually available in landslide susceptibility mapping.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geomorph.2008.02.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Geomorphology", "mag_id": "2023203753", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["133268422", "11281068", "199093189", "135190463", "107680519", "56178893", "131663402", "209350566", "43224493", "52011463", "207818365", "203638936", "201838736", "39337875", "211019182", "215637310", "207812889", "208821147", "23571589", "133142463", "128624922", "17465280", "128660317", "69757343", "140725248", "128756567", "16619074", "73688927", "145817063", "116476989", "135065115", "134642527", "128557647", "55038662", "2053492", "135262555", "8905880", "19847346", "130236024", "134420733", "207815416", "134293519", "134030822", "129238688", "55059883", "203063294", "140188746", "128805600", "129375479", "132520268", "208171580", "199093939", "130342110", "128948172", "130754264", "204808232", "114279966", "210847160", "116347490", "55180969", "157367275", "211829722", "49579837", "135070992", "128749170", "201913775", "199091207", "129344165", "211196355", "129086692", "55851702", "150062714", "131953800", "35623519", "67760439", "68245778", "12714507", "132304249", "129350475", "134851944", "134308108", "129867359", "128681677", "150367159", "10126095", "134429207", "33974143", "134388907", "116025387", "133006267", "129176813", "73690828", "60664372", "128476601", "109786017", "17114820", "140178253", "210953907", "131577221", "134247645", "11821456", "133402210", "133140310", "33326955", "189870088", "134650602", "128685345", "134510772", "55953457", "30679671", "120550001", "215192333", "59486526", "195819160", "71152753", "209366057", "135172009", "7834178", "39373329", "26848991", "132567377", "134298673", "134298673", "59413056", "140564727", "130428257", "130577993", "21075255", "45681226", "134884981", "121310814", "128425461", "113401024", "198402197", "52884011", "144207356", "59328194", "209312519", "128833962", "145852570", "131835891", "153314649", "63033164", "29820708", "54553085"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129153900"}

The second concerns the combination techniques used to assemble multiple regressors or classifiers and the third concerns with the quantum of regressors or classifiers to be ensembled. Subsequently, the number of relevant studies scrutinising these previously mentioned concerns are limited. In this study, we performed an extensive comparative analysis of ensemble techniques such as boosting, bagging, blending and super learners (stacking).

SERS is an improved Raman spectroscopic technique, which can amplify spectral intensity by 103 to l07 times, to yield usable spectra of low concentration NS1 in saliva. The spectra produced contain 1801 features for each of the 284 samples collected.

They fit generative models by minimizing certain distance measure between the real image distribution and the generated data distribution. Several distance measures have been used, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-divergence, and Wasserstein distance, and choosing an appropriate distance measure is very important for training the generative network. In this paper, we choose to use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the distance metric, which has several nice theoretical guarantees. In fact, generative moment matching network (GMMN) (Li, Swersky, and Zemel 2015) is such a generative model which contains only one generator network $G$ trained by directly minimizing MMD between the real and generated distributions. However, it fails to generate meaningful samples on challenging benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and LSUN. To improve on GMMN, we propose to add an extra network $F$, called mapper. $F$ maps both real data distribution and generated data distribution from the original data space to a feature representation space $\\mathcal{R}$, and it is trained to maximize MMD between the two mapped distributions in $\\mathcal{R}$, while the generator $G$ tries to minimize the MMD. We call the new model generative adversarial mapping networks (GAMNs). We demonstrate that the adversarial mapper $F$ can help $G$ to better capture the underlying data distribution. We also show that GAMN significantly outperforms GMMN, and is also superior to or comparable with other state-of-the-art GAN based methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Bedrooms datasets.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1709.09820", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2756612184", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9127770", "10742222", "206594692", "5808102", "1302462", "18268744", "207763512", "4685015", "2207512", "8317437"], "inbound_citations": ["3532229"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27991985"}

In this paper, a new path planning algorithm for unstructured environments based on a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) is presented. Our method uses as its input an aerial image or an unfiltered auto-generated map of the area in which the robot will be moving. Given this, the algorithm is able to generate a graph showing all of the safe paths that a robot can follow. To do so, our algorithm takes advantage of the training stage of a MSVM, making it possible to obtain the set of paths that maximize the distance to the obstacles while minimizing the effect of measurement errors, yielding paths even when the input data are not sufficiently clear. The method also ensures that it is able to find a path, if it exists, and it is fully adaptable to map changes over time. The functionality of these features was assessed using tests, divided into simulated results and real-world tests. For the latter, four different scenarios were evaluated involving 500 tests each.

Class imbalance is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Pattern Recognition applications; therefore, these research communities have responded to such interest with literally dozens of methods and techniques. Surprisingly, there are still many fundamental open-ended questions such as \"Are all learning paradigms equally affected by class imbalance?\", \"What is the expected performance loss for different imbalance degrees?\" and \"How much of the performance losses can be recovered by the treatment methods?\". In this paper, we propose a simple experimental design to assess the performance of class imbalance treatment methods. This experimental setup uses real data sets with artificially modified class distributions to evaluate classifiers in a wide range of class imbalance. We employ such experimental design in a large-scale experimental evaluation with twenty-two data sets and seven learning algorithms from different paradigms. Our results indicate that the expected performance loss, as a percentage of the performance obtained with the balanced distribution, is quite modest (below 5%) for the most balanced distributions up to 10% of minority examples. However, the loss tends to increase quickly for higher degrees of class imbalance, reaching 20% for 1% of minority class examples. Support Vector Machine is the classifier paradigm that is less affected by class imbalance, being almost insensitive to all but the most imbalanced distributions. Finally, we show that the sampling algorithms only partially recover the performance losses. On average, typically about 30\\% or less of the performance that was lost due to class imbalance was recovered by random over-sampling and SMOTE.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2012.162", "venue": "2012 11th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journal": "2012 11th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2105180131", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15428347", "10776829", "1795112", "62808464", "16326925", "14972567", "206742563", "2344521", "59849738", "1554582", "18057117", "39321012", "2566941", "207155015", "2391953", "1212431", "8446587", "195705776", "5262555", "46265723", "6492502", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["214699587", "32230452", "214810361", "207801938", "17123336", "18090501", "17513719", "56822916", "189926850", "11934099", "68217976"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12669106"}

Second, their generalization performance is not guaranteed due to that fact that the solution of their objective functions is not global optimal solution. To solve these problems, we propose a novel sign prediction on unlabeled social networks using branch and bound optimized transfer learning (SP_BBTL) sign prediction model.

Different kinds of sub-graph structures, e.g., ring, star, linear, and hybrid have also been found in Protein-Protein Interaction Network (PPIN), therefore, more advance topological properties may be helpful to predict these structures. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of protein determines its formation, thus, the sequence information is important for predicting the interacting property among proteins in a secure way. In this study, we have computed basic as well as advance topological features by considering the interaction network of human protein complexes in the IoMT environment. In addition, biological features, i.e., discrete wavelet coefficients, length, and entropy from amino acid sequences of proteins have been computed. The supervised learning method based on association rules such as Partial Tree (PART) and Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) are trained to identify human protein complexes on the basis of integrated topological and biological properties. The 10-fold cross validation is exercised to measure the proposed methods. Experimental results show that association rule learners with integrated features outperform other complex mining algorithms, i.e., probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN), and Random Forest, in terms of accuracy and efficiency in addition to provide privacy.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963797", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2997698360", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59235678", "198146374", "139108150", "149781963", "133456898", "132093211", "181622572", "167222303", "65178512", "205210802", "6562956", "1007515", "663553", "1732896", "3591016", "9026084", "3259536", "1725973", "6924989", "10291802", "7544527", "10831466", "12144661", "785962", "30451570", "30193141", "13706706", "654543", "6934761", "23430057", "5262555", "6370985", "465240", "215034901", "205192960", "3757107", "16021423"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210695448"}

However, access to this profile data is scarce and limited due to its high cost of testing. As a result, some well blocks have tested some discontinuous profiles, but other well blocks do not have any profiles. Traditional machine learning can be applied to construct an intelligent surrogate model by training with historical injection profile. This well-trained model can be only used to make a good prediction for well blocks which contribute profile data, not applicable to well blocks without injection profile. In this study, a Joint Distribution Adaption based Extreme Gradient boosting transfer learning approach is presented to predict water absorption of sublayers in water injection well which do not have any injection profile. A handful of observations are obtained from source well block which has tested sufficient injection profiles. Joint Distribution Adaption is first conducted to transfer knowledge from source well block to the target well block which have no injection profile. The transferred dataset with new feature representation is used to constitute the training dataset for target well block. This transferred training dataset then can be feed into the Extreme Gradient Boosting model to construct a water absorption predictive model. The well-trained model can be applied to predicting water absorption of sublayers in injectors which do not have any water injection profile. The proposed approach is demonstrated by applying to two well blocks from SL oilfield, China.

In this paper, we suggest two novel discriminative approaches to the dynamic state prediction: 1) learning generative state-space models with discriminative objectives and 2) developing an undirected conditional model.

As big data processing is concerned, newly built cloud clusters meet the challenges of performance optimization focusing on faster task execution and more efficient usage of computing resources. Presently proposed approaches concentrate on temporal improvement, that is, shortening MapReduce time, but seldom focus on storage occupation; however, unbalanced cloud storage strategies could exhaust those nodes with heavy MapReduce cycles and further challenge the security and stability of the entire cluster. In this paper, an adaptive method is presented aiming at spatial-temporal efficiency in a heterogeneous cloud environment. A prediction model based on an optimized Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine algorithm is proposed for faster forecast of job execution duration and space occupation, which consequently facilitates the process of task scheduling through a multi-objective algorithm called time and space optimized NSGA-II TS-NSGA-II. Experiment results have shown that compared with the original load-balancing scheme, our approach can save approximate 47-55i\u00be\u017as averagely on each task execution. Simultaneously, 1.254i\u00be\u017a of differences on hard disk occupation were made among all scheduled reducers, which achieves 26.6% improvement over the original scheme.

The recent advancements in computerized solutions for these diagnoses are highly promising with improved accuracy and efficiency. In this article, we proposed a method for the classification of melanoma and benign skin lesions. Our approach integrates preprocessing, lesion segmentation, features extraction, features selection, and classification. Preprocessing is executed in the context of hair removal by DullRazor, whereas lesion texture and color information are utilized to enhance the lesion contrast. In lesion segmentation, a hybrid technique has been implemented and results are fused using additive law of probability. Serial based method is applied subsequently that extracts and fuses the traits such as color, texture, and HOG (shape). The fused features are selected afterwards by implementing a novel Boltzman Entropy method. Finally, the selected features are classified by Support Vector Machine. The proposed method is evaluated on publically available data set PH2. Our approach has provided promising results of sensitivity 97.7%, specificity 96.7%, accuracy 97.5%, and F-score 97.5%, which are significantly better than the results of existing methods available on the same data set.

While many studies in West Africa are conducted with coarse resolution earth observation data, few have tried to relate vegetation trends to explanatory factors, as is generally done in land use and land cover change (LULCC) studies at finer scales. In this study we proposed to make a bridge between vegetation trend analysis and LULCC studies to improve the understanding of the various factors that influence the biomass production changes observed in satellite time series (using integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] as a proxy). The study was conducted in two steps. In the first step we analyzed MODIS NDVI linear trends together with TRMM growing season rainfall over the Sahel region from 2000 to 2015. A classification scheme was proposed that enables better specification of the relative role of the main drivers of biomass production dynamics. We found that 16% of the Sahel is re-greening\u2014but found strong evidence that rainfall is not the only important driver of biomass increase. Moreover, a decrease found in 5% of the Sahel can be chiefly attributed to factors other than rainfall (88%). In the second step, we focused on the \u201cDegre Carre de Niamey\u201d site in Niger. Here, the observed biomass trends were analyzed in relation to land cover changes and a set of potential drivers of LULCC using the Random Forest algorithm. We observed negative trends (29% of the Niger site area) mainly in tiger bush areas located on lateritic plateaus, which are particularly prone to pressures from overgrazing and overlogging. The significant role of accessibility factors in biomass production trends was also highlighted. Our methodological framework may be used to highlight changing areas and their major drivers to identify target areas for more detailed studies.

A VPP optimal dispatch model is then formulated to achieve maximum utilization of renewable energy generation, which can take into account the constraints of electric power network and DERs. Based on the Gumbel-Copula joint distribution, the nonlinear functional relationship between the wind power cost and wind turbine output is approximated using ELM.

To display a rich set of haptic effects for both static and dynamic gestures, we integrated electromechanical and electrostatic actuation techniques effectively on tabletop surface of HapTable, which is a surface capacitive touch screen. We attached four piezo patches to the edges of tabletop to display vibrotactile feedback for static gestures.

In this paper, a new multiple radar subbands fusion algorithm in complex noise environment is proposed. The considered complex noise includes impulsive noise and the mixture of impulsive and Gaussian noises. The proposed subband fusion algorithm consists of the following steps. First, the incoherent factors are estimated and the multiple subbands are compensated to be mutually coherent. Then, coherent subbands are fit by the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) model, where model parameters are estimated in the frame of sparse reconstruction. Different probability distribution functions are used to describe different noise environments, and the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate of scattering model parameters is achieved. It is shown that the MAP estimate can be obtained by iteratively solving a support vector regression problem. Finally, the fused full band is obtained by extrapolating the measured subband data based on the estimated GTD model.

In contrast, actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically perform very poorly when grasping diverse objects, especially when learning from raw images and sparse rewards. To make these RL techniques feasible for vision-based grasping tasks, we employ state representation learning (SRL), where we encode essential information first for subsequent use in RL. However, typical representation learning procedures are unsuitable for extracting pertinent information for learning the grasping skill, because the visual inputs for representation learning, where a robot attempts to grasp a target object in clutter, are extremely complex. We found that preprocessing based on the disentanglement of a raw input image is the key to effectively capturing a compact representation. This enables deep RL to learn robotic grasping skills from highly varied and diverse visual inputs.

Since preliminary voxel segmentation tends to be less accurate at the boundary, and there are other non-liver tissue voxels with similar texture characteristics as liver parenchyma, morphological smoothing and 3D level set refinement are applied to enhance the accuracy of segmentation.

The Top Scoring Pair (TSP), k-Top Scoring Pairs (k-TSP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) are four popular classifiers that have comparable performance on multiple cancer datasets. SVM and PAM tend to use a large number of genes and TSP, k-TSP always use even number of genes. In addition, the selection of distinct gene pairs in k-TSP simply combined the pairs of top ranking genes without considering the fact that the gene set with best discrimination power may not be the combined pairs. The k-TSP algorithm also needs the user to specify an upper bound for the number of gene pairs. Here we introduce a computational algorithm to address the problems. The algorithm is named Chisquare-statistic-based Top Scoring Genes (Chi-TSG) classifier simplified as TSG.ResultsThe TSG classifier starts with the top two genes and sequentially adds additional gene into the candidate gene set to perform informative gene selection. The algorithm automatically reports the total number of informative genes selected with cross validation. We provide the algorithm for both binary and multi-class cancer classification. The algorithm was applied to 9 binary and 10 multi-class gene expression datasets involving human cancers. The TSG classifier outperforms TSP family classifiers by a big margin in most of the 19 datasets. In addition to improved accuracy, our classifier shares all the advantages of the TSP family classifiers including easy interpretation, invariant to monotone transformation, often selects a small number of informative genes allowing follow-up studies, resistant to sampling variations due to within sample operations.ConclusionsRedefining the scores for gene set and the classification rules in TSP family classifiers by incorporating the sample size information can lead to better selection of informative genes and classification accuracy.

First, it is predicted whether harvests occur on a plot in a given time period. Second, for plots on which harvests are predicted to occur, the harvested volume is predicted. This research addresses this second step. For forests with more than one species and/or forests with trees of varying dimensions, overall harvested volume predictions are not satisfactory and more detailed predictions are required. The study focuses on southwest Germany where diverse forest types are found. Predictions are conducted for plots on which harvests occurred in the 2002\u20132012 period. For each plot, harvest probabilities of sample trees are predicted and used to derive the harvested volume (m\u00b3 over bark in 10 years) per hectare. Random forests (RFs) have become popular prediction models as they define the interactions and relationships of variables in an automatized way. However, their suitability for predicting harvest probabilities for inventory sample trees is questionable and has not yet been examined. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are suitable in this context as they can account for the nested structure of tree-level data sets (trees nested in plots). It is unclear if RFs can cope with this data structure. This research aims to clarify this question by comparing two RFs\u2014an RF based on conditional inference trees (CTree-RF), and an RF based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF)\u2014with a GLMM. For this purpose, the models were fitted on training data and evaluated on an independent test set. Both RFs achieved better prediction results than the GLMM. Regarding plot-level harvested volumes per ha, they achieved higher variances explained (VEs) and significantly (p < 0.05) lower mean absolute residuals when compared to the GLMM. VEs were 0.38 (CTree-RF), 0.37 (CART-RF), and 0.31 (GLMM). Root means squared errors were 138.3, 139.9 and 145.5, respectively. The research demonstrates the suitability and advantages of RFs for predicting harvest decisions on the level of inventory sample trees. RFs can become important components within the generation of business-as-usual wood supply scenarios worldwide as they are able to learn and predict harvest decisions from NFIs in an automatized and self-adapting way.

A systematic comparison of the relations before and after the 2008 nancial crisis shows that the economic and nancial health of local governments has become markedly more diverse since the crisis began. The relation between the municipal bond yields and the economic and nancial health of the local governments has also become stronger because of the larger dierentiation among the local governments and hence larger signal to noise ratio, as well as closer scrutiny by market participants on the economic fundamentals of municipal governments.

Proper sign maintenance and inventory is therefore necessary. Sign inventory system is an essential tool for infrastructure management and maintenance. Currently, sign inventory is mostly conducted by human observation of the digital images of roadway scenes. Automated system would substantially improve the processing speed and accuracy of two key processing tasks, sign detection and sign classification, since the human observation of the large amount of images is tedious, error-prone and time-consuming. The research in this final report emphasizes on the study of the classification. Classification is to categorize signs into proper classes, which is important and also more difficult for automation in the automated sign inventory system. The most frequently used technique in previous research for classification is neural network. However, neural network has the local minimum problem. In addition, neural network lacks explainable inner theoretical rule which brings difficulty to fine tune the performance of the model. This research presents a method for sign classification which combines feature extraction, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and multi-class classification. SVM is a statistical learning method based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and structural minimum principle. It is supposed to overcome the aforementioned two drawbacks of neural network method. The feature extraction is accomplished by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which reduces the dimension of the image as well as keeping the most important features. Preliminary experimental result presented in the report demonstrates that the SVM method has potential to solve the road sign classification problem.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "612334456", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["17840216", "61087370", "124081552", "61289300", "18296555", "110392375", "30147164", "60844264", "62626841", "61997936", "60562755", "7138354", "106565344", "961425"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106914094"}

Traditional segmentation methods may cause problems of boundary leakage and \u201cweak\u201d local minima. This paper deals with the above mentioned problems. An improved detection method which combines a fuzzy integrated active contour model (FIACM)-based segmentation method, a segmentation refinement method based on Parametric Mixture Model (PMM) of juxta-vascular nodules, and a knowledge-based C-SVM (Cost-sensitive Support Vector Machines) classifier, is proposed for detecting various types of pulmonary nodules in computerized tomography (CT) images.

The fuzzy energy is used as the motivation power for the evolution of the active contour.

Compared with the classic GAN that {\\em globally} parameterizes a manifold, the Localized GAN (LGAN) uses local coordinate charts to parameterize distinct local geometry of how data points can transform at different locations on the manifold. Specifically, around each point there exists a {\\em local} generator that can produce data following diverse patterns of transformations on the manifold. The locality nature of LGAN enables local generators to adapt to and directly access the local geometry without need to invert the generator in a global GAN. Furthermore, it can prevent the manifold from being locally collapsed to a dimensionally deficient tangent subspace by imposing an orthonormality prior between tangents. This provides a geometric approach to alleviating mode collapse at least locally on the manifold by imposing independence between data transformations in different tangent directions. We will also demonstrate the LGAN can be applied to train a robust classifier that prefers locally consistent classification decisions on the manifold, and the resultant regularizer is closely related with the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

In ISH image annotations, the image content representation is crucial to achieve satisfactory results. However, existing methods mainly focus on improving the classification algorithms and only using simple visual descriptor. If we integrate the effective local and holistic visual descriptors via proper learning method, we can achieve more accurate image annotation results than using individual visual descriptor. We propose a novel structured sparsity-inducing norms based feature learning model to integrate the multi-dimensional visual descriptors for Drosophila gene expression patterns annotations.

The overall results suggest that using GS and PSO lead to build more accurate classifiers, and therefore can help oncologists to provide more accurate diagnosis.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-16187-3_12", "venue": "WorldCIST", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2930907319", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:93001047"}

Divergence is generally due to excessive observation noise and leads to error magnitudes that quickly become unbounded (R.J. Fitzgerald, 1971). When a filter diverges, it must be re initialised but because the observations are extremely poor, re initialised states will have poor estimates. The paper proposes that if neurofuzzy estimators produce more accurate state estimates than those calculated from the observed noisy inputs (using the known state model), then neurofuzzy estimates can be used to initialise the states of Kalman and extended Kalman filters.

However, the specific sites of modification on individual proteins, as well as the extent of glutarylation throughout the proteome, remain largely uncharacterized. Though informative, proteomic approaches based on mass spectrometry can be expensive, technically challenging and time-consuming. Therefore, the ability to predict glutarylation sites from protein primary sequences can complement proteomics analyses and help researchers study the characteristics and functional consequences of glutarylation. To this end, we used Random Forest (RF) machine learning strategies to identify the physiochemical and sequence-based features that correlated most substantially with glutarylation. We then used these features to develop a novel method to predict glutarylation sites from primary amino acid sequences using RF. Based on 10-fold cross-validation, the resulting algorithm, termed \u2018RF-GlutarySite\u2019, achieved efficiency scores of 75%, 81%, 68% and 0.50 with respect to accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP) and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively.

Results using both 10-fold cross validation and an independent test set were on par with or better than those achieved by existing glutarylation site predictors.

In order to learn the influence probabilities and simultaneously maximize the influence spread, we consider the tradeoff between exploiting the current estimation of the influence probabilities to ensure certain influence spread and exploring more nodes to learn better about the influence probabilities. The exploitation-exploration trade-off is the core issue in the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. If we regard the influence spread as the reward, then the IM problem could be reduced to the combinatorial multi-armed bandits. At each round, the learner selects a limited number of seed nodes in the social network, then the influence spreads over the network according to the real influence probabilities. The learner could observe the activation status of the edge if and only if its start node is influenced, which is referred to as the edge-level semi-bandit feedback. Two classical bandit algorithms including Thompson Sampling and Epsilon Greedy are used to solve this combinatorial problem. To ensure the robustness of these two algorithms, we use an automatic ensemble learning strategy, which combines the exploration strategy with exploitation strategy.

The respiration status has been measured in various ways in the medical and healthcare sectors. Contact type sensors were conventionally used to measure respiration. The contact type sensors have been used primarily in the medical sector, because they can be only used in a limited environment. Recent studies have evaluated the ways of detecting human respiration patterns using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Radar, which relies on non-contact type sensors. Previous studies evaluated the apnea pattern during sleep by analyzing the respiration signals acquired by UWB Radar using a principal component analysis (PCA). However, it is necessary to measure various respiration patterns in addition to apnea in order to accurately analyze the health condition of an individual in the healthcare sector. Therefore, this study proposed a method to recognize four respiration patterns based on the 1D convolutional neural network from the respiration signals acquired from UWB Radar. The proposed method extracts the eupnea, bradypnea, tachypnea, and apnea respiration patterns from UWB Radar and composes a learning dataset. The proposed method learned data through 1D CNN and the recognition accuracy was measured.

Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), as a domain discrepancy metric, has achieved promising performance in unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). We argue that MMD-based DA methods ignore the data locality structure, which, to some extent, would cause the negative transfer effect. The locality plays an important role in minimizing the nonlinear local domain discrepancy underlying the marginal distributions. For better exploiting the domain locality, a novel local generative discrepancy metric (LGDM) based intermediate domain generation learning called Manifold Criterion guided Transfer Learning (MCTL) is proposed in this paper. The merits of the proposed MCTL are four-fold: 1) the concept of manifold criterion (MC) is first proposed as a measure validating the distribution matching across domains, and domain adaptation is achieved if the MC is satisfied; 2) the proposed MC can well guide the generation of the intermediate domain sharing similar distribution with the target domain, by minimizing the local domain discrepancy; 3) a global generative discrepancy metric (GGDM) is presented, such that both the global and local discrepancy can be effectively and positively reduced; 4) a simplified version of MCTL called MCTL-S is presented under a perfect domain generation assumption for more generic learning scenario. Experiments on a number of benchmark visual transfer tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed manifold criterion guided generative transfer method, by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.

Despite the good accuracies obtained with single modalities, these systems are more susceptible to attacks, i.e, spoofing attacks, and noises of all kinds, especially in non-cooperative (in-the-wild) environments. Since non-cooperative environments are becoming more and more common, new approaches involving multi-modal biometrics have received more attention. One challenge in multimodal biometric systems is how to integrate the data from different modalities. Initially, we propose a deep transfer learning optimized from a model trained for face recognition achieving outstanding representation for only iris modality. Our feature level fusion by means of features selection targets the use of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for such aims. In our pool, we have the proposed iris fine-tuned representation and a periocular one from previous work of us. We compare this approach for fusion in feature level against three basic function rules for matching at score level: sum, multi, and min.

The regulation of sexual dimorphism in this species is not yet fully understood. According to current knowledge, the sex of zebrafish is determined genetically on the basis of a polygenic sex determination system. In this system the interaction of genetic and environmental factors contributes to determine the sexual fate of an organism. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the effects of high ambient temperature, as one of the major environmental factors, in interaction with the genome on sexual plasticity and phenotypic traits of zebrafish. ::: Chapter 1 introduces a general overview of sexual diversity in teleost fish and explains the main features of sex determination and gonad differentiation mechanisms in zebrafish. The sexual selection theory in relation to the reproductive success and the effect of environment on secondary sexual traits is generally described. ::: In chapter 2, the phenotypic plasticity of zebrafish in response to increased water temperature is investigated. The study was designed to test the influence of transient temperature perturbations during the thermosensitive embryonic developmental period (from gastrula to pharyngula) in a high number of families (69 families) on various biological functions. The physiological response to the high ambient temperature revealed a lower hatchability and survival ability during embryonic and post-embryonic development. The results of survival trajectories until adulthood demonstrated that in zebrafish the life stages most sensitive to thermal changes are the first day after fertilization and the first two weeks after hatching. Consideration of the effect of temperature on morphometric traits (weight and length) in order to investigate the temperature \u00d7 sex interaction effect indicated a higher growth performance in temperature-treated animals at different time points of adulthood development. A heat-induced masculinization was clearly observed across all families, while a wide range of interfamily sex ratio variations was detected. These observations emphasize a genetic \u00d7 environment (G\u00d7E) interaction of sex determination and constitute a strong confirmation for a polygenic sex determination system in zebrafish. ::: In chapter 3, a fully automated phenotypic sex classification in zebrafish was established for the first time using two different machine learning methods: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Based on phenotypic characteristics, a high accuracy of sex differentiation was obtained using these two methods in non-heat-treated groups. However, in treated animals, some males were misclassified using SVM due to reduced pigmentation intensity, suggesting these animals were probably masculinized females. Investigation of the colour intensity of the caudal fin using SVM shows that males exhibited a higher pigmentation intensity compared to females. Furthermore, a positive association of male caudal fin colouration with the morphometric traits (weight and length) was determined. These results imply the effect of temperature on secondary phenotypic sexual characteristics, which in turn may influence the sexual attractiveness for mating and reproductive success. ::: Phenotypic modifications in response to different environmental conditions indicate the changes in the expression of genes responsible for those traits. Hence chapter 4 examines, whether the sex and colour genes are differentially expressed in the two sexes with respect to the observed sexually dimorphic in the caudal fin colouration. This hypothesis is derived from chapter 3, where the sexually differing colour intensity in the caudal fin of the two sexes was detected. Therefore, a transcriptome analysis of caudal fins and gonads was performed in chapter 4 in order to identify the differentially expressed genes and pathways regulating sexual dimorphism in interaction with high water temperature. In addition, the mechanism of gene expression in the masculinization process, as one of the most important consequences of increased temperature, was studied in this chapter. A significantly differentiated expression of sex determination and colour pattern genes was identified in the gonad. In the caudal fin, a high expression magnitude of a set of colour pattern genes was observed, although they were not differentially expressed in two sexes of adult fish. The enrichment of a subset of pathways containing sex and colour genes provides an evidence of the involvement of those genes in the regulation of phenotypic sexual dimorphism in zebrafish. These results led to additional analyses in chapter 5 examining the validity of this hypothesis. ::: In chapter 5, the topics of previous chapters are first discussed in more detail, and then the hypothesis of chapter 4 is further investigated by pathway analysis, gene interaction networks and transcription factor analysis.

Many algorithms involve an eigenvector or singular value decomposition (SVD) procedure on a similarity matrix of size n \u00d7n, where n denotes the number of data samples, making them not scalable to big data. A method to overcome large data set size is to create a manifold with a subset of the original data while embedding the rest into the manifold skeleton. An adequate number of neighbors varies and depends on the geometry of the manifold. Points that contain too few neighbors may not be able to encompass the intrinsic manifold geometry. Conversely, too many neighbors will cause a short circuit in the manifold. To overcome these problems, we introduce a novel adaptive neighbor selection approach using l1 optimization.

The way the attacker attacks the system differs from one attacker to the other. The sequence of attack or the signature of an attacker should be stored, analyzed and used to generate rules for mitigating future attack attempts. We have deployed honeypot to record the activities of the attacker. While the attacker prepares for an attack, the IDS redirects him to the honeypot. We make the attacker believe that he is working with the actual system. The activities related to the attack are recorded by the honeypot by interacting with the intruder. The recorded activities are analyzed by the network administrator, and the rule database is updated. As a result, we improve the detection accuracy and security of the system using honeypot without any loss or damage to the original system. As the number of threats to the information is increasing, there is a need for a powerful intrusion detection system that can actually fulfil the requirement of security against the threat. This type of security can be achieved by identifying the particular type of attack. The classification of attack activities ensures the efficient countermeasure for the attack. The work focuses on the classification of attack using multiclass support vector machine approach. The support vector machine is used for binary classification. This approach is extended to the multiclass classification of attack with improved accuracy of classification. We have used three benchmark datasets for training and testing purpose: KDD corrected dataset, NSLKDD dataset, Gure KDD dataset. We have also compared the results with existing work.

Due to many lifestyle factors, it is difficult to precisely predict how individuals may look with advancing years or how they looked with \"retreating\" years.

The method requires only one input image of a subject and produces an age progressed or regressed image of the person at a particular target age. To implement this training-based approach, over 800 high quality facial images ranging from 15 years to 99 years in age were collected from the Internet. After normalization, these data were used to train a Support Vector Regression Machine (SVM) to derive an age prediction function \u2013 a relationship between a facial image and its corresponding age. Signature images for a set of small age groups from our database were then created. Using these signature images as age prototypes, as well as the determined age prediction function, we then present a new age simulation technique. The proposed method preserves the identity of the subject while enforcing a realistic simulation of aging effects on adult facial images between 20 and 90 years old.

The pyramid idea can model temporal relationships. One of the problems of Support Vector Machine to classify words is its inability to model temporal relationships unlike hidden Markov models. Using the BOW-based pyramid idea in the extraction of the display containing temporal information of voice, the SVM can be given the capability of considering the time relationships of speech frames.

This fosters the necessity to identify prognostic biomarkers, in order to optimize treatment and diminish unnecessary suffering of patients. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic biomarkers for high-grade glioma patients. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Eleven proteins were selected for analysis due to their suggested importance for survival of patients with other types of cancers and due to a high variation in protein levels between glioma patients (according to the Human Protein Atlas, www.proteinatlas.org). Protein expression patterns of these 11 proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from 97 high-grade glioma patients. The prognostic values of the proteins were analyzed with univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses for the high-grade glioma patients, including subgroup analyses of histological subtypes and immunohistochemically defined molecular subtypes. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The proteins with the most significant (univariate and multivariate p<0.05) correlations were analyzed further with cross-validated Kaplan-Meier analyses for the possibility of predicting survival based on the protein expression pattern of the corresponding candidate. Random Forest classification with variable subset selection was used to analyze if a protein signature consisting of any combination of the 11 proteins could predict survival for the high-grade glioma patients and the subgroup with glioblastoma patients. The proteins which correlated most significantly (univariate and multivariate p<0.05) to survival in the Cox regression analyses were Myc for all high-grade gliomas and FGF2, CA9 and CD44 for the subgroup of proneural gliomas, with FGF2 having a strong negative predictive value for survival.

Our method is based on the Wavelet Packet (WP) decomposition and the choice of a best basis for classification purpose. Before classification, there is a need to detect events in the recorded signals. The discrimination criterion is based on the calculation of the ratio between intra-class variance and total variance (sum of the intra-class and inter-class variances), calculated directly from the coefficients of the selected WP. We evaluated the performance of the algorithm on real signals by using the classification methods Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

An approach to a soil-structure interaction problem is using data-based methods (DBM's) that benefit from developing mathematical models on the experimental data. A mathematical model for the seismic analysis of soil-pile-structure (SPS) systems is built in the neural networks environment based on the existing experimental data. A network consisting of two hidden layers is proved to be the most efficient among other choices. Three sets of data are utilized for training, testing, and validation of the ANN model to avoid over fitting by cross-validation. The accuracy of the neural networks to predict the seismic behavior is enhanced by the parallel vectorial analysis technique of the support vector machines. It is shown that the model can predict the dynamic characteristics and seismic response of the soil-structure system with good accuracy in much less time compared with the finite element method.

As for potentials, both local and global feature functions are learned using joint boosting whereas a likelihood ratio is learned to derive the pairwise edge potential.

Understanding these collections could be done via their user-supplied metadata or via text analysis, but the metadata is applied inconsistently between collections and some Archive-It collections consist of hundreds of thousands of seeds, making it costly in terms of time to download each memento.

We adapt the concept of the collection growth curve for understanding Archive-It collection curation and crawling behavior. We also introduce several seed features and come to an understanding of the diversity of resources that make up a collection. Finally, we use the descriptions of each collection to identify four semantic categories of Archive-It collections. Using the identified structural features, we reviewed the results of runs with 20 classifiers and are able to predict the semantic category of a collection using a Random Forest classifier with a weighted average F1 score of 0.720, thus bridging the structural to the descriptive.

Semi-supervised learning leverages the large amount of unlabeled data in developing effective classifiers. Feature subspace learning finds optimal feature subspaces for representing data and helping classification. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, Locality Preserving Semi-supervised Support Vector Machines (LPSSVM), to jointly learn an optimal feature subspace as well as a large margin SVM classifier. Over both labeled and unlabeled data, an optimal feature subspace is learned that can maintain the smoothness of local neighborhoods as well as being discriminative for classification. Simultaneously, an SVM classifier is optimized in the learned feature subspace to have large margin. The resulting classifier can be readily used to handle unseen test data. Additionally, we show that the LPSSVM algorithm can be used in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space for nonlinear classification. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm over four types of data sets: a toy problem, two UCI data sets, the Caltech 101 data set for image classification, and the challenging Kodak's consumer video data set for semantic concept detection.

We conducted studies at the highly dissected Tar Hollow State Forest (THSF) in southeastern Ohio USA, where Ailanthus is widely distributed within the forest, harvests have been ongoing for decades, and prescribed fire had been applied to about a quarter of the study area. Our intention was to develop models to evaluate the relationship of Ailanthus presence to prescribed fire, harvesting activity, and other landscape characteristics, using this Ohio location as a case study. Field assessments of the demography of Ailanthus and other stand attributes (e.g., fire, harvesting, stand structure) were conducted on 267 sample plots on a 400-m grid throughout THSF, supplemented by identification of Ailanthus seed-sources via digital aerial sketch mapping during the dormant season. Statistical modeling tools Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Maxent were used to assess relationships among attributes, then model habitats suitable for Ailanthus presence. In all, 41 variables were considered in the models, including variables related to management activities, soil characteristics, topography, and vegetation structure (derived from LiDAR). The most important predictor of Ailanthus presence was some measure of recent timber harvest, either mapped harvest history (CART) or LiDAR-derived canopy height (Maxent). Importantly, neither prescribed fire or soil variables appeared as important predictors of Ailanthus presence or absence in any of the models of the THSF. These modeling techniques provide tools and methodologies for assessing landscapes for Ailanthus invasion, as well as those areas with higher potentials for invasion should seed sources become available.

We proposed a generalized linear stochastic model (GLSM) for forecasting the weekly and monthly Urmia lake water levels, the sixth-largest saltwater lake on Earth. In this methodology, three approaches are defined to pre-process data. The first approach is merely based on the differencing method, while the second and third are a one-step (the combination of de-trending with standardization and spectral analysis) and two-step (the combination of the 2nd approach with normalization transform) preprocessing, respectively. A thorough comparison of the GLSM results with eminence nonlinear AI models (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems, ANFIS, Multilayer Perceptron, MLP, Gene Expression Programming, GEP, Support Vector Machine with Firefly algorithm, SVM-FFA, and Artificial Neural Networks ANN) showed that by using an appropriate method that delivers accurate information of the entailing terms in time series, it is possible to model Urmia lake level with acceptable precision.

Our idea is intuitive but proven to be very effective, especially in addressing some key limitations of GAN. In essence, it combines the Kullback-Leibler (KL) and reverse KL divergences into a unified objective function, thus it exploits the complementary statistical properties from these divergences to effectively diversify the estimated density in capturing multi-modes. We term our method dual discriminator generative adversarial nets (D2GAN) which, unlike GAN, has two discriminators; and together with a generator, it also has the analogy of a minimax game, wherein a discriminator rewards high scores for samples from data distribution whilst another discriminator, conversely, favoring data from the generator, and the generator produces data to fool both two discriminators.

A computer aided diagnostic system is proposed to identify the disc bulge in axial lumbar spine MR images. A new EM based segmentation method is applied to segment the Intervertebral Disc (IVD) from the axial slice of T2-weighted MRI. After segmentation, the features are extracted by executing Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and a novel feature descriptor called as Intervertebral disc Descriptor (IdD). The features obtained are trained by Support Vector Machine(SVM). In this work, T2-weighted axial slices of lumbar MR images for 93 patients are used for evaluation. The proposed framework is trained, tested and validated on 675 clinical axial MR images of 93 patients, in which 184 are normal, 55 are herniated, and 436 are bulged images. On applying the proposed system, an accuracy of 92.78% is obtained for classifying normal and bulge and compared with different classifiers such as k-nn, decision trees and feed forward neural network. This model produces high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f-score to detect bulge in the MRI.

The appearance of a human face changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intraclass variations. As opposed to current techniques for ageinvariant face recognition, which either directly extract ageinvariant features for recognition, or first synthesize a face that matches target age before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end, we propose a deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three distinct novelties. First, AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture jointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual boosting way. Second, AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with remarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties, avoiding the requirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third, we develop effective and novel training strategies for end-to-end learning the whole deep architecture, which generates powerful age-invariant face representations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Extensive experiments on several cross-age datasets (MORPH, CACD and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts.

Establishing a molecular level screening method to detect BOS-related proteome changes before its diagnosis by forced expiratory volume surrogate marker criteria was the main objective of this study. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 82 lung transplant recipients (48/34 with/without known BOS development) at different time points between 12 and 48 months after lung transplantation. A mass spectrometry-based method was devised to generate bronchoalveolar lavage fluid proteome profiles that were screened for BOS-specific alterations. Statistically significant marker peptides and proteins were identified and validated by in-gel digestion, tandem mass spectrometric sequencing, and quantitative immunoassays. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Among the panel of statistically significant markers were Clara cell protein, calgranulin A, human neutrophil peptides, and the antimicrobial agent histatin. To assess their clinical relevance, a highly sensitive and specific classifier model was developed. Positive BOS classification by monitoring of seven polypeptides correlated strongly with a significant decrease in BOS-free time. Thus, it was possible to detect high-risk patients early on in the pathogenetic process. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Monitoring the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of seven polypeptides detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry allows a reliable prediction of early BOS using a Random Forest decision tree-based classifier model.

So, the aim of this study was to determine whether a two-dimensional imaging system could be used for lateral and sternal lying posture detection in grouped pigs under commercial farm conditions. An image processing algorithm with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was applied in this work. Pigs were monitored by top view RGB cameras and animals were extracted from their background using a background subtracting method. Based on the binary image properties, the boundaries and convex hull of each animal were found. In order to determine their lying posture, the area and perimeter of each boundary and convex hull were calculated in lateral and sternal lying postures as inputs for training of a linear SVM classifier. The trained SVM was then used to detect the target postures in binary images.

The SVM constructs a classifier by generating a decision surface, namely the optimal separating hyper-plane, to partition different categories of data points in the vector space. The concept of the optimal separating hyper-plane can be generalized for the non-linearly separable cases by introducing kernel functions to map the data points from the input space into a high dimensional feature space so that they could be separated by a linear hyper-plane. This characteristic causes the implementation of different kernel functions to have a high impact on the classification accuracy of the SVM. Other than the kernel functions, the value of soft margin parameter, C is another critical component in determining the performance of the SVM classifier. Hence, one of the critical problems of the conventional SVM classification framework is the necessity of determining the appropriate kernel function and the appropriate value of parameter C for different datasets of varying characteristics, in order to guarantee high accuracy of the classifier. In this paper, we introduce a distance measurement technique, using the Euclidean distance function to replace the optimal separating hyper-plane as the classification decision making function in the SVM. In our approach, the support vectors for each category are identified from the training data points during training phase using the SVM. In the classification phase, when a new data point is mapped into the original vector space, the average distances between the new data point and the support vectors from different categories are measured using the Euclidean distance function.

Within the fields of user profiling and Web personalization several popular content filtering techniques have been developed. In this chapter we present one of such techniques -- collaborative filtering. Apart from giving an overview of collaborative filtering approaches, we present the experimental results of confronting the \u03ba-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm with Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the collaborative filtering framework using datasets with different properties. While the \u03ba-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is usually used for collaborative filtering tasks, Support Vector Machine is considered a state-of-the-art classification algorithm. Since collaborative filtering can also be interpreted as a classification/regression task, virtually any supervised learning algorithm (such as SVM) can also be applied.

In this paper, we provide an extensive evaluation that gives insight into how each of these aspects (multicue, multimodality, and strong MV classifier) affect accuracy both individually and when integrated together. In the multimodality component, we explore the fusion of RGB and depth maps obtained by high-definition light detection and ranging, a type of modality that is starting to receive increasing attention. As our analysis reveals, although all the aforementioned aspects significantly help in improving the accuracy, the fusion of visible spectrum and depth information allows to boost the accuracy by a much larger margin.

We evaluate our approach using multiple scenarios on several publicly available datasets, where the number of identities varies from 28 to 191 and the number of images ranges between 1003 and 36 171.

The smaller the window is, the harder for the texture classifier to recognize it. On the other hand, using smaller windows reduce the processing power requirements and make it easier to localize defects or segment textures. Consequently, the aim of this article is to evaluate the performance of popular texture classifiers on different window sizes.

Because of its importance, several computational methods for fold recognition have been proposed. Most of them are based on well-known machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), etc. Although these machine learning methods play a role in stimulating the development of this important area, new techniques are still needed to further improve the predictive performance for fold recognition. Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC) has been widely used in image processing, and shows better performance than other related machine learning methods. In this study, we apply the SRC to solve the protein fold recognition problem. Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset show that the proposed method is able to improve the performance of some basic classifiers and three state-of-the-art methods to feature selection, including autocross-covariance (ACC) fold, D-D, and Bi-gram. Finally, we propose a novel computational predictor called MF-SRC for fold recognition by combining these three features into the framework of SRC to achieve further performance improvement. Compared with other computational methods in this field on DD dataset, EDD dataset and TG dataset, the proposed method achieves stable performance by reducing the influence of the noise in the dataset.

As such, many users select cloud services based on description alone. An emerging alternative is to use a decision support system (DSS), which typically relies on gaining insights from observational data in order to assist a customer in making decisions regarding optimal deployment or redeployment of cloud applications. The primary activity of such systems is the generation of a prediction model (e.g. using machine learning), which requires a significantly large amount of training data. However, considering the varying architectures of applications, cloud providers, and cloud offerings, this activity is not sustainable as it incurs additional time and cost to collect training data and subsequently train the models. We overcome this through developing a Transfer Learning (TL) approach where the knowledge (in the form of the prediction model and associated data set) gained from running an application on a particular cloud infrastructure is transferred in order to substantially reduce the overhead of building new models for the performance of new applications and/or cloud infrastructures. In this paper, we present our approach and evaluate it through extensive experimentation involving three real world applications over two major public cloud providers, namely Amazon and Google. Our evaluation shows that our novel two-mode TL scheme increases overall efficiency with a factor of 60\\% reduction in the time and cost of generating a new prediction model.

O-GlcNAcylation is an O-linked glycosylation with attachment of \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to Ser/Thr residues catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGA), whose removal is catalyzed by O-GlcNAcase. Unlike mucin-type O-glycosylation, O-GlcNAcylation occurs primarily in nucleocytoplasmic proteins and the monosaccharide is not further extended. Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation is dynamic and often reciprocal to phosphorylation at the same or adjacent Ser/Thr residues. Growing evidences suggest that O-GlcNAcylation is very common and has broad roles in physiology as well as in diseases especially through its interplay with phosphorylation, e.g., regulation of insulin signaling, transcription, and roles in diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. In contrast to the enormous body of research on cellular roles of phosphorylation, the amount of research on O-GlcNAcylation has been disproportionally small and annotation of O-GlcNAcylated sites in protein databases is currently scarce. An O-GlcNAcylation site prediction program was developed in 2002, but it was based on a small data set with 40 O-GlcNAcylation sites known at that time. Here we seek to develop a database of O-GlcNAcylated proteins and sites, named dbOGAP, and also an O-GlcNAcylated site prediction system based on known sites data in dbOGAP to facilitate annotation and proteomic identification of the O-GlcNAcylation sites. We developed dbOGAP based primarily on O-GlcNAcylated proteins and sites published in peer-reviewed articles dated back to 1984 since it was first described. Most of these proteins were mapped to the UniProtKB protein IDs, except for some that could not be unambiguously mapped. The database currently contains 540 protein entries with experimental O-GlcNAcylation information, and 338 O-GlcNAc sites for 164 proteins. About 59% of these proteins are of humans, and other organisms include rat, mouse, fly and African frog. Among 164 proteins with known O-GlcNAcylation sites, 122 also have both phosphorylation (total 1634) and O-GlcNAc sites (total 263). The Gene Ontology (GO) profiling showed that the known O-GlcNAcylated proteins have a broad range of functions including developmental process, transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, metabolic regulation, and cellular transport and trafficking. The GO profile also showed that O-GlcNAcylated proteins are primarily nuclear and cytoplasmic, including membrane-associated intracellular proteins. The database is also populated with additional orthologous protein sequences to known O-GlcNAcylated proteins. Additional functional data, including other PTM features, biological pathways and disease information have been integrated to the database. We developed an O-GlcNAcylation site prediction program using Support Vector Machine (SVM). As positive instances, sequence fragments surrounding 322 O-GlcNAcylated Ser/Thr sites were extracted from 157 proteins in dbOGAP, and over 28 thousand sequence fragments surrounding the rest of the Ser/Thr sites in those proteins were assumed as negative instances. Two thirds of this data set was randomly selected as development data and was used for tuning parameters in SVM classifiers, while the rest of the data was set apart as a held-out test data set. To reduce the impact of imbalanced data on the performance of trained classifiers, we explored different ratio of positive to negative instances in a training data set, which was controlled by under-sampling negative instances in a training data set. The optimal parameters of the prediction system were sought in five-fold cross-validation tests conducted on the development data set, and the final classifier trained on the entire development data set was evaluated on the held-out test data set. We used four encoding methods for feature vector extraction, including binary encoding, composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP), monomer spectrum (MS), and composition of monomer spectrum (CMS). These encoding methods yielded different prediction performance for O-GlcNAcylation sites. The results showed that the method obtained an AUC (area under curve) of ~80% on the test sequence set. The dbOGAP database and the O-GlcNAcylation site prediction program tool are being made web accessible and the web resource will be an important bioinformatics tool to facilitate exploration of the broad roles of O-GlcNAcylation in physiology and diseases.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIBMW.2009.5332094", "venue": "2009 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshop", "journal": "2009 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshop", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2008203128", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:677942"}

As the digital modulation signal, the multi-carrier amplitude shift keying (MC-ASK), frequency shift keying (MC-FSK), and phase shift keying (MC-PSK) modulation types are employed. In the first step, the feature extraction process has been conducted from the raw digital modulation signals and thereby extracted time, frequency, and time-frequency domain features from the multi-carrier ASK, FSK, and PSK signals. After that, these features have been weighted by using NCMBFW. Finally, classifier algorithms including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), AdaBoostM1, and Random Forest, have been used to determine the types of digital modulation signals automatically. Many metrics are used to evaluate the performance in the experiments.

To model the randomness of language spreading, we propose the Batch Markov Monte Carlo Simulation with Migration(BMMCSM) algorithm, in which each agent is treated as a language stack. The agent learns languages and migrates based on the proposed Batch Markov Property according to the transition matrix T and migration matrix M. Since population plays a crucial role in language spreading, we also introduce the Mortality and Fertility Mechanism, which controls the birth and death of the simulated agents, into the BMMCSM algorithm. The simulation results of BMMCSM show that the numerical and geographic distribution of languages varies across the time. The change of distribution fits the world cultural and economic development trend. Next, when we construct Matrix T, there are some entries of T can be directly calculated from historical statistics while some entries of T is unknown. Thus, the key to the success of the BMMCSM lies in the accurate estimation of transition matrix T by estimating the unknown entries of T under the supervision of the known entries. To achieve this, we first construct a 20 by 20 by 5 factor tensor X to characterize each entry of T. Then we train a Random Forest Regressor on the known entries of T and use the trained regressor to predict the unknown entries.

However, in reality, time-series data usually exhibit some kind of time-varying characteristic, which may lead to a wide variability between old data and new data. Hence, how to transfer knowledge over a long time span, when addressing time series prediction issues, poses serious challenges. To solve this problem, in this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on transfer learning, Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with Kernels (OS-ELMK), and ensemble learning, abbreviated as TrEnOS-ELMK, is proposed, along with its precise mathematic derivation. It aims to make the most of, rather than discard, the adequate long-ago data, and constructs an algorithm framework for transfer learning in time series forecasting, which is groundbreaking. Inspired by the preferable performance of models ensemble, ensemble learning scheme is also incorporated into our proposed algorithm, where the weights of the constituent models are adaptively updated according to their performances on fresh samples. Compared to many existing time series prediction methods, the newly proposed algorithm takes long-ago data into consideration and can effectively leverage the latent knowledge implied in these data for current prediction. In addition, TrEnOS-ELMK naturally inherits merits of both OS-ELMK and ensemble learning due to its incorporation of the two techniques. Experimental results on three synthetic and six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2018.05.021", "venue": "Knowl.

To encode the discriminative ability of set covariance matrices, we elaborately design two different loss functions, which respectively lead to two different representation learning schemes, i.e., the Graph Embedding scheme and the Softmax Regression scheme. Both schemes optimize the whole network containing both image representation mapping and set model classification in a joint learning manner. The proposed method is extensively validated on three challenging and large scale databases for the task of face recognition with image sets, i.e., YouTube Celebrities, YouTube Face DB and Point-and-Shoot Challenge.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2017.609", "venue": "2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2745398842", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1871558", "15514260", "1684237", "12972240", "9189303", "1464457", "16880444", "2820314", "11563357", "3071177", "1246787", "14119285", "1872039", "15664892", "7444242", "2895533", "6901717", "17510114", "1799558", "4966996", "9776222", "15175276", "1543125", "11843115", "15637053", "4637184", "206592766", "15164089", "1395439", "206592295", "10611748", "11746742", "16167569", "5831790", "16569745", "108422", "15736175", "54434063", "9898157", "17342425", "2426049", "15600652", "1433575"], "inbound_citations": ["199453117", "68121482", "133604252", "54219314", "53082626", "133606883", "52840060", "53779973", "3988396", "202689768", "53033931", "13711357", "44152068", "208299937"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4951133"}

This thesis extends the empirical evaluation to emotion classification tasks in the literary domain. This study selects two literary text classification problems---the eroticism classification in Dickinson's poems and the sentimentalism classification in early American novels---as two cases for this evaluation. Both problems focus on identifying certain kinds of emotion---a document property other than topic. This study chooses two popular text classification algorithms---naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and three feature engineering options---stemming, stopword removal and statistical feature selection (Odds Ratio and SVM)---as the subjects of evaluation. This study aims to examine the effects of the chosen classifiers and feature engineering options on the two emotion classification problems, and the interaction between the classifiers and the feature engineering options. ::: This thesis seeks empirical answers to the following research questions: (1) is SVM a better classifier than naive Bayes regarding classification accuracy, new literary knowledge discovery and potential for example-based retrieval? (2) is SVM a better feature selection method than Odds Ratio regarding feature reduction rate and classification accuracy improvement? (3) does stop word removal affect the classification performance? (4) does stemming affect the performance of classifiers and feature selection methods? ::: Some of our conclusions are consistent with what are obtained in topic classification, such as Odds Ratio does not improve SVM performance and stop word removal might harm classification. Some conclusions contradict previous results, such as SVM does not beat naive Bayes in both cases. Some findings are new to this area---SVM and naive Bayes select top features in different frequency ranges; stemming might harm feature selection methods. These experiment results provide new insights to the relation between classification methods, feature engineering options and non-topic document properties.

Classification on medical data raises several problems such as class imbalance, double meaning of missing data, volumetry or need of highly interpretable results. In this paper a new algorithm is proposed: MOCA-I (Multi-Objective Classification Algorithm for Imbalanced data), a multi-objective local search algorithm that is conceived to deal with these issues all together. It is based on a new modelization as a Pittsburgh multi-objective partial classification rule mining problem, which is described in the first part of this paper. An existing dominance-based multi-objective local search (DMLS) is modified to deal with this modelization. After experimentally tuning the parameters of MOCA-I and determining which version of DMLS algorithm is the most effective, the obtained MOCA-I version is compared to several state-of-the-art classification algorithms.

A statistical learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), has recently been explored for the prediction of protein-protein interactions using artificial shuffled sequences as hypothetical noninteracting proteins and it has shown promising results (Bock, J. R., Gough, D. A., Bioinformatics 2001, 17, 455-460). It remains unclear however, how the prediction accuracy is affected if real protein sequences are used to represent noninteracting proteins. In this work, this effect is assessed by comparison of the results derived from the use of real protein sequences with that derived from the use of shuffled sequences. The real protein sequences of hypothetical noninteracting proteins are generated from an exclusion analysis in combination with subcellular localization information of interacting proteins found in the Database of Interacting Proteins. Prediction accuracy using real protein sequences is 76.9% compared to 94.1% using artificial shuffled sequences. The discrepancy likely arises from the expected higher level of difficulty for separating two sets of real protein sequences than that for separating a set of real protein sequences from a set of artificial sequences. The use of real protein sequences for training a SVM classification system is expected to give better prediction results in practical cases. This is tested by using both SVM systems for predicting putative protein partners of a set of thioredoxin related proteins.

Moreover, in terms of deep learning, transfer learning in deep learning has been applied. A hybrid method has been compared to classical deep learning approach, and let us state that the new approach can obtain more accuracy than regular methods. Transfer learning in deep learning should be used in case of lack of data to train the use of deep learning algorithms. We have used this method for the classification of drill wear state on the basis of drilled hole images. The specialists divided the whole data set into three classes: red, yellow, and green, which correspond to 3 stages of drill wear. The red class corresponds to a drill which is worn out and should be replaced; the yellow class should send a warning message to an operator for a manual check of the state of a drill; and the last one, the green one, is connected with the state of a drill which should be further used in production (it is still sharp enough). The important advantage of this approach is that it collects features from two sources: one set is automatically extracted by means of deep learning and the other is manually extracted by a researcher.

Hence, in order to get around this issue connected with a small portion of training data, transfer learning in deep learning has been applied.

As a first step towards this challenge, we introduce a novel framework for image generation: Message Passing Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Networks (MPM GANs). While GANs have recently been shown to be very effective for image generation and other tasks, these networks have been limited to mostly single generator-discriminator networks. We show that we can obtain multi-agent GANs that communicate through message passing to achieve better image generation. The objectives of the individual agents in this framework are two fold: a co-operation objective and a competing objective. The co-operation objective ensures that the message sharing mechanism guides the other generator to generate better than itself while the competing objective encourages each generator to generate better than its counterpart. We analyze and visualize the messages that these GANs share among themselves in various scenarios. We quantitatively show that the message sharing formulation serves as a regularizer for the adversarial training.

The main aim of this research was to conduct a spatially prediction of the top soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and clay content using digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches in Borujen region, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari province, central Iran. To achieve this goal, a total of 334 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth. Three non-linear models including Cubist (Cu), Random Forest (RF), Regression Tree (RT) and a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to link environmental covariates and the studied soil properties. The environmental covariates were obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imagery (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper; ETM). The model was calibrated and validated by the 10-fold cross-validation approach. Root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to determine the performance of the models, and relative RMSE (RMSE%) was used to define prediction accuracy. According to the RMSE and R2, Cu and RF resulted in the most accurate predictions for CCE (R2 = 0.30 and RMSE = 9.52) and clay contents (R2 = 0.15 and RMSE = 7.86), respectively, while both of RF and Cu models showed the highest performance to predict SOC content (R2 = 0.55). Results showed that remote sensing covariates (Ratio Vegetation Index and band 4) were the most important variables to explain the variability of SOC and CCE content, but only topographic attributes were responsible for clay content variation. According to RMSE% results, it could be concluded that the best model is not necessarily able to make the most accurate estimation. This study recommended that more observations and denser sampling should be carried out in the entire study area. Alternatively, stratified sampling by elevation in homogeneous sub-areas was recommended. The stratified sampling probably will increase the performance of models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "2893301845", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215540625", "199407495", "164994126", "150382308", "134385063", "199412752", "199093336"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133812434"}

However, immunohistochemistry has been traditionally affected by lack of reproducibility due to technological variabilities as well as to the inherent subjectivity of the visual observation, thus the analysis has been limited to qualitative evaluation of the presence of the target stains within the tissues. The rapid evolution of the technique as a valid diagnostic and prognostic tool for tumor marker identification and cancer assessment has ultimately shifted the aim from qualitative to quantitative, stressing the demand for the standardization of the overall IHC assay and for the extraction of objective and repeatable measures of protein activity from the IHC images. Computer-aided image analysis has been universally acknowledged for having a fundamental role in solving the IHC standardization issue; in particular, tissue and cell segmentation techniques are precious instruments to identify the regions of interest of the target antigens in the specimens, allowing fully-automated and repeatable measurements at cellular and sub-cellular level; this is required by modern pathology and not feasible with simple visual evaluation. To this date, literature does not provide effective solutions for these challenging tasks, which gives motivation to our thesis work. This thesis addresses the problems of tissue compartmentalization and cell segmentation in IHC images, proposing fully-automated techniques to i) recognize the cancerous areas of the samples disregarding non-interesting tissues such as stroma and blood vessels; ii) detect and delineate the sub-cellular regions of the cancerous cells, i.e. nuclei, cellular membranes and cytoplasm. The proposed methods, based on color and morphological processing, were validated on large datasets of IHC cancer images from several anatomical locations and compared experimentally with state of the art segmentation approaches, such as Support Vector Machines and active contours. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the quantitative accuracy and reproducibility of the segmentations provided by our techniques, that can be used to obtain localized measure of protein activity as well as for any other applications requiring tissue and cell exploration in pathological tissues.

In the next step, several features in time and frequency domains are extracted from EDR and HRV signals. Moreover, several features are extracted from mutual information of HRV and EDR, which is derived from cross-spectral and magnitude-squared coherence of both signals. The extracted features were evaluated statistically using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, and the optimum number of features were selected by the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm.

Furthermore, supervised learning as a predictive model for classifying tree genera (and species, where possible) has been gaining popularity in order to minimize this labor-intensive task. However, bottlenecks remain that hinder the immediate adoption of supervised learning methods. With supervised classification, training samples are required for learning the parameters that govern the performance of a classifier, yet the selection of training data is often subjective and the quality of such samples is critically important. For LiDAR scanning in forest environments, the quantification of data quality is somewhat abstract, normally referring to some metric related to the completeness of individual tree crowns; however, this is not an issue that has received much attention in the literature. Intuitively the choice of training samples having varying quality will affect classification accuracy. In this paper a Diversity Index (DI) is proposed that characterizes the diversity of data quality (Qi) among selected training samples required for constructing a classification model of tree genera. The training sample is diversified in terms of data quality as opposed to the number of samples per class. The diversified training sample allows the classifier to better learn the positive and negative instances and; therefore; has a higher classification accuracy in discriminating the \u201cunknown\u201d class samples from the \u201cknown\u201d samples. Our algorithm is implemented within the Random Forests base classifiers with six derived geometric features from LiDAR data. The training sample contains three tree genera (pine; poplar; and maple) and the validation samples contains four labels (pine; poplar; maple; and \u201cunknown\u201d).

Prediction of short-term network car demand can provide many benefits such as an increase in the income of network car drivers. In addition, demand prediction is an important resource for recommendation systems, carpooling systems, and network car scheduling; and therefore, predicting the demand for network cars has great significance. In the last few decades, scholars have studied various problems related to short-term demand prediction for online car-hailing services based on clustering algorithms and regression algorithms. However, these studies are still problematic because the accuracy of demand prediction is not high enough. Therefore, this paper studies a method of improving the accuracy and the efficiency of demand prediction. Due to the high prediction accuracy and the fast training efficiency of least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), a short-term demand prediction method for online car-hailing services based on LS-SVM is proposed. The modeling process involves selecting the dependent and independent variables, the basic principles of the LS-SVM, the kernel function and superparameter, model training, and prediction. In a numerical experiment, we use network car order data as the network car demand data to test the model. We show that the experimental results with the LS-SVM method implemented in this paper and then compare the model with lasso linear regression, nearest neighbor regression, decision tree regression, and neural network. The experimental results show that the short-term demand prediction model for online car-hailing services based on LS-SVM performs better than the other methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891825", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2910829642", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3451346", "88522552", "18419724", "18330540", "7950455", "15374171", "22685661", "18645987", "2439714", "44195827", "116666662", "15293937", "41317200", "45505685", "10743717", "64493273", "207579947", "62765790", "17220557", "62569873", "110058587", "195968485"], "inbound_citations": ["207938400", "195831847", "204793825", "195831370"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59600614"}

To compute the new kernel, at first, suffix trees of documents are constructed with suffix tree constructing algorithm, and then the word sequence kernel is computed based on the suffix trees. With STWSK, the documents can be categorized using Support Vector Machine fast and efficiently. The theory analysis shows that the computing time of STWSK is linear to the length of the compared documents, which is less than that of SK and WSK obviously. We compare the classification performance of STWSK with WSK and polynomial kernel (PK) on Reuters-21578 text dataset.

In 1989, a large, 5 year fuzzy logic research and applications program was funded in Japan by MITI which involved over 45 industrial companies including most of the major automotive and electrical manufacturers. One of the main topics of this research was finding ways to make machines smarter by increasing the number of sensors and developing new ways to make use of this extra information. Sometimes the sensor only existed in algorithmic form (a soft sensor), where other measurements were combined to infer the value of a particular variable. Products which involved fuzzy systems therefore, generally either performed better or were easier to use, and as such were readily accepted by consumers in the Far East. Factors, such as a reduced product development times and a flexible framework, were cited as reasons why fuzzy techniques were a good solution, but these must be balanced against the fact that it would take just as long to validate the final solution and that the fuzzy solution was often the only system developed. The interest in fuzzy systems which occurred in Europe and America during the Nineties was partially in response to the wave of electrical consumer applications which appeared in the Far East. The first fuzzy control system was developed in the UK over 20 years ago, and during the Seventies, Mamdani and hi co-workers at Queen Mary College, London, developed a number of static and adaptive fuzzy PID-type controllers. This work involved testing their performance against standard PID controllers on a range of different plants. However, the first real applications of fuzzy control were developed in Holland in 1979 and was used to control a cement kiln. Peter Holmbald had attended a session where Mamdani presented a paper on self-organising controllers which concluded at the end that self-organising controllers were complicated and that he had recently stumbled on a better method: fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic was therefore proposed as a method for simplifying the controller design process, making it: quicker to design, perform better than standard linear methods and less reliant on an accurate mathematical model of the plant. Mamdani's work was transferred to Japan after Prof Sugeno spent a six month sabbatical period working at Queen Mary College in 1982, and the fuzzy techniques began to be exploited after the successful development and deployment of the Sendai subway system by Hitachi in 1987, and a series of small laboratory experiments, such as the inverted pendulum, which demonstrated that fuzzy logic could be used to design and develop a wide variety of different control schemes. This paper will discuss how fuzzy logic has been used to improve controller design, and how neurofuzzy systems can be used to combine both symbolic (expert) and numerical (data) information to possibly overcome some of the weaknesses of each design paradigm.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1049/ic:19961140", "venue": "IEE Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence in Consumer and Domestic Products", "journal": "IEE Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence in Consumer and Domestic Products", "mag_id": "2022515442", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109742651"}

The visual image reconstruction allows to translate neural brain activity pattern into the visual image (stimulus) that has caused the corresponding brain activity. The stimulus may be graphical characters, face images, handwritten characters and natural images. The proposed technique aims to develop a novel framework for visual image reconstruction of natural images from fMRI. The exact reconstruction of natural images is challenging due to its complexity. The classification of image prior plays an important role in improving the accuracy of reconstruction. Since the image prior consists of multiple categories, like Gabor wavelet transform, Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Haar feature transform, Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) were tried on image prior. The extracted features are fed into the multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier followed by k-means clustering. An analysis on reconstruction done using different feature extraction techniques revealed that the Gabor feature extraction gave the highest accuracy in final results. The reconstruction of natural images was achieved with an accuracy of 80% till now. Also 70% accuracy was achieved in identifying the category and reconstructing the test stimulus from a real time test fMRI voxel responses.

This article proposes a novel adaptive self-advised online OCSVM that incrementally tunes the kernel parameter and decides whether a model update is required or not. As opposed to existing methods, this novel online algorithm does not rely on any fixed threshold, but it uses the slack variables in the OCSVM to determine which new data points should be included in the training set and trigger a model update. The algorithm also incrementally tunes the kernel parameter of OCSVM automatically based on the spatial locations of the edge and interior samples in the training data with respect to the constructed hyperplane of OCSVM. This new online OCSVM algorithm was extensively evaluated using synthetic data and real data from case studies in structural health monitoring.

In this paper, focusing on the binary label-imbalanced classification field, a novel method of Adaptive Ensemble of classifiers with Regularization (AER) has been proposed. The method deals with the overfitting problem from a perspective of implicit regularization. Specifically, it leverages the properties of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to obtain the solution with the minimum norm to achieve regularization, and interpolates ensemble weights via the global geometry of data to further prevent overfitting. The method enjoys a favorable time and memory complexity, and theoretical proofs show that algorithms implemented with AER paradigm have time and memory complexities upper-bounded by their original implementations. Furthermore, the proposed AER method is tested with a specific implementation based on Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost) on the three datasets: UCI Bioassay, KEEL Abalone19, and a set of GMM-sampled artificial dataset. Results show that the proposed AER algorithm can outperform the major existing algorithms based on multiple metrics, and Mcnemar's tests are applied to validate performance superiorities.

We propose a text-enhanced KG model based on gated convolution network (GConvTE), which can learn entity descriptions and symbol triples jointly by feature fusion. Specifically, each triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) is represented as a 3-column structural embedding matrix, a 3-column textual embedding matrix and a 3-column joint embedding matrix where each column vector represents a triple element. Textual embeddings are obtained by bidirectional gated recurrent unit with attention (A-BGRU) encoding entity descriptions and joint embeddings are obtained by the combination of textual embeddings and structural embeddings. Extending feature dimension in embedding layer, these three matrixs are concatenated into 3-channel feature block to be fed into convolution layer, where the gated unit is added to selectively output the joint features maps. These feature maps are concatenated and then multiplied with a weight vector via a dot product to return a score.

To improve detection accuracy, we propose a novel feature extraction method by encoding high order directional derivatives at each pixel. We first quantize the directional derivatives into ternary values to generate Local Ternary Patterns (LTP). For the sake of simplification, each LTP code is usually decomposed into an upper LBP code and a lower LBP code, but this leads to loss of information. Hence, we use joint histograms to preserve the co-occurrence of upper and lower LBP codes for each order LTP. Then we concatenate all joint histograms from different orders to propose High-order Local Ternary Patterns (HLTP). To improve computational efficiency, we apply Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) to reduce the dimension of HLTP. To further improve performance, we present a noise resistant mechanism to remove noisy derivatives, and then propose HLTP based on Magnitudes of noise removed derivatives and values of Center pixels (HLTPMC). Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for training and classification. Experiments on large scale smoke data sets show that our method can achieve detection rates above 94% with false alarm rates below 1.33%.

High spatial and temporal variability characterize the Wadden Sea. The ecosystem is significantly influenced by the climate, especially by increasing temperatures. Tidal flows, storms, strong wind, an d human activities like dredging or deepening of chan nels cause changes in the morphology. In order to detect undesired changes at early stages, enabling rapid countermeasures to mitigate or minimize potential harm or hazard, a recurrent monitoring becomes necessary. For the monitoring of coastal areas, basical ly three techniques are available: terrestrial surveyi ng, echo sounding and remote sensing. Whereas terrestrial surveying is limited by a high cost and time factor and provide only isolated measurements, echo sounding is capable to acquire morphological data with an ar ea-wide coverage. However, due to the limited cover ed area per day, and the needed sufficient water depth , remote sensing technique becomes a good alternati ve technique in this context. In the framework of a German research project calle d Scientific Monitoring Concepts for the German Bight (WIMO, 2013), new approaches for a sustainable monitoring of coastal areas by remote sensing dat a are investigated. In particular, the analysis of ch anges in the morphology and the habitat distributio n are of great interest. For these tasks we use three types of remote sensing data: SAR (synthetic aperture rad ar) data, optical images, and airborne laser scanning d ata, also called lidar (light detection and ranging ). In this paper, we focus on the analysis of lidar data which provide substantial information for two monitoring tasks.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2188503782", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "17039446", "207251944", "29696476"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11364956"}

In mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM), supervised machine learning algorithms, which have advantages in dealing with complex geo-data, usually involve uncertainty resulting from the discretization of continuous evidential maps into arbitrary classes as well as the large data imbalance caused by the rarity of deposit locations. Consequently, the predicted results may be biased. In this paper, a random forest (RF) algorithm based on the bagging technique is used to map the prospectivity of tungsten polymetallic deposits in the Nanling metallogenic belt. Data-driven logistic transformation is employed to obtain continuous evidential maps. Both discretized and continuous evidential maps are used to generate prospectivity models for comparison. To reduce the data imbalance, the under-sampling method and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) are implemented to generate balanced datasets. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and improved prediction-area (P-A) plot are applied to evaluate the prospectivity models. The predictive results show that when using the RF algorithm in MPM, the application of continuous evidential maps can improve the performance of prospectivity models and reduce the uncertainty resulting from the discretization of evidential maps. The prospectivity model trained with a balanced SMOTE-generated dataset shows the best overall performance for improving the percentage of deposit locations that are correctly predicted and decreasing the percentage of non-deposit locations that are inaccurately identified as deposit locations to some extent. In addition, the improved P-A plot is superior to the ROC curve because the latter neglects the occupied area, which is critical for mineral exploration and may provide an overly optimistic performance with imbalanced data. However, further testing of the evaluation criteria and the SMOTE approach to reduce data imbalance is warranted to determine fully the universality in MPM from the perspective of data imbalance. Based on prospectivity models, four high-potential areas and five moderate-potential areas are delineated, which indicates good future prospecting for tungsten polymetallic deposits in this region.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11053-019-09564-8", "venue": "Natural Resources Research", "journal": "Natural Resources Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2979128757", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["127447472", "121025150", "125618059", "173073619", "127110200", "128491588", "128503818", "207738357", "89141", "60993494", "128954442", "131211448", "14587985", "129071685", "10895910", "127632303", "129707039", "15273230", "1554582", "8501064", "129276217", "140642387", "131235847", "134083894", "129570290", "130463999", "54196921", "132372459", "121240696", "122604404", "128823788", "207159665", "122844634", "55639350", "650045", "129029018", "131436559", "133659340", "53046396", "11062019", "128670759", "129667106", "131930698", "15000608", "133795289", "3093707", "131548030", "132938402", "128478685", "132430135", "121254302", "121921565", "132470644", "129387971", "131549910", "127824447", "134719778", "140618933", "128667126", "129178993", "134489689", "2769679", "129907209", "59900704", "61282562", "129788221", "16237703", "60160905", "6336016", "129774903", "134569504", "126283342", "122879482", "130145753", "117960937", "129355900", "128819287", "115632550", "204237963", "128567496", "11952307", "132972642", "130242827", "22117231", "131976561", "135221425", "17592539", "43168190", "62180304", "133910948", "112150586", "129123659", "128771282", "131197519", "202171226", "120372381", "131501604", "128593539", "134852205", "36661103", "12958071", "129715370", "130336532", "128822063", "129692478", "131122440", "134208522"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203653916"}

In an abstract sense, regularized kernel methods (simply called SVMs here) can be seen as regularized M-estimators for a parameter in a (typically infinite dimensional) reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For smooth loss functions, it is shown that the difference between the estimator, i.e.\\ the empirical SVM, and the theoretical SVM is asymptotically normal with rate $\\sqrt{n}$.

Additionally, our input feature data, acquired from only five BP measurements per subject, represent a very small sample size. This constitutes a critical limitation when utilizing the SVR technique and can cause overfitting or underfitting, depending on the structure of the algorithm. To overcome these challenges, a fusion with an asymptotic approach (based on combining the bootstrap with the SVR technique) is utilized to generate the pseudo features needed to predict the BP values.

This paper presents a novel MIL algorithm for an extreme learning machine called MI-ELM. A radial basis kernel extreme learning machine is adapted to approach the MIL problem using Hausdorff distance to measure the distance between the bags. The clusters in the hidden layer are composed of bags that are randomly generated. Because we do not need to tune the parameters for the hidden layer, MI-ELM can learn very fast.

Experimental results show that our approach can correctly translate the majority of Chinese names.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WI-IATW.2007.64", "venue": "2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology - Workshops", "journal": "2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology - Workshops", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2101634476", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["94229", "14421001", "43807699", "1077722", "20904597", "6906500", "1340206"], "inbound_citations": ["14915853"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14681474"}

The secondary structure of an RNA molecule, signified by base-pairing and stacking interactions between the paired bases, is formed first. Subsequently, the RNA molecule adopts an energetically favorable three-dimensional conformation in the structural space determined mainly by the rotational degrees of freedom associated with the backbone of regions of unpaired nucleotides (loops). To what extent the backbone conformation of RNA loops also results from interactions within the local sequence context or rather follows global optimization constraints alone has not been addressed yet. Because the majority of base stacking interactions are exerted locally, a critical influence of local sequence on local structure appears plausible. Thus, local loop structure ought to be predictable, at least in part, from the local sequence context alone. To test this hypothesis, we used Random Forests on a nonredundant data set of unpaired nucleotides extracted from 97 X-ray structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to predict discrete backbone angle conformations given by the discretized \u03b7/\u03b8-pseudo-torsional space. Predictions on balanced sets with four to six conformational classes using local sequence information yielded average accuracies of up to 55%, thus significantly better than expected by chance (17%-25%). Bases close to the central nucleotide appear to be most tightly linked to its conformation. Our results suggest that RNA loop structure does not only depend on long-range base-pairing interactions; instead, it appears that local sequence context exerts a significant influence on the formation of the local loop structure.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3138562", "pubmed_id": "21628431", "doi": "10.1261/rna.2550211", "venue": "RNA", "journal": "RNA", "mag_id": "2119004629", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25652642"}

This scanner, Titan MW (multi-wavelength), collects point clouds using three different wavelength lasers simultaneously, hence opening the door to new possibilities in land cover classification using only LiDAR data. We show that the recorded intensities of returned laser pulses together with structural characteristics of the features on the Earth surface calculated from the 3D positions of returns are sufficient enough to classify the point cloud into 10 distinct land cover classes.

The classifier determines the font type for each segmented character obtained from a document.
