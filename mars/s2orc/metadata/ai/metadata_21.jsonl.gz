We first present an effective and robust face component rendering method using Adaptive Thresholding to eliminate the influence of illumination by separating face components into layers. Then, we propose an automatic exaggeration method, in which face component features are trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and then amplified using image processing techniques to make the caricature more hilarious and thus more impressive. After that, a hair rendering method is presented, which synthesizes hair in the same caricature style using edge-detection techniques.

Specifically, we use sentence templates composed of Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to represent the syntax structure of captions, and accordingly, syntax representation learning is performed by directly inferring POS tags from videos. The visual perception is implemented by a mixture model which translates visual cues into lexical words that are conditional on the learned syntactic structure of sentences. Thus, a video captioning task consists of two sub-tasks: video POS tagging and visual cue translation, which are jointly modeled and trained in an end-to-end fashion.

Nevertheless, transplantation is greatly hampered by the un-availability of suitable liver donors; several methods have been developed and applied to find a better system to prioritize recipients on the waiting list, although most of them only consider donor or recipient characteristics (but not both). This paper proposes a novel donor-recipient liver allocation system constructed to predict graft survival after transplantation by means of a dataset comprised of donor-recipient pairs from different centres (seven Spanish and one UK hospitals). The best model obtained is used in conjunction with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (MELD), one of the current assignation methodology most used globally. This problem is assessed using the ordinal regression learning paradigm due to the natural ordering in the classes of the problem, via a cascade binary decomposition methodology and the Support Vector Machine methodology. The methodology proposed has shown competitiveness in all the metrics selected, when compared to other machine learning techniques and efficiently complements the MELD score based on the principles of efficiency and equity. Finally, a simulation of the proposal is included, in order to visualize its performance in realistic situations. This simulation has shown that there are some determining factors in the characterization of the survival time after transplantation (concerning both donors and recipients) and that the joint use of these sets of information could be, in fact, more useful and beneficial for the survival principle. Nonetheless, the results obtained indicate the true complexity of the problem dealt within this study and the fact that other characteristics that have not been included in the dataset may be of importance for the characterization of the dependent variable (survival time after transplantation), thus starting a promising line of future work.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2013.07.017", "venue": "Appl.

Eighty lakes free of zebra mussels in 1996 were reexamined from 1997 to 2008. Of these, zebra mussels successfully invaded an additional 31 lakes, all of which were classified initially as suitable for zebra mussels; none of the lakes previously classified as unsuitable were invaded. We used the Random Forests classification algorithm with 16 environmental variables to determine the most important factors that differed between invaded lakes and those lakes suitable for invasion that have not yet been invaded. Distance to the nearest infested lakes was found to be the most important variable, followed by the lake area, color, average depth, and concentration of chloride, magnesium, and bicarbonate.

One-class classification is particularly significant in applications where only a single class of data objects is applicable and easy to obtain. Objects from the other classes could be too difficult or expensive to be made available. So we would only describe the target class to separate it from the outlier class. The SVDD is a kind of one-class classification method based on Support Vector Machine [1, 2] which proposed by Tax. It tries to construct a boundary around the target data by enclosing the target data within a minimum hyper-sphere. Inspired by the support vector machines (SVMs), the SVDD decision boundary is described by a few target objects, known as support vectors (SVs). A more flexible boundary can be obtained with the introduction of kernel functions, by which data are mapped into a high-dimensional feature space. The most commonly used kernel function is Gaussian kernel. This method has attracted many researchers from the various fields. For example Liu et al. applied the SVDD techniques for novelty detection as part of the validation on an Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS) [3]. Ji et al. discussed the SVDD application in gene expression data clustering [4]. Yu et al. used SVDD for image categorization from internet images [5]. Recently, some efforts have been expended to improve the SVDD method. Guo et al. proposed a simple post-processing method which tries to modify the SVDD boundary in order to achieve a tight data description [6]. As another example Cho apply the orthogonal filtering as a preprocessing step is executed before SVDD modeling to remove the unwanted variation of data [7]. In this paper, we propose an extended SVDD (ESVDD) which describes data by using a hyper-ellipse instead of a hyper-sphere. Clearly, ESVDD can", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCKE.2011.6413318", "venue": "2011 1st International eConference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)", "journal": "2011 1st International eConference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2168206619", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["547095", "207566367", "3006155", "39666158", "17548428", "5190111", "37568208", "43195234"], "inbound_citations": ["211093247", "119114191", "214612101", "11991169", "42004348", "18449976"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55329159"}

This vast amount of microbiome data, as well as the widespread proliferation of microbiome research and the looming era of clinical metagenomics, means there is an urgent need to develop analytics that can process huge amounts of data in a short amount of time. To address this need, we propose a new method for the compact representation of microbiome sequencing data using similarity-preserving sketches of streaming k-mer spectra. These sketches allow for dissimilarity estimation, rapid microbiome catalogue searching, and classification of microbiome samples in near real-time. Results We apply streaming histogram sketching to microbiome samples as a form of dimensionality reduction, creating a compressed \u2018histosketch\u2019 that can be used to efficiently represent microbiome k-mer spectra. Using public microbiome datasets, we show that histosketches can be clustered by sample type using pairwise Jaccard similarity estimation, consequently allowing for rapid microbiome similarity searches via a locality sensitive hashing indexing scheme. Furthermore, we show that histosketches can be used to train machine learning classifiers to accurately label microbiome samples. Specifically, using a collection of 108 novel microbiome samples from a cohort of premature neonates, we trained and tested a Random Forest Classifier that could accurately predict whether the neonate had received antibiotic treatment (95% accuracy, precision 97%) and could subsequently be used to classify microbiome data streams in less than 12 seconds. We provide our implementation, Histosketching Using Little K-mers (HULK), which can histosketch a typical 2GB microbiome in 50 seconds on a standard laptop using 4 cores, with the sketch occupying 3000 bytes of disk space.

However, most existing metric learning methods learn only one Mahalanobis distance metric from a single feature representation for each face image and cannot make use of multiple feature representations directly. In many face-related tasks, we can easily extract multiple features for a face image to extract more complementary information, and it is desirable to learn distance metrics from these multiple features, so that more discriminative information can be exploited than those learned from individual features. To achieve this, we present a large-margin multi-metric learning (LM3L) method for face and kinship verification, which jointly learns multiple global distance metrics under which the correlations of different feature representations of each sample are maximized, and the distance of each positive pair is less than a low threshold and that of each negative pair is greater than a high threshold. To better exploit the local structures of face images, we also propose a local metric learning and local LM3Lmethods to learn a set of local metrics.

The incidence of the oral cancer seems to be increasing exponentially in the world. The clinician has to undergo a higher level of dilemma every time in order to differentiate the cancerous lesions from other controversial and poorly defined lesions that are present in the oral cavity. Early stage carcinomas and its subsequent manifestations are highly misinterpreted because at the initial stage there is minimum discomfort in the patient and they simply mimic many similar benign lesions. The analysis to be done by the doctors is often delayed and therefore there is a high risk for the cancer to spread in the body. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm present in the oral cavity. Therefore the accurate diagnosis and management of this particular Squamous cell carcinoma which originates from the surface of the oral muscle has to be done well. The main aim of this work is to assess the clinical features, diagnostic procedures and treatment required for oral cancer patients. The staging of the cancer is generally divided into two stages namely, clinical and pathological. In TNM (Tumour, Node, Metasis), a lot of novel prognostic tools have been traced and new methodologies for the prognostic factors have been drastically improved and developed. This paper compares the classification accuracy of the TNM staging system with the aid of Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifiers. In this work, totally 75 oral cancer patients are studied. For both the classifiers, the input variables are nothing but the TNM variables such as tumour size, number of positive regional nodes, distance metastasis, hereditary etc. Out of the two post classifiers utilized here, GMM provided a better result as of 94.18% average accuracy for all the stages while Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) showed an average accuracy of about 89.5% for all the stages.

One of these challenges is the fact that just a small portion of the data can be manually labeled by human experts. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by handling unlabeled data alongside labeled ones. However, if only a small quantity of labeled examples is available, the performance of the classification can be unsatisfactory. Algorithms such as co-training and tri-training use multiple views or multiple learning algorithms to improve the classification of unlabeled instances through simple majority agreement. Also, there are approaches that use less trivial voting processes such as weighted majority voting. Nevertheless, these solutions require some confidence level on the label in order to use it for training. Hence, not all information is used, i.e., information associated with lower confidence level is disregarded completely. We propose an approach called social-training, which uses all information available in the semi-supervised learning task.

Various statistics-based machine learning techniques have been employed for this task. \u201cCurse of Dimensionality\u201d is still a significant challenge in machine learning techniques. Some research has been carried out on Feature Selection (FS) using genetic algorithm as wrapper to improve the performance of credit scoring models. However, the challenge lies in finding an overall best method in credit scoring problems and improving the time-consuming process of feature selection. In this study, the credit scoring problem is investigated through feature selection to improve classification performance. This work proposes a novel approach to feature selection in credit scoring applications, called as Information Gain Directed Feature Selection algorithm (IGDFS), which performs the ranking of features based on information gain, propagates the top m features through the GA wrapper (GAW) algorithm using three classical machine learning algorithms of KNN, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for credit scoring. The first stage of information gain guided feature selection can help reduce the computing complexity of GA wrapper, and the information gain of features selected with the IGDFS can indicate their importance to decision making. Regarding the classification accuracy, SVM accuracy is always better than KNN and NB for Baseline techniques, GAW and IGDFS. Also, we can conclude that the IGDFS achieved better performance than generic GAW, and GAW obtained better performance than the corresponding single classifiers (baseline) for almost all cases, except for the German Credit dataset, IGDFS + KNN has worse performance than generic GAW and the single classifier KNN. Removing features with low information gain could produce conflict with the original data structure for KNN, and thus affect the performance of IGDFS + KNN. Regarding the ROC performance, for the German Credit Dataset, the three classic machine learning algorithms, SVM, KNN and Naive Bayes in the wrapper of IGDFS GA obtained almost the same performance. For the Australian credit dataset and the Taiwan Credit dataset, the IGDFS + Naive Bayes achieved the largest area under ROC curves.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2018.04.033", "venue": "Appl.

Firstly, the marine animal images are colleced by an underwater robot equipped with an embedded device.

Although computed tomography (CT) examinations are frequently used for lung cancer diagnosis, it can be difficult to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules on the basis of CT images alone. Therefore, a bronchoscopic biopsy may be conducted if malignancy is suspected following CT examinations. However, biopsies are highly invasive, and patients with benign nodules may undergo many unnecessary biopsies. To prevent this, an imaging diagnosis with high classification accuracy is essential. In this study, we investigate the automated classification of pulmonary nodules in CT images using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). We use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate additional images when only small amounts of data are available, which is a common problem in medical research, and evaluate whether the classification accuracy is improved by generating a large amount of new pulmonary nodule images using the GAN. Using the proposed method, CT images of 60 cases with confirmed pathological diagnosis by biopsy are analyzed. The benign nodules assessed in this study are difficult for radiologists to differentiate because they cannot be rejected as being malignant. A volume of interest centered on the pulmonary nodule is extracted from the CT images, and further images are created using axial sections and augmented data. The DCNN is trained using nodule images generated by the GAN and then fine-tuned using the actual nodule images to allow the DCNN to distinguish between benign and malignant nodules. This pretraining and fine-tuning process makes it possible to distinguish 66.7% of benign nodules and 93.9% of malignant nodules.

However, ana-lysis of such digital imagery data using traditional pixel-wise approaches remains a challenge due to the spectral complexity of urban areas. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is emerging as an alternative method to produce landcover information. Standard OBIA approaches rely on ima-ge segmentation which partitions the image into a set of 'crisp' non-overlapping image-objects. This step regularly requires significant user-interaction to parameterise a functional segmentation model. This paper proposes fuzzy image segmentation which produces fully overlapping image-regions with indeterminate boundaries that serves as alternative framework for the subsequent image classification. The new method uses three stages: (i) fuzzy image segmentation, (ii) feature analysis, and (iii) defuzzification, that were implemented applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques and using open source software.

In this paper, we explicitly model the relations among 11 attributes of nodules by way of transfer learning and extract a meta-structure that captures the transferabilities across deep features of these attributes. Specifically, a higher-order transfer learning scheme is proposed by involving three phases, i.e., semantic attribute-specific modeling, semantic attributes transfer modeling and pathologic attribute generalizing, to explore the strongest association across various attributes and to boost the nodule attribute predictions in chest CT images. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the 2632 nodules in the public Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) dataset. The experimental results suggest that our higher-order transfer approach shows the superior predictive performance not only in the most of the semantic attributes compared with the schemes of learning from scratch and the first-order transfer but also for the pathologic attribute compared with the related studies.

The model was introduced under the name of Random Neural Networks (RNNs), inside the \ufb01eld of Neural Networks. In this thesis, a \ufb01rst contribution consists of an adaptation of quasi-Newton optimisation methods for training the RNN model. In the last decade, a new computational paradigm was introduced in the \ufb01eld of Machine Learning, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). One of the pioneers and most di\ufb00used RC methods is the Echo State Network (ESN) model. Here, we propose a method based on topographic maps to initialise the ESN procedure. Another contribution of the thesis is the introduction of a new RC model called the Echo State Queueing Network (ESQN), where we use ideas coming from RNNs for the design of the reservoir. An ESQN consists of an ESN where the reservoir has a new dynamics inspired by recurrent RNNs. In this thesis, we position the ESQN method in the global Machine Learning area, and provide examples of their use and performances. Finally, we propose a method for real\u2013time estimation of Speech Quality using the learning tools above described. Audio quality in the Internet can be strongly affected by network conditions. As a consequence, many techniques to evaluate it have been developed. In particular, the ITU-T adopted in 2001 a technique called Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) to automatically measuring speech quality. PESQ is a well-known and widely used procedure, providing in general an accurate evaluation of perceptual quality by comparing the original and received voice sequences. The thesis provides a procedure for estimating PESQ output working only with measures taken on the network state and using some properties of the communication system, without any original signal.

More than 20% of the number of deaths are pedestrians. Traffic crashes will become, in 2030, the fifth leading cause of deaths worldwide. A considerable amount of these accidents occurs due to either imprudence or lack of dexterity of the driver. More than 70% of traffic accidents are attributed to human error, such as perception errors as distance judgment error or simply by lack of attention. Because of the problem aforementioned, this work proposes the development and discussion of a pedestrian recognition system using an automotive radar of 79 GHz. The main idea is to early detect pedestrians using the micro Doppler characteristics of the human body in near to crash situations (0\u201315 m). Based on these requirements, at first this work presents the improvement of velocity resolution of the radar system with the objective of extracting the micro Doppler characteristics of the objects. The improvement of velocity resolution was reached assuming the application of multi-objective optimization techniques, in this case Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search (RS) were adopted, enhancing the quality of the radar signal. Based on radar measures of velocity and range, a machine learning approach was considered in order to classify objects detected by the radar. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was assumed to distinguish pedestrians and non-pedestrians objects. Four different SVM based models were considered in this work, aiming the improvement of both classification performance and speed, comparing three different kernel functions. As a result, it was possible to verify the advantages of the multi-objective optimization to extract the micro Doppler effects based on radar signals. Moreover, the optimization reached the velocity resolution of 0.12 m/s. To conclude, we showed that a model involving a polynomial kernel for the SVM reported better result in terms of accuracy (99.5%), confirming the promising perspectives of vehicles embedded radar-based safety systems.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.06.048", "venue": "Expert Syst.

We analyzed 93 IO tables, spanning the years 1993 to 2005 for 37 countries that are either members or associates of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The 2009 OECD input/output tables featured 48 industrial sectors based on International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 3, and described the respective economies in current country-of-origin valued currency. We converted and transformed these reported values to US 2005 dollars using appropriate exchange rates and implicit price deflators, and addressed discrepancies in reported industrial sectors across tables.

Investigation of the structure of an artificial neural network (ANN) in that class (paradigm) suggested the use of geometric and categorical modeling methods in the following sense. A (noncommutative) geometric space can be interpreted as a so-called geometric net. To a given ANN a corresponding geometric net can be associated. Geometric spaces form a category. Consequently, one obtains a category of geometric nets with a suitable notion of morphism. It is natural to interpret a learning step of an ANN as a morphism, thus learning corresponds to a finite sequence of morphisms (the associated networks are the objects). An associated (\"local\") geometric net is less complex than the original ANN, but it contains all necessary information about the network structure. The association process together with learning (expressed by morphisms) leads to a commutative diagram corresponding to a suitable natural transformation. Commutativity can be exploited to make learning \"cheaper\". The simplified mathematical network model was used in ANN simulation applied in an industrial project on quality control.

For example, classification models and vectorization methods can directly affect the detection results and code replacement can affect the features of vulnerability detection. We conduct a comparative study to evaluate the impact of different classification algorithms, vectorization methods and user-defined variables and functions name replacement. In this paper, we collected three different vulnerability code datasets. These datasets correspond to different types of vulnerabilities and have different proportions of source code. Besides, we extract and analyze the features of vulnerability code datasets to explain some experimental results. Our findings from the experimental results can be summarized as follows: (i) the performance of using deep learning is better than using traditional machine learning and BLSTM can achieve the best performance. (ii) CountVectorizer can improve the performance of traditional machine learning. (iii) Different vulnerability types and different code sources will generate different features.

To better model the nonlinear mapping from MRI to CT and produce more realistic images, we propose to use the adversarial training strategy to train the FCN. Moreover, we propose an image-gradient-difference based loss function to alleviate the blurriness of the generated CT. We further apply Auto-Context Model (ACM) to implement a context-aware generative adversarial network. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and robust for predicting CT images from MR images, and also outperforms three state-of-the-art methods under comparison.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1612.05362", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6044459", "pubmed_id": "30009283", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-66179-7_48", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2567079332,2952038462", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8466695", "75497666", "25147213", "18874645", "5575601", "1033682", "6758477", "33052332", "413926", "14542261", "9494752", "205514", "11758569", "1122604", "1344879", "2177465", "1004793"], "inbound_citations": ["208632080", "208157892", "195064546", "56657867", "209495570", "21656909", "42998214", "3964805", "204512185", "214795218", "210190799", "202778405", "54514126", "88523526", "70215434", "59606309", "195883541", "58029038", "47019328", "49573933", "59602179", "59555280", "51628313", "209317814", "204263802", "43919703", "52927253", "4806855", "53721640", "49865218", "52291253", "53117050", "195892000", "52191433", "5658128", "52290387", "201310377", "203626883", "53086010", "53010261", "67869425", "195783948", "4842480", "73440365", "211110722", "53096731", "85529685", "215245647", "204250247", "13846218", "174817455", "198953059", "5035343", "59236493", "88485059", "212737036", "52289143", "203687324", "209696181", "215334911", "3597027", "214599267", "195188944", "204826622", "145832709", "52984073", "115141812", "155099880", "28111473", "195771186", "214704210", "202588705", "209405109", "3672198", "52067470", "10853534", "213175482", "146809512", "203831018", "53753063", "44108413", "203927724", "62913361", "13972466", "133360110", "204743811", "21682220", "21682220", "52896500", "12351421", "195881601", "209140699", "51985467", "13659091", "49322589", "67771853", "3052834", "208884095", "198146049", "202542640", "44151959", "201058515", "197935262", "4978081", "160013462", "54485981", "21657876", "53566877", "85524843", "59601340", "184487353", "52211986", "51612859", "195884213", "43939347", "49188098", "13256186", "49878576", "215371207", "207863534", "58670749", "54218360", "202539196", "86613908", "22848456", "49296798", "207972991", "182953229", "49294604", "52305483", "102352365", "199532659", "140221061", "211082884", "146101395", "211540323", "209202290", "44032116", "53032488", "195766482", "52988736", "211817953", "53944116", "44068082", "53104467", "201621636", "35639092", "197767624", "198989828", "126733243", "52189741", "201718362", "4535622", "51614024", "203563315", "3762136", "204823753", "50784705", "14003800", "13354644", "58321480", "4548839", "53084007", "59234295", "5030118", "197453915", "203704051", "20025294", "49907378", "54445067", "13748858", "210930270", "195699395", "206491372", "208520617", "88481466", "9058444", "201058618", "53378294", "209314976", "3710447", "49310577", "50786007", "3686035", "174819853", "54186228", "58007004", "195833585", "91751865", "2286534", "52964761"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16628328"}

A common solution for this concept drift problem is by SSL. In this paper, an incre- mental SSL training framework is proposed to combine the low space complexity advantage of topology learning and SSL for network intrusion detection. First, the unsupervised self-organizing incremental neural network is extended to process labeled and unlabeled information incrementally. Second, a kernel function is constructed from the training results of the previous step. Finally, a kernel machine is trained with the constructed kernel function.

With the development and popularization of remote-sensing and information technologies, a great number of river-extraction methods have been proposed. However, most of them are vulnerable to noise interference and perform inefficient in a big data environment. To address these problems, a river extraction method is proposed based on adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization (PSO) support vector machine (AMPSO-SVM). First, three features, the spectral information, normalized difference water index (NDWI), and spatial texture entropy, are considered in feature space construction. It makes the objects with the same spectrum more distinguishable, then the noise interference could be resisted effectively. Second, in order to address the problems of premature convergence and inefficient iteration, a mutation operator is introduced to the PSO algorithm. This processing makes transductive SVM obtain optimal parameters quickly and effectively. The experiments are conducted on GaoFen-1 multispectral remote-sensing images from Yellow River. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existed ones, including PCA, KNN, basic SVM, and PSO-SVM, in terms of overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient.

One typical structural information which is useful for the classification task is the spatial relationship of the nearby data points. In this paper, to leverage this kind of structural information, we propose a novel classification method which combines total variational (TV) regularization with SVM, called TV-SVM. Since TV achieves a local smoothing property by penalizing the local discontinuity of data, TV-SVM preserves better local structure than the original SVM due to TV regularization.

The recent denial of service attacks on major Internet sites has shown that no open computer network is immune from intrusions. The inefficiency, inaccuracy and high false alarm rate of existing network security systems posed serious problems to network users, network administrators and security professionals and needs urgent redress. The traditional way of protecting network systems with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective, and there is an urgent need for new architecture and mechanism to protect network systems and mobile computing applications. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop an efficient model of network intrusion detection system using layered framework with conditional random fields that is capable of overcoming the apparent shortcomings of the present network intrusion detection systems. In this paper, the security system was developed using the structured system analysis and design methodology (SSADM). Furthermore, a simple, scalable, customizable and intelligent layered conditional random field based network intrusion detection system (LCRFNIDS) for detecting network based attacks was successfully implemented. This system will play a key role in controlling intruders\u2019 activities by detecting network based attacks reliably and efficiently. Specifically, in this system: an automated network monitoring system was implemented for monitoring packet broadcast from unauthorized internet protocol (IP) addresses, usual packet size, unauthorized packet transmission and packet broadcast to unauthorized IP addresses In general, the developed system was tested and found to be very effective for detecting and alerting intruder\u2019s activities in the network systems in order to establish a secured network system that will enhance business continuity and preserve organizations\u2019 vital and sensitive information.

A plant subject to infection typically releases exclusive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which may be detected by appropriate sensors. A set of experiments were designed, constructed and conducted at University of Warwick in which the state-of-the-art gas sensors namely Electronic Nose (EN) and Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS) were employed to sample the VOC profiles in order to detect powdery mildew-infected and spider mite-infested tomato plants in a non-destructive manner. The data acquired from the EN and FAIMS devices was analysed using Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. Both EN and FAIMS proved to be able to distinguish between healthy and infected tomato plants with desirable accuracy when coupled with an appropriate data analysis technique. A review of the literature on plant diseases, destructive and non-destructive plant's disease detection tools as well as VOC sampling procedures and instrumentation will be given throughout this thesis. ::: ::: Moreover, the latter part of this thesis presents the master-slave synchronisation of identical chaotic dynamical systems using the open-plus close-loop (OPCL) control method. The study is mainly concerned with the behaviour of the synchronisation of chaotic dynamical systems in respect to an added bias and in the case of mismatch of parameters of master and slave systems. The link between the external bias and the synchronisation error generated as well as between the value of parameters mismatch and the synchronisation error is examined and discussed. The usability of the newly proposed approaches is assessed by the aid of two applications. The first application demonstrates that a weak bias acting on Nano-mechanical resonator shows the linear correlation with the synchronisation error and, consequently, the bias can be estimated via this error. The second application is related to the synchronisation of the cantilevers commonly found in ENs and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). It is suggested to use a novel scheme of coupled master{slave cantilevers and, estimate the difference in cantilever-surface interactions in master oscillator and in slave oscillator via measuring the synchronisation error. The scheme is particularly useful for using the master cantilever as a control and the slave cantilever as a unit device which measures surface properties. The study shows that by calculating the error of synchronisation, a precise measurements can be conducted when two cantilevers leave the synchronous region, that is when they de-synchronise. Thus, this thesis also contributes to the understanding of de-synchronisation of nano-scale chaotic systems (Nano electromechanical Systems) in respect to the addition of an external bias and/or parameters mismatch by outlining the possible applications.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1603392812", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109458517"}

However, the TWSVM obtains the final classifier by giving the same importance to all training samples which may be important for classification performance. In order to address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel entropy-based fuzzy twin bounded support vector machine (EFTBSVM) for binary classification problems.

Depending on how a gripper grasps a structural member, defined as the Angle-of-Approach (AoA), the extracted tactile data can result in erroneous identifications due to the similarities in beam cross-sectional shapes and sizes. In these cases, further grasps at favorable Angles-of-Approach (AoAs) are required to correctly identify the beam member and its properties. This paper presents an information-based method which uses tactile data to determine the next best AoA for the identification of beam members in truss structures. The method is used in conjunction with a state estimate of beam shape, dimension, and AoA calculated by a Random Forest classifier.

The review of text classification models has shown that Support Vector Machines have very often outperformed other classic machine learning algorithms, while word and character n-gram features have performed well with varying prediction performances in different contexts. This paper therefore evaluated the performance of different parameter settings of Support Vector Machines and n-gram features for detection of toxic South African tweets, with a view to hybridize the best among the classifiers. Different combinations of word and character n- gram features were used for the classification. The results show that the Support Vector Machine classifier with set of unigram and bigram as well as set of character n-gram with length sizes from 3 to 7 perform best. By combining the classifiers, the accuracy and F-measure improve from the initial highest Accuracy and F-Measure scores of 0.9085 and 0.94, respectively to 0.9095 and 0.95.

This creates a tremendous challenge for pattern recognition techniques, which need to be more efficient without losing their effectiveness. We have tried to circumvent the problem by reducing it into the fast computation of an optimum-path forest (OPF) in a graph derived from the training samples. In this forest, each class may be represented by multiple trees rooted at some representative samples. The forest is a classifier that assigns to a new sample the label of its most strongly connected root. The methodology has been successfully used with different graph topologies and learning techniques. In this work, we have focused on one of the supervised approaches, which has offered considerable advantages over Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks to handle large datasets. We propose (i) a new algorithm that speeds up classification and (ii) a solution to reduce the training set size with negligible effects on the accuracy of classification, therefore further increasing its efficiency. Experimental results show the improvements with respect to our previous approach and advantages over other existing methods, which make the new method a valuable contribution for large dataset analysis.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2011.07.013", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2096411924", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15945657", "15465957", "59575788", "206787478", "60577818", "2483269", "14227081", "3116168", "7045013", "44693224", "61771446", "206433377", "31073001", "16720359", "16819429", "15230585", "12529836", "8720594", "2943668", "2973956", "40361262", "961425", "59849738"], "inbound_citations": ["3397794", "1762088", "7867014", "7867014", "68031879", "12190596", "57617057", "17309821", "88488996", "8507491", "8795757", "16484421", "27142647", "1027749", "13885679", "120171531", "210932318", "39691789", "36431270", "4352377", "3445125", "7655526", "58618581", "58672192", "33668455", "54435093", "133186988", "203605997", "16986680", "52987070", "7773875", "15570950", "27925566", "10879465", "10016140", "11859683", "58821958", "18218022", "116823835", "7262505", "17125487", "14787968", "9687384", "38553592", "206436261", "8192913", "53565067", "35843011", "14558461", "174806989", "10603464", "11265862", "24171103", "115283826", "215225673", "53228765", "38348345", "13686820", "45894677", "7892604", "23464437", "1299871", "8888319", "56598360", "125791730", "18233280", "33815481", "28494627", "24695150", "1439816", "22845780", "24206708", "3306755", "13506067", "52127863", "58676148", "24314533", "58673048", "40179469", "12018604", "14415472", "1486848", "37105281", "9146911", "274424", "17316664", "12000674", "2367936", "18023944", "37431164", "507025", "15329467", "14804376", "10423747", "13275740", "22679285", "33666034", "17138113", "9610520", "14508022", "15135141", "3504378", "1238857", "80628086", "52984252", "7685931", "8218124", "10204104"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16258268"}

Even though P and T waves reveal very useful information, their accurate detection is a difficult and challenging task on account of noise, baseline drift and odd morphologies. The need for a rapid and effective detection algorithm motivated us to propose two automated methods: the percentile based Automatic Detection (pAD) and the Graphical based Automatic Detection (gAD). Both algorithms use statistical and probabilistic concepts to achieve adequate delineation and detection of the waves. The former uses the percentile as an adaptive threshold to define the location of these waves. The latter uses a \"feature wave-bank\" to train a graphical probabilistic model named as Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF). The gAD algorithm takes advantage of the monotonicity and the slope of an ECG to detect and collect waves, which imports to the graphical model and classifies them to P or T waves. The efficiency of our proposed algorithms has been evaluated on 10 long-term (24-hour) ECG recordings of MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database.

Two sets of simulation studies are reported, which demonstrate both the power and the psychological validity of this approach. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great promise as a model of learning in complex, dynamic tasks, for both humans and artificial systems. However, the effectiveness of RL models depends strongly on the choice of state representation, because this determines how knowledge is generalized among states. We introduce a framework for integrating psychological mechanisms of representation learning that allows RL to autonomously adapt its representation to suit its needs and thereby speed learning. One such model is formalized, based on learned selective attention among stimulus dimensions. The model significantly outperforms standard RL models and provides a good fit to human data. Reinforcement Learning RL comprises a family of algorithms for learning optimal action in dynamic environments. RL models characterize a task as a Markov Decision Process, in which the environment at any moment exists in one of a set of states, each associated with a set of actions available to the learner. The chosen action determines both the immediate reward received, if any, and the state of the environment on the next time step. This general framework encompasses most tasks of psychological interest (Sutton & Barto, 1998). The key insight behind most RL algorithms is to learn a value for each possible state or action. This value represents the total future reward that can be expected starting from that point. Formally, given any state s and action a, the state-action value is defined as Q(s, a) = E \uf8ef \u2211 \u03b3 k r t+k s t = s, a t = a \uf8fa , \uf8f0 k\u22650 Keywords: Reinforcement learning; attention; generalization Introduction Most challenging tasks people face are inherently dynamic and interactive. Choices affect not just immediate outcomes but also future events, and hence subsequent decisions that must be made. Normative and descriptive theories of learning in dynamic environments have advanced dramatically in recent years with the development of Reinforcement Learning (RL), a mathematical and computational theory drawing on machine learning, psychology, and neuroscience (e.g., Schultz, Dayan, & Montague, 1997; Sutton & Barto, 1998). However, RL currently faces a fundamental challenge relating to the issue of knowledge representation. Dynamic tasks tend to be highly complex, with an enormous number of possible states (situations) that can arise. Therefore, efficient learning must rely on generalization from past states that are similar to the current one. Similarity, in turn, depends on how states are represented, including the features by which they are encoded and the relative attention allocated to those features (Medin, Goldstone, & Gentner, 1993). Thus representation is critical to the effectiveness of RL algorithms, because representation determines the pattern of generalization by which past experience is used to make new decisions. Although there has been little research on representation in the context of RL, representation and representation learning have long been topics of psychological study. Empirical research in a number of domains, including perceptual learning, attention, categorization, object recognition, and analogy, has uncovered principles and mechanisms by which people learn to modify how they encode objects and situations in the service of learning, inference, and decision making. Here we describe a framework for a natural synthesis of these ideas with RL algorithms, which leads to models that learn representations for dynamic tasks. A specific model is presented that is where t is the current timestep; s, a, and r are the state, action, and received reward on each step; and \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] is a \u20ac discount factor representing the relative value of immediate versus delayed rewards. This approach allows action selection to be based directly on the Q-values. Here we use a Luce-choice or Gibbs-sampling rule, with inverse- temperature parameter \u03b8. P(a t = a) \u221d e \u03b8 \u22c5Q(s t ,a) Once an action is selected, its value is updated according to the immediate reward and the values associated with the \u20ac state that follows. One of the best-studied algorithms for learning action values, Q-learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992), uses the update rule \u0394Q(s t , a t ) = e val \u22c5 \u03b4 , where e val \u2208 (0, 1] is a learning rate, and \u03b4 is the temporal- difference (TD) error, defined as \u03b4 = r t + \u03b3 \u22c5 max { Q(s t+1 , a) } \u2212 Q(s t , a t ) . a The TD error represents the difference between the original action-value estimate, Q(s t , a t ), and a new estimate \u20ac based on the immediate reward and ensuing state. The expression max a {Q(s t+1 , a)} represents an estimate of the value of the new state, s t+1 , based on the best action that could be performed in that state.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "86588979", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5135932", "14727192", "875526", "6461523", "14264990", "26166298", "5788356", "15750779", "16355329", "27148249", "16399602", "62537074", "8869524", "2635253", "143465599", "9166388"], "inbound_citations": ["14374191", "164729", "32088372", "72333116", "52345270", "36812297", "202749395", "5135932", "4654037", "30453355", "3288563", "18446484"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8699116"}

In this paper, a technique based on multiobjective optimization for automatic selection of classifier, its parameters and feature combinations is used for classifying the miRNAs. The proposed approach is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a multiobjective framework in combination with four different classifiers namely Random Tree (RT), Random Forest (RF), Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), and Logistic Regression is used. The multiobjective based framework is capable of automatically determining the appropriate classifier, its different parameter combinations and feature combinations for any classification problem. The proposed approach is very generic and can be solved using any multiobjective evolutionary approach. But in the current study the search capability of popular NSGA-II is used. A new encoding strategy is proposed in the current paper to represent all the relevant information (classifier type, parameter combination, feature combination) in the form of a chromosome. Several different mutation operators are developed to accelerate the search process.

Conventional machine learning or data mining methods are not suitable to handle such larger streaming real-time data. This is primarily due to latencies associated with cloud environments (e.g., at an aggregator or PDC level), and thus necessitates the need for local computing to move the data on the edge (or locally at the PMU level) for processing. This requires faster real-time streaming algorithms to be processed at the local level (e.g., typically by a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based controllers).

Latent variable models have increasingly gained attention for the statistical modeling of knowledge graphs, showing promising results in tasks related to knowledge graph completion and cleaning. Besides storing facts about the world, schema-based knowledge graphs are backed by rich semantic descriptions of entities and relation-types that allow machines to understand the notion of things and their semantic relationships. In this work, we study how type-constraints can generally support the statistical modeling with latent variable models. More precisely, we integrated prior knowledge in form of type-constraints in various state of the art latent variable approaches. Our experimental results show that prior knowledge on relation-types significantly improves these models up to 77% in link-prediction tasks. The achieved improvements are especially prominent when a low model complexity is enforced, a crucial requirement when these models are applied to very large datasets. Unfortunately, type-constraints are neither always available nor always complete e.g., they can become fuzzy when entities lack proper typing.

GANs create impressive data primarily through a new type of operator called deconvolution (DeConv) or transposed convolution (Conv). To implement the DeConv layer in hardware, the state-of-the-art accelerator reduces the high computational complexity via the DeConv-to-Conv conversion and achieves the same results. However, there is a problem that the number of filters increases due to this conversion. Recently, Winograd minimal filtering has been recognized as an effective solution to improve the arithmetic complexity and resource efficiency of the Conv layer. In this paper, we propose an efficient Winograd DeConv accelerator that combines these two orthogonal approaches on FPGAs. Firstly, we introduce a new class of fast algorithm for DeConv layers using Winograd minimal filtering. Since there are regular sparse patterns in Winograd filters, we further amortize the computational complexity by skipping zero weights. Secondly, we propose a new dataflow to prevent resource underutilization by reorganizing the filter layout in the Winograd domain. Finally, we propose an efficient architecture for implementing Winograd DeConv by designing the line buffer and exploring the design space.

VR-Trees are able to span from the conventional deterministic trees to the complete-random trees using a probabilistic parameter.

Among the 35 selected candidates, three hits were identified, such as quinazoline compound 1 (KIN-1; N4-[7-chloro-2-[(E)-styryl]quinazolin-4-yl]-N1,N1-diethylpentane-1,4-diamine), which was found to inhibit CaMKII\u03b4 kinase activity at single-digit micromolar IC50 . Activity across the kinome was assessed by profiling analogues of 1, namely 6 (KIN-236; N4-[7-chloro-2-[(E)-2-(2-chloro-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)vinyl]quinazolin-4-yl]-N1,N1-diethylpentane-1,4-diamine), and an analogue of hit compound 2 (KIN-15; 2-[4-[(E)-[(5-bromobenzofuran-2-carbonyl)hydrazono]methyl]-2-chloro-6-methoxyphenoxy]acetic acid), namely 14 (KIN-332; N-[(E)-[4-(2-anilino-2-oxoethoxy)-3-chlorophenyl]methyleneamino]benzofuran-2-carboxamide), against 337 kinases. Interestingly, for compound 6, CaMKII\u03b4 and homologue CaMKII\u03b3 were among the top ten targets. Among the top 25 targets of 6, IC50 values ranged from 5 to 22 \u03bcm. Compound 14 was found to be not specific toward CaMKII kinases, but it does inhibit two kinases with sub-micromolar IC50 values among the top 25. Derivatives of 1 were tested against several kinases including several members of the CaMK family. These data afforded a limited structure-activity relationship study.

Recently, a study has demonstrated that the presence or absence of all isomiRs could efficiently discriminate amongst 32 TCGA cancer types. Besides, an effective reduction of distinguishing isomiR features for multiclass tumor discrimination must have a major impact on our understanding of the disease and treatment of cancer.MethodsIn this study, we have constructed a combination of the genetic algorithms (GA) with Random Forest (RF) algorithms to detect reliable sets of cancer-associated 5\u2019isomiRs from TCGA isomiR expression data for multiclass tumor classification.ResultsWe obtained 100 sets of the optimal predictive features, each of which comprised of 50\u20135\u2019isomiRs that could effectively classify with an average sensitivity of 92% samples from 32 different tumor types. We calculated the frequency with which a 5\u2019isomiR found in these sets as measuring its importance for tumor classification. Many highly frequent 5\u2019isomiRs with different 5\u2032 loci from canonical miRNAs were detected in these sets, supporting that the isomiRs play a significant role in the multiclass tumor classification. The further functional enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of the 10 most frequently appearing 5\u2019isomiRs were involved in the activity of transcription activator and protein kinase and cell-cell adhesion.ConclusionsThe findings of the present study indicated that the 5\u2019isomiRs might be employed for multiclass tumor classification and the suggested that GA/RF model could perform effective tumor classification by a series of largely independent optimal predictor 5\u2032 isomiR sets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6367816", "pubmed_id": "30732570", "doi": "10.1186/s12885-019-5340-y", "venue": "BMC Cancer", "journal": "BMC Cancer", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2922188578", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["38405512", "1282553", "7694246", "26288408", "8431485", "207626729", "22526455", "45201738", "215575827", "22876678", "4533307", "9762727", "21776894", "9725569", "215018092", "215224318", "284937", "49321106", "3408979", "15315839", "15611834", "16715576", "18539587", "13158158", "2885905", "1325919", "4416000", "1138568", "3737846", "215689404", "209592360", "10418677", "14847796", "2085071"], "inbound_citations": ["211829355", "215439418", "209409806"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59616584"}

A range of learning parameters are analysed including the number of Guassian mixtures, support vector kernels including linear, radial basis function Kernel (RBF) and polynormial kernel (poly), and the order of RBF kernel and polynormial kernel.

In this paper, we proposed a robust approach with convex optimization to \"forge\" a graph: with an input of a graph, to learn a graph with higher quality. Our major concern is that an ideal graph shall satisfy all the following constraints: non-negative, symmetric, low rank, and positive semidefinite. We develop a graph learning algorithm by solving a convex optimization problem and further develop an efficient optimization to obtain global optimal solutions with theoretical guarantees.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a novel tool increasingly used in schizophrenia research. Recent advances in statistical learning theory have led to applying pattern classification algorithms to access the diagnostic value of functional brain networks, discovered from resting state fMRI data. The aim of this study was to propose an adaptive learning algorithm to distinguish schizophrenia patients from normal controls using resting-state functional language network. Furthermore, here the classification of schizophrenia was regarded as a sample selection problem where a sparse subset of samples was chosen from the labele d training set. Using these selected samples, which we call informative vectors, a classifier for the clinic diagnosis of schizophrenia was established. We experimentally demonstrated that the proposed algorithm incorporating resting-state functional language network achieved 83.6% leave-one-out accuracy on resting-state fMRI data of 27 schizophrenia patients and 28 normal controls. In contrast with K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and l1-norm, our method yielded better classification performance. Moreover, our results suggested that a dysfunction of resting-state functional language network plays an important role in the clinic diagnosis of schizophrenia.

In feature selection, 15 feature algorithms in time domain, time-frequency domain, and nonlinearity are selected to obtain 30 feature parameters.

Unfortunately, the discovery of synergistic combinations by purely experimental means is only feasible on small sets of drugs. In silico modeling methods can substantially widen this search by providing tools able to predict which of all possible combinations in a large compound library are synergistic. Here we investigate to which extent drug combination synergy can be predicted by exploiting the largest available dataset to date (NCI-ALMANAC, with over 290,000 synergy determinations). Methods Each cell line is modeled using primarily two machine learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), on the datasets provided by NCI-ALMANAC. This large-scale predictive modeling study comprises more than 5000 pair-wise drug combinations, 60 cell lines, 4 types of models and 5 types of chemical features. The application of a powerful, yet uncommonly used, RF-specific technique for reliability prediction is also investigated. Results The evaluation of these models shows that it is possible to predict the synergy of unseen drug combinations with high accuracy (Pearson correlations between 0.43 and 0.86 depending on the considered cell line, with XGBoost providing slightly better predictions than RF). We have also found that restricting to the most reliable synergy predictions results in at least two-fold error decrease with respect to employing the best learning algorithm without any reliability estimation.

These results are necessary, but not sufficient, for ILP to be adopted as a tool for data analysis in an era of very large machine-generated scientific and industrial datasets, accompanied by programs that provide ready access to complex relational information in machine-readable forms (ontologies, parsers, and so on). Besides the usual issues about the ease of use, ILP is now confronted with questions of implementation. We are concerned here with two of these, namely: can an ILP system construct models efficiently when (a) Dataset sizes are too large to fit in the memory of a single machine; and (b) Search space sizes becomes prohibitively large to explore using a single machine. In this paper, we examine the applicability to ILP of a popular distributed computing approach that provides a uniform way for performing data and task parallel computations in ILP. The MapReduce programming model allows, in principle, very large numbers of processors to be used without any special understanding of the underlying hardware or software involved. Specifically, we show how the MapReduce approach can be used to perform the coverage-test that is at the heart of many ILP systems, and to perform multiple searches required by a greedy set-covering algorithm used by some popular ILP systems. Our principal findings with synthetic and real-world datasets for both data and task parallelism are these: (a) Ignoring overheads, the time to perform the computations concurrently increases with the size of the dataset for data parallelism and with the size of the search space for task parallelism. For data parallelism this increase is roughly in proportion to increases in dataset size; (b) If a MapReduce implementation is used as part of an ILP system, then benefits for data parallelism can only be expected above some minimal dataset size, and for task parallelism can only be expected above some minimal search-space size; and (c) The MapReduce approach appears better suited to exploit data-parallelism in ILP.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-011-5245-8", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1970217364", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12933684", "1341209", "30243473", "59755487", "62963320", "62963320", "13095088", "6489412", "185359896", "207166250", "5673972", "5055340", "14456048", "10801901", "6392609", "16875156", "682510", "14030356", "8235202", "3811264", "12643399", "14992676", "457364", "8239878", "1782025", "1113621", "27665754", "12615546", "17685536", "2211677"], "inbound_citations": ["2612917", "9751702", "30504903", "5829163", "3400598", "57662695", "46958511", "64664126", "12912512", "20217152", "16320789", "14634473", "3196617", "29085246", "17130757", "40159517", "11674561", "37814185", "54005641", "16312476", "40231674", "16568440", "205460333", "25619084", "1285298", "1626918", "34028114", "206776191", "7092943", "52218628"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17632749"}

The paper deals with the classification of an Earth Observing\u20131 Hyperion image of the mangrove area of Bhitarkanika National Park, Odisha, India into mangrove floristic composition classes. Out of 196 calibrated bands of the image, 56 were found to be highly uncorrelated and contained maximum information; therefore, these 56 bands were used for classification. Amongst the three full\u2013pixel classifiers tested in the investigation, Support Vector Machine produced the best results in terms of training pixel accuracy with overall precision of 96.85 %, in comparison to about 70\u201372.0 % for the other two classifiers. A total of five mangrove classes were obtained \u2013 pure or dominant class of Heritiera fomes, mixed class of H. fomes, mixed Excoecaria agallocha with Avicennia officinalis, mixed class of fringing Sonneratia apetala and class comprising of mangrove associates with salt resistant grasses. Post\u2013classification field data also established the same. Pure or dominant classes of H. fomes occupied more than 50 % of the total mangrove vegetation in the forest blocks of the National Park. Spectral profile matching of image pixels with that of in\u2013situ collected canopy reflectance profile revealed good match for H. fomes (pure or dominant stands). Red\u2013edge index, which was a preferred criterion for matching was notably correlated in case of H. fomes and E. agallocha.

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic.

Traditional signal processing (SP) methods are less effective due to noises and interferences from different sources and incipient faults which remain active for a short time with a particular frequency. In recent times, SP techniques along with artificial intelligence methods are being used for fault classification. Various complex approaches in SP domain have used for feature extraction of the vibration data to design a feature set. A challenging task is to select dominant features from the available feature set for improving the accuracy of fault classification. Thus, motivated by spectral kurtosis (SK) and extreme learning machine (ELM), we propose a novel intelligent diagnosis method for fault classification of rotating machines. In this paper, SK is used as an input feature set to avoid the task of finding the dominant feature set. The extracted features are fed to ELM for fault identification. However, ELM performance primarily depends upon the hidden node parameters and the number of hidden nodes. The selection of optimum ELM parameters for good performance is an open issue. Therefore, modified bidirectional search with local search method is proposed to determine the optimum set of ELM parameters. The developed method is tested on two vibration data sets of rolling element bearings. We examined the significance of SK as a feature set and improved ELM in comparison with traditional methods.

However, the GIS tools still use a fixed 3-by-3 window to evaluate attributes such as slope, elevation and curvature. These tools do not scale well to a 5m DEM resolution compared to 30m resolution used earlier. Results generated usually contain a lot of noise. To overcome this problem researchers prefer to resample DEMs to a lower resolution which in turn decreases their accuracy. In this paper we test the efficiency of sliding window-based aggregation technique on DEM derived attributes on a multi-scalar level. We use an iterative aggregation algorithm to obtain these attributes for multiple window sizes 4, 8 and 16. Results obtained from previous iteration are reused in the next iteration. Hence, we achieve logarithmic efficiency compared to the existing resampling technique in ArcMap. Results are compared with resampled DEM data at window sizes 3, 9 and 15. Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood classification have been applied to all the outputs with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the dependent variable. Classification on results from the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy compared to traditional resampling technique. Window size 4 produces the highest accuracy of 74.47% using the Random Forest based classification compared to 46.31% generated using output from ArcMap. The accuracy remains fairly consistent across all the window sizes for the proposed method while the classification accuracy generated from resampled data falls drastically with higher window size.

This advancement would allow early patient treatment and enrollment into clinical trials, both of which would greatly facilitate the development of new therapies for PD. Methods Sera from a total of 398 subjects, including 103 early-stage PD subjects derived from the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP) study, were screened with human protein microarrays containing 9,486 potential antigen targets to identify autoantibodies potentially useful as biomarkers for PD. A panel of selected autoantibodies with a higher prevalence in early-stage PD was identified and tested using Random Forest for its ability to distinguish early-stage PD subjects from controls and from individuals with other neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative diseases. Results Results demonstrate that a panel of selected, blood-borne autoantibody biomarkers can distinguish early-stage PD subjects (90% confidence in diagnosis) from age- and sex-matched controls with an overall accuracy of 87.9%, a sensitivity of 94.1% and specificity of 85.5%. These biomarkers were also capable of differentiating patients with early-stage PD from those with more advanced (mild-moderate) PD with an overall accuracy of 97.5%, and could distinguish subjects with early-stage PD from those with other neurological (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis) and non-neurological (e.g., breast cancer) diseases.

This airborne scanner is a 288-channel imaging spectrometer operating in the wavelength range 0.4-2.5 \u00b5m. For reference patterns of forest and non-forest vegetation, maps (provided by the Polish Karkonosze National Park) were chosen. Terrain recognition was based on field walks with a Trimble GeoXT GPS receiver. It allowed test and validation dominant polygons of 15 classes of vegetation communities to be selected, which were used in the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification. The SVM classifier is a type of machine used for pattern recognition. The result is a post classification map with statistics (total, user, producer accuracies, kappa coefficient and error matrix). Assessment of the statistics shows that almost all the classes were properly recognised, excluding the fern community. The overall classification accuracy is 79.13% and the kappa coefficient is 0.77.

It involves identification of certain entities from text and their classification into some predefined categories. In the biomedical community, there is yet no general consensus regarding named entity (NE) annotation; thus, it is very difficult to compare the existing systems due to corpus incompatibilities. Due to this problem we can not also exploit the advantages of using different corpora together. In our present work we address the issues of corpus compatibilities, and use a single objective optimization (SOO) based classifier ensemble technique that uses the search capability of genetic algorithm (GA) for NE extraction in biomedicine. We hypothesize that the reliability of predictions of each classifier differs among the various output classes. We use Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) frameworks to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the set of features and/or feature templates. It is to be noted that we tried to extract the features without using any deep domain knowledge and/or resources.ResultsIn order to assess the challenges of corpus compatibilities, we experiment with the different benchmark datasets and their various combinations. Comparison results with the existing approaches prove the efficacy of the used technique. GA based ensemble achieves around 2% performance improvements over the individual classifiers. Degradation in performance on the integrated corpus clearly shows the difficulties of the task.ConclusionsIn summary, our used ensemble based approach attains the state-of-the-art performance levels for entity extraction in three different kinds of biomedical datasets.

In the case of forested areas, the extracted elevation values appear to be somewhere between the ground surface and the top of the canopy, depending on the forest characteristics. If the ground surface elevations are known by using a Digital Terrain Model derived from Airborne Laser Scanning surveys, it is possible to obtain information related to forest resources. To the best of our knowledge, this paper, presents the first attempt to obtain forest variables at plot level based on TerraSAR-X stereo SAR images (non-interferometric data). The study set consisted of 109 circular test plots for which forest variables were observed by performing tree-specific measurements. The statistical features were calculated for each test plot from the elevation values extracted from stereo SAR data. This was followed by predicting field-observed plot-level forest variables from the features derived from stereo SAR data using the Nearest Neighbors approach which employs the Random Forest technique in selection of the nearest neighbors. The relative errors (RMSE%) for predicting the stem volume, basal area, mean forest canopy height, and mean diameter values were 34.0%, 29.0%, 14.0%, and 19.7%, respectively.

Many text learning methods have been proposed, like statistics-based methods, semantic similarity methods, and deep learning methods.

Semantic similarity methods learn a text representation by training word embedding and representing text as the average vector of all words. However, these methods cannot capture the topic diversity of words and texts clearly. Recently, deep learning methods such as CNNs and RNNs have been studied. However, the vanishing gradient problem and time complexity for parameter selection limit their applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient text learning framework, named Latent Topic Text Representation Learning.

With the assumption that words on the same topic follow a Gaussian distribution, texts are represented as a mixture of topics, i.e., a Gaussian mixture model.

We evaluated the techniques on simulated data generated to mimic global untargeted metabolomics data by incorporating realistic block-wise correlation and partial correlation structures for mimicking the correlations and metabolite clustering generated by biological processes.

The presence of non-normal error distributions and the effect of prior-significance filtering (dimension reduction) were evaluated. In each simulation, classifier parameters (such as the number of hidden nodes in a neural network) were tuned by cross-validation to minimize the probability of detecting spurious results due to poorly tuned classifiers. Classifier performance was then evaluated using real clinical metabolomics datasets of varying sample medium, sample size, and experimental design. We report that in the scenarios without a significant presence of non-normal error distributions over metabolite clusters, Neural Network and PLS-DA classifiers performed poorly relative to Sparse PLS-DA (sPLS-DA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers. When non-normal error distributions were introduced, the performance of PLS-DA classifiers deteriorated further relative to the remaining techniques.

Most successful deep neural models are the ones with many layers which highly increases their number of parameters. Training such models requires a large number of training samples which is not always available. One of the fundamental issues in neural networks is overfitting which is the issue tackled in this thesis. Such problem often occurs when the training of large models is performed using few training samples. Many approaches have been proposed to prevent the network from overfitting and improve its generalization performance such as data augmentation, early stopping, parameters sharing, unsupervised learning, dropout, batch normalization, etc. In this thesis, we tackle the neural network overfitting issue from a representation learning perspective by considering the situation where few training samples are available which is the case of many real world applications. We propose three contributions. The first one presented in chapter 2 is dedicated to dealing with structured output problems to perform multivariate regression when the output variable y contains structural dependencies between its components. The second contribution described in chapter 3 deals with the classification task where we propose to exploit prior knowledge about the internal representation of the hidden layers in neural networks. Our last contribution presented in chapter 4 showed the interest of transfer learning in applications where only few samples are available. In this contribution, we provide an automatic system based on such learning scheme with an application to medical domain.

The class imbalance problem exists when the number of instances present in a class (or classes) is significantly fewer than the number of instances belonging to another class (or classes). Sufficiently recognizing the minority class during classification is a problem as most algorithms employed to learn from data input are biased toward the majority class. The underlying issue is made more complex with the presence of data difficult factors embedded in such data input. This paper presents a novel and effective ensemble-based method for dealing with the class imbalance problem. This paper is motivated by the idea of moving the oversampling from the data level to the algorithm level, instead of increasing the minority instances in the data sets, the algorithms in this paper aims to \u201coversample the classification ensemble\u201d by increasing the number of classifiers that represent the minority class in the ensemble, i.e., random forest.

Several species are known to be involved in crop damage and in the epidemiology of several human and cattle diseases. Due to the existence of sibling species their identification is often problematic. Thus an easy, fast and accurate species identification tool is needed for non-systematicians to correctly identify Praomyini species. In this study we compare the usefulness of three genes (16S, Cytb, CO1) for identifying species of this tribe. A total of 426 specimens representing 40 species (sampled across their geographical range) were sequenced for the three genes. Nearly all of the species included in our study are monophyletic in the neighbour joining trees. The degree of intra-specific variability tends to be lower than the divergence between species, but no barcoding gap is detected. The success rate of the statistical methods of species identification is excellent (up to 99% or 100% for statistical supervised classification methods as the k-Nearest Neighbour or Random Forest). The 16S gene is 2.5 less variable than the Cytb and CO1 genes. As a result its discriminatory power is smaller. To sum up, our results suggest that using DNA markers for identifying species in the Praomyini tribe is a largely valid approach, and that the CO1 and Cytb genes are better DNA markers than the 16S gene. Our results confirm the usefulness of statistical methods such as the Random Forest and the 1-NN methods to assign a sequence to a species, even when the number of species is relatively large.

CML belongs to the domain of neural-symbolic integration, which concerns the application of problem-specific symbolic knowledge within the neurocomputing paradigm. In CML, one may represent, reason or learn modal logics using a neural network. This is achieved by a Modalities Algorithm that translates modal logic programs into neural network ensembles. We show that the translation is sound, i.e. the network ensemble computes a fixed-point meaning of the original modal program, acting as a distributed computational model for modal logic. We also show that the fixed-point computation terminates whenever the modal program is well-behaved. Finally, we validate CML as a computational model for integrated knowledge representation and learning by applying it to a well-known testbed for distributed knowledge representation.

However, there are two inevitable problems in nonlinear time series prediction using the standard ESN. One is that its prediction ability reaches a saturation point as the reservoir size is increased. The other is that its prediction ability depends heavily on hyperparameter values.

Both machine learning methods outperformed the state-of-the-art linear multipole electromagnet method (LMEM). The RF and the ANN model reduced the root mean squared error of the LMEM when predicting the field magnitude by around 40% and 80%, respectively, over the entire current range of the eMNS. At high current regions, especially between 30 and 35 A, the field-magnitude RMSE improvement of the ANN model over the LMEM was over 35 mT. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning methods to model an eMNS for medical applications, and its ability to account for complex nonlinear behavior at high currents. The use of machine learning thus shows promise for improving surgical procedures that use magnetic navigation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.12028", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2975142752,3026219154,3014688668,3005325671", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["18180049", "22780031", "57762490", "59620250", "3059083", "39781191", "7107409", "18913143", "6493662", "62794269", "20510525", "12695087", "56174112", "5884351", "89141", "10659969", "24876842", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202888984"}

Traditional methods for gene selection in classification problems have several drawbacks. First, the majority of the gene selection approaches for classification are single-gene based. Second, many of the gene selection procedures are not embedded within the algorithm itself. The technique of random forests has been found to perform well in high-dimensional data settings with survival outcomes. It also has an embedded feature to identify variables of importance. Therefore, it is an ideal candidate for gene selection in high-dimensional data with survival outcomes. In this paper, we develop a novel method based on the random forests to identify a set of prognostic genes. We compare our method with several machine learning methods and various node split criteria using several real data sets. Our method performed well in both simulations and real data analysis.

This will be followed by a short account of individual intelligent technologies within the scope of EUNITE and their potential combinations which are perceived as good candidates for constructing systems with a degree of adaptiveness and intelligence. The chapters in the first part of the book cover some of these intelligent technologies like artificial neural networks, fuzzy expert systems, machine and reinforcement learning, evolutionary computing and various hybridizations in more detail. As it has proved throughout the life span of EUNITE it was not an easy task to agree on the definitions of what adaptive and smart systems are and therefore some compromise have had to be reached. As a result the definitions of three levels of adaptivity and some interpretations of the word smart adopted within EUNITE are given first. We then look at more general requirements of intelligent (smart) adaptive systems of the future and discuss some of the issues using the example of Evolutionary Connectionist Systems (ECOS) framework. Within this general framework and the scope of the book in the remaining sections we then concentrate on short description of existing methods for adaptation and learning, issues to do with model selection and combination and conflicting goals of having systems that can adapt to new/changing environments and at the same time have provable stability and robustness characteristics.

Previous research in animal models has demonstrated that the severity of HSV-1 ocular disease is influenced by three main factors: host innate immunity, host immune response, and viral strain. We have previously shown that mixed infection with two avirulent HSV-1 strains (OD4 and CJ994) results in recombinants with a wide range of ocular disease phenotype severity. Recently, we developed a quantitative trait locus (QTL)-based computational approach (vQTLmap) to identify viral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predicted to influence the severity of the ocular disease phenotypes. We have now applied vQTLmap to identify HSV-1 SNPs associated with corneal neovascularization and mean peak percentage weight loss (MPWL) using 65 HSV-1 OD4-CJ994 recombinants. The vQTLmap analysis using Random Forest for neovascularization identified phenotypically meaningful nonsynonymous SNPs in the ICP4, UL41 (VHS), UL42, UL46 (VP11/12), UL47 (VP13/14), UL48 (VP22), US3, US4 (gG), US6 (gD), and US7 (gI) coding regions. The ICP4 gene was previously identified as a corneal neovascularization determinant, validating the vQTLmap method. Further analysis detected an epistatic interaction for neovascularization between a segment of the unique long (UL) region and a segment of the inverted repeat short (IRS)/unique short (US) region. Ridge regression was used to identify MPWL-associated nonsynonymous SNPs in the UL1 (gL), UL2, UL4, UL49 (VP22), UL50, and ICP4 coding regions. The data provide additional insights into virulence gene and epistatic interaction discovery in HSV-1.Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) typically causes recurrent cold sores; however, it is also the leading source of infectious blindness in developed countries. Corneal neovascularization is critical for the progression of blinding ocular disease, and weight loss is a measure of infection severity. Previous HSV-1 animal virulence studies have shown that the severity of ocular disease is partially due to the viral strain. In the current study, we used a recently described computational quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach in conjunction with 65 HSV-1 recombinants to identify viral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in neovascularization and weight loss. Neovascularization SNPs were identified in the ICP4, VHS, UL42, VP11/12, VP13/14, VP22, gG, US3, gD, and gI genes. Further analysis revealed an epistatic interaction between the UL and US regions.

Facial expressions are communicated by subtle changes in one or more discrete features such as tightening the lips, raising the eyebrows, opening and closing of eyes or certain combination of them, which can be identified through monitoring the changes in muscles movements (Action Units), located around the regions of mouth, eyes and eyebrows. An analytic representation of face with fifteen feature points describing the geometric and physical (muscle) model of facial expression structure has been used that represents and identifies the principal muscle actions and also provides visual observation (sensing) of the discrete features responsible for each of the seven basic human emotions. Feature points from the region of mouth have been detected by segmenting the lip contour applying a newly introduced variational formulation of the existing level set method. In addition, a multi-detector approach of facial feature point detection has been utilized for identifying the points of interest from the regions of eyes, eyebrows and nose. The feature vector composed of fifteen features is then obtained with respect to the average representation of neutral face by calculating the degree of displacement of five different pairs of points, and measuring the deviations of ten points from a non-changeable rigid point. Finally, the obtained feature sets are used to train a Multi-Class SVM classifier.

Computational experiments showed that information encoded in miRNAs is not sufficient to classify cancers; gut-derived samples cluster more accurately when using mRNA expression profiles compared with using miRNA profiles; and poorly differentiated tumors (PDT) could be classified by mRNA expression profiles at the accuracy of 100% versus 93.8% when using miRNA profiles.

Imaging spectroscopy has been recognized as a suitable tool for soil erosion assessment in recent years. In our study, we bring an approach for assessment of soil degradation by erosion by means of determining soil erosion classes representing soils differently influenced by erosion impact. The adopted methods include extensive field sampling, laboratory analysis, predictive modelling of selected soil surface properties using aerial hyperspectral data and the digital elevation model and fuzzy classification. Different multivariate regression techniques (Partial Least Square, Support Vector Machine, Random forest and Artificial neural network) were applied in the predictive modelling of soil properties. The properties with satisfying performance (R2 > 0.5) were used as input data in erosion classes determination by fuzzy C-means classification method. The study was performed at four study sites about 1 km2 large representing the most extensive soil units of the agricultural land in the Czech Republic (Chernozems and Luvisols on loess and Cambisols and Stagnosols on crystalline rocks). The influence of site-specific conditions on prediction of soil properties and classification of erosion classes was assessed. The prediction accuracy (R2) of the best performing models predicting the soil properties varies in range 0.8\u20130.91 for soil organic carbon content, 0.21\u20130.67 for sand content, 0.4\u20130.92 for silt content, 0.38\u20130.89 for clay content, 0.73\u2013089 for Feox, 0.59\u20130.78 for Fed and 0.82 for CaCO3. The performance and suitability of different properties for erosion classes\u2019 classification are highly variable at the study sites. Soil organic carbon was the most frequently used as the erosion classes\u2019 predictor, while the textural classes showed lower applicability. The presented approach was successfully applied in Chernozem and Luvisol loess regions where the erosion classes were assessed with a good overall accuracy (82% and 67%, respectively). The model performance in two Cambisol/Stagnosol regions was rather poor (51%\u201352%). The results showed that the presented method can be directly and with a good performance applied in pedologically and geologically homogeneous areas. The sites with heterogeneous structure of the soil cover and parent material will require more precise local-fitted models and use of further auxiliary information such as terrain or geological data. The future application of presented approach at a regional scale promises to produce valuable data on actual soil degradation by erosion usable for soil conservation policy purposes.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9010028", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2566087511", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["149451608", "131505342", "11708255", "130663355", "128838166", "128746121", "31969471", "129904750", "128896779", "197556702", "1145637", "134228681", "128826201", "130514771", "54082227", "129587975", "129370013", "13243191", "4443353", "9518634", "128958051", "4378225", "129847618", "131461913", "82675133", "53367939", "85240420", "26074384", "15542121", "129017642", "140567470", "129864806", "129292764", "53664350", "128174370", "129616825", "129713185", "130681624", "59126388", "15508922", "97776473", "208618902", "11920190", "7138354", "64543020", "14727192", "89141", "95875004", "130211933", "53325795", "129315452", "131594077", "9970548", "129186159", "43842461", "129571878", "55735598", "129781164", "55426025", "16732343", "129301532", "128752430", "3082674", "129931223", "128700502", "129596556", "128943005", "52060748", "129686532", "205863770", "93728470", "14963777", "128508701", "30923465"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7761196"}

We used data compiled from the California Department of Education, the U.S. Geological Survey, ESRI's Business Analyst, the U.S. Census, and other public sources for ecologic level variables for various years and assessed their relative importance to obesity as determined from the statewide Physical Fitness Test 2003 through 2007 for grades 5, 7, and 9 (n = 5,265,265). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In addition to individual-level race and gender, the following within and school neighborhood variables ranked as the most important model contributors based on the Random Forest analysis and were included in multilevel regressions clustered on the county. Violent crime, English learners, socioeconomic disadvantage, fewer physical education (PE) and fully credentialed teachers, and diversity index were positively associated with obesity while academic performance index, PE participation, mean educational attainment and per capita income were negatively associated with obesity. The most highly ranked built or physical environment variables were distance to the nearest highway and greenness, which were 10th and 11th most important, respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Many states in the U.S. do not have school-based surveillance programs that collect body mass index data. System-level determinants of obesity can be important for tracking and intervention. The results of these analyses suggest that the school social environment factors may be especially important. Disadvantaged and low academic performing schools have a higher risk for obesity. Supporting such schools in a targeted way may be an efficient way to intervene and could impact both health and academic outcomes.

The vast majority of previous work proposes solutions that are based on supervised learning paradigms, in which historical disease rates are required for training a model. However, for many geographical regions this information is either sparse or not available due to a poor health infrastructure. It is these regions that have the most to benefit from inferring population health statistics from online user search activity. To address this issue, we propose a statistical framework in which we first learn a supervised model for a region with adequate historical disease rates, and then transfer it to a target region, where no syndromic surveillance data exists. This transfer learning solution consists of three steps: (i) learn a regularized regression model for a source country, (ii) map the source queries to target ones using semantic and temporal similarity metrics, and (iii) re-adjust the weights of the target queries. It is evaluated on the task of estimating influenza-like illness (ILI) rates. We learn a source model for the United States, and subsequently transfer it to three other countries, namely France, Spain and Australia.

Early detection of breast cancer is the key to improve the survival rate. Mammography is currently the most efficient tool for early detection of breast cancer. A large number of digital mammograms generated each year needs accurate and fast interpretation of images. The drawback of mammography is that the digital mammograms are difficult images to be interpreted visually. Non-cancerous lesions can be misinterpreted as a cancer (false-positive value), while cancers may be missed (false-negative value). A Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system can help radiologists in this difficult task of interpreting digital mammograms. Though there are many CAD techniques developed today, clinical success depends on CAD having a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and the reader taking appropriate action when interpreting the CAD prompts. This balance is not easy to achieve. The motivation behind this research work is to develop a CAD system with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the range of 95% to 100%. The work plan of the proposed research consists of four stages: The first stage involves the development of pre-processing methods for contrast enhancement of digital mammograms.The second stage of the proposed CAD is the development of suitable algorithms for segmentation of regions of interest using Otsu algorithm and data clustering techniques. The third stage involves the selection and extraction of image features tailored for the analysis of digital mammograms. Thirteen textural features for four spatial orientations: 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 are extracted from Gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) for the purpose of image analysis. The last stage is the evaluation of Neural network architectures and Support Vector Machines (SVM) aimed at using CAD system as a decision making aid for automatic detection of breast cancer. The Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database of digital mammograms is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed CAD system. The overall performance of the developed system is compared with previously established methods based on the performance measures such as accuracy, specificity and sensitivity.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4225/03/58b372ae894de", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2553266973", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114612952"}

This infrastructure is already in place in many cities throughout the main markets of China, EU and USA. Public policies are both taken at regional and/or at a city level targeting both EV adoption, but also charging infrastructure management. A growing trend is the increasing idle time over the years (time an EV is connected without charging), which directly impacts on the sizing of the infrastructure, hence its cost or availability. Such a phenomenon can be regarded as an opportunity but may very well undermine the same initiatives being taken to promote adoption; in any case it must be measured, studied, and managed. The time an EV takes to charge depends on its initial/final state of charge (SOC) and the power being supplied to it. The problem however is to estimate the time the EV remains parked after charging (idle time), as it depends on many factors which simple statistical analysis cannot tackle. In this study we apply supervised machine learning to a dataset from the Netherlands and analyze three regression algorithms, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, identifying the most accurate one and main influencing parameters. The model can provide useful information for EV users, policy maker and network owners to better manage the network, targeting specific variables. The best performing model is XGBoost with an R2 score of 60.32% and mean absolute error of 1.11. The parameters influencing the model the most are: The time of day in which the charging sessions start and the total energy supplied with 22.35%, 15.57% contribution respectively.

In existing interpretation methods for NLP, a word's importance is determined by either input perturbation---measuring the decrease in model confidence when that word is removed---or by the gradient with respect to that word. To understand the limitations of these methods, we use input reduction, which iteratively removes the least important word from the input. This exposes pathological behaviors of neural models: the remaining words appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by interpretation methods. As we confirm with human experiments, the reduced examples lack information to support the prediction of any label, but models still make the same predictions with high confidence.

Deep reinforcement learning needs a large number of learning samples in its learning process, so it often faces with the problems that the algorithm is difficult to converge and easy to fall into local minimums. In view of the above problems, we apply support vector machines classification to reinforcement learning, and propose an algorithm named Advantage Actor-Critic with Support Vector Machine Classification (SVM-A2C). Our algorithm adopts the actor-critic framework and uses the support vector machine classification as a result of the actor's action output, while Critic uses the advantage function to improve and optimize the parameters of support vector machine. In addition, since the environment is changing all the time in reinforcement learning, it is difficult to find a global optimal solution for the support vector machines, the gradient descent method is applied to optimize the parameters of support vector machine. So that the agent can quickly learn a more precise action selection policy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the classical experimental environment of reinforcement learning.

This technology can be used by disabled people in order to improve their independence and maximize their capabilities such as finding an object in the environment. Such devices can be realized by the non-invasive measurement of information from the cortex by electroencephalography (EEG). Methods Our work proposes a novel BCI system that consists of controlling a robot arm based on the user's thought. Four subjects (1 female and 3 males) aged between 20 and 29 years have participated to our experiment. They have been instructed to imagine the execution of movements of the right hand, the left hand, both right and left hands or the movement of the feet depending on the protocol established. EMOTIV EPOC headset was used to record neuronal electrical activities from the subject's scalp, these activities were then sent to the computer for analysis. Feature extraction was performed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method combined with the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum within the frequency band responsible for sensorimotor rhythms (8 Hz\u201322 Hz). These features were then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on a Radial Base Function (RBF) whose outputs were translated into commands to control the robot arm. Results The proposed BCI enabled the control of the robot arm in the four directions: right, left, up and down, achieving an averaged accuracy of 85.45% across all the subjects. Conclusion The results obtained would encourage, with further developments, the use of the proposed BCI to perform more complex tasks such as execution of successive movements or stopping the execution once a searched object is detected. This would provide a useful assistance means for people with motor impairment.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.irbm.2018.02.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Irbm", "mag_id": "2793397193", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199057644"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80374302"}

This study explores the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a nonlinear statistical regression approach for the purpose of predicting the field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Kfield) of sandy soil based on basic soil properties of saline and alkaline soil data sets. Considering the significance of soil properties, both methods used the following levels of input soil data, which are easily measurable in the laboratory: hydraulic conductivity, clay/silt ratio, liquid limit, hydro carbonate anions, chloride ions, and calcium carbonate content. The influence of three kernel functions (linear, radial basis and sigmoid) on the performance of the SVM model was investigated. An adaptive genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal free parameters of the SVM models. The results indicated that the SVM with the RBF model has better accuracy compared to the linear- and sigmoid-based models. The RBF model performed satisfactorily with a modeling efficiency of 0.972 and a correlation coefficient of 0.976.

LGL related cytopenias have been attributed to LGL cellular cytotoxicity or proapoptotic cytokines rather than intrinsic properties of the neutrophils. The association of LGL with autoimmunity suggests that genetic predisposition may contribute to disease pathogenesis. We studied 69 patients with LGL leukemia using a case-control approach; control populations included ethnically matched healthy individuals (N=82) and disease controls of aplastic anemia (N=48) and kidney transplant recipients (N=48). Initially, we applied the Illumina 12K non-synonymous SNP array to a subcohort of 36 LGL patients and 54 healthy controls (training set). Results were subjected to independent hypothesis-generating biostatistical algorithms. First, Exemplar automated analysis determined disease prediction based on independent \u03c72 analysis for each SNP. As expected, no SNP in this underpowered study reached Bonferroni corrected statistical significance, but our analysis allowed for ranking based on p-value. Second, Random Forests, a nonparametric tree method was applied, whereby all SNP information was calculated multivariately to predict disease. In a non-Mendelian inherited disease, this method more closely reflects the biology of complex polygenic traits; remarkably, those SNP identified by Random Forest were among the highest ranking SNP by Exemplar. Our initial hypothesis-generating set identified 1 SNP in unknown gene C8orf31 and 4 SNP within the MHC class I related-chain A ( MICA ) gene. We focused on MICA, a non-peptide presenting, tightly regulated stress response HLA molecule that could play a role in pathogenesis of neutropenia in LGL. To further substantiate our finding, the initial training set results were subjected to technical validation; fidelity was rechecked by PCR genotyping with 93% concordance. Biological validation was determined by confirmation in an independent test set consisting of 33 LGL patients and additional 28 controls. As only limited numbers of SNP were tested, there was no need for \u03b1-error adjustment. MICA SNP rs1063635 was found to have the most predictive value in both the training set (PPV=56%, NPV=89%) and test set (PPV=64%, NPV=86%). Overall, the control frequency of this SNP in homozygous form was 12% vs 60% in LGL (p<.01, OR=9.1). MICA alleles have been implicated in autoimmune diseases and malignancies. Although this SNP may not define a particular MICA genotype, it is possible that it is in linkage disequilibrium with genotype-defining polymorphisms. To study the functional consequences of our findings, flow cytometric analysis using anti-MICA antibodies was performed, which identified higher expression of MICA in neutrophils from patients as compared to controls (p=.04). MICA overexpression decreased after immunosuppressive therapy (p<.01). While the mechanism of MICA induction is unknown, we stipulate that the presence of MICA alleles leads to a persistent stimulatory signal in LGL predisposing to clonal outgrowth.

The concept of drift handling solutions is sensitive to class imbalance. The sampling techniques are widely applied to process the continuously arriving data streams with a sufficient number of instances. The selected instances have to build a statistical inference to support imbalanced class distribution. The stream data classification model without concept drift adaptation is not preferable to the imbalanced class distribution. To solve the issues, this article presents the dynamic sampling and an ensemble classification technique, named as Handling Imbalanced Data with Concept Drift (HIDC). To provide high statistical precision over imbalanced class distribution with concept drift, the HIDC decides an optimal reservoir size using the metrics regarding statistical properties of stream data and control parameter. The former refers to the inequality level in the values of instances arrived from a source, and the latter one controls over the selection of instances from multiple sources. The HIDC estimates the optimal reservoir size using such statistical and control parameters. To select the appropriate instances with an allocated optimal reservoir size, the HIDC applies random sampling over imbalanced classes and chooses a set of instances from multiple sources. The random sampling cannot solve the issues of imbalanced class distribution among the existing classes. To address such problems, the HIDC applies resampling techniques with respect to the imbalance factor. To identify and address the new concepts, the proposed HIDC sampling model trains the candidate classifier and replaces the worst ensemble member with the candidate classifier. Finally, the experimental results show that the HIDC performs better sampling and mining over imbalanced class distribution with concept drifts.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comcom.2020.01.061", "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Communications", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213823485"}

This study focuses on the function of daily living subscale (KOOS ADL), which is calculated based on 17 questions. By employing machine learning to predict KOOS ADL scores, we sought to better understand the relative importance of the survey questions and thereby identify its most critical components as well as questions that do not adequately predict outcomes. Methods: Pre- and post-operative patient reported KOOS ADL survey responses and outcomes scores following ACL surgery were obtained from the Surgical Outcome System data registry(SOS), an international patient-reported outcomes database sponsored and maintained by Arthrex. Patients with missing KOOS ADL survey responses were excluded from the study. Machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were used to identify the most critical survey questions that predict KOOS ADL scores with high accuracy. These decision tree-based algorithms predict patient outcomes using several decision rules and thereby determining the relative value of individual questions at predicting patient deficits (e.g., if patients have \u201cSevere\u201d difficulty in ascending stairs, they are more likely to have globally worse scores than those with difficulty with other tasks). Results: 4996 patients were initially identified. Based on compliance with the survey, 2407, 2407, 1817 and 1193 patients records for pre-surgery, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year post-surgery responses respectively underwent further analysis. The dataset consisted of 53.9% males and 46.1% females. Mean age was 29 (range 11 to 70 years). Results from the ML models indicated that by 6 key questions, over 80% of the variance in KOOS ADL scores could be explained instead of standard 17 survey questions (Table 1). Interestingly, the analysis provided similar accuracy at both 6 months and 1 year. Discussion and Conclusion: Most patients have similar functional deficits that can be captured using a simplified version of the KOOS ADL survey. The abbreviated survey would result in a better patient reporting experience while still obtaining quality data. Additional work on predicting post-surgery scores using ML from pre-surgery responses and other patient information would provide valuable insights; however, predicting outcome scores with high accuracy remains challenging. We advocate for novel methods to identify and measure meaningful data to assist with understanding patient outcomes and thereby proving the true value of orthopaedic interventions on functional status.

With recent progress in machine learning, it has become more feasible to replace real IR images with qualified synthetic IR images in learning-based IR systems. However, this alternative may fail to achieve the desired performance, due to the gap between real and synthetic IR images. Inspired by adversarial learning for image-to-image translation, we propose the Synthetic IR Refinement Generative Adversarial Network (SIR-GAN) to narrow this gap. By learning the bidirectional mappings between two unpaired domains, the realism of the simulated IR images generated from the IR Simulator are significantly improved, where the source domain contains a large number of simulated IR images, where the target domain contains a limited quantity of real IR images. Specifically, driven by the idea of transferring infrared characteristic and protect target semantic information simultaneously, we propose a SIR refinement loss to consider an infrared loss and a structure loss further to the adversarial loss and the consistency loss. To further reduce the gap, stabilize training, and avoid artefacts, we modify the proposed algorithm by developing a training strategy, adding the U-net in the generators, using the dilated convolution in the discriminators and invoking the N-Adam acts as the optimizer.

Introduction Pauses in speech may be categorized on the basis of their length. Some authors claim that there are two categories (short and long pauses) (Baken & Orliko , 2000), others claim that there are three (Campione & Veronis, 2002), or even more. Pause lengths may be a ected in speakers with aphasia. Individuals with dementia probably caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) or Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) interrupt speech longer and more frequently. One infrequent form of dementia, non- uent primary progressive aphasia (PPA-NF), is even de ned as causing speech with an unusual interruption pattern (\u201dhesitant and labored speech\u201d). Although human listeners can o en easily distinguish pathological speech from healthy speech, it is unclear yet how so ware can detect the relevant patterns. e research question in this study is: how can so ware measure the statistical parameters that characterize the dis uent speech of PPA-NF/AD/PD patients in connected conversational speech? 2. Methods We used speech data collected during a larger study of processing of verbs and nouns in speak- ers with di erent types of dementia, currently performed by one of the co-authors (FJ). A total of nine spontaneous conversations at three di erent moments in time were held with partici- pants from di erent groups: (1) Non-brain-damaged individuals (n=7). (2) patients with a clinical diagnosis of a form of dementia: (a) Probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease (n=9). (b) Non- uent primary progressive aphasia (PPA-NF, n=2) (c) Semantic dementia (PPA-SD, n=1) (d) Parkinson\u2019s disease (n=6). (e) Behavioral fronto-temporal dementia (n=4). (f) Parkinson\u2019s disease with minor cognitive impairment (n=4). (g) Parkinson\u2019s Disease with dementia (n=3). e average conversation length was 5m47s (\u00b1 2m30s). e 22 hours of speech were auto- matically analyzed for speech and pauses using our own R-implementation of the Voice Activ- ity Detection algorithm proposed by Ramirez, Segura, Benitez, De La Torre, and Rubio (2004) CONTACT Roelant Ossewaarde.

Figure 1. e TIMIT corpus (Garofolo, Lamel, Fisher, Fiscus, & Pallett, 1993) was used to benchmark the performance of the algorithm against other algorithms in speech of non-brain-damaged in- dividuals. e decision procedure was compared to manual annotations of pathological speech obtained from DementiaBank (Becker, Boiler, Lopez, Saxton, & McGonigle, 1994; MacWhin- ney, 2007). We modeled the resulting data under the assumption of multimodality. A Support Vector Machine classi er was used to measure the predictive value of the discovered patterns. 3. Results e results show that the algorithm can detect that the speech-pause pattern in speech of in- dividuals with PPA-NF is di erent from that of individuals from the other classes. Di erences between the other classes are more subtle, and may be statistically signi cant. e generating distribution is a sum of multiple distinct Gaussians, each of which represents a pause category. e mean and variance of the Gaussians are clearly distinct for each of the participant categories, cf. Figure 2. e performance of the classi er beats a baseline (\u201cZero Rule\u201d) strategy that always predicts the majority class. 2 Non\u2212brain\u2212damaged Alzheimer Parkinson 234523452345 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 PPA\u2212NF #1 PPA\u2212NF #2 PPA\u2212SD 234523452345 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 Pause length (miliseconds) Figure 2.: e distribution of pause lengths as detected by the algorithms.

Emergency classification is a method to identify emergency events rapidly and accurately,and divide them into different levels. The appropriate emergency measures are taken according to classification results. At present,the actual classification decisions still rely mainly on intuition and experience of decision-makers. In order to obtain the results of scientific classification,it needs to establish a classification model based on objective data and provides a scientific basis for decision-makers. Support vector machine( SVM) is developed based on statistical learning theory. It is an effective way to deal with classification problems. This paper presents the application of support vector machine in order to solve emergency classification problems.Support vector machine algorithm is originally designed for binary classification problem,and then used for multi-category classification problem. There are two methods for extending SVM to multi-class SVM. The first method is to construct a multi-class classifier by combing several binary classifiers. The second method is to consider all data in an optimized formula for global optimization. There are four ways to solve multi-class recognition problems through a combination of multiple binary classifiers: oneagainst-all,one-against-one,directed acidic graph and binary tree. In this paper,one-against-one SVM is selected to solve emergency classification problems.This paper describes the emergency classification process based on support vector machine. The process consists of five steps:( 1) establish an index system based on emergency types and the analysis of relevant factors;( 2) collect historical data of the index system to constitute the SVM training sample set;( 3) use a training set to classify learning according to the SVM classification algorithm and obtain an inherent law;( 4) find support vector of the training set to construct SVM decision function; and( 5) enter the index data of classification object into the decision function and obtain the classification results.The classification of earthquake disasters is an example to verify the feasibility of the emergency classification method based on support vector machine. According to an earthquake disaster database from the National Earthquake Science Data Sharing Center website,30 earthquake sample data from 1995 to 2004 were selected,with 24 of them as training data,and others as the testing data.Selected seismic data contain nine characteristic properties: Richter scale,epicenter intensity,VI degree area,the number of people affected,the number of deaths,the number of injuries,the number of houses destroyed,the number of total housing damage and direct economic losses. According to the calculation result of LibSVM toolkit,experimental results show that support vector machine is effective to solve classification problems related to earthquake disasters.In the present paper,an emergency classification method based on support vector is introduced. Earthquake classification is proposed as an example. The one-against-one method of multi-class support vector machine is applied to the experiment. Experimental results show that multi-class support vector machine is a feasible approach dealing with emergency classification problems.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IEEM 2014", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2370028333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16757240"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113295941"}

In general, the critical purpose of graph-oriented learning algorithms is to construct an informative graph for image clustering and classification tasks. In addition to the classical K-nearest-neighbor and r-neighborhood methods for graph construction, l1-graph and its variants are emerging methods for finding the neighboring samples of a center datum, where the corresponding ingoing edge weights are simultaneously derived by the sparse reconstruction coefficients of the remaining samples. However, the pairwise links of l1-graph are not capable of capturing the high-order relationships between the center datum and its prominent data in sparse reconstruction. Meanwhile, from the perspective of variable selection, the l1 norm sparse constraint, regarded as a LASSO model, tends to select only one datum from a group of data that are highly correlated and ignore the others. To simultaneously cope with these drawbacks, we propose a new elastic net hypergraph learning model, which consists of two steps. In the first step, the robust matrix elastic net model is constructed to find the canonically related samples in a somewhat greedy way, achieving the grouping effect by adding the l2 penalty to the l1 constraint. In the second step, hypergraph is used to represent the high order relationships between each datum and its prominent samples by regarding them as a hyperedge. Subsequently, hypergraph Laplacian matrix is constructed for further analysis. New hypergraph learning algorithms, including unsupervised clustering and multi-class semi-supervised classification, are then derived. Extensive experiments on face and handwriting databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28113763", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2016.2621671", "venue": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "journal": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195674437"}

In the past decade, computational approaches on longitudinal image sequences have been actively investigated with special attention to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is an intermediate stage between normal control (NC) and AD. However, current state-of-the-art diagnosis methods have limited power in clinical practice, due to the excessive requirements such as equal and immoderate number of scans in longitudinal imaging data. More critically, very few methods are specifically designed for the early alarm of AD uptake. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible spatial-temporal solution for early detection of AD by recognizing abnormal structure changes from longitudinal MR image sequence. Specifically, our method is leveraged by the non-reversible nature of AD progression. We employ temporally structured SVM to accurately alarm AD at early stage by enforcing the monotony on classification result to avoid unrealistic and inconsistent diagnosis result along time. Furthermore, in order to select best features which can well collaborate with the classifier, we present as joint feature selection and classification framework. The evaluation on more than 150 longitudinal subjects from ADNI dataset shows that our method is able to alarm the conversion of AD 12 months prior to the clinical diagnosis with at least 82.5 % accuracy.

The mechanisms by which vaginal microbiota protect or increase the risk to STIs remain unknown. By characterising the in vivo host miRNA response to different types of vaginal microbiota, we gained insight into functions that play a role in epithelial homeostasis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving vaginal dysbiosis may help develop strategies reduce the risk of STIs. Methods Leveraging prospectively collected daily vaginal swab samples, miRNA-seq profiling was used to gain insight into host regulatory mechanisms controlled by vaginal microbial communities. Random Forest miRNA feature ranking was used to identify miRNAs expressed in response to different types of vaginal microbiota. In vitro , VK2 epithelial cells were exposed to vaginal bacteria culture supernatants, and miRNA expression was measured by qPCR, while cyclin D1 was measured by Western blot. Cell proliferation was quantified using scratch and EdU assays. Cell proliferation\u2019s effect on C. trachomatis infection was performed on cervical A2EN epithelial cells. Results We leveraged daily collected vaginal samples in conjunction with a machine learning approach to discover eight miRNAs differently controlled by vaginal microbiota. Of these, expression of miR-193b, known to regulate host cell proliferation, was increased by Lactobacillus spp.-dominated microbiota. Recently, in vitro , VK2 cells exposed to Lactobacillus -conditioned supernatants exhibited reduced proliferation, high miRNA-193b expression and decreased abundance of cyclin D1. Importantly, epithelial cell proliferation was required for efficient C. trachomatis infection.

Our recent studies show that while almost 100% of childhood BL (238 children) is characterized by an 8q24 (c-myc) gene rearrangement, 70% of the patients also had a secondary chromosomal aberration (Cairo et al Blood 2007), and those children with BL who had a 13q abnormality had a significantly poorer outcome (20% reduction in EFS; Poirel/Cairo et al Leukemia, 2009). Loss of 13q14.3 was associated with a significant decrease in OS (Nelson/Cairo/Perkins/Sanger et al BJH 2010). DLEU1, proven as a Burkitt specific classifier and a cMYC target gene (Dave/Staudt et al NEJM 2006), is located within the region of 13q14.3. DLEU1 is recognized to interact with c-Myc, TUBB2C, UBR1, and other proteins. When DLEU1 is down-regulated by a DLEU1 siRNA, the spontaneous apoptotic rate was decreased with concomitant significantly reduced levels of UBR1 and TUBB2C gene expression (Day/Cairo et al SIOP 2008). Our hypothesis is that deletion of 13q14.3, which contains DLEU1, in pediatric BL may confer a phenotype of chemoimmunotherapy resistance. Objective: To identify potential drug targets using comparative genomic microarray analysis of specimens in patients with PBL. Methods: PBL data from three different research groups were used; i.e. COG ANHL01P1 by our group (n=11), NCBI9s GEO GSE10172 and GSE4475 (Klapper et al) (n=16), and GSE4732 (Dave/Staudt et al) (n=15). For comparison at equal weighted level, ANHL01P1 samples were validated by building a prediction model with Support Vector Machines using Klapper PBL as training database. RNAs were subjected to microarray studies (Affymetrix U133A_2) and analyzed by Agilent GeneSpring or Partek. Functional interpretation of the identified PBL genes was analyzed by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test was used. To test our hypothesis, we knocked down DLEU1 and investigated cytoxan (CY) and rituximab effect on apoptotic rate of Ramos. Ramos BL cell lines were transiently transfected (24 hrs) with DLEU1 siRNA (5\u2032-AUACUUGGCAUGAAUGAACUUAUGU-3\u2032 and 3\u2032-UAUGAACCGUACUUACUUGAAUACA-5\u2032) (Day/Cairo SIOP 2008). The siRNA transfected cells were then treated with CY (0, 89.5, 895, 8950 nM) or rituximab (0, 4, 40, 400 mg/mL) for additional 4 hrs. Cells were evaluated for percent apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide followed by FACS using BD LSRII. Results: 1565 genes were identified (p Conclusions: Our pathway analysis of the 376 BL signature indicates that Toll-like receptor, JAK-STAT, and MAPK signaling pathways play important roles in gene regulation, anti-apoptosis, and proliferation, respectively, in PBL. The siRNA knock down of DLEU1 resulted in significantly less apoptosis on Ramos with CY or rituximab treatment. These data suggest that DLEU1 may in part play an important role in regulation of programmed cell death in BL and suggest a mechanism whereby BL with a 13q- abnormality may have a more aggressive clinical course. As CY or rituximab does not induce apoptosis in DLEU1 knockdown BL, the absence of DLEU1 may, in part, lead to drug resistance.

We demonstrated that a network representing three-dimensional structural similarities among 5452 compounds can be used to automatically group together drugs with similar scaffolds, physicochemical parameters and mode-of-action. We compared the structural network to a network representing transcriptional similarities among a subset of 1309 drugs for which transcriptional response were available in the Connectivity Map data set. Analysis of structurally similar, but transcriptionally different drugs sharing the same MOA enabled us to detect and remove weak and noisy transcriptional responses, greatly enhancing the reliability of transcription-based approaches to drug discovery and drug repositioning. Cardiac glycosides exhibited the strongest transcriptional responses with a significant induction of pathways related to epigenetic regulation, which suggests an epigenetic mechanism of action for these drugs. Drug classes with the weakest transcriptional responses tended to induce expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, hinting at drug-induced drug resistance. Analysis of transcriptionally similar, but structurally different drugs with unrelated MOA, led us to the identification of a 'toxic' transcriptional signature indicative of lysosomal stress (lysosomotropism) and lipid accumulation (phospholipidosis) partially masking the target-specific transcriptional effects of these drugs. We found that this transcriptional signature is shared by 258 compounds and it is associated to the activation of the transcription factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Finally, we built a predictive Random Forest model of these 258 compounds based on 128 physicochemical parameters, which should help in the early identification of potentially toxic drug candidates. Transcriptional responses to drug treatment can reveal mechanism of action and off-target effects thus enabling drug repositioning, but only if measured in the appropriate cells at clinically relevant concentrations. A team led by Diego di Bernardo and Diego Medina generated a network representing structural similarities among compounds to automatically group together drugs with similar scaffolds and MOA. By comparing the structural drug network with a transcriptional drug network based on similarities in transcriptional response, the team observed broad differences between the two. This observation led to the identification of a transcriptional signature related lysosomal stress and phospholipidosis, and a physicochemical model to identify such compounds.

In this paper, we propose a novel group of features and combine these features with the recently proposed deep forest learning algorithm called gcForest to train a classification model to detect spammer. These features used by our method to represent a mail user include: entropy of subject size of sent mails, entropy of content size of sent mails, ratio of received mail count to sent mail count. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed features on classification, we conduct combinational tests for our proposed features and another group of features used by SpaDes method, which has achieved an impressive performance on spammer detection, together with three learning algorithms, i.e. gcForest, SVM (Support Vector Machine) and ALAC (Active Lazy Association Classification) which is used by the later version of SpaDes.

Besides, due to the high communication cost, some of these matrix operations cannot be directly implemented on shared-nothing distributed computing model like MapReduce.

Namely, our kernel tries to focus on the shape of the time-series and ignores small perturbations such as misalignments or shifts. First, a recursive formulation of the kernel directly based on its definition is proposed. Then it is shown how to efficiently compute the kernel using an equivalent matrix-based formulation. To validate the proposed kernel three experiments have been carried out. As an initial step, several synthetic datasets have been generated from UCR time-series repository and the KDD challenge of 2007 with the purpose of validating the kernel-derived distance over shifted time-series.

To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely used to detect anomalies caused by a cyber attacker in IoT systems. However, due to the large-scale nature of the IoT, its IDS must operate in a distributed manner with minimum dependence on a central controller. Moreover, in many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the IoT application datasets are private and IoT devices (IoTDs) may not intend to share such data. To this end, in this paper, a distributed generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to provide a fully distributed IDS for the IoT so as to detect anomalous behavior without reliance on any centralized controller. In this architecture, every IoTD can monitor its own data as well as neighboring IoTDs to detect internal and external attacks. In addition, the proposed distributed IDS does not require any sharing of datasets among the IoTDs and, thus, it can be implemented in IoT applications that must preserve the privacy of user data such as health monitoring or financial applications. It is shown analytically that the proposed distributed GAN has higher accuracy of detecting intrusion compared to a standalone IDS that has access to only a single IoTD dataset.

Hence, false negative (or Type I) errors receive greater consideration than false positive (Type II) errors during the construction of the model. This post-processing technique tunes the initial bias term once a solution vector is learned by using standard SVM algorithms in two steps: First, a fixed threshold is given as a lower bound for the recall measure; second, the true negative rate (or specificity) is maximized.

In Chapter 2 we describe the genetic and phenotypic variation of this core collection to explore the possibility of following association mapping methods to identify genes involved in metabolic regulation. We explored through a genome wide and candidate gene approach different association mapping methods in a core collection in Chapters 3 and 4 respectively and in Chapter 5 we combined the QTL analysis of targeted and untargeted metabolites profiled through LC-MS with expression QTLs following a genetical genomics approach aiming to detect genes underlying the metabolite QTL. The genetic diversity evaluated through the screening of AFLP and SSR markers was correlated with classification of accessions using morphological and metabolic trait values. The relationship between accessions in groups was compared using hierarchical clustering and the STRUCTURE program. Using Random Forests classification a set of metabolites was selected that differentiated the different sub groups as determined by STRUCTURE (Chapter 2). Based on the classification into subpopulations using the STRUCTURE program we included the subpopulations as a correction term in our statistical model for association studies (Chapter 3). Additionally, because of the increasing amount of data that will be soon available through sequencing technology we tested the use of Random Forests in the search for marker-trait association for the isoprenoids pathway. Using the results obtained with the linear models as implemented in TASSEL and the results obtained in Random Forests we found a set of 16 significant markers with potential use for marker assisted selection in breeding for several isoprenoidsThe determination of map positions through synteny prediction and genetic mapping of a group of genes from the glucosinolate pathway lead us to identify Myb28 and MAM as candidate genes mapping under a previously detected major QTL for glucosinolates We followed an association mapping approach to investigate their role in the variation in glucosinolates in the core collection by profiling 37 SSR markers, which included markers linked to these candidate genes and markers distributed along different positions in linkage group A03 (Chapter 4). Interestingly, not only MAM and Myb28, but the AOP and GS-OH genes involved in side chain modification and Myb29 in transcriptional regulation were also associated with glucosinolate levels. A genetical genomics approach was followed to identify candidate genes for variation inmetabolites of six biosynthetic pathways: carotenoids, tocopherols, folates, glucosinolates, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids, based on the co-localization analysis and comparison between metabolic (m)QTLs and expression (e)QTLs (Chapter 5). A Doubled Haploid (DH) population was profiled for metabolite content and variation through targeted and LC-MS untargeted approaches. Additionally, the same population was profiled for transcript variation with a newly developed 105K Cogenics array assembled using mainly EST sequences from three species: B. napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea. Co-localization of eQTLs and mQTLs for several isoprenoids (tocopherols and carotenoids) and glucosinolates lead us to the identification of candidate genes for these pathways. However, further work is needed to identify the gene or genes underlying a major cluster of QTLs for 112 centrotypes derived from the LC-MS untargeted data. The results obtained through this combined approach and considerations that need to be taken into account when performing these types of studies with regard to identification of paralogues and the use of a multi Brassica species microarray for transcript profiling in Brassica rapa are discussed.In the final Chapter, the combined use of core collections encompassing the genetic diversity within B. rapa and biparental DH populations to unravel the genetic regulation of the metabolome are discussed.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2135422304", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85623078"}

In recent years, artificial neural network models of aphasia have enabled cognitive neuropsychologists to explore contemporary theories of language processing. Such work may, in the future, lead to the development of innovative strategies for the rehabilitation of brain-damaged patients. The aim of our work has been to analyse the modelling techniques employed in existing connectionist accounts of language disorders, and, on the basis of our findings, to propose novel and computationally well-grounded architectures which may be used to explore cognitive neuropsychological theories. The majority of connectionist language disorder models reported in the literature may be categorised as network-level models, consisting of a single homogeneous structure built from identical processing elements. We believe that in order to simulate more fully the complexity of human language processing, it may be necessary to move away from this approach, in favour of nervous system-level models, in which a number of network-level models are interconnected to form a modular connectionist architecture. The suitability of these architectures for language disorder simulation has been assessed through the construction of LISA: a Language Impairment Simulation Architecture. LISA comprises a number of linked connectionist networks which have been collectively trained to simulate object naming and word repetition. By lesioning one or more components of our modular system, it is possible to simulate the impaired language production of an aphasic patient. We present our attempts to simulate an acquired disorder of repetition, deep dysphasia, and a progressive disorder, semantic dementia, using LISA. The results of our experiments are encouraging, and lead us to conclude that the cognitive neuropsychology community may indeed benefit from the use of modular connectionist architectures in the simulation of both progressive and acquired language disorders.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2346561658", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16904135", "5563576"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8932224"}

In order to optimize the adjustable parameters, three optimization indexes are introduced to make the optimization process more adaptively. Based on the time-frequency matrix of MST, four disturbance features are enough to construct the feature vector, solving the problem of the statistical feature redundancy. Compared with the algorithms such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM), ELM has the advantages of simple structure, fast training speed and high precision, more suitable for engineering application. The simulation experiments show that the MST-ELM algorithms, could provide higher classification accuracy, better anti-noise property, less computational cost and independent of training set. A modified S-transform (MST) is proposed by introducing two regulation parameters.Three optimization indexes are put forward to optimize the parameters.Only four discriminative disturbance features are served as the feature vector.The MST-ELM has better accuracy, robustness, less computational cost and independent of training set.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2015.12.050", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2201988513", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3809735", "40457915", "145981941", "24041919", "54052414", "213183662", "54961780", "125501669", "174820052", "69294761"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43053697"}

In this study, we developed a novel wearable sensing brace design for measuring multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) ankle motions to minimize hysteresis and to improve the measurement repeatability and developed a computationally efficient calibration method based on sim-to-real transfer learning. By attaching the soft sensors to shin links rather than directly to the ankle joint, the effects of external disturbances during joint motions were minimized. To calibrate the sensors to body motions, transfer learning was used based on the results from musculoskeletal simulation(OpenSim) and sensor data. The average tracking error for ankle motions using the proposed method was found to be 12.0\u00b0 for five healthy subjects, while the direct deep neural network approach showed an error of 17.9\u00b0.

To this end, we propose a novel multimodal framework that instantiates multiple instance learning. Specifically, we develop methods that identify events and localize corresponding AV cues in unconstrained videos. Importantly, this is done using weak labels where only video-level event labels are known without any information about their location in time. We show that the learnt representations are useful for performing several tasks such as event/object classification, audio event detection, audio source separation and visual object localization. An important feature of our method is its capacity to learn from unsynchronized audio-visual events. We also demonstrate our framework's ability to separate out the audio source of interest through a novel use of nonnegative matrix factorization. State-of-the-art classification results, with a F1-score of 65.0, are achieved on DCASE 2017 smart cars challenge data with promising generalization to diverse object types such as musical instruments.

Non-availability of standard datasets and limited labeled data points makes it difficult to attain high accuracies in change detection. In this paper, we have proposed a modified ensemble of extreme learning machines (mAEELM) for change detection in green cover to increase the accuracy of the change detection process. It uses Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the base classifier. Different ELMs are trained with different configuration so that they have different learning capabilities. These ELMs are combined to create an ensemble and it is then adapted based on the accuracy of the individual ELMs. The ensemble is then pruned to eliminate the ELMs which are not contributing towards the overall result of the ensemble, to make it more efficient.

Research on overlapping communities detection cannot only promote the study of network functions but also bring insight into a deep understanding of the network topology.

We apply this model to the label propagation algorithm and present an overlapping community detection algorithm based on Preferential Learning and Label Propagation Algorithm, called PLPA. The algorithm regards the network as a dynamic system. Each node selects the learning target to update its own label according to the degree of preference to its neighbor nodes. With learning, the information in the system will finally reach a steady state. We consider nodes that have the same label belonging to the same community, so that the overlapping community structure in the network will be separated. In the experiments, we verified the performance of our algorithm through real-world and synthetic networks.

The key challenge is how to capture the realistic feature distribution of unseen classes without training samples. To this end, we propose a hybrid model consists of Random Attribute Selection (RAS) and conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). RAS aims to learn the realistic generation of attributes by their correlations in nature. To improve the discrimination for the large number of classes, we add a reconstruction loss in the generative network, which can solve the domain shift problem and significantly improve the classification accuracy.

Data come from SisFall, a publicly available dataset containing records of Activities of Daily Living and falls. We compared five Machine Learning algorithms. We first applied preprocessing and a feature extraction stage before using five Machine Learning algorithms, allowing us to compare them. Ensemble learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting have the best performance, with a Sensitivity and Specificity both close to 99%.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "3008674845", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213887770"}

Despite the massive research efforts consumed for CBIR, the completely satisfactory results have not yet been attained. In this article, we offer a new CBIR technique that relies on extracting Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) feature descriptors as well as the color features; color correlograms and Improved Color Coherence Vector (ICCV). These features are joined and used to build a multidimensional feature vector. Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) technique is utilized to quantize the extracted feature vector. Then, a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented to classify the query images. The performance of the presented retrieval framework is analyzed and scrutinized by comparing it with three alternative approaches. The first one is based on extracting SURF descriptors while the second one is based on extracting SURF descriptors, color correlograms and ICCV. The third approach, on the other hand, is based on extracting MSER, color correlograms and ICCV. All implemented schemes are tested on two benchmark datasets; Corel-1000 and COIL-100 datasets. The empirical results show that our suggested approach has a superior discriminative classification and retrieval performance with respect to other approaches.

Chapter 1 presents the main ideas, challenges and the notation used in this thesis. Chapter 2 addresses the problem of selecting a finite set of time instants which best classify multivariate functional data into two predefined classes. Using, not only the information provided by the function itself but also its high-order derivatives will be crucial to improve the accuracy. To do this, a continuous bilevel optimization problem is solved. Such problem combines the resolution of the well-known technique SVM (Support Vector Machine) with the maximization of the correlation between the class label and the score. Chapter 3 also focuses on the binary classification problem using SVM. However, instead of finding the most important time instants, here we define a functional bandwidth in the so-called kernel function. In this way, accuracy may be improved and the most relevant intervals of the domain of the function, according to their classification ability, are identified, enhancing the interpretability. A bilevel optimization problem is formulated and solved by means of an alternating procedure. Chapter 4 is focused on classifying the so-called hybrid functional data, i.e., data which are formed by functional and static (constant over time) covariates. The goal is to select the features, functional or static, which best classify. An anisotropic kernel which associates a scalar bandwidth to each feature is defined. As in previous chapters, an alternating approach is proposed to solve a bilevel optimization problem. Chapter 5 generalizes the variable selection problem presented in Chapter 2 to regression. The solution approach combines the SVR (Support Vector Regression) problem with the minimization of sum of the squared residuals between the actual and predicted responses. An alternating heuristic is developed to handle such model.

Tree genus is classified by using two sets of features within the Random Forest classifier; the two sets of features are 1) descriptors related to the geometric information of the trees and 2) descriptors related to the vertical profile of LiDAR points. The targeted genera include pine, poplar and maple at a study site situated north of Thessalon, Ontario (east of Sault Ste. Marie) along a major utility corridor right of way and seven surrounding woodlots. The first set of features classifies tree genera by obtaining the geometric information from LiDAR point data, we have derived 24 features for each isolated tree crown and the features are grouped into five categorizes 1) Linear features \u2013 describing characteristics of line segments derived internal to a tree crown; 2) Cluster features \u2013 describing the shape of the LiDAR point clusters grouped within an individual tree crown; 3) Hull features \u2013 describing tree form in terms of volume hulls; 4) Buffer features \u2013 describing characteristics of the point distribution within a tree crown and 5) Form features \u2013 describing overall tree shape. The second set of features classifies tree genera by obtaining vertical height point profile information, we derived 78 features for each tree; features are grouped in three categories. 1) Count features \u2013 percentage of first, single and last returns within the profile; 2) Height features \u2013 statistical attributes of height values at different height percentiles and 3) Intensity features \u2013 statistical attributes of intensity values at different height percentiles. The Random Forest classifier is used to process both sets of features separately and their accuracy rates are compared among different pulse densities. The LiDAR data was collected by a Riegl LMS-Q560 scanner with original point density of 40 pulses per m 2 , tree genera classification was performed at the original pulse density, we then reduce the density to 20, 10, and 5 pulses per m 2 , each time recording the accuracy. Our analysis indicates that as pulse densities decrease, vertical profile methods remain effective, but to truly extract structural parameters, higher pulse densities are necessary. The implementation of a simple multiple classifier system (MCS) combines the two sets of descriptors and yields improved classification accuracy. The sensitivity analysis helps identify a breakpoint at which pulse densities drop too low for true structural analyses at an operational scale.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2741139358", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18012907"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134624003"}

Our primary goal is to develop a monitoring system capable of being used outside of controlled laboratory settings. Such a system would enable us to track medication cycles at home and provide valuable clinical feedback. Most of the relevant prior works involve supervised learning frameworks (e.g., Support Vector Machines). However, in-home monitoring provides only coarse ground truth information about symptom occurrences, making it very hard to adapt and train supervised learning classifiers for symptom detection. We address this challenge by formulating symptom detection under incomplete ground truth information as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. MIL is a weakly supervised learning framework that does not require exact instances of symptom occurrences for training; rather, it learns from approximate time intervals within which a symptom might or might not have occurred on a given day. Once trained, the MIL detector was able to spot symptom-prone time windows on other days and approximately localize the symptom instances. We monitored two Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, each for four days with a set of five triaxial accelerometers and utilized a MIL algorithm based on axis parallel rectangle (APR) fitting in the feature space.

Selection of the most promising candidates between the initial untargeted step and the subsequent validation phases is critical within the pipeline leading to clinical tests. Several statistical and data mining methods have been described for feature selection: in particular, wrapper approaches iteratively assess the performance of the classifier on distinct subsets of variables. Current wrappers, however, do not estimate the significance of the selected features. We therefore developed a new methodology to find the smallest feature subset which significantly contributes to the model performance, by using a combination of resampling, ranking of variable importance, significance assessment by permutation of the feature values in the test subsets, and half-interval search. We wrapped our \\emph{biosigner} algorithm around three reference binary classifiers (Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) which have been shown to achieve specific performances depending on the structure of the dataset. By using three real biological and clinical metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets (containing up to 7,000 features), complementary signatures were obtained in a few minutes, generally providing higher prediction accuracies than the initial full model. Comparison with alternative feature selection approaches further indicated that our method provides signatures of restricted size and high stability. Finally, by using our methodology to seek metabolites discriminating type 1 from type 2 diabetic patients, several features were selected, including a fragment from the taurochenodeoxycholic bile acid.

In this work, we apply DCNs as frame-based recognizers for video recognition. Our preliminary studies, however, show that video corpora with complete ground truth are usually not large and diverse enough to learn a robust model. The networks trained directly on the video data set suffer from significant overfitting and have poor recognition rate on the test set. The same lack-of-training-sample problem limits the usage of deep models on a wide range of computer vision problems where obtaining training data are difficult. To overcome the problem, we perform transfer learning from images to videos to utilize the knowledge in the weakly labeled image corpus for video recognition. The image corpus help to learn important visual patterns for natural images, while these patterns are ignored by models trained only on the video corpus. Therefore, the resultant networks have better generalizability and better recognition rate. We show that by means of transfer learning from image to video, we can learn a frame-based recognizer with only 4k videos. Because the image corpus is weakly labeled, the entire learning process requires only 4k annotated instances, which is far less than the million scale image data sets required by previous works. The same approach may be applied to other visual recognition tasks where only scarce training data is available, and it improves the applicability of DCNs in various computer vision problems. Our experiments also reveal the correlation between meta-parameters and the performance of DCNs, given the properties of the target problem and data. These results lead to a heuristic for meta-parameter selection for future researches, which does not rely on the time consuming meta-parameter search.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1409.4127", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2295546024,1489833900", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11788802", "16013270", "7677566", "12365014", "206597351", "1309931", "1087061", "5607238", "12364197", "9530137", "207763512", "206741597", "14457153", "10402702", "14542261", "18268744", "372467", "1923924", "206592218", "18235792", "12008458", "2309950", "15796526", "12589862", "10940950", "6161478", "1241368", "818234", "15700257", "7487588"], "inbound_citations": ["43136801"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:781408"}

Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Forest\u2014a non-parametric ensemble classifier\u2014has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km 2 in 1972 to 378 km 2 in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/su10010010", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainability", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2778315739", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["55959756", "14996931", "59024935", "12255681", "153923177", "16713557", "85050203", "86439387", "2141538", "20278770", "126836964", "129858141", "161400268", "36581654", "18194063", "152914127", "133617557", "131082729", "29931960", "6579507", "59068243", "128768389", "153586727", "89141", "58374281", "2357415", "4713187", "265681", "2827580", "84180341", "128979698", "129311636", "32292346", "28458292", "60985554", "51994032", "166277726", "128558354"], "inbound_citations": ["52888708", "212696941", "159394962", "204896788", "51965405", "115369519", "51619071", "51694938", "48353130", "127119944"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53603823"}

{"paper_id": "144021760", "title": "Connectionist Modelling and Education.", "authors": [{"first": "Colin", "middle": ["W."], "last": "Evers", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Introduction The main aim of this paper is to describe and explain some recent work on artificial neural networks (ANNs) that should be of interest to researchers in educational studies. These networks are also known more generally in the literature as connectionist systems. Although models of cognition would be of obvious relevance to those seeking to understand teaching and learning, a subsidiary aim of the paper will be to show that ANNs are relevant to the study of a wider range of educational phenomena. The plan of the discussion is as follows. First, the development of ANN models is located within the context of the rise of what might usefully be called the `new cognitive science'. Then a taxonomy of the main models is provided, together with a fairly detailed account of the workings of one particular type. Three quite diverse applications are then discussed and their implications for education canvassed. Finally the significance of ANN models for representing both static and dynamical aspects of knowledge is touched upon. Since applications involve computer simulations, there will also be mention of a number of helpful software packages. Traditional cognitive science Fifty years ago, in a highly influential paper, the English mathematician Alan M. Turing (1950) sought to answer the question `Can machines think?' (p. 40). After transforming that question into one that was more manageable, he answered in the affirmative, speculating that `in about fifty years time' developments would be such that an interrogator would have only a 70 per cent chance of correctly distinguishing an (unseen) computer from a human after five minutes of questioning (p. 49). Despite the offer of a generous prize--the Loebner Prize, worth US$100,000, and a gold medal--and restrictions on the domain of questioning, no computer has been adjudicated as thinking since the annual contest commenced in 1991 (although adjudicators have classified a few humans as computers, Dennett, 1998, pp. 27-29). Matters of prediction aside, Turing's lingering influence on traditional conceptualisations of cognition, or perhaps his capturing of a widely shared intuition, lay in the way he transformed the original question. His first strategy was epistemological and amounted to a behavioural test for thinking: the Turing Test. How could we ever tell if a machine was thinking? Answer: by asking it unrestricted questions. If it successfully imitates human answers--plays well the imitation game--then we may say it is thinking (Turing, 1950, pp. 40-43). His second strategy was ontological and involved a reconstrual of what we might regard as a machine. Since he was concerned, not with whether some particular machine could think, but with `whether there are imaginable computers which would do well [at imitation]' (p. 43), an approach was proposed that abstracted almost entirely from physical detail beyond requiring adequate (program) storage space and suitable speed of operation. The upshot is that these two strategies conspire to yield a functionalist theory of mind, a very general set of constraints for determining the adequacy of accounts of cognition. The way it works is as follows. Roughly speaking, sets of inputs and outputs constitute the empirical evidence of cognition. Often winnowed selectively to comprise words, or other symbolic tokens, written or spoken, that elicit behaviours also often in the form of produced symbol tokens, cognitive acts are construed as the set of transformations that connect these inputs to their associated outputs. The best known general formulation of the class of intelligent cognitive acts is given by Newell and Simon (1976) in what they call `the Physical-Symbol System Hypothesis' which states that `a physical-symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action' (p. 111). Construed as an empirical hypothesis, they are claiming essentially that the basis for intelligent action is to be found in the processes that operate on sets of symbols, or `symbol structures' to produce other symbol structures. \u2026", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1177/000494410004400302", "venue": null, "journal": "Australian Journal of Education", "mag_id": "1988919809", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55639032", "56163661", "42334170", "10474288", "54984936"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144021760"}

However, in real world applications, there is simply not enough time and resources to perform such a huge number of model runs. In this study, a computational framework, known as v-SVR-FGM / LI-FGM, is presented for solving computationally expensive simulation problems. The concept of v-SVR-FGM / LI-FGM will be demonstrated via a small number of fine grid model (FGM) runs using a nonlinear regression or modified linear interpolation. The approximation model is performed in predicting the form of results of FGM instead of running the time consuming FGM.

Subsequently, data pretreatment was conducted by using a Progenesis QI software and screening rules. The obtained metabolite features were defined as variables for statistical analyses.

Furthermore, orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis was performed to discriminate confused two species, and resulted in the discovery of nine contributing markers. Ultimately, a Support Vector Machine model was developed to recognize five species and predict origins of commercial materials.

Recently, genes encoding the photosystem II reaction center (psbA and psbD) were found in cyanophage genomes. This phenomenon suggested that the horizontal transfer of these genes may be involved in increasing phage fitness. To date, a very small percentage of marine bacteria and phages has been cultured. Thus, mapping genomic data extracted directly from the environment to its taxonomic origin is necessary for a better understanding of phage-host relationships and dynamics.ResultsTo achieve an accurate and rapid taxonomic classification, we employed a computational approach combining a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a codon usage position specific scoring matrix (cuPSSM). Our method has been applied successfully to classify core-photosystem-II gene fragments, including partial sequences coming directly from the ocean, to seven different taxonomic classes. Applying the method on a large set of DNA and RNA psbA clones from the Mediterranean Sea, we studied the distribution of cyanobacterial psbA genes and transcripts in their natural environment. Using our approach, we were able to simultaneously examine taxonomic and ecological distributions in the marine environment.ConclusionThe ability to accurately classify the origin of individual genes and transcripts coming directly from the environment is of great importance in studying marine ecology. The classification method presented in this paper could be applied further to classify other genes amplified from the environment, for which training data is available.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2696472", "pubmed_id": "19445709", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-10-229", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2117343681", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["84128481", "4995749", "37809183", "25614848", "11944582", "26111354", "11883145", "41111850", "143955"], "inbound_citations": ["84142775", "4359263", "32998525", "23522570", "11475366", "16917899", "13832800", "2316207", "4266778", "469294", "7875891"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14619461"}

However decision making in medicine is a complex and challenging problem and often inaccurate. This can be illustrated by considering the problem of diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Studies indicate that as many as 20% of patients with AMI are wrongly diagnosed. Computerised medical decision support systems have the potential to improve this accuracy. In this paper we evaluate the performance of Kernel based Support Vector Machine (KerSVM) learning methods which are a new, efficient and effective methodology for solving pattern classification problems. Methods: Using the framework of a generalised Support Vector Machine model, we tested and validated the behaviour of five kernel classifiers: Linear, Polynomial, Gaussian, Laplacian and Sigmoid with respect to diagnosing AMI. It was tested on data taken from 242 patients who had presented with chest pain; 130 of these had correctly been diagnosed as suffering from AMI and the other 112 had their chest pain correctly attributed to other causes. Initially the model was tested using 105 individual pieces of data taken from the patient history, electrocardiography, echocardiography and blood investigations. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of the SVM with the different kernels varied between 86.7% and 93.8%. The data was also run through 3 well-established classifiers -Bayesian, Decision Trees and Neural Networks, and the results compared favourably with those from the SVM model. We also carried out further experiments using several subsets of the 105 data features. We found that using 68 features (taken from electrocardiography, echocardiography and blood tests) or 66 features (taken from electrocardiography and echocardiography) it was possible to obtain diagnostic accuracies of between 90% and 93% with 3 of the kernel classifiers.

However, most techniques (1) require many images to achieve high accuracy and (2) do not provide support for reasoning below the level of classification, and so are unable to support secondary reasoning, such as the existence and position of light sources and other objects outside the image. This paper describes an Inductive Logic Programming approach called Logical Vision which overcomes some of these limitations. LV uses Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) combined with low-level extraction of high-contrast points sampled from the image to learn recursive logic programs describing the image. In published work LV was demonstrated capable of high-accuracy prediction of classes such as regular polygon from small numbers of images where Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks gave near random predictions in some cases. LV has so far only been applied to noise-free, artificially generated images. This paper extends LV by (a) addressing classification noise using a new noise-telerant version of the MIL system Metagol, (b) addressing attribute noise using primitive-level statistical estimators to identify sub-objects in real images, (c) using a wider class of background models representing classical 2D shapes such as circles and ellipses, (d) providing richer learnable background knowledge in the form of a simple but generic recursive theory of light reflection. In our experiments we consider noisy images in both natural science settings and in a RoboCup competition setting. The natural science settings involve identification of the position of the light source in telescopic and microscopic images, while the RoboCup setting involves identification of the position of the ball. Our results indicate that with real images the new noise-robust version of LV using a single example (i.e. one-shot LV) converges to an accuracy at least comparable to a thirty-shot statistical machine learner on both prediction of hidden light sources in the scientific settings and in the RoboCup setting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a general background recursive theory of light can itself be invented using LV and used to identify ambiguities in the convexity/concavity of objects such as craters in the scientific setting and partial obscuration of the ball in the RoboCup setting.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10994-018-5710-8", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2801900606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1806278", "1266785", "60993494", "961425", "16350131", "45391060", "14338830", "640499", "14637356", "206590483", "7708151", "13970558", "7137527", "148269058", "973746", "34873540", "60564345", "9944232", "59644197", "207763512", "15373038", "7016601", "210848538", "33970", "130535382", "2489151", "4979794", "99632", "4683304", "128747490", "7490338", "207079297", "206594738", "14124313", "1458265", "8909022", "5595240", "206421594"], "inbound_citations": ["215356061", "153314474"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25435940"}

This paper presents metric-based techniques for real-time kidnap detection, utilising either linear or SVM classifiers to identify all kidnapping events during the autonomous operation of a mobile robot. In contrast, existing techniques either solve specific cases of kidnapping, such as elevator motion, without addressing the general case or remove dependence on local pose estimation entirely, an inefficient and computationally expensive approach. Three metrics that measured the quality of a pose estimate were evaluated and a joint classifier was constructed by combining the most discriminative quality metric with a fourth metric that measured the discrepancy between two independent pose estimates. A multi-class Support Vector Machine classifier was also trained using all four metrics and produced better classification results than the simpler joint classifier, at the cost of requiring a larger training dataset. While metrics specific to 3D point clouds were used, the approach can be generalised to other forms of data, including visual, provided that two independent ways of estimating pose are available. Two methods for kidnap detection using local pose estimation techniques are proposed.At least two independent ways of estimating relative pose are required.Metrics assessing the quality of a pose estimate are developed and evaluated.For applications with limited training data, a joint classifier performs well.If a large training dataset is available, an SVM classifier is more accurate.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.robot.2014.08.004", "venue": "Robotics Auton.

These operations in the feature space can be expressed in terms of input data thanks to the kernel functions. Support Vector Machines is a classifier using this kernel method by computing, in the feature space and on basis of examples of the different classes, hyperplanes that separate the classes. The hyperplanes in the feature space correspond to non linear surfaces in the input space.Concerning facial expressions, the aim is to train and test a classifier able to recognise, on basis of some pictures of faces, which emotion (among these six ones: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sad, and surprise) that is expressed by the person in the picture. In this application, each picture has to be seen has a point in an N-dimensional space where N is the number of pixels in the image.The second application is the detection of camouflage nets hidden in vegetation using a hyperspectral image taken by an aircraft.

This paper proposes theoretic backgrounds which are useful for understanding the relationships among multiple hyperplanes from the analytic viewpoint. Based on key findings, an integrated framework that is able to effectively extend binary linear classifications to cover multiclass classifications is introduced. By doing so, a new comparison method which consists of multiple classes and essential hyperplanes is established.

Later, the efficiency of GWO-LSSVM is compared against three comparable hybrid algorithms namely LSSVM optimized by Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Differential Evolution (DE) and Firefly Algorithms (FA). Findings of the study revealed that, by producing lower Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE), the GWO-LSSVM is able to outperform the identified algorithms for the data set of interest.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2519742684", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56217164"}

Therefore, well-known methods from literature were compared in a larger study based on nine benchmark corpora, where within each data set a leave-one-speaker-out validation strategy was applied. As normalisation approaches, we investigated standardisation, range normalisation, and centering. These were tested in two possible options: (1) The normalisation parameters were estimated on the whole data set and (2) we obtained the parameters by using emotionally neutral samples only.

In particular, connectionist models contribute novel testable predictions, instantiate the theorized mechanism of change, and create a unifying framework for understanding infant learning and development. We relate these benefits to the 2 primary approaches used in connectionist models of infant development. The first approach employs changes in neural processing as the basis for developmental changes, and the second employs changes in infants\ufffd experiences. The review sheds light on the unique hurdles faced by each approach as well as the challenges and solutions related to both, particularly with respect to the identification of critical model components, parameter specification, availability of empirical data, and model comparison.

In this paper, a novel support vector machine (SVM) based ensemble model is proposed for credit risk assessment. In the proposed method, principles component analysis (PCA) is firstly employed for credit feature selection. Secondly, SVMs with different kernels are trained by using genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the parameters, and the corresponding assessment results are obtained. Thirdly, all results produced by different SVMs are combined by several ensemble strategies. Finally, an optimal ensemble strategy is selected for credit scoring. For validation, two real world credit datasets are used to test the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The experiment results find that our proposed ensemble model outperforms commonly used credit scoring tools.

Recent advances in introduction of machine learning models to this process can lead to significant increase in the overall quality of the drug designing pipeline. Unfortunately, for many proteins it is still extremely hard to come up with a valid statistical model. It is a consequence of huge classes disproportion (even 1000:1), large datasets (over 100,000 of samples) and restricted data representation (mostly high-dimensional, sparse, binary vectors). In this paper, we try to tackle this problem through three important innovations. First we represent compounds with 2-dimensional, graph representation. Second, we show how one can provide extremely fast method for measuring similarity of such data. Finally, we use the Extreme Entropy Machine which shows increase in balanced accuracy over Extreme Learning Machines, Support Vector Machines, one-class Support Vector Machines as well as Random Forest. Proposed pipeline brings significantly better results than all considered alternative, state-of-the-art approaches. We introduce some important novel elements and show why they lead to better model.

However, due to the difficulties of controlling the structure and texture in high-resolution, it is challenging to simultaneously model pose and expression during manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simplifies face manipulation with extreme pose and expression into two correlated stages: a boundary prediction stage and a disentangled face synthesis stage. In the first stage, we propose to use a boundary image for joint pose and expression modeling. An encoder-decoder network is employed to predict the boundary image of the target face in a semi-supervised way. Pose and expression estimators are used to improve the prediction accuracy. In the second stage, the predicted boundary image and the original face are encoded into the structure and texture latent space by two encoder networks respectively. A proxy network and a feature threshold loss are further imposed as constraints to disentangle the latent space. In addition, we build up a new high quality Multi-View Face (MVF-HQ) database that contains 120K high-resolution face images of 479 identities with pose and expression variations, which will be released soon. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on four databases show that our method pushes forward the advance of extreme face manipulation from 128 $\\times$ 128 resolution to 1024 $\\times$ 1024 resolution, and significantly improves the face recognition performance under large poses.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1903.12003", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2924918398", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206652126", "491418", "52889459", "14911023", "206804955", "9417016", "141196166", "1033682", "206594692", "126652", "195345871", "52839262", "49865829", "13058841", "6200260", "67750926", "3568073", "211022860", "206592400", "53591987", "52336221", "459456", "50769652", "7350432", "49298277", "42092779", "206593693", "21011865", "52049245", "41805341", "5756583", "5351802", "52169903", "13951779", "15990980", "2806929", "52847135", "51902796", "51606190", "12963130"], "inbound_citations": ["202542329"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85542933"}

A greenhouse experiment was conducted on three common weed species, namely, kochia (Kochia scoparia), ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) and waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis), including resistant and susceptible types to collect canopy spectral reflectance after glyphosate spraying. To generate SWI, the best weighted combination of single wavelength and a normalized wavelength difference in the range of 450\u2013920 nm was established. Relief-F algorithm selected the most discriminative feature wavelengths, and two band normalized differences to differentiate weeds with higher degree of resistance, and changes in the hyperspectral signature caused by glyphosate application. The performance of optimized SWIs on resistant weeds identification was assessed by employing machine learning Random Forest (RF) method. The RF classification model achieved a classification accuracy of 96%, 100% and 97% in detecting resistant kochia, ragweed and waterhemp, respectively. A comparison between introduced SWIs in this study and previously published hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) indicated that the SWIs provided better agreement with real data in glyphosate-resistant weeds identification.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2020.105276", "venue": "Comput.

Traditional iris location methods involve a large range of search, which is computation wasting and sensitive to noise. And these methods adopt circular template to locate the pupillary boundary.

To address these problems, this paper presents an algorithm of accurate iris location based on region of interest for improving the accuracy of iris location. At first, according to the feature of approximate concentric circles of iris inner and outer boundaries, the Region of Interest (ROI) only containing the complete iris information can be automatically extracted from an original iris image by Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to get the statistical information of direction and gradient of an iris image and then the information is taken into Support Vector Machines (SVM) for training and the SVM decision function is gotten. It can eliminate the sensitive noise and reduce the amount of calculation when reserving the useful information as much as possible. Then the iris inner boundary is located roughly by using minimum average gray method, on the basis of this, the annular region is mapped on the rectangular region for the iris inner boundary accurate detection. At last, the iris outer boundary is confirmed by using the improved J.Daugman circle differential algorithm.

The human oral cavity is a site of numerous diseases and two of the common and visually similar lesions are oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid reactions. The lichenoid reactions, which may occur in different subclasses, are usually harmless lesions while leukoplakia can develop into cancer. An automatic detection of potentially precancerous lesions can enhance the diagnostic process and reduce the need for biopsy. The problems studied represent a two-class classification problem (potentially precancerous vs. harmless lesions) and a four-class problem (complete classification into leukoplakia, atrophic, plaqueformed and reticular lichenoid reactions). Different classifiers are investigated, from classical Fisher linear discriminant to the novel Support Vector Machines. Different shape and color features are extracted from color images and evaluated as to their discrimination power. Using morphological and color features around 90% classification accuracy has been obtained on the two-class problem and 75% on the four-class problem. This corresponds to the performance of a very experienced oral specialist. The obtained 100% sensitivity for leukoplakia corresponded to 68% specificity for lichenoid reactions. Detection of the lesion boundaries was performed both manually and using Active Contour Models (snakes). The conclusion is that the system can be used as a decision support system and an educational tool in odontological practice.

Although powerful deep neural networks (DNNs) techniques can be applied to artificially synthesize speech waveform, the synthetic speech quality is low compared with that of natural speech. One of the issues causing the quality degradation is an over-smoothing effect often observed in the generated speech parameters. A GAN introduced in this paper consists of two neural networks: a discriminator to distinguish natural and generated samples, and a generator to deceive the discriminator. In the proposed framework incorporating the GANs, the discriminator is trained to distinguish natural and generated speech parameters, while the acoustic models are trained to minimize the weighted sum of the conventional minimum generation loss and an adversarial loss for deceiving the discriminator. Since the objective of the GANs is to minimize the divergence (i.e., distribution difference) between the natural and generated speech parameters, the proposed method effectively alleviates the over-smoothing effect on the generated speech parameters. We evaluated the effectiveness for text-to-speech and voice conversion, and found that the proposed method can generate more natural spectral parameters and $F_0$ than conventional minimum generation error training algorithm regardless its hyper-parameter settings.

Finally, three classifiers were built: \u2018Control vs. LTLE\u2019, \u2018Control vs. RTLE\u2019 and \u2018LTLE vs. RTLE\u2019. In the final classification system, a new subject is assigned to the class that was most voted by these three classifiers. ::: ::: Results: The \u2018Control vs. RTLE\u2019 classifier achieved an accuracy of 78.2% (sensitivity: 80.0%, specificity 77.2%), \u2018Control vs. LTLE\u2019 an accuracy of 83.6% (sensitivity 85.0%, specificity 82.9%) and \u2018LTLE vs. RTLE\u2019 an accuracy of 85.0% (sensitivity 85.0%, specificity 85.0%). Combining these classifiers into one system yielded that 16, 15 and 27 subjects were correctly classified as being, respectively, RTLE, LTLE and control. ::: ::: Conclusion: The high accuracy achieved demonstrates the potential of resting-state EEG-based directed functional connectivity for the diagnosis and lateralization of TLE.

Motivated by the RF success, recently proposed RF-based classification approaches leverage the central RF idea of aggregating a large number of low-correlated trees, which are inherently parallelizable and provide exceptional generalization capabilities. In this context, this work brings several new contributions to this line of research. First, we propose a new RF-based strategy (BERT) that applies the boosting technique in bags of extremely randomized trees. Second, we empirically demonstrate that this new strategy, as well as the recently proposed BROOF and LazyNN_RF classifiers do complement each other, motivating us to stack them to produce an even more effective classifier. Up to our knowledge, this is the first strategy to effectively combine the three main ensemble strategies: stacking, bagging (the cornerstone of RFs) and boosting. Finally, we exploit the efficient and unbiased stacking strategy based on out-of-bag (OOB) samples to considerably speedup the very costly training process of the stacking procedure. Our experiments in several datasets covering two high-dimensional and noisy domains of topic and sentiment classification provide strong evidence in favor of the benefits of our RF-based solutions. We show that BERT is among the top performers in the vast majority of analyzed cases, while retaining the unique benefits of RF classifiers (explainability, parallelization, easiness of parameterization). We also show that stacking only the recently proposed RF-based classifiers and BERT using our OOB-based strategy is not only significantly faster than recently proposed stacking strategies (up to six times) but also much more effective, with gains up to 21% and 17% on MacroF1 and MicroF1, respectively, over the best base method, and of 5% and 6% over a stacking of traditional methods, performing no worse than a complete stacking of methods at a much lower computational effort.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3077136.3080815", "venue": "SIGIR '17", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2740270877", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207757727", "209140607", "53034111", "51614209"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11337436"}

We aim to obtain better computational efficiency than pure metrical mapping techniques, better accuracy as well as usability for robot guidance compared to the topological mapping. A crucial step of any mapping system is the loop closure detection which is the ability of knowing if the robot is revisiting a previously mapped area. Therefore, we first propose a hierarchical loop closure detection framework which also constructs the global topological structure of our hybrid map. Using this loop closure detection module, a hybrid mapping framework is proposed in two step. The first step can be understood as a topo-metric map with nodes corresponding to certain regions in the environment. Each node in turn is made up of a set of images acquired in that region. These maps are further augmented with metric information at those nodes which correspond to image sub-sequences acquired while the robot is revisiting the previously mapped area. The second step augments this model by using road semantics. A Conditional Random Field based classification on the metric reconstruction is used to semantically label the local robot path (road in our case) as straight, curved or junctions. Metric information of regions with curved roads and junctions is retained while that of other regions is discarded in the final map. Loop closure is performed only on junctions thereby increasing the efficiency and also accuracy of the map. By incorporating all of these new algorithms, the hybrid framework presented can perform as a robust, scalable SLAM approach, or act as a main part of a navigation tool which could be used on a mobile robot or an autonomous car in outdoor urban environments.

The most commonly applied method to map CORINE land cover change is by visual interpretation of optical/near-infrared satellite imagery. The Sentinel-1A satellite carries a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and was launched in 2014 by the European Space Agency as the first operational Copernicus mission. This study is the first investigation of Sentinel-1A for CORINE land cover mapping. Two of the first Sentinel-1A images acquired during its ramp-up phase in May and December 2014 over Thuringia in Germany are analysed. 27 hybrid level 2/3 CORINE classes are defined. 17 of these were present at the study site and classified based on a stratified random sample of training pixels from the polygon-eroded CORINE 2006 map. Sentinel-1A logarithmic radar backscatter at HH and HV polarisation (May acquisition), VV and VH polarisation (December acquisition), and the HH image texture are used as input bands to the classification. In addition, a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and slope and aspect maps from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are used as input bands to account for geomorphological features of the landscape. In future, elevation data will be delivered for areas with sufficiently high coherence from the Sentinel-1A Interferometric Wide-Swath Mode itself. When augmented by elevation data from radar interferometry, Sentinel-1A is able to discriminate several CORINE land cover classes, making it useful for monitoring of cloud-covered regions.

Previous works have demonstrated promising performance in this task. However, they mainly utilize holistic features, whilst neglecting the rich semantic knowledge and inter-object relationships in the scene. In addition, these methods usually require a large number of pixel-level annotations, which is too expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge Embedded Generative Adversarial Networks, dubbed as KE-GAN, to tackle the challenging problem in a semi-supervised fashion. KE-GAN captures semantic consistencies of different categories by devising a Knowledge Graph from the large-scale text corpus. In addition to readily-available unlabeled data, we generate synthetic images to unveil rich structural information underlying the images. Moreover, a pyramid architecture is incorporated into the discriminator to acquire multi-scale contextual information for better parsing results. Extensive experimental results on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that KE-GAN is capable of improving semantic consistencies and learning better representations for scene parsing, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00538", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2971974407", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3058770", "206766608", "14941970", "13813737", "3429309", "22655199", "3638670", "502946", "1282515", "4557963", "8758543", "26517743", "206765110", "3692977", "1033682", "436933", "206594692", "11816781", "2898888", "6200260", "3672043", "5696978", "10458500", "56507745", "205514", "1157792", "8420864", "2202933", "11758569", "3719281", "16737710", "9775470", "10756563", "15038672", "3926195", "7507210", "21670200", "17127188", "5299559", "52958802", "11371972", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["214808549"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197679574"}

A new color model technique based on pallor in fundus images using K means clustering is proposed to differentiate between the Optic cup to disc boundary. The method differs by initial optic cup region detection followed by the erasure of blood vessels. In addition to the shape based features, textural features are extracted to better characterize the pathological subjects. Optimal set of features selected by Genetic algorithm are fed as input to Adaptive Neuro fuzzy inference system for classification of images into normal, suspect and abnormal categories. The method has been evaluated on 550 images comprising normal and glaucomatous images.

Morphing a giraffe into a bird is a challenging task, as they have different scales, textures, and morphology. An unsupervised cross-domain translator entitled InstaGAN was trained on giraffes and birds, along with their respective masks, to learn translation between both domains. A dataset of synthetic bird images was generated using translation from originally giraffe images while preserving the original spatial arrangement and background. It is important to stress that the generated birds do not exist, being only the result of a latent representation learned by InstaGAN. Two subsets of common literature datasets were used for training the GAN and generating the translated images: COCO and Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011. To evaluate the realness and quality of the generated images and masks, qualitative and quantitative analyses were made. For the quantitative analysis, a pre-trained Mask R-CNN was used for the detection and segmentation of birds on Pascal VOC, Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011, and our new dataset entitled FakeSet.

However, due to restrictions of conventional 3D imaging techniques, 3D reconstructions are typically performed from planar radiographs. Conventional reconstruction methods require a large interaction time for the identification of anatomical structures of interest. Recently, semi-supervised methods were proposed that enable to reduce interaction time. However, these methods have shown difficulties to determine precisely the pedicles of vertebrae, which are fundamental for calculating several clinical indices. This paper proposes a new method for the detection of pedicles in planar radiographs. The method is based in the use of feature descriptors for training a binary classifier and a detection phase that is carried out by sweeping a region of interest classifying all of its pixels. The location of the pedicle corresponds to the candidate with the largest output value of the classifier. The evaluation of the method was performed by comparison with a manual identification from an expert. The classifier used was a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and several descriptors were selected in order to determine which best suits this problem. The best results were obtained using Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), which was able of determining a valid detection in approximatly half of the cases.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-31298-4_33", "venue": "ICIAR", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1923150108", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203654143", "7659946"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13616450"}

In this paper, we introduce a maximum entropy classification method with feature selection for large dimensional data such as text datasets that is generative in nature. To tackle the curse of dimensionality of large data sets, we employ conditional independence assumption (Naive Bayes) and we perform feature selection simultaneously, by enforcing a `maximum discrimination' between estimated class conditional densities. For two class problems, in the proposed method, we use Jeffreys ($J$) divergence to discriminate the class conditional densities. To extend our method to the multi-class case, we propose a completely new approach by considering a multi-distribution divergence: we replace Jeffreys divergence by Jensen-Shannon ($JS$) divergence to discriminate conditional densities of multiple classes. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employ a modified Jensen-Shannon divergence ($JS_{GM}$), based on AM-GM inequality. We show that the resulting divergence is a natural generalization of Jeffreys divergence to a multiple distributions case. As far as the theoretical justifications are concerned we show that when one intends to select the best features in a generative maximum entropy approach, maximum discrimination using $J-$divergence emerges naturally in binary classification.

However, existing approaches require exhaustively labelling training data, which is labor demanding, difficult to scale up, and hard to adapt to a new domain. To overcome such a key limitation, we propose Sparsely Grouped Generative Adversarial Networks (SG-GAN) as a novel approach that can translate images in sparsely grouped datasets where only a few train samples are labelled. Using a one-input multi-output architecture, SG-GAN is well-suited for tackling multi-task learning and sparsely grouped learning tasks. The new model is able to translate images among multiple groups using only a single trained model. To experimentally validate the advantages of the new model, we apply the proposed method to tackle a series of attribute manipulation tasks for facial images as a case study.

Compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, KICA is unsupervised and available for fault detection. Hence, in this article, KICA is used to detect faults. Because the dimension of the feature space is far less than the rank of kernel matrix, a basis in feature space is selected. Specifically, the basis in feature space is first constructed based on the similarity factor of data in one group in this article. A contribution plot is impossible, because the nonlinear mapping function from input space into feature space is unknown. Therefore, KICA is difficult for nonlinear fault diagnosis. In this article, once a fault is detected, the kernel-transformed scores from improved KICA will be directly introduced as the inputs of SVM to diagnose the fault. The classification rate of SVM plus improved KICA is higher than the classification rate of SVM plus KICA when the same number of independent components (nICs) is selected. The reason is that the negentropy in improved KICA plus SVM could take into account the more-useful information of original inputs than that of original KICA plus SVM. The training time of SVM plus improved KICA is shorter than that of SVM plus KICA, because the former attenuates the expensive computation load. The proposed approach is applied to the fault detection and diagnosis in the Tennessee Eastman process and a wastewater treatment process (WWTP).

According to this new learning mechanism, two best individuals are used to update the prototype vector instead of only one best individual. It increases the chances of more individuals with better characteristics being selected and preserved for next generations.

The conversations are recorded in a natural environment without any specific constraint on the discourses using unobtrusive recording devices.

Further, we were able to utilize the proposed HMM approach in a cross-corpus experiment without any retraining with respectable generalization capability (F1score: 0.49).

The main idea is to reduce the scale of SVM by safely discarding the redundant training samples. Among existing safe screening rules, the dual screening method with variational inequalities (DVI) and the dynamic screening rule (DSR) based on duality gap are two representative strategies. DVI is efficient, while its safety may be affected by inaccurate solving algorithms. DSR is guaranteed to be safe; however, accurate feasible solutions are required for good efficiency. Based on the above-mentioned studies, in this paper, a two-stage screening (TSS) rule, which fully exploits the advantages of the above-mentioned two approaches and improves their shortcomings, is proposed. First, DVI is applied prior to training for sample screening. It reduces the scale of SVM and, meanwhile, produces a better initial feasible solution for DSR. Then, by embedding DSR into the solving algorithm, the solver becomes more accurate, and the safety of DVI can be strengthened. In the end, for safety guarantee, a postchecking step is added to search the wrongly identified samples and retrain them. To theoretically analyze the safety of DVI, an upper bound of the deviation in DVI is estimated, and a Safe-DVI is given based on it.

Nowadays, it is becoming crucial to interpret the data of varying dimensionality correctly. Dimensionality reduction methods process the data in order to help visualize the data, reduce its complexity, or find latent representation of the original problem. The algorithms of nonlinear dimensionality reduction (also known as manifold learning) are used to decrease the dimensionality of the problem while preserving the general structure of the data. Both spectral methods (such as Laplacian Eigenmaps or ISOMAP) and nonlinear embedding algorithms (NLE, such as t-SNE or Elastic Embedding) have shown to provide very good nonlinear embedding of high-dimensional data sets. However, those methods are notorious for very slow optimization, practically preventing them from being used when a data set is bigger than few thousand points. In my thesis we investigate several techniques to improve different stages of nonlinear dimensionally algorithms. First, we analyze the entropic affinities as a better way to build a similarity matrix. We explore its properties and propose a nearly-optimal algorithm to construct them. Second, we present a novel faster method to optimize NLE by using second-order information during the optimization. Third, for spectral methods, we investigate landmark-based optimization that cleverly substitutes original large-scale problem with a much smaller easy-to-solve subproblem. Finally, we apply Fast Multipole Methods approximation that allows fast computation of the gradient and the objective function of NLE and reduces their computational complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).

Both of them are well optimized to enable in-situ processing on smartwatch. To provide more robust and detailed monitoring, the smartglass is also incorporated and trigged to capture a short video clip in the front of the user when potential drinking activity is detected. The smartglass will send the video clip to the remote server via its companion smartphone and a Faster-RCNN is performed on the server to confirm the detected drinking activity and identify the type of intake liquid.

Previous studies thus have developed many text classifiers. They often employed training texts to build the classifiers, and showed that the classifiers had good performance in various application domains. However, as the training texts are often inevitably unsound or incomplete in practice, they often contain many terms not related to the categories of interest. Such terms are actually training noises in classifier training, and hence can deteriorate the performance of the classifiers. Reduction of the training noises is thus essential. It is also quite challenging as training texts are unsound or incomplete. In this paper, we develop a technique TNR ( T raining N oise R eduction) to remove the possible training noises so that the performance of the classifiers can be further improved. Given a training text d of a category c, TNR identifies a sequence of consecutive terms (in d) as the noises if the terms are not strongly related to c.

That is why technical definitions will usually contain components such as multi or single-stage turbocharger, throttle, exhaust gas recirculation loops, wastegate, variable valve timing or phasing, etc. One of the biggest challenges is to precisely quantify the gas flows through the engine. They include fresh and burnt gases, with trapping and scavenging phenomena. An accurate prediction of these values leads to an efficient control of the engine air fuel ratio and torque. Fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are then minimized. In this paper, we propose to use an artificial neural networkbased model as a prediction tool for the engine volumetric efficiency.

Each signal is represented by an attribute vector containing a set of statistical measures for the respective signal. At first, the SVM classifier is trained by data (attribute vectors) with known ground truth. Then, the classifier learnt parameters can be used for the categorization of new signals not belonging to the training set. We have experimented with both real and artificial signals and the SVM classifier performs very well even with signals exhibiting very low signal to noise ratio which is not the case for other standard methods proposed by the literature. I. INTRODUCTION Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis is based on measur- ing the variability of heart rate signals and more specifically, the variability in intervals between R peaks of the electrocar- diogram (ECG), referred as RR intervals. Several techniques have been proposed for the investigation of evolution of features of the HRV time series. A survey of statistical methods, based on the estimation of the statistical properties of the beat-to-beat time series, can be found in (1). These methods describe the average statistical behavior of the signal over a considered time window. Spectral methods (2), based on FFT or standard autoregressive modeling, were also proposed. More recently, nonlinear approaches, including Markov modeling (3), entropy-based metrics (4), (5), the mutual information measure (6) and probabilistic modeling (7), (8) were presented to examine heart rate fluctuations. Other methods include the application of the Karhunen- Lo\u00a8 eve transformation (9) or modulation analysis (10), (11). In this study, we investigate the potential benefit of using a support vector machine (SVM) learning (12), (13) to classify heart rate signals. Support vector classifiers are based on recent advances on statistical learning theory (14). They use a hypothesis space of linear functions in a high dimensional feature space, trained with a learning algorithm from opti- mization theory that implements a learning bias derived from statistical learning theory. In the last decade, SVM learning has found a wide range of applications (15), including image segmentation (16) and classification (17), object recognition (18), image fusion (19) and stereo correspondence (20).

In this paper, we address an efficient lip reading approach by investigating the unsupervised random forest manifold alignment (RFMA). The density random forest is employed to estimate affinity of patch trajectories in speaking facial videos. We propose novel criteria for node splitting to avoid the rank-deficiency in learning density forests. By virtue of the hierarchical structure of random forests, the trajectory affinities are measured efficiently, which are used to find embeddings of the speaking video clips by a graph-based algorithm. Lip reading is formulated as matching between manifolds of query and reference video clips.

ADHD has been associated with multiple cortical features from structural MRI data. However, most existing learning algorithms for ADHD identification contain obvious defects, such as time-consuming training, parameters selection, etc. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) Propose an ADHD classification model using the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm for automatic, efficient and objective clinical ADHD diagnosis. (2) Assess the computational efficiency and the effect of sample size on both ELM and support vector machine (SVM) methods and analyze which brain segments are involved in ADHD. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: High-resolution three-dimensional MR images were acquired from 55 ADHD subjects and 55 healthy controls. Multiple brain measures (cortical thickness, etc.) were calculated using a fully automated procedure in the FreeSurfer software package. In total, 340 cortical features were automatically extracted from 68 brain segments with 5 basic cortical features. F-score and SFS methods were adopted to select the optimal features for ADHD classification. Both ELM and SVM were evaluated for classification accuracy using leave-one-out cross-validation. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We achieved ADHD prediction accuracies of 90.18% for ELM using eleven combined features, 84.73% for SVM-Linear and 86.55% for SVM-RBF. Our results show that ELM has better computational efficiency and is more robust as sample size changes than is SVM for ADHD classification. The most pronounced differences between ADHD and healthy subjects were observed in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe and insular. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our ELM-based algorithm for ADHD diagnosis performs considerably better than the traditional SVM algorithm.

In this paper, we propose the use of Distance Metric Learning (DML) in combination with Nearest Neighbor (NN) classification for object tracking. Initially a video file is read and the frames in the video are accessed individually. The object in that video is first detected using canny edge detector. We assume that the previous appearances of the object and the background are clustered so that a nearest neighbor classifier can be used to distinguish between the new appearance of the object and the appearance of the background. Using Nearest Neighbor classifier it is able to distinguish the object from other objects. The process is repeated for all the frames. Then the object is tracked using the Distance Metric Learning algorithm using normalized correlation between the frames. The human appearance model is identified using the Blob detector which uses the skin color to identify the object. Then the bounding box is fixed for the object in that frame. Then the video is reconstructed with the processed frames. Feature extraction is done using Region Props which threshold the image and extract the features.

In voice impersonation, the resultant voice must convincingly convey the impression of having been naturally produced by the target speaker, mimicking not only the pitch and other perceivable signal qualities, but also the style of the target speaker. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based speech quality- and style- mimicry framework for the synthesis of impersonated voices. The framework is built upon a fast and accurate generative adversarial network model. Given spectrographic representations of source and target speakers' voices, the model learns to mimic the target speaker's voice quality and style, regardless of the linguistic content of either's voice, generating a synthetic spectrogram from which the time domain signal is reconstructed using the Griffin-Lim method. In effect, this model reframes the well-known problem of style-transfer for images as the problem of style-transfer for speech signals, while intrinsically addressing the problem of durational variability of speech sounds. Experiments demonstrate that the model can generate extremely convincing samples of impersonated speech. It is even able to impersonate voices across different genders effectively.

This way, we can identify CIP even if a group of people with similar appearance are present in the view. More specifically, we detect a set of persons on each frame as the candidates of the CIP and then build a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to select the one with consistent motion patterns in different videos and high spacial-temporal consistency in each video.

We used randomly placed nested-plot series where we measured alpha-diversity at three different plot sizes (1 m2, 0.1 m2 and 0.01 m2) and within-plot beta-diversity (as expressed by the slope of the species-area curve across plot sizes). Variable selection was performed by means of Random Forests. Relationships between selected variables and diversity measures were then assessed using Regression Trees, Linear and Generalized Linear Models. Overall, results pointed to topographically-controlled edaphic factors (soil pH and silt fraction) as the main drivers positively influencing alpha-diversity at all spatial scales, with a positive effect of rock cover and slope inclination at smaller spatial grains. Beta-diversity was positively influenced by rock cover. We suggest that high-pH, steep and/or rocky sites feature higher species richness because they lack competitive grass species.

In the next phase, a novel hybrid 3D nodule candidate detection method is presented, comprises of Active Contour Model (ACM), 3D neighborhood connectivity and geometric properties based rules. A hybrid feature vector is created, by combining geometric texture and Histogram of Oriented Gradient reduced by Principle Component Analysis (HOG-PCA) features, for each nodule candidate. After feature extraction, classification is performed by applying four different classifiers including k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN), Naive Bayesian, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and AdaBoost.

This kind of smart alloy is known to have a unique characteristic in that its shape can be controlled by temperature that can be varied by passing a current through it. Using SMA actuators, it would be possible to design miniature mechanisms for a variety of applications. Today SMA is used for valves, latches, and locks, which are automatically activated by heat. However it has not been used as a motion control device due to difficulty in the treatment of its highly non-linear strain-stress hysteresis characteristic which is further influenced by its temperature. In this project, a dynamic model of a SMA actuator is developed using ANFIS, a neuro-fuzzy inference system provided in MATLAB environment. Using neuro-fuzzy logic, the system identification of the dynamic system is performed by observing the change of state variables (displacement and velocity) responding to a known input (voltage across the SMA actuator). Then, using the dynamic model, the estimated input voltage required to follow a desired trajectory is calculated in an open-loop manner. The actual input voltage supplied to the SMA actuator is the sum of this open-loop input voltage and an input voltage calculated from an ordinary PD control scheme. This neuro- fuzzy logic-based control scheme is a very generalized scheme that can be used for a variety of SMA actuators. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the potential for this type of controller to control the motion of the SMA actuator.\u00a9 (2000) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The complex real world problems require intelligent systems that combine knowledge, techniques and methodologies from various sources. Neuro fuzzy is the combination of the neural network and fuzzy logic. Neural networks recognize patterns and adapt themselves to cope with changing environments. Fuzzy inference systems incorporate human knowledge and perform inferencing and decision making. Noise is an unwanted energy, which interferes with the desired signal. It can be suppressed with adaptive filters using signal processing. But if the noise frequency is same as the original signal then sometimes it also eliminates the desired signal. Therefore, noise cancellation is used which will not affect the desired signal. The basic principle of noise cancellation using neuro fuzzy is to filter out an interference component by identifying the nonlinear model between a measurable interference (J.S.R. Jang, et al., 1997). The matlab command called 'ANFIS' (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) is used to demonstrate how noise cancellation can be applied as interference canceling in ECG [Fuzzy logic tool box].", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223828", "venue": "Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2003.", "journal": "Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2003.", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1836510836", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60896462"], "inbound_citations": ["53612832"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58708186"}

Most classical object detection methods heavily rely on category- based training to handle intra-class variations. In contrast to classical methods that use a rigid category-based representation, exemplar-based methods try to model variations among positives by learning from specific positive samples. However, current existing exemplar-based methods either fail to use any training information or suffer from a significant performance drop when few exemplars are available. In this paper, we design a novel local metric learning approach to well handle exemplar- based object detection task. The main works are two-fold: 1) a novel local metric learning algorithm called exemplar metric learning (EML) is designed and 2) an exemplar-based object detection algorithm based on EML is implemented. We evaluate our method on two generic object detection data sets: UIUC-Car and UMass FDDB.

An open problem is how to select the available models (including algorithms and parameters) and importantly, abundance of source-domain data, through statistically reliable methods, thus making transfer learning practical and easy-to-use for real-world applications. To address this challenge, one needs to take into account the difference in both marginal and conditional distributions in the same time, but not just one of them. In this paper, we formulate a new criterion to overcome \"double\" distribution shift and present a practical approach \"Transfer Cross Validation\" (TrCV) to select both models and data in a cross validation framework, optimized for transfer learning. The idea is to use density ratio weighting to overcome the difference in marginal distributions and propose a \"reverse validation\" procedure to quantify how well a model approximates the true conditional distribution of target-domain. The usefulness of TrCV is demonstrated on different cross-domain tasks, including wine quality evaluation, web-user ranking and text categorization.

An ideal feature descriptor must be robust to changes involving (i) local transformations and (ii) re-appearances of a local event pattern. To that end, we propose a novel spatiotemporal feature representation learning algorithm based on slow feature analysis (SFA). Using SFA, smoothly changing linear projections are learnt which are robust to local visual transformations. In order to determine if the features can learn to be invariant to various visual transformations, feature point tracking tasks are used for evaluation.

Epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis are very important in planning and evaluating new strategies that prevent this reaction, but also in providing a guide to the treatment of patients who have just suffered an anaphylactic reaction. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are one of the most effective and richest sources for the epidemiology of anaphylaxis, because they provide a low-cost way of accessing rich longitudinal data on large populations. However, a negative aspect is that researchers have to manually review a huge amount of information, which is a very costly and highly time consuming task. Therefore, our goal is to explore different machine learning techniques to process Big Data EMR, lessening the needed efforts for performing epidemiological studies about anaphylaxis. In particular, we aim to study the incidence of anaphylaxis by the automatic classification of EMR. To do this, we employ the most widely used and efficient classifiers in text classification and compare different document representations, which range from well-known methods such as Bag Of Words (BoW) to more recent ones based on word embedding models, such as a simple average of word embeddings or a bag of centroids of word embeddings. Because the identification of anaphylaxis cases in EMR is a class-imbalanced problem (less than 1% describe anaphylaxis cases), we employ a novel undersampling technique based on clustering to balance our dataset. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms, we also use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify our dataset. In general, experiments show that the most classifiers and representations are effective (F1 above 90%). Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest achieve an F1 around 95%, however linear methods have considerably lower training times.

In recent years, non-parametric classifiers such as the neural network, the decision tree classifier and other classifiers have developed increasingly. Therefore, the four broadly used classification methods, which are Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Self-Organized Neural Network (SONN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree Classification (DTC) are firstly applied for the land cover remote sensing classification based on the multitemporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of Heilongjiang area. The emphasis is placed on the comparison of the four classification methods and the techniques used for improving classification accuracy. Then, we compare the four classifiers through different aspects. Through the comparison, we got the conclusions: DTC is the best, and MLC as one of the classical methods is more stable than other three methods. Therefore, we make the land cover classification test over China using DTC and MLC methods and compare them again.

{"paper_id": "134864244", "title": "Combining 2D facial texture and 3D face morphology for estimating people's soft biometrics and recognizing facial expressions", "authors": [{"first": "Huaxiong", "middle": [], "last": "Ding", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Since soft biometrics traits can provide sufficient evidence to precisely determine the identity of human, there has been increasing attention for face based soft biometrics identification in recent years. Among those face based soft biometrics, gender and ethnicity are both key demographic attributes of human beings and they play a very fundamental and important role in automatic machine based face analysis. Meanwhile, facial expression recognition is another challenge problem in face analysis because of the diversity and hybridity of human expressions among different subjects in different cultures, genders and contexts. This Ph.D thesis work is dedicated to combine 2D facial Texture and 3D face morphology for estimating people\u2019s soft biometrics: gender, ethnicity, etc., and recognizing facial expression. For the gender and ethnicity recognition, we present an effective and efficient approach on this issue by combining both boosted local texture and shape features extracted from 3D face models, in contrast to the existing ones that only depend on either 2D texture or 3D shape of faces. In order to comprehensively represent the difference between different genders or ethnics groups, we propose a novel local descriptor, namely local circular patterns (LCP). LCP improves the widely utilized local binary patterns (LBP) and its variants by replacing the binary quantization with a clustering based one, resulting in higher discriminative power as well as better robustness to noise. Meanwhile, the following Adaboost based feature selection finds the most discriminative gender- and ethnic-related features and assigns them with different weights to highlight their importance in classification, which not only further raises the performance but reduces the time and memory cost as well. Experimental results achieved on the FRGC v2.0 and BU-3DFE data sets clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. For facial expression recognition, we present a fully automatic multi-modal 2D + 3D feature-based facial expression recognition approach and demonstrate its performance on the BU\u20133DFE database. Our approach combines multi-order gradientbased local texture and shape descriptors in order to achieve efficiency a nd robustness. First, a large set of fiducial facial landmarks of 2D face images along with their 3D face scans are localized using a novel algorithm namely incremental Parallel Cascade of Linear Regression (iPar\u2013CLR). Then, a novel Histogram of Second Order Gradients (HSOG) based local image descriptor in conjunction with the widely used first-order gradient based SIFT descriptor are employed to describe the local texture around each 2D landmark. Similarly, the local geometry around each 3D landmark is described by two novel local shape descriptors constructed using the first-order and the second-order surface differential geometry quantities, i.e., Histogram of mesh Gradients (meshHOG) and Histogram of mesh Shape index (curvature quantization, meshHOS). Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based recognition results of all 2D and 3D descriptors are fused at both featurelevel and score-level to further improve the accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that there exist impressive complementary characteristics between the 2D and 3D descriptors. We use the BU\u20133DFE benchmark to compare our approach to the state-of-the-art ones. Our multi-modal feature-based approach outperforms the others by achieving an average recognition accuracy of 86,32%. Moreover, a good generalization ability is shown on the Bosphorus database.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2757211058", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134864244"}

Stockholm County currently holds 22% of the population and accounts for nearly half of the urban growth in Sweden (Svensk Handelskammare). Previous research on change detection using remote sensing cover the use of data sets from optical sensors, infrared spectrum, radar data and the use of additional derived data sets such as indices and texture measure (implemented on pixel or feature level). There is not yet any consensus regarding which change detection methods that is superior to others. Comparative studies often only test a few algorithms on one particular data set. Change detection of Stockholm urban area has not been well investigated in previous literature.This thesis is focused on a change detection analysis of Stockholm area between 1986 and 2006 using remote sensing data fusion. The data set used is SPOT-1 HRV XS data at 20m resolution from 1986, SPOT-1 HRV Panchromatic data at 10m resolution from 1987 and SPOT-5 HRG XS data of 10m resolution from 2006.The first challenge was to fuse the multispectral and panchromatic images from 1986 and 1987 to inject the details of the 10m panchromatic image into the 20m multispectral so that the resulting images will have similar spatial details as the 2006 images. This was done by wavelet transform. Haar, Daubechies, Coiflet and Biorthogonal wavelet families were tested to find the optimal fusion and the corresponding parameters. The results showed that the Daubechies, Coiflet and Biorthogonal families did not differ significantly and that for this data set and analysis purpose more than one wavelet family fusion results showed satisfactory results. The correlation coefficient for these three families was all over 0,96 at decomposition level two. Then change detection was performed using change vector analysis (CVA) and a supervised non-parametric classifier. A comparison is made between two inputs: one using only spectral information and the other adding textural information to the spectral information. The change detection analysis was undertaken in three steps: calculating texture measures from the original images, calculating change magnitude using Change Vector Analysis (CVA) and classifying change from no-change using Support Vector Machine (SVM).Three GLCM texture measures were chosen: Homogeneity, Mean and Entropy in the change detection analysis. These, as well as the spectral information, were input for change vector magnitude. Then SVM is used to classify changed pixels from no-change pixels. Two change results were obtained, the first using only spectral information, and the other using both spectral and textural information.The overall accuracy using only spectral information was rather high at 87, 86%. But the visual inspections indicate that using only spectral change magnitude is not sufficient for a good change detection result because there is an apparent overestimation of change. When adding the textural information the overall accuracy increase drastically to 97,01%, although at visual inspection there seem to be an underestimation of change. Because of the high overall accuracy an independent validation was made causing the overall accuracy and kappa to decrease. Change detection using only multispectral data got an overall accuracy of 76, 12% and kappa coefficient 0,53. For change detection result with added texture measures the overall accuracy became 85,80% and 0,72. The results further confirm the general advantages using texture measure although the independent evaluation resulted in a lower accuracy than the author's evaluations.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2097373418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129191103"}

We selected a final model based on performance and simplicity. Results:People with epilepsy who, in year 1, were adults (rather than children or seniors), male, Manhattan residents, frequent users of health services, users of multiple health systems, or had medical, neurologic, or psychiatric comorbidities, were more likely to frequently use the ED in year 2. Predictive techniques identified frequent ED visitors with good positive predictive value (approximately 70%) but poor sensitivity (approximately 20%).

The PBIL method with two different updating schemes of its probability vectors is presented. The performance of the two proposed multiobjective optimisers are measured and compared with four other established multiobjective evolutionary algorithms i.e. niched Pareto genetic algorithm, version 2 of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, version 2 of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm, and Pareto archived evolution strategy. The optimisation methods are implemented to solve 8 bi-objective test problems where design variables are encoded as a binary string.

Studies have indicated that miRNAs play key roles in complex diseases by taking part in many biological processes, such as cell growth, cell death and so on. Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of disease diagnosis and treatment, it is appealing to develop advanced computational methods for predicting the essentiality of miRNAs. ::: ::: ::: RESULT ::: In this study, we propose a method (PESM) to predict the miRNA essentiality based on gradient boosting machines and miRNA sequences. First, PESM extracts the sequence and structural features of miRNAs. Then it uses gradient boosting machines to predict the essentiality of miRNAs. We conduct the 5-fold cross-validation to assess the prediction performance of our method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), F-measure and accuracy (ACC) are used as the metrics to evaluate the prediction performance. We also compare PESM with other three competing methods which include miES, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The results of experiments show that PESM achieves the better prediction performance (AUC: 0.9117, F-measure: 0.8572, ACC: 0.8516) than other three computing methods. In addition, the relative importance of all features also further shows that newly added features can be helpful to improve the prediction performance of methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7079416", "pubmed_id": "32183740", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-020-3426-9", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3012154856", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["90438", "32015178", "13702049", "19538148", "11138988", "34129228", "2963495", "13965832", "10641589", "16058893", "1440722", "9375052", "14038145", "3478818", "2151284", "3699940", "3654936", "51613135", "49406702", "52081324", "59225845", "198170087", "4586099", "4964364", "13772289", "201844762", "140386737", "199486268", "91189259", "201805185", "210193625", "169034023", "209894525", "215506382", "3789520", "209461848", "211077396", "26070257", "209328401", "52918097", "23470302", "4642860", "199518167", "52130812", "53103637", "205285179", "119513227", "51870805", "4421030", "16562161", "7859147", "17140625", "3169194", "11582746", "4586938", "5734736", "215088646", "215292984", "7208922", "10659969", "201631800", "2007721", "195843849", "53243897", "201093561"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212742200"}

Understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying GIF has been limited by difficulties in eliciting and objectively characterizing such gait phenomena in the clinical setting. Studies investigating the effects of GIF on brain activity using EEG offer the potential to study such behavior. In this preliminary study, we present a novel methodology where wavelet transform was used for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine for classifying GIF events in five patients with PD and FOG. To deal with the large amount of EEG data, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the data dimension from 15 EEG channels into 6 principal components (PCs), retaining 93% of the information. Independent Component Analysis using Entropy Bound Minimization (ICA-EBM) was applied to 6 PCs for source separation with the aim of improving detection ability of GIF events as compared to the normal initiation of gait (Good Starts).

The theoretical background and the description of the forecasting techniques are given in the first part of the thesis (chapters 1-3), while the contribution is provided through the last five self-contained chapters (chapters 4-8). ::: Chapter 4 investigates the utility of the Psi Sigma neural network when applied to the task of forecasting and trading the Euro/Dollar exchange rate, while Kalman Filter estimation is tested in combining neural network forecasts. A time-varying leverage trading strategy based on volatility forecasts is also introduced. In chapter 5 three neural networks are used to forecast an exchange rate, while Kalman Filter, Genetic Programming and Support Vector Regression are implemented to provide stochastic and genetic forecast combinations. In addition, a hybrid leverage trading strategy tests if volatility forecasts and market shocks can be combined to boost the trading performance of the models. Chapter 6 presents a hybrid Genetic Algorithm \u2013 Support Vector Regression model for optimal parameter selection and feature subset combination. The model is applied to the task of forecasting and trading three euro exchange rates. The results of these chapters suggest that the stochastic and genetic neural network forecast combinations present superior forecasts and high profitability. In that way, more light is shed in the demanding issue of achieving statistical and trading efficiency in the foreign exchange markets. ::: The focus of the next two chapters shifts from exchange rate forecasting to inflation and unemployment prediction through optimal macroeconomic variable selection. Chapter 7 focuses on forecasting the US inflation and unemployment, while chapter 8 presents the Rolling Genetic \u2013 Support Vector Regression model. The latter is applied to several forecasting exercises of inflation and unemployment of EMU members. Both chapters provide information on which set of macroeconomic indicators is found relevant to inflation and unemployment targeting on a monthly basis. The proposed models statistically outperform traditional ones. Hence, the voluminous literature, suggesting that non-linear time-varying approaches are more efficient and realistic in similar applications, is extended. From a technical point of view, these algorithms are superior to non-adaptive algorithms; avoid time consuming optimization approaches and efficiently cope with dimensionality and data-snooping issues.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2135076734", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155020930"}

The first of these is the programmer channel, through which the knowledge in the system is simply edited to include the desired new knowledge. While this method is often effective, it may not be as efficient as learning directly from environmental interaction. The second channel may be called the linguistic channel, through which knowledge is added by explicitly telling the system facts or commands encoded as strings of quasi-linguistic instructions in some appropriate form. Finally, there is, for want of a better phrase, the learning channel, through which the system learns new knowledge in an inductive way via environmental observations and simple feedback information. These latter two channels are the ones upon which we wish to focus, as they are the hallmarks of instructable systems. Most instructable systems depend upon, or at least heavily favor, one of these two channels for the bulk of their knowledge acquisition. Specifically, symbolic artificial intelligence systems have generally depended upon the explicit use of sentential logical expressions, rules, or productions for the transmission of new knowledge to the system.

We aimed to develop a diagnostic model for differentiation of sepsis and non-infectious SIRS in critically ill children based on routinely available parameters (baseline characteristics, clinical/laboratory parameters, technical/medical support). This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial conducted at a German tertiary-care pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Two hundred thirty-eight cases of non-infectious SIRS and 58 cases of sepsis (as defined by IPSCC criteria) were included. We applied a Random Forest approach to identify the best set of predictors out of 44 variables measured at the day of onset of the disease. The developed diagnostic model was validated in a temporal split-sample approach. A model including four clinical (length of PICU stay until onset of non-infectious SIRS/sepsis, central line, core temperature, number of non-infectious SIRS/sepsis episodes prior to diagnosis) and four laboratory parameters (interleukin-6, platelet count, procalcitonin, CRP) was identified in the training dataset. Validation in the test dataset revealed an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70\u20130.87). Our model was superior to previously proposed biomarkers such as CRP, interleukin-6, procalcitonin or a combination of CRP and procalcitonin (maximum AUC = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.74). When aiming at a complete identification of sepsis cases (100%; 95% CI: 87\u2013100%), 28% (95% CI: 20\u201338%) of non-infectious SIRS cases were assorted correctly. Our approach allows early recognition of sepsis with an accuracy superior to previously described biomarkers, and could potentially reduce antibiotic use by 30% in non-infectious SIRS cases.

Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image is commonly used for grading. However, the classification of different types of high-grade gliomas using T1-weighted MR images is still challenging, due to the lack of imaging biomarkers. Previous studies only focused on simple visual features, ignoring rich information provided by MR images. In this paper, we propose an automatic classification pipeline using random forest to differentiate the WHO Grade III and Grade IV gliomas, by extracting discriminative features based on 3D patches. The proposed pipeline consists of three main steps in both the training and the testing stages. First, we select numerous 3D patches in and around the tumor regions of the given MR images. This can suppress the intensity information from the normal region, which is trivial for the classification process. Second, we extract features based on both patch-wise information and subject-wise clinical information, and then we refine this step to optimize the performance of malignant tumor classification. Third, we incorporate the classification forest for training/testing the classifier. We validate the proposed framework on 96 malignant brain tumor patients that consist of both Grade III (N = 38) and Grade IV gliomas (N = 58). The experiments show that the proposed framework has demonstrated its validity in the application of high-grade gliomas classification, which may help improve the poor prognosis of high-grade gliomas.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-97785-0_2", "venue": "S+SSPR", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2886663764", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51957774"}

Assessing the impact of different network and channel conditions on the user experience is important for improving the telecommunication services. The QoE for various wireless services including VoIP, video streaming, and web browsing, has been in the epicenter of recent networking activities. The majority of such efforts aim to characterize the user experience, analyzing various types of measurements often in an aggregate manner. This paper proposes the MLQoE, a modular algorithm for user-centric QoE prediction. The MLQoE employs multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression machines, Decision Trees, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers, and tunes their hyper-parameters. It uses the Nested Cross Validation (nested CV) protocol for selecting the best classifier and the corresponding best hyper-parameter values and estimates the performance of the final model. The MLQoE is conservative in the performance estimation despite multiple induction of models. The MLQoE is modular, in that, it can be easily extended to include other ML algorithms. The MLQoE selects the ML algorithm that exhibits the best performance and its parameters automatically given the dataset used as input. It uses empirical measurements based on network metrics (e.g., packet loss, delay, and packet interarrival) and subjective opinion scores reported by actual users. This paper extensively evaluates the MLQoE using three unidirectional datasets containing VoIP calls over wireless networks under various network conditions and feedback from subjects (collected in field studies). Moreover, it performs a preliminary analysis to assess the generality of our methodology using bidirectional VoIP and video traces.

The platform also aims to raise awareness about alcohol consumption in order to help people control or even reduce their alcohol consumption. The platform consists of a self-contained smart cup which the attendee uses during the day. This platform allows to easily follow the user's alcohol intake based on a model in order to display alerts if necessary. The smart cup embeds sensors to detect the liquid level and its movements. In addition, activity recognition is performed from the collected data in order to recognize when the user drinks and enhance the alcohol intake assessment. The smart cup also embeds LEDs visual displays that provides information about the alcohol intake estimation. This paper presents the design concept of the smart cup along with the technical implementation. Then, the data processing and analysis is presented for the alcohol intake estimation method using activity recognition with a Support Vector Machine classifier. An experiment have also been carried out and shows a good level of recognition above 90% for the \u201cdrinking\u201d activity.

As computing power increases and cost drops, Machine Learning is seen as an alternative method or an additional mechanism to defend against malwares, botnets, and other attacks. This paper explores Machine Learning as a viable solution by examining its capabilities to classify malicious traffic in a network. ::: First, a strong data analysis is performed resulting in 22 extracted features from the initial Netflow datasets.

Then, our approach analyzes five different machine learning algorithms against NetFlow dataset containing common botnets.

LDELM learns deep localized features in an unsupervised way from random patches of the training data. Each image is then feed-forwarded, patch-wise, through the LDELM to form a cuboid of features. The cuboid is divided into cells and pooled to get the final compact image representation which is then used to train an ELM classifier.

MANET has become an important technology in current years because of the rapid explosion of wireless devices. They are highly susceptible to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology. MANETs have unique characteristics like dynamic topology, wireless radio medium, limited resources and lack of centralized administration; as a result, they are vulnerable to different types of attacks in different layers of protocol stack. Each node in a MANET is capable of acting as a router. Routing is one of the aspects having various security concerns. There are various common Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks occurs on network layer namely Wormhole attack, Blackhole attack and Grayhole attack which are serious threats for MANETs.

Recently, SVM Support Vector Machine), a new machine learning method, is comprehensively used to solve the problem of non-liner classification and regression. Support vector machines (SVM) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. The basic SVM takes a set of input data and predicts, for each given input, which of two possible classes forms the output, making it a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. A network traffic predictive method presented in this paper is based on the LS-SVM (Least Squares SVM). In machine learning, the (Gaussian) radial basis function kernel, or RBF kernel, is a popular kernel function. It is the most popular kernel function used in support vector machine classification.

In addition, before each usage of the tracking system, a cumbersome calibration procedure must be performed to obtain a gaze mapping function. Our proposed method significantly improves the conventional Pupil Center Corneal Refection (PCCR) technique to permit natural head movement and to minimize calibration. Support vector regression (SVR) is used to construct a highly nonlinear generalized gaze mapping function that accounts for head movement. As the head moves naturally in front of the camera, the associated gaze mapping function with each new head position will be obtained automatically by the learned generalized gaze mapping function.

However, it is inapplicable directly to Korean women since breast cancer risk is dependent on race. Also, it shows low accuracy (58%-59%). In this study, breast cancer discrimination models for Korean women are developed using only epidemiological case-control data (n = 4,574).

Although the support vector machine took the longest calculation time, the highest classification performance has been achieved in the case of women older than 50 yr (AUC = 64%). The proposed model is dependent on demographic characteristics, reproductive factors, and lifestyle habits without using any clinical or genetic test. It is expected that the model could be implemented as a web-based discrimination tool for breast cancer. This tool can encourage potential breast cancer prone women to go the hospital for diagnostic tests. ::: ::: Graphical Abstract ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: Keywords: Breast Neoplasms, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Computers ::: ::: ::: INTRODUCTION ::: A breast cancer is one of leading cancers for the Korean women and its incidence rate has been rapidly increasing every year (1). An early diagnosis of breast cancer is a crucial step in reducing the mortality rate because the breast cancer survival rate rises to 95.6% (2) if breast cancer is detected during stage I. Various researches on the early diagnosis of breast cancer have been conducted and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the United States has released a Web-based Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (3). The tool is based on the Gail Model (4) and it is purely based on the epidemiologic data. A drawback of the NCI Tool maybe relatively low accuracy in prediction (i.e., 58%-59%) (5). However, it could be a still good prediction tool since the women can check the risk of breast cancer at home without visiting hospital. ::: ::: Recently, computational discrimination methods have been applied for clinical classification and regression analysis (6,7) of risk factors. Emerging artificial intelligent algorithms have the potential to extract meaningful information or identify differences among the enormous amount of data. Previously, a considerable amount of research regarding risk assessments of breast cancer using computational discrimination methods has been performed. Bayesian network (BN) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used to calculate survivor rates for breast cancer patients, and these modeling techniques show high sensitivity and specificity (8). These breast cancer risk assessment models are helpful for clinical diagnosis and breast cancer treatment planning (9). Hybrid models of ANN and BN using clinical data (especially mammography) have been previously used in the risk analysis and diagnosis of breast cancer (10,11). BN models based on a number of risk factors have been previously investigated for Korean women (8,12). However, these studies have limitations in their generalizability because of small sample sizes. However, a discrimination of breast cancer using only epidemiological risk factors based on case-control study data set has not been performed previously. ::: ::: Breast cancer risk assessment requires the analysis of different characteristics that depend on race (13). Particularly, the incidence of breast cancer in Korean women is lower than in Western women, and the incidence in Korean women begins to decrease after the age of 50, whereas the incidence in Western women increases gradually with age until 80 yr old, as shown in Fig. 1 (14,15). The Gail model based on western women data would have to be recalibrated to rates of breast cancer in Korea to make it applicable. Therefore, a Korean breast cancer risk assessment tool (KoBCRAT) which is more applicable to Korean women than the Gail model based on western populations has been developed using a case-control study (Seoul Breast Cancer Study, SeBCs) with 4,647 cases and 4,601 controls (16). Although the same raw data from SeBCs has been used to develop each model, there are two main differences between the KoBCRAT and the breast cancer risk classification algorithm proposed in this research. First, unlike the KoBCRAT, the proposed algorithms in this research were developed and validated with a rich data set, which were 2,291 cases and 2,283 controls through different selection criteria. Breast cancer risk classification algorithms for Korean women were developed considering those rates as well as augmenting risk factors for Korean women. Data were separated with respect to age groups and risk factors were selected according to the methods. Secondly, KoBCRAT has been developed based upon Gail model's equation while the three different classifiers such as the support vector machine (SVM), ANN, and BN are being considered in this research. Further, the results of three different methods were compared for two different reasons; 1) to find out which method is the best and 2) to validate a method comparing with the other two methods. ::: ::: ::: ::: Fig. 1 ::: ::: Incidence rates of breast cancer (in 2008): Korean women vs white women in the USA (14,15). ::: ::: ::: ::: Results showed that area under the curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve are calculated as 60%-64%. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, single iterative calculation time, and contribution of a specific risk factor to models are presented in detail.

Based on galactic models, we can expect microlensing events across a vastly wider region of the galaxy, although the cadence of these surveys (2-3 d \u2212 1 ) is lower than traditional microlensing surveys, making efficient detection a challenge. Rapid advances are being made in the utility of time-series data to detect and classify transient events in real-time using very high data-rate surveys, but limited work has been published regarding the detection of microlensing events, particularly for when the data streams are of relatively low-cadence.

CNNs have demonstrated excellent performance on various tasks including image classification, feature extraction, and segmentation. CNNs can learn features automatically from large datasets through the organization of multi-layers of neurons and have the ability to implement nonlinear decision functions. This study investigates the potential of CNN approaches to extract flooded areas from UAV imagery. A VGG-based fully convolutional network (FCN-16s) was used in this research. The model was fine-tuned and a k-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate the performance of the model on the new UAV imagery dataset. This approach allowed FCN-16s to be trained on the datasets that contained only one hundred training samples, and resulted in a highly accurate classification. Confusion matrix was calculated to estimate the accuracy of the proposed method. The image segmentation results obtained from FCN-16s were compared from the results obtained from FCN-8s, FCN-32s and SVMs. Experimental results showed that the FCNs could extract flooded areas precisely from UAV images compared to the traditional classifiers such as SVMs. The classification accuracy achieved by FCN-16s, FCN-8s, FCN-32s, and SVM for the water class was 97.52%, 97.8%, 94.20% and 89%, respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6479537", "pubmed_id": "30934695", "doi": "10.3390/s19071486", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2924082650", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["128888093", "21708162", "21331196", "30612617", "17917874", "18383844", "17754100", "9847433", "195908774", "38953733", "37336258", "13816461", "65126673", "56507745", "3719281", "202960210", "5165390", "62711222", "15745256", "49545311", "6916627", "14124313", "206592484", "64486064", "140652307", "24823225", "7138354", "14495716", "17415407", "53306101"], "inbound_citations": ["210930212", "208076028", "210908760", "207906662", "208224366", "210930011"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91187268"}

Existing correlation-based methods do not guarantee positive correlations of the selected features and often need a pre-feature selection step to reduce redundant features on each feature view. The new GNCCA approach attempts to overcome these issues by incorporating (1) a nonnegativity constraint that guarantees positive correlations in the reduced representation and (2) a group-sparsity constraint that allows for simultaneous between- and within- view feature selection. In particular, GNCCA is designed to emphasize correlations between feature views and class labels such that the selected features guarantee better class separability. In this work, GNCCA was evaluated on three prostate cancer (CaP) prognosis tasks: (i) identifying 40 CaP patients with and without 5-year biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy by fusing quantitative features extracted from digitized pathology and proteomics, (ii) predicting in vivo prostate cancer grade for 16 CaP patients by fusing T2w and DCE MRI, and (iii) localizing CaP/benign regions on MR spectroscopy and MRI for 36 patients. For the three tasks, GNCCA identifies a feature subset comprising 2%, 1% and 22%, respectively, of the original extracted features. These selected features achieve improved or comparable results compared to using all features with the same Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, GNCCA consistently outperforms 5 state-of-the-art feature selection methods across all three datasets.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25320823", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-10443-0_49", "venue": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The integrative approach augments the segmentation capabilities of the off-line trained ML classifier for pixel-based object detection in images by using graph and weights for pixels. The approach integrates the ML model, graph, pixel weights, the neighborhood weights and the graph-cut. For an evaluation, we use two bi-class pixel-based object detection problems of pixel-based skin detection and pixel-based sky color detection in images. An evaluation of the Bayesian Network (BayesNet), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest and the Histogram approach of Jones and Rehg (JR) based on the two datasets of skin and one dataset of the sky images reveals that the proposed integrative approach improves the detection performance in all the cases compared to using the classifiers alone.

In this paper, a novel RF framework is proposed, named Bernoulli RFs (BRFs), with the aim of solving the RF dilemma between theoretical consistency and empirical performance. BRF uses two independent Bernoulli distributions to simplify the tree construction, in contrast to the RFs proposed by Breiman. The two Bernoulli distributions are separately used to control the splitting feature and splitting point selection processes of tree construction. Consequently, theoretical consistency is ensured in BRF, i.e., the convergence of learning performance to optimum will be guaranteed when infinite data are given. Importantly, our proposed BRF is consistent for both classification and regression. The best empirical performance is achieved by BRF when it is compared with state-of-the-art theoretical/consistent RFs.

Although a number of high-throughput technologies have been proposed to predict PPIs, there are unavoidable shortcomings, including high cost, time intensity, and inherently high false positive rates. For these reasons, many computational methods have been proposed for predicting PPIs. However, the problem is still far from being solved. In this article, we propose a novel computational method called RVM-BiGP that combines the relevance vector machine (RVM) model and Bi-gram Probabilities (BiGP) for PPIs detection from protein sequences. The major improvement includes (1) Protein sequences are represented using the Bi-gram probabilities (BiGP) feature representation on a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), in which the protein evolutionary information is contained; (2) For reducing the influence of noise, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used to reduce the dimension of BiGP vector; (3) The powerful and robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is used for classification. Five-fold cross-validation experiments executed on yeast and Helicobacter pylori datasets, which achieved very high accuracies of 94.57 and 90.57%, respectively. Experimental results are significantly better than previous methods. To further evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the yeast dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our RVM-BiGP method is significantly better than the SVM-based method. In addition, we achieved 97.15% accuracy on imbalance yeast dataset, which is higher than that of balance yeast dataset. The promising experimental results show the efficiency and robust of the proposed method, which can be an automatic decision support tool for future proteomics research. For facilitating extensive studies for future proteomics research, we developed a freely available web server called RVM-BiGP-PPIs in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) for predicting PPIs.

Upper extremity impairments are very common after stroke. To support the recovery process, conventional assessment methods such as Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) are widely used to assess motor performance of stroke patients. However, the assessments face some limitations such as being subjective and time-consuming. Many research have been done to solve the limitations of conventional assessments by using motion capture sensor or robotics for objective assessment. The main objective of this research is to design and develop a vision-based automated rehabilitation and assessment system to assess upper extremity of stroke patients. A Kinect-based system was used as an upper extremity stroke rehabilitation assessment system with isolated training movement namely Shoulder Abduction-Adduction (SAA). Three experiments were conducted involving a total of eight healthy subjects and three stroke patients. A total of six out of nine collected features have been proved being significantly different using t-test method. The suitable features were selected using three different features selection methods, namely Relief-F, Principal Analysis Component, and Correlation-based Feature Selection. These three feature sets were then trained with four different classifiers: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Tree and Random Forests in order to achieve the best predictive model. With a total of three feature sets and four classifiers, a total of 12 predictive models were constructed in this thesis. The 12 models were evaluated based on correlation-analysis.

Existing methods have discovered influential nodes and cluster nodes separately, especially in a citation network. This study develops a method used to detect influential nodes (that is, core patents) and clusters (that is, patent groups) in a patent citation network simultaneously rather than separately. The method allows a core patent in each patent group to be discovered easily and the distribution of similar patents around a core patent to be recognized.

The lip color of a person is considered as a symptom to reflect the physical conditions of organs in the body. However, the traditional diagnostic approach is mainly based on observation by doctor\u2019s nude eyes, which is non-quantitative and subjective. The non-quantitative approach largely depends on the doctor\u2019s experience and influences accurate the diagnosis and treatment in TCM. Developing new quantification methods to identify the exact syndrome based on the lip diagnosis of TCM becomes urgent and important. In this paper, we design a computer-assisted classification model to provide an automatic and quantitative approach for the diagnosis of TCM based on the lip images. A computer-assisted classification method is designed and applied for syndrome diagnosis based on the lip images. Our purpose is to classify the lip images into four groups: deep-red, red, purple and pale. The proposed scheme consists of four steps including the lip image preprocessing, image feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The extracted 84 features contain the lip color space component, texture and moment features. Feature subset selection is performed by using SVM-RFE (Support Vector Machine with recursive feature elimination), mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) and IG (information gain). Classification model is constructed based on the collected lip image features using multi-class SVM and Weighted multi-class SVM (WSVM). In addition, we compare SVM with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, Multiple Asymmetric Partial Least Squares Classifier (MAPLSC) and Na\u00efve Bayes for the diagnosis performance comparison. All displayed faces image have obtained consent from the participants. A total of 257 lip images are collected for the modeling of lip diagnosis in TCM. The feature selection method SVM-RFE selects 9 important features which are composed of 5 color component features, 3 texture features and 1 moment feature. SVM, MAPLSC, Na\u00efve Bayes, kNN showed better classification results based on the 9 selected features than the results obtained from all the 84 features. The total classification accuracy of the five methods is 84%, 81%, 79% and 81%, 77%, respectively. So SVM achieves the best classification accuracy. The classification accuracy of SVM is 81%, 71%, 89% and 86% on Deep-red, Pale Purple, Red and lip image models, respectively. While with the feature selection algorithm mRMR and IG, the total classification accuracy of WSVM achieves the best classification accuracy. Therefore, the results show that the system can achieve best classification accuracy combined with SVM classifiers and SVM-REF feature selection algorithm. A diagnostic system is proposed, which firstly segments the lip from the original facial image based on the Chan-Vese level set model and Otsu method, then extracts three kinds of features (color space features, Haralick co-occurrence features and Zernike moment features) on the lip image. Meanwhile, SVM-REF is adopted to select the optimal features. Finally, SVM is applied to classify the four classes. Besides, we also compare different feature selection algorithms and classifiers to verify our system. So the developed automatic and quantitative diagnosis system of TCM is effective to distinguish four lip image classes: Deep-red, Purple, Red and Pale. This study puts forward a new method and idea for the quantitative examination on lip diagnosis of TCM, as well as provides a template for objective diagnosis in TCM.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3522569", "pubmed_id": "22898352", "doi": "10.1186/1472-6882-12-127", "venue": "BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "journal": "BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2129456158", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3041842", "13186751", "18275454", "2949211", "5508286", "17770885", "62157538", "206786900", "44050331", "61649919", "5373332", "206764015", "5083193", "11625473", "13424148", "11089235", "24061568", "961425", "8946742", "3116168", "38623860"], "inbound_citations": ["7188534", "215103545", "4349499", "51890273", "13986006", "215214146", "215100781", "454174", "28878878", "18683530", "3237502", "11179819", "47571562", "39622807", "14857263", "38492799", "215193538", "24509108", "214919445", "679207"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2790808"}

However, the current prediction models display low accuracy and high sample size dependence. The purpose of this study is to put forward a new prediction method based on an improved support vector machine (SVM) to solve these problems. Methods: A total of 200 individuals participated in this study and were further divided into a modeling group and a test group. Their physiological parameters (height, weight, age, the four parameters of abdominal impedance and body fat mass) were measured using the body composition tester (the universal INBODY measurement device) based on BIA. Intelligent algorithms were used in the modeling group to build predictive models and the test group was used in model performance evaluation. Firstly, the optimal boundary C and parameter gamma were optimized by the particle swarm algorithm. We then developed an algorithm to classify human abdominal adiposity according to the parameter setup of the SVM algorithm and constructed the prediction model using this algorithm. Finally, we designed experiments to compare the performances of the proposed method and the other methods. Results: There are different abdominal obesity prediction models in the 1 KHz and 250 KHz frequency bands. The experimental data demonstrates that for the frequency band of 250 KHz, the proposed method can reduce the false classification rate by 10.7%, 15%, and 33% in relation to the sole SVM algorithm, the regression model, and the waistline measurement model, respectively. For the frequency band of 1 KHz, the proposed model is still more accurate.

These models play an essential role in science and engineering because they fill the gap in those cases where we know the input-output behaviour of a system, but there is not a mathematical model to understand and predict its changes in future or even prevent threats. In this context, the nonlinear approximation of systems is nowadays very popular since it better describes complex instances. On the other hand, digital image processing is an area of systems engineering that is expanding the analysis dimension level in a variety of real-life problems while it is becoming more attractive and affordable over time. Medicine has made the most of it by supporting important human decision-making processes through computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. ::: ::: This thesis presents three different frameworks for breast cancer detection, with approaches ranging from nonlinear system identification, nonlinear system identification coupled with simple neural networks, to multilayer neural networks. In particular, the nonlinear system identification approaches termed the Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) model and the MultiScales Radial Basis Function (MSRBF) neural networks appear for the first time in image processing. Along with the above contributions takes place the presentation of the Multilayer-Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) neural network for faster training and more accurate image classification. ::: ::: A central research aim is to take advantage of nonlinear system identification and multilayer neural networks to enhance the feature extraction process, while the classification in CAD systems is bolstered. In the case of multilayer neural networks, the extraction is carried throughout stacked autoencoders, a bottleneck network architecture that promotes a data transformation between layers. In the case of nonlinear system identification, the goal is to add flexible models capable of capturing distinctive features from digital images that might be shortly recognised by simpler approaches. The purpose of detecting nonlinearities in digital images is complementary to that of linear models since the goal is to extract features in greater depth, in which both linear and nonlinear elements can be captured. This aim is relevant because, accordingly to previous work cited in the first chapter, not all spatial relationships existing in digital images can be explained appropriately with linear dependencies. ::: ::: Experimental results show that the methodologies based on system identification produced reliable images models with customised mathematical structure. The models came to include nonlinearities in different proportions, depending upon the case under examination. The information about nonlinearity and model structure was used as part of the whole image model. It was found that, in some instances, the models from different clinical classes in the breast cancer detection problem presented a particular structure. For example, NARX models of the malignant class showed higher non-linearity percentage and depended more on exogenous inputs compared to other classes. ::: ::: Regarding classification performance, comparisons of the three new CAD systems with existing methods had variable results. As for the NARX model, its performance was superior in three cases but was overcame in two. However, the comparison must be taken with caution since different databases were used. The MSRBF model was better in 5 out of 6 cases and had superior specificity in all instances, overcoming in 3.5% the closest model in this line. The ML-FELM model was the best in 6 out of 6 cases, although it was defeated in accuracy by 0.6% in one case and specificity in 0.22% in another one.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2966976397", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201891421"}

It has been successfully applied in many classification problems. But, the common issue for LS-SVM is that it lacks sparseness, which is a serious drawback in its applications. To tackle this problem, a fast approach is proposed in this paper for developing sparse LS-SVM. First, a new regression solution is proposed for the LS-SVM which optimizes the same objective function for the conventional solution.

Hence, in this article, an Incremental Learning based Multiobjective Fuzzy Clustering for Categorical Data is proposed. For this purpose, a multiobjective modified differential evolution based fuzzy clustering algorithm is developed. Thereafter, it integrates with the well-known supervised classifier, called random forest, using incremental learning to propose the aforementioned technique. Here, the multiobjective algorithm produces a set of optimal clustering solutions, known as Pareto-optimal solutions, by optimizing two conflicting objectives simultaneously. Subsequently, through incremental learning using random forest classifier final solution is evolved from the ensemble Pareto-optimal solutions.

By utilizing information extraction techniques such as entity extraction, co-referencing, and pronoun resolution, the review texts are segmented into multiple sections where each section contains multiple sentences and discusses a particular aspect of the reviewed movie. For each aspect section, a machine-learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is applied to determine sentiment orientation toward the target aspect.

Detecting the optical properties of aerosols using passive satellite-borne measurements alone is a difficult task due to the broadband effect of aerosols on the measured spectra and the influences of surface and cloud reflection. We present another approach to determine aerosol type, namely by studying the relationship of aerosol optical depth (AOD) with trace gas abundance, aerosol absorption, and mean aerosol size. Our new Global Aerosol Classification Algorithm, GACA, examines relationships between aerosol properties (AOD and extinction Angstrom exponent from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), UV Aerosol Index from the second Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment, GOME-2) and trace gas column densities (NO2, HCHO, SO2 from GOME-2, and CO from MOPITT, the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere instrument) on a monthly mean basis. First, aerosol types are separated based on size (Angstrom exponent) and absorption (UV Aerosol Index), then the dominating sources are identified based on mean trace gas columns and their correlation with AOD. In this way, global maps of dominant aerosol type and main source type are constructed for each season and compared with maps of aerosol composition from the global MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) model. Although GACA cannot correctly characterize transported or mixed aerosols, GACA and MACC show good agreement regarding the global seasonal cycle, particularly for urban/industrial aerosols. The seasonal cycles of both aerosol type and source are also studied in more detail for selected 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 regions. Again, good agreement between GACA and MACC is found for all regions, but some systematic differences become apparent: the variability of aerosol composition (yearly and/or seasonal) is often not well captured by MACC, the amount of mineral dust outside of the dust belt appears to be overestimated, and the abundance of secondary organic aerosols is underestimated in comparison with GACA. Whereas the presented study is of exploratory nature, we show that the developed algorithm is well suited to evaluate climate and atmospheric composition models by including aerosol type and source obtained from measurements into the comparison, instead of focusing on a single parameter, e.g., AOD. The approach could be adapted to constrain the mix of aerosol types during the process of a combined data assimilation of aerosol and trace gas observations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/acp-15-10597-2015", "venue": null, "journal": "Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2103754321", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["104446050", "214700504", "54068394", "28663705", "210145519", "55306044"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55181828"}

The base wavelet that maximizes the energy to Shannon entropy ratio is selected to extract statistical features from wavelet coefficients. Finally, a comparative study is carried out with the calculated statistical features as input to two supervised soft computing techniques like Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for faults classification.

Typically sites of interest can extend up to many hundreds of square kilometers. However, collecting ground truth data (optical imagery, towed video, grab samples, and etc.) over such broad scales is impractical, and only a small fraction of the sites can be sampled depending on budget constraints. Benthic habitat mapping involves learning the correlations between habitat classes derived from limited ground truth sampling of the seabed and its corresponding morphology and extrapolating these correlations to the entire site. One important issue with such approaches is that the correlations are learned on limited data, therefore, motivating the need to investigate robust techniques for learning the correlations and extrapolating them. In this paper we have motivated the use of the generative classifier Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM's) for the task of benthic habitat mapping instead of discriminative models such as Classification Trees (CT's \u2014 popular in the benthic habitat mapping literature) and Support Vector Machines (SVM's \u2014 generally popular in a variety of fields) based on the idea that generative classifiers take into more information about the underlying data distribution than discriminative classifiers, yielding more robust extrapolations. Using holdout validation we have shown that GMM's consistently perform comparably, or outperform, the best classifier for all training set sizes (small and large), and that this is not the case with CT's and SVM's. We also show that GMM's are more certain about their predictions over the broad-scale than the other classifiers.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/OCEANS-Yeosu.2012.6263540", "venue": "2012 Oceans - Yeosu", "journal": "2012 Oceans - Yeosu", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1993188849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["17014232", "22358738", "54520065", "129337734", "85678301", "131086014", "130215651", "131218819", "18912881", "82355490", "140726582", "129779428", "44639725", "5764133", "10442029", "10285111", "21787339", "778086", "23406563", "26722546", "8256634", "38380986", "18514002", "198157215", "124985575", "4193919", "34133936", "16374484", "14727192", "86426456", "30533367", "961425", "9680336", "13635856", "13371224", "14217319", "6009000", "12129013", "8816149"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6925931"}

This is because it seems reasonable to expect that certain distinct views are more correlated than some others, and thus identifying correlated views could improve recognition. Also, part-based modeling is expected to improve robustness against self-occlusion when actors are imaged from different views.
