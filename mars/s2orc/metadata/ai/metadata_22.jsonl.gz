As smoke is often an initial sign of fire, smoke detection using surveillance cameras is key to providing early alarm in open space environments. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction method that combines local binary patterns with co-occurrence of texture features in RGB color space to characterize the diverse manifestations of smoke. The proposed RGB color based Local Binary Co-occurrence Patterns (RGB_LBCoP) extracts smoke features from candidate smoke regions which are extracted by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. Subsequently, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for training and classification based on these features. The major benefit of the proposed feature descriptor is the ability to incorporate local and global texture properties of smoke along with color information. This property enables the detection of smoke in complex environments and provides insensitivity to illumination changes. For validation, performance of the proposed method is compared with other LBP variants and Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM).

In addition, identifying feasible network traffic features is a major challenge for an accurate detection of the attacks. In this paper, we propose a hypervisor level distributed network security (HLDNS) framework which is deployed on each processing server of cloud computing.

The derived features are applied to the Random Forest classifier for detecting the intrusions in cloud network traffic and intrusion alerts are generated. The intrusion alerts from different servers are correlated to identify the distributed attack and to generate new attack signature. For the performance and feasibility analysis, the proposed security framework is tested on the cloud network testbed at NIT Goa and using recent UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS-2017 intrusion datasets.

To improve classification and change detection of riparian buffers, this paper developed an evolutionary computational, supervised classification method--the RIparian Classification Algorithm (RICAL)--to conduct the seasonal change detection of riparian zones in a vast semi-arid watershed, South Texas. RICAL uniquely demonstrates an integrative effort to incorporate both vegetation indices and soil moisture images derived from LANDSAT 5 TM and RADARSAT-1 satellite images, respectively. First, an estimation of soil moisture based on RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images was conducted via the first-stage genetic programming (GP) practice. Second, for the statistical analyses and image classification, eight vegetation indices were prepared based on reflectance factors that were calculated as the response of the instrument on LANDSAT. These spectral vegetation indices were then independently used for discriminate analysis along with soil moisture images to classify the riparian zones via the second-stage GP practice. The practical implementation was assessed by a case study in the Choke Canyon Reservoir Watershed (CCRW), South Texas, which is mostly agricultural and range land in a semi-arid coastal environment. To enhance the application potential, a combination of Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA) and maximum likelihood supervised classification was also performed for spectral discrimination and classification of riparian varieties comparatively. Research findings show that the RICAL algorithm may yield around 90% accuracy based on the unseen ground data. But using different vegetation indices would not significantly improve the final quality of the spectral discrimination and classification.

The main contributions of this article are: (1) the development of a novel bio-inspired algorithm called Kangaroo Mob Optimization, (2) the development of a machine learning methodology for predicting the daily living activities based on Binary Kangaroo Mob Optimization Features Selection and Random Forest and (3) the application of the proposed methodology on four datasets from literature and on one synthetic dataset in order to demonstrate the improvement of the classification performance.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CSCS.2019.00046", "venue": "2019 22nd International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science (CSCS)", "journal": "2019 22nd International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science (CSCS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2953670995", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["53101139", "3985305", "49405135", "6551637", "22990894", "53280410", "3628257", "53284857", "28670840", "51625987", "17345625", "20671715", "4870430", "52933090", "1269449", "32477407", "53229455", "52302865", "11315476", "63184169", "31519578", "10417615", "15548493", "11690478", "5385222", "22548242", "53608878", "22036810", "4878009", "6514304", "31168768", "10337279", "3089400", "5874130", "9038218", "14159642", "53282932"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195740256"}

This paper proposes a fully automated Computer Assisted Evaluation (CAE) system which comprises of a set of algorithms for exudates detection and to classify the different stages of Diabetics Retinopathy, which are identified as either normal or mild or moderate or severe. Experimental validation is performed on a real fundus retinal image database. The segmentation of exudates is achieved using fuzzy C-means clustering and entropy filtering. An optimal set obtained from the statistical textural features (GLCM and GLHM) is extracted from the segmented exudates for classifying the different stages of Diabetics Retinopathy. The different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy are classified using three classifiers such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results show that the SVM classifiers outperformed other classifiers for the examined fundus retinal image dataset.

The user edits a voxel grid with a painting interface (like Minecraft). Yet, at any time, he/she can execute a SNAP command, which projects the current voxel grid onto a latent shape manifold with a learned projection operator and then generates a similar, but more realistic, shape using a learned generator network. Then the user can edit the resulting shape and snap again until he/she is satisfied with the result. The main advantage of this approach is that the projection and generation operators assist novice users to create 3D models characteristic of a background distribution of object shapes, but without having to specify all the details. The core new research idea is to use a GAN to support this application. 3D GANs have previously been used for shape generation, interpolation, and completion, but never for interactive modeling. The new challenge for this application is to learn a projection operator that takes an arbitrary 3D voxel model and produces a latent vector on the shape manifold from which a similar and realistic shape can be generated. We develop algorithms for this and other steps of the SNAP processing pipeline and integrate them into a simple modeling tool.

It is suggested that experimental data indicating approximate postural invariance for reaches do not imply that the motor system is utilizing postural targets. Instead, an inverse kinematics transformation utilizing a directional mapping with a \u201cpostural relaxation\u201d component is shown to be consistent with these data while also providing motor equivalent capabilities not possessed by models that use postural targets. This transformation is related to robotics techniques utilizing a Jacobian pseudoinverse and to the motor control models of Cruse and colleagues. A self-organizing neural network architecture that learns such a directional mapping is presented, including simulations verifying its ability to explain the approximate postural invariance seen in the experimental data.

Alcoholism affects the structure and functioning of brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can depict the state of brain. The EEG signals are ensemble of various neuronal activity recorded from different scalp regions having different characteristics and very low magnitude in microvolts. These factors make human interpretation difficult and time consuming to analyze these signals. Moreover, these highly varying EEG signals are susceptible to inter/intra variability errors. So, a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) can be used to identify the alcoholic and normal subjects accurately. However, these EEG signals exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary properties. Therefore, it needs much effort in deciphering the diagnostic evidence from them using linear time and frequency-domain methods. The nonlinear parameters together with time-frequency/scale domain methods can help to detect tiny changes in these signals. The correntropy is nonlinear indicator which characterizes the dynamic behavior of EEG signals in time-scale domain. In this paper, we present a new way for diagnosis of alcoholism using Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT) based features derived from EEG signals. The feature extraction is performed using TQWT based decomposition and extracted Centered Correntropy (CC) from the forth decomposed detail sub-band. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for feature reduction followed by Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) for classifying normal and alcoholic EEG signals. In order to make sure reliable classification performance, 10-fold cross-validation scheme is adopted. Our proposed system is able to diagnose the alcoholic and normal EEG signals, with an average accuracy of 97.02%, sensitivity of 96.53%, specificity of 97.50% and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9494 for Q-factor (Q) varying between 3 and 8 using Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function. Also, we have established a novel Alcoholism Risk Index (ARI) using three clinically significant features to discriminate the given classes by means of a single number. This system can be used for automated diagnosis and monitoring of alcoholic subjects to evaluate the effect of treatment.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2016.11.002", "venue": "Appl.

Specifically, (A) ranking-based selection mechanism to speed up the backdoor trigger generation and perturbation process while defeating pruning-based and/or retraining-based defenses. (B) autoencoder-powered trigger generation is proposed to produce a robust trigger that can defeat the input pre-processing-based defense, while guaranteeing that selected neuron(s) can be significantly activated.

Therefore, software aging is closely related to system performance. Understanding and analyzing performance issues in the software system is critical to mastering software aging information. Instead of focusing on normal valid bug reports (VBRs), this paper advocates the usage of invalid bug reports (IBRs) to capture software aging signals. We use performance bugs that are highly related to software aging as an example to construct a binary classification model for bug report classification. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of the constructed models via different performance measures (i.e., recall, precision, F1-score, AUC). Then, the model is used to predict the performance bug reports (PBRs) in IBRs, and a manual analysis of the prediction results is conducted to identify aging-related bug reports (ABRs). The final results show that the ratio of PBRs in IBRs ranges from 4.9 to 42.18% for the two real open-source projects HDFS and HBase when considering five different classifiers. Among these five classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier can achieve the best performance. The ratios of PBRs in IBRs by using this classifier are 11.1% and 15.35% for these two datasets and the performances in terms of F1-score are 85% and 74%. Further analysis of the predicted PBRs of IBRs in the project HDFS is conducted through a manual user case study; some surprising findings revealing the relationship between IBRs, PBRs, and ABRs are presented: (1) Around 50% of the PBRs in IBRs are related to software aging; (2) components that undertake major tasks are more prone to aging problems; (3) more than 50% ARBs lead to timeout, 33% ARBs are caused by improper control of memory or threats, and 29% ARBs are caused by inappropriate management of file operation or disk usage; (4) hard to reproduce is the major reason that ARBs are usually closed as invalid because many aging-related bugs would temporarily disappear by restarting the system.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11219-019-09481-2", "venue": "Software Quality Journal", "journal": "Software Quality Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2999930818", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17601393", "89141", "961425", "52874011", "7573685", "6324563", "1841765", "119351629", "77139", "33021340", "3116168", "53356703", "109217282", "36342288", "51922218", "741397", "52071400", "15171249", "3432368", "6345218", "5934430", "19735420", "67024004", "126133208", "12549681", "125165001", "155100007", "5297867", "63215468", "53436702", "13412536"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210157926"}

Firstly, preprocessing techniques, like filtration and k-means clustering are performed to the raw data to filter out the \u201ccorrupted\u201d low frequency (LF) information and generate the band-pass filter bank. Then, the processed data is decomposed into 20 categories via Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), filter bank method and wavelet transform and 11 statistical features are extracted for each category. Subsequently, Max-relevance Min-redundancy (mRMR) method helps to select salient features with best trade-off between relevance and redundancy. With these selected features, a newly developed three-layer classification structure with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Random Forest (RF) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based combination classifiers is proposed to derive the current sea state.

The existing semantic mapping approaches typically consider small number of semantic categories, require complex inference or large number of training examples to achieve desirable performance. In the proposed work we present an efficient approach for predicting locations of generic objects in urban environments by means of semantic segmentation of a video into object and non-object categories. We exploit widely available exemplars of non-object categories (such as road, buildings, vegetation) and use geometric cues which are indicative of the presence of object boundaries to gather the evidence about objects regardless of their category. We formulate the object/non-object semantic segmentation problem in the Conditional Random Field framework, where the structure of the graph is induced by a minimum spanning tree computed over a 3D point cloud, yielding an efficient algorithm for an exact inference. The chosen 3D representation naturally lends itself for on-line recursive belief updates with a simple soft data association mechanism.

In order to overcome this in endoscopic approaches, hyperrealistic concepts have been proposed to be used in an augmented reality-setting, which are based on deep image-to-image transformation methods. Such concepts are able to generate realistic representations of phantoms learned from real intraoperative endoscopic sequences. Conditioned on frames from the surgical training process, the learned models are able to generate impressive results by transforming unrealistic parts of the image (e.g. the uniform phantom texture is replaced by the more heterogeneous texture of the tissue). Image-to-image synthesis usually learns a mapping \\(G:X~\\rightarrow ~Y\\) such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y. However, it does not necessarily force the generated images to be consistent and without artifacts. In the endoscopic image domain this can affect depth cues and stereo consistency of a stereo image pair, which ultimately impairs surgical vision. We propose a cross-domain conditional generative adversarial network approach (GAN) that aims to generate more consistent stereo pairs. The results show substantial improvements in depth perception and realism evaluated by 3 domain experts and 3 medical students on a 3D monitor over the baseline method.

Sequence-based homology-free encoding schemes have been increasingly applied to develop promising protein-protein interaction (PPI) predictors by means of statistical or machine learning methods. Here we analyze the relationship between codon pair usage and PPIs in yeast. We show that codon pair usage of interacting protein pairs differs significantly from randomly expected. This motivates the development of a novel approach for predicting PPIs, with codon pair frequency difference as input to a Support Vector Machine predictor, termed as CCPPI. 10-fold cross-validation tests based on yeast PPI datasets with balanced positive-to-negative ratios indicate that CCPPI performs better than other sequence-based encoding schemes. Moreover, it ranks the best when tested on an unbalanced large-scale dataset. Although CCPPI is subjected to high false positive rates like many PPI predictors, statistical analyses of the predicted true positives confirm that the success of CCPPI is partly ascribed to its capability to capture proteomic co-expression and functional similarities between interacting protein pairs. Our findings suggest that codon pairs of interacting protein pairs evolve in a coordinated manner and consequently they provide additional information beyond amino acids-based encoding schemes.

In case of breast cancer medical treatment, the breast cancer classification methods can be used to classify input images as normal and abnormal classes for better diagnoses and earlier detection with breast tumors. However, classification process can be challenging because of the existence of noise in the images, and complicated structures of the image. Manual classification of the images is time-consuming, and need to be done only by medical experts. Hence using an automated medical image classification tool is useful and necessary. In addition, having a better training data set directly affect the quality of classification process. In this paper, a method is proposed based on supervised learning and automatic thresholding for both generating better training data set, and more accurate classification of the mammogram images into Normal/Abnormal classes. The procedure consists of preprocessing, removing noise, elimination of unwanted objects, features extraction, and classification. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the supervised model in two phases which are testing and training. Intensity value, auto-correlation matrix value of detected corners, and, energy, are three extracted features used to train the SVM.

The proposed algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art classification methods for 16S rRNA metagenomic data, including Random Forests and the phylogeny-based Metaphyl algorithm, for varying sample size, classification difficulty, and dimensionality (number of OTUs), using both synthetic and real metagenomic data sets. The results demonstrate that the proposed OBC method, with either noninformative or constructed priors, is competitive or superior to the other methods. In particular, in the case where the ratio of sample size to dimensionality is small, it was observed that the proposed method can vastly outperform the others. Author summary Recent studies have highlighted the interplay between host genetics, gut microbes, and colorectal tumor initiation/progression. The characterization of microbial communities using metagenomic profiling has therefore received renewed interest. In this paper, we propose a method for classification, i.e., prediction of different outcomes, based on 16S rRNA metagenomic data. The proposed method employs a Bayesian approach, which is suitable for data sets with small ration of number of available instances to the dimensionality.

We applied these two methods to intrusion detection in an experimental control system network, and compared the differences in the classification.

The benefit of using learned ACOPF solutions is shown to be solver and network dependent, but shows promise for quickly finding approximate solutions to the ACOPF problem.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.08860", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MLSP.2019.8918690", "venue": "2019 IEEE 29th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 29th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2946681496,2994480493", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["88508195", "206701629", "111011740", "53728047", "52152571", "110369343", "19579573", "12722985", "119590742", "65069073", "119141028", "1673912", "117636684", "9232391", "2075824", "3882439", "11160018", "12438460", "35110452"], "inbound_citations": ["207756751", "214595286", "203641740", "211082652"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:162168681"}

The fusion of these two algorithms provides a numerical efficiency advantage since an SVR Quadratic Program (QP) solver is not necessary for every particle at every epoch.

We design an adaptive gesture segmentation algorithm (AGS) based on the difference in information entropy between action and non-action parts to segment gestures. Different from KNN, SVM and other machine learning methods, we use GBDT ensemble learning algorithm to realize finger gesture recognition. The experimental results show that our system has an average recognition accuracy of 91 % for finger gestures.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3377170.3377254", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 2019 7th International Conference on Information Technology: IoT and Smart City", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3012021783", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["57764180", "15929994", "17878358", "15843276", "13991618", "13561174", "124011207", "125949605"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213184704"}

This paper proposes an automatic classification system for identifying cancer related causes of death from death certificates. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Detailed features, including terms, n-grams and SNOMED CT concepts were extracted from a collection of 447,336 death certificates. These features were used to train Support Vector Machine classifiers (one classifier for each cancer type). The classifiers were deployed in a cascaded architecture: the first level identified the presence of cancer (i.e., binary cancer/nocancer) and the second level identified the type of cancer (according to the ICD-10 classification system). A held-out test set was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the classifiers according to precision, recall and F-measure. In addition, detailed feature analysis was performed to reveal the characteristics of a successful cancer classification model. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The system was highly effective at identifying cancer as the underlying cause of death (F-measure 0.94). The system was also effective at determining the type of cancer for common cancers (F-measure 0.7). Rare cancers, for which there was little training data, were difficult to classify accurately (F-measure 0.12). Factors influencing performance were the amount of training data and certain ambiguous cancers (e.g., those in the stomach region). The feature analysis revealed a combination of features were important for cancer type classification, with SNOMED CT concept and oncology specific morphology features proving the most valuable. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The system proposed in this study provides automatic identification and characterisation of cancers from large collections of free-text death certificates. This allows organisations such as Cancer Registries to monitor and report on cancer mortality in a timely and accurate manner. In addition, the methods and findings are generally applicable beyond cancer classification and to other sources of medical text besides death certificates.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26323193", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.08.004", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "mag_id": "2104321900,2258217556", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209556699", "209854405", "69454694", "212411416", "3565485", "2246164", "4118814", "34056429", "5418779", "215446513", "13905024", "59232111", "5209622", "54445685", "204331112", "16573350", "214894619", "93000637", "1857974", "53110712", "23602045", "11045020", "201998215", "7245317", "17952430", "211056330", "51868887", "3892048", "211041229", "204755094", "28279414", "196195184", "201135168"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28495575"}

Existing visual tracking methods often employ a semi-supervised appearance modeling where a set of samples are continuously extracted around the vehicle to train a discriminant classifier between the vehicles and the background. While proving their advantage, many issues are still to be addressed. One is a tradeoff between high adaptability (prone to drift) and preserving original vehicle appearance (susceptible to tracking loss with significant appearance variations). Another issue is vehicle scale changes due to perspective camera effect which increases the potential for an inaccurate update and subsequently visual drifting. Still, scale adaptability has received little attention in vision-based discriminant trackers. In this paper we propose a three-step Scale Adaptive Object Tracking (SAOT) framework that adapts to scale and appearance changes. The framework is divided into three phases: (1) vehicle localization using a diverse ensemble, (2) scale estimation, and (3) data association where detected and tracked vehicles are correlated. The first step computes vehicle position by using an ensemble based on a compressed low-dimensional feature subsets projected from high-dimension feature space by random projections. This provides the diversity needed to accommodate for individual classifiers errors and different adaptability rates. The scale estimation step, applied after vehicle localization, is computed based on matched points between a pre-stored template and the localized vehicle. This doesn't only estimate the new scale of the vehicle but also serves as a correction step to prevent drifting by estimating the displacements between correspondences. The data association step is subsequently applied to link detected vehicle of current frame with the tracked vehicles. Data association must consider factors like the absence of detected target, false detections and ambiguity. Figure 1 illustrates the framework in operation. While the vehicle detection phase is executed per frame, the continuous tracking procedure ensures that all vehicles in the scene, no matter how complex it is, are correctly accounted for. The performance of the proposed Scale Adaptive Object Tracking (SAOT) algorithm is further evaluated with a different set of sequences with scale and appearance changes, blurring, moving camera and illumination. SAOT was compared to three established trackers in the literature: Compressive Tracking , Incremental Learning for Visual Tracking and Random Project with Diverse Ensemble Tracker using standard visual tracking evaluation datasets [4]. The initial target position for all sequences was initialized using manual ground truth. Centre Location Error (CLE) and Recall are calculated to evaluate the methods. Table 1 presents the CLE errors and recall in parentheses measured on a set of 2 sequences with different challenges. It clearly demonstrates that SAOT performs better than the other trackers.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5339/qfarc.2014.itpp0159", "venue": "Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference Proceedings Volume 2014 Issue 1", "journal": "Qatar Foundation Annual Research Conference Proceedings Volume 2014 Issue 1", "mag_id": "1784724605", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109178844"}

Interestingly, among the compounds that had not shown inhibition of EGFR, four blocked H1299 and H460 proliferation, one potently with IC(50) values near 1 \u00b5M. This compound was from the menogaril family, which reached Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of lymphomas. This suggests that our computational approach comparing binding profile may have favored molecules with anti-cancer properties like erlotinib.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2931832", "pubmed_id": "20824148", "doi": null, "venue": "ACS medicinal chemistry letters", "journal": "ACS medicinal chemistry letters", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["205649654", "2831427", "22936318"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10853624"}

Hans Phaf (r.h.phaf@uva.nl) Bram T. Heerebout (b.t.heerebout@uva.nl) Gijs H.

In Evolutionary Psychology, the outcomes of this development are primarily subjected to experimental research, but evolutionary computation appears to be the only means to empirically investigate the development process itself. Evolutionary simulations may show that some processing architectures are more likely to develop than others and may thus help to decide between alternative accounts. Continuing on the evolutionary simulations by den Dulk et al., (2003), we conduct research into the emergence of variants of LeDoux\u2019 (1996) dual-route network. Here, we present preliminary simulations investigating under which environmental conditions adding a learning faculty is adaptive.

Figure 1. A three-layer feed-forward network, with input from food and predators, controlled the movements of agents that accumulated fitness by surviving in a simulated environment by searching for food and avoiding predators. Without environmental changes the learning rate evolved towards zero, whereas fitness increased. With environmental changes ontogenetic learning contributed to fitness and learning rate remained relatively high. Future simulations are planned in which the (modular) structure of the network is also driven by evolution, and type of learning and level of environmental changes are varied. Evolutionary simulations were performed with a network in which connection weights could change either due to evolution, or to both evolution and (Hebbian) learning. The Hebbian learning parameter also formed a hereditary trait which the genetic algorithm optimized. We hypothesized that short-term weight changes would be adaptive when there were also short-term environmental changes. During the agents\u2019 \u2018lifetime\u2019 small random mutations in stimulus characteristics of food and predators were introduced. References den Dulk, P., Heerebout, B.T. & Phaf, R.H. (2003).

The goal of this work is to develop an effective data integration method to characterize deregulation between miRNA and mRNA due to environmental toxicant exposures. We will use data from an animal experiment designed to investigate the effect of low-dose environmental chemical exposure on normal mammary gland development in rats to motivate and evaluate the proposed method. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: We propose a new network approach-integrative Joint Random Forest (iJRF), which characterizes the regulatory system between miRNAs and mRNAs using a network model. iJRF is designed to work under the high-dimension low-sample-size regime, and can borrow information across different treatment conditions to achieve more accurate network inference. It also effectively takes into account prior information of miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships from existing databases. When iJRF is applied to the data from the environmental chemical exposure study, we detected a few important miRNAs that regulated a large number of mRNAs in the control group but not in the exposed groups, suggesting the disruption of miRNA activity due to chemical exposure.

We have investigated the influence of the composition of training datasets on the ability to classify peptides as cell penetrating using support vector machines (SVMs). We identified 111 known CPPs and 34 known non-penetrating peptides from the literature and commercial vendors and used several approaches to build training data sets for the classifiers. Features were calculated from the datasets using a set of basic biochemical properties combined with features from the literature determined to be relevant in the prediction of CPPs. Our results using different training datasets confirm the importance of a balanced training set with approximately equal number of positive and negative examples. The SVM based classifiers have greater classification accuracy than previously reported methods for the prediction of CPPs, and because they use primary biochemical properties of the peptides as features, these classifiers provide insight into the properties needed for cell-penetration.

Most of the existing protein subcellular localization methods are only used to deal with the single-location proteins. In the past few years, only a few methods have been proposed to tackle proteins with multiple locations. However, they only adopt a simple strategy, that is, transforming the multilocation proteins to multiple proteins with single location, which does not take correlations among different subcellular locations into account. In this paper, a novel method named random label selection (RALS) (multilabel learning via RALS), which extends the simple binary relevance (BR) method, is proposed to learn from multilocation proteins in an effective and efficient way. RALS does not explicitly find the correlations among labels, but rather implicitly attempts to learn the label correlations from data by augmenting original feature space with randomly selected labels as its additional input features. Through the fivefold cross-validation test on a benchmark data set, we demonstrate our proposed method with consideration of label correlations obviously outperforms the baseline BR method without consideration of label correlations, indicating correlations among different subcellular locations really exist and contribute to improvement of prediction performance. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets also show that our proposed methods achieve significantly higher performance than some other state-of-the-art methods in predicting subcellular multilocations of proteins.

Known for well capturing data locality, lazy learning can be advantageous for highly dynamic and complex learning environments such as data streams. Yet its high memory consumption and low prediction efficiency have made it less favorable for stream oriented applications. Specifically, traditional lazy learning stores all the training data and the inductive process is deferred until a query appears, whereas in stream applications, data records flow continuously in large volumes and the prediction of class labels needs to be made in a timely manner. In this paper, we provide a systematic solution that overcomes the memory and efficiency limitations and enables fast lazy learning for concept drifting data streams. In particular, we propose a novel Lazy-tree (Ltree for short) indexing structure that dynamically maintains compact high-level summaries of historical stream records. L-trees are M-Tree [5] like, height-balanced, and can help achieve great memory consumption reduction and sub-linear time complexity for prediction. Moreover, L-trees continuously absorb new stream records and discard outdated ones, so they can naturally adapt to the dynamically changing concepts in data streams for accurate prediction.

The proposed method first semantically labels the raw point clouds into the walls, ceiling, floor, and other objects. Then line structures are extracted from the labeled points to achieve an initial description of the building line framework. To optimize the detected line structures caused by furniture occlusion, a conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN) deep learning model is constructed. The line framework optimization model includes structure completion, extrusion removal, and regularization. The result of optimization is also derived from a quality evaluation of the point cloud.

Such representations are more versatile because music audio exhibits structure on multiple timescales, which are relevant for different MIR tasks to varying degrees. We develop and compare three approaches to multiscale audio feature learning using the spherical K-means algorithm. We evaluate them in an automatic tagging task and a similarity metric learning task on the Magnatagatune dataset.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ISMIR", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2242773987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8275457", "8018433", "12132619", "10546515", "308212", "2466561", "14214491", "8616518", "15891272", "9711044", "2309950", "7969298", "195908774", "10402290", "12219023", "15539264", "6022282", "369036"], "inbound_citations": ["433555", "59307339", "52832571", "13505043", "331697", "16152403", "17717707", "31628619", "160032233", "8608506", "27853460", "36259821", "89609204", "102353017", "9128633", "52008860", "189927963", "51608101", "67855407", "145055642", "56169674", "49215300", "208139423", "6159614", "582314", "11710859", "206741796", "209516760", "58669670", "7253694", "3835905", "174802052", "154440", "127312159", "53009770", "1982469", "13094557", "4691758", "913917", "5304221", "3286115", "132718639", "202722889", "1906290", "17120208", "24626675", "8407810"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5637201"}

The experiments conducted on test dataset and real data showed that the improved method is relatively more efficient to be implemented and holds a good robustness to predict unknown hand pose.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/icvrv.2016.25", "venue": "2016 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Visualization (ICVRV)", "journal": "2016 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Visualization (ICVRV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2620848623", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15326934", "18981266", "3513568", "206590483", "5258236", "61962167", "5736984", "7394442", "89141"], "inbound_citations": ["209495666"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1721613"}

Because more substance abuse treatment while incarcerated is associated with better post-release outcomes, including a reduced risk of accidental overdose death, the stakes are high in developing novel predictors of substance abuse treatment completion in inmate populations. ::: ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: ::: Using electroencephalography (EEG), this study investigated stimulus-locked ERP components elicited by distractor stimuli in three tasks (VO-Distinct, VO-Repeated, Go/NoGo) as a predictor of treatment discontinuation in a sample of male and female prison inmates. We predicted that those who discontinued treatment early would exhibit a less positive P3a amplitude elicited by distractor stimuli. ::: ::: ::: ::: Results ::: ::: Our predictions regarding ERP components were partially supported. Those who discontinued treatment early exhibited a less positive P3a amplitude and a less positive PC4 in the VO-D task. In the VO-R task, however, those who discontinued treatment early exhibited a more negative N200 amplitude rather than the hypothesized less positive P3a amplitude. The discontinuation group also displayed less positive PC4 amplitude. Surprisingly, there were no time-domain or principle component differences among the groups in the Go/NoGo task. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models of the three tasks accurately classified individuals who discontinued treatment with the best model accurately classifying 75% of inmates.

To design a robust hybrid modelling mechanism, the Interim-ERA European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data are employed to train and cross-validate the estimation model that is formulated by an evolutionary-type algorithm: the Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) integrated with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. The hybrid CRO-(ELM) algorithm is applied in two stages: first for the feature selection process guided by an ELM algorithm (a class of fast training neural network tool) as the model\u2019s fitness function to screen an optimal set of predictor variables and second, for the estimation of the solar radiation using the optimally screened variables by the final hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system. To benchmark the performance of the hybrid CRO-ELM algorithm for this estimation problem we apply an alternative, yet a similar feature screening approach: the Grouping Genetic Algorithm encoded into the ELM-based model (GGA-(ELM) used as the predictor mechanism). After the feature selection process is performed by the CRO algorithm that extracts the data patterns for accurate estimation the alternative objective algorithm is applied (in this case the ELM again) to formulate the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM modelling system. To provide a rigorous evaluation of the CRO-(ELM)-ELM hybrid system, alternative estimation approaches are considered: the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). The hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system is tested in a real problem where the results are evaluated by means of several statistical score metrics and diagnostic plots of the observed and the estimated daily global solar radiation in the testing phase. We show that the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM model is able to yield promising results; thus improving those attained by the 7 alternative models (i.e., hybrid CRO-(ELM)-MARS, CRO-(ELM)-MLR and CRO-(ELM)-SVR and the GGA equivalent models).

With the data collected from four pressure sensors that installed at four corners of an intelligent nursing bed, first, some pivotal preprocessing such as median filtering and down sampling are adopted to make a good performance. Then sparse auto encoder (SAE) is adopted for feature extraction. Finally, the RVFLNN is used for classification. Besides, for both new samples and new categories, the proposed method offers an incremental learning ability that can easily update the model with no need of model retaining. Compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed method has superiority in training time while the accuracy is guaranteed.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICARCV.2018.8581232", "venue": "2018 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)", "journal": "2018 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2908374068", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16421896", "27603577", "17383264", "2543370", "103988527", "3736261", "206401842", "14542261", "207763512", "19182432", "15232182", "10985974", "11001398", "17774486", "26109462", "121589596"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56596812"}

In the field of ship detection, different types of images are used depending on the application. Regarding high-resolution images, the variable characteristics of the sea environment often complicate a precise detection. These characteristics make the extraction of general properties from individual pixels difficult. To overcome this issue, a block division that divides the image into small blocks of pixels which represent small ship or non-ship regions is proposed. In contrast with a pixel approach, this block division characterizes better the properties of the regions and is more computationally efficient. For the classification of blocks, a supervised learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained using color and texture features extracted from the blocks. On one hand, color features describe the chromatic characteristics of these regions. On the other hand, texture features provide information about the spatial distribution of pixels. Once the classification is performed, ship detection is improved using a reconstruction algorithm, which corrects most wrong classified blocks and extracts the detected ships. The combination of color and texture features achieves the highest precision, up to 96.98%, in the classification between ship blocks and non-ship blocks, and up to 98.14% in the final ship detection.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCP.2015.7312682", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1955830868", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11423965", "25028868", "9429103", "7402547", "206942399", "2813120", "399530", "15233851", "14196440", "207165665", "2443126", "7372958", "2513013", "60637293", "206786900", "44708800", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["2196013", "6339251", "214789684", "214626954", "54439336", "211630928"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8385421"}

In this paper, we propose a family of IR loss functions to measure the performance of nondeterministic learners. After discussing such measures, we derive an algorithm for learning optimal nondeterministic hypotheses. Given an entry from the input space, the algorithm requires the posterior probabilities to compute the subset of classes with the lowest expected loss. From a general point of view, nondeterministic classifiers provide an improvement in the proportion of predictions that include the true class compared to their deterministic counterparts; the price to be paid for this increase is usually a tiny proportion of predictions with more than one class. The paper includes an extensive experimental study using three deterministic learners to estimate posterior probabilities: a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Logistic Regression, and a Naive Bayes.

Feature selection techniques show that more information is not always good in machine learning applications. Apply different algorithms for the data at hand and with baseline classification performance values we can select a final feature selection algorithm. In this paper, we propose a hybrid classification model, which has correlation based filter feature selection algorithm and Machine learning as classifiers. The objective of this study is to select relevant features and analyze the outperform machine learning algorithms in order to train our model, predict and compare their classification performance. In this method, features are ordered according to their Absolute correlation value with respect to the class attribute. Then top K Features are selected from ordered list of features to form a reduced dataset. This proposed classifier model is applied to our smart meter datasets. To measure the performance of these selected features; seven benchmark classifier are used; Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). This paper then analyzes the performance of all classifiers with feature selection in term of accuracy, sensitivity, F-Measure, Specificity, Precision, and MCC.

We sought to identify donor predictors of allograft non-utilization and to determine whether these predictors are associated with adverse recipient outcomes. We then developed statistical models incorporating donor and recipient-specific variables to predict survival post-transplant. Methods and Materials We studied a cohort of 1872 potential organ donors managed by the California Transplant Donor Network from 2001-8. 43% of available grafts were accepted for heart transplant. We used a Random Forest (RF) model, an extension of decision tree analysis, to predict allograft utilization. We then created RF models to predict recipient survival using donor characteristics alone, and donor plus recipient characteristics at the time of transplant. Results The RF model developed to predict cardiac allograft utilization performed well, with a C-statistic of 0.85. The most important predictors were donor age, cause of death, left ventricular ejection fraction, and history of hypertension. However, among hearts that were transplanted, only donor diabetes was associated with increased recipient mortality. Models developed to predict recipient survival were less accurate, with C-statistics of 0.58 and 0.52 for 30-day and 1-year survival, respectively, using donor characteristics alone, and C-statistics of 0.62 and 0.61 for 30-day and 1-year survival using both donor and recipient characteristics at transplant. Conclusions While there are many donor predictors of allograft discard in the current era, these factors appear to have little relationship with recipient outcomes when the hearts are transplanted. It is difficult to predict recipient post-transplant survival, even knowing donor and recipient characteristics at the time of transplant.

Attention has been mainly focused on readmissions following inpatient hospitalizations. In the outpatient setting, readmissions have been far less studied. Premature outpatient discharges can have negative impacts at multiple levels, as they may prolong disability, and increase the chance of disease chronification, the demands to the immediate patient\u2019s support system, and healthcare resources utilization. As the first step in preventing outpatient readmission, the assessment of the individual patient\u2019s risk could be useful to help identify those subjects at greatest risk, so, in a further step we could focus the delivery of an intervention in those patients to reduce their risk. Objectives: To develop and validate a machine learning predictive model based on Random Forest, to estimate the risk of readmission in an outpatient rheumatology clinic after discharge (outpatient readmission). Methods: Patients stored in a departmental electronic health record from April 1st, 2007 to November 30th, 2016, and followed-up until November 30th, 2017, were included in this study. Only readmissions taking place between 3 and 12 months after discharge were analyzed. Discharge episodes were split into training, validation and test datasets. Clinical and demographic variables, including diagnoses, treatments, quality of life, and comorbidities, were used as predictors. Models were developed using Random Forest in the training dataset, though the combination of several tuning parameters. Models that maximized the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) in the validation set were assessed in the test set. The model with the highest AUC-ROC in the test dataset was considered as the best final model. Results: 17,473 patients (18,117 discharges episodes) were analyzed and 1,960 (10.8%) discharges episodes were classified as outpatient readmissions. 48,654 models were finally developed. The best final model showed an AUC-ROC of 0.674 a sensitivity of 0.330 and a specificity of 0.867. The most relevant variables in the model were the number of diagnoses given at discharge, follow-up duration, age, number of previous discharges, previous corticosteroids use and disability. Conclusion: We have developed a predictive model for outpatient readmission in a rheumatology setting. Clinical, demographical characteristics as well as medication and disability were the most important predictors.

{"paper_id": "16955736", "title": "Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with less Supervision", "authors": [{"first": "Omid", "middle": [], "last": "Ghiasvand", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Rohit", "middle": ["J."], "last": "Kate", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Annotating clinical notes manually is very labor-intensive and needs expertise in the area of annotation. Thus annotation is a highly expensive task not only in human resource but also in financial aspects. Moreover mistakes, missed tags, and inconsistency are the common problems with manual annotations. The purpose of this research is to reduce humans as annotation effort for clinical notes, to improve consistency, and to decrease cost of annotation. The aim of this research is to annotate clinical texts to extract biomedical names and terms. In our research Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is the reference meta thesaurus of names and terms used in biomedical and clinical domains. In this research we have done unsupervised and semi-supervised Named Entity Recognition (NER) through exact matching in UMLS. The data sets that have been used were provided by SemEval 2015 (task 14) natural language processing competition, including 199 clinical notes in training set and 133 notes in test set. The analysis that has been done so far can be divided into two steps: mapping and learning. The first step is to map all terms into UMLS that includes not only unigrams but also n-grams, usually n is 5. To achieve the best results of exact matching, we extracted UMLS terms of diseases and disorders based on semantic groups and mapped each n-gram to that part of UMLS. If there is a match, that is assumed to be a disease or disorder. When there is no match for n-grams (n>=2), to avoid low precisions, we supposed that unigrams must be noun phrases to be nominated as a disease/disorder. With this method we got 60% of f-score, and training files for next process (training CRFs) were generated. The second step involves using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The results generated in the first step were used to train the CRF. CRFs learn from training data the general contexts in which named entities occur. Also because of different levels of correctness in training files, we decided to modify training files before using them to train CRFs and to test on test data. Level of correctness means different accuracies of tagging in the data set. Because exact matching is not very accurate, the accuracy in different notes is variable. In some data it is very high and in some of them it is low. This results in an inconsistency in training files. To solve this problem we divided training files into ten groups. The CRF used only one group to be trained and to tag other groups, and results of exact matches and CRFs were combined (logic OR between results of CRF and exact match) together to get the final results. This was done for all other groups as well, and finally applied on test data. These two steps together are known as unsupervised disease named entity recognition, and the results show a difference of 10.3 percent between unsupervised and supervised approaches. By supervised learning we got 73% F-score while we got 62.7% by the proposed unsupervised approach. Another approach that was developed is semi supervised disease named entity recognition that used annotated files generated by unsupervised method and annotated files by human or gold standards. By this method we could improve 73% of F-score, that we got in supervised approach, to 74.2%. In the future some other refinements and extra tasks are going to be done. To improve the results, we are planning to use approximate matching by the process that is called normalization. Normalization means mapping a term in clinical notes to a preferred term in UMLS. These kinds of terms do not have exact matches, thus the way to find exact matches is to use normalization. Moreover we are going to do exact/approximate matching over discontinuous mentions in clinical texts. In these texts there are mentions including disconnected words in a sentence that together form a named entity. This essential step will extract those mentions that could not be extracted by exact match and normalization approaches. The last thing in our plan is to expand our developed system to a less supervised \"Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BNER)\" to extract all biomedical and clinical terms. We will do this for other semantic groups in UMLS such as Activities and Behaviors, Anatomy, Devices, Phenomena, etc. Thus developing a less supervised annotating system for clinical notes could generate annotated notes with less cost of manual tagging, more consistent, and accurate enough. By using this approach it is feasible to extract tags of other semantic groups in UMLS, and finally it could be an advanced system to tag all the biomedical and clinical mentions based on semantic groups in UMLS.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICHI.2015.85", "venue": "2015 International Conference on Healthcare Informatics", "journal": "2015 International Conference on Healthcare Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2295141588", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207845897", "203605717"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16955736"}

An exhaustive empirical study is then performed to validate the proposed approach for different privacy problems in three actual data sets.

One of the application is agriculture. In agriculture plant disease detection and diagnosis using digital image processing techniques focused on accurate segmentation of healthy and diseased tissue. In various segmentation methods, Semi-automatic segmentation was most widely utilized which was based on gray scale histogram. In a novel semi-automatic segmentation process, pixels along the edges were removed and then color conversion was done. After color conversion, contrast enhancement of an image and pixel value adjustments were performed to improve the image quality. Histogram with 100 bins was constructed for identifying the diseased tissue from the healthier part of a leaf image. Finally, segmentation of diseased leaf was found based on the histogram bins. Such bins were searched manually which is not easy for all cases. Moreover, detection accuracy was degraded by the influence of reflection light and distortion regions in an acquired image. Hence Quality Assessment Method Scheme (QAMS) algorithm used to remove both reflection light and distortion from image. For automatic separation of diseased part from the healthier regions in a leaf image an optimization algorithm is required. The method employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithm to automatically define the histogram bins and separate diseased part from the healthier regions in a leaf image. After segmenting the diseased leaf image, the classification is done by Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect the leaf diseases.

However, the rapid expansion has brought a series of ecological and environmental problems in many regions, such as the vast amount of residues from the plastic-mulched farmland bring about aesthetic pollution and adverse environmental impacts on water, air and soil of the agricultural ecosystem and the terrestrial ecosystem. It is a serious problem that will do great damage to the sustainability of agriculture. In order to alleviate problems and to find solutions, the development of efficient methods to map plastic-mulched farmland as accurately as possible is of great significance to the policy-makers and scientists. In this paper, the optical remotely sensed data, Landsat-8 OLI, have been used in monitoring the plastic-mulched farmland in a study area located in Jizhou city, Hebei Province, China, where the plastic mulching is extensively practiced in farming and interlaced with uncovered farmland. The spectral and texture features of different ground objects have been statistically analyzed on the OLI imagery in the light of the training samples. Then the spectral and texture features that carry a certain degree of explanation for plastic-mulched farmland were selected for classification. The training and testing samples (bigger than 4 pixels \u00d7 4 pixels of panchromatic fused OLI imagery) were collected from Google Earth images, and were amended by comparing to false color composite Landsat bands 7 (SWIR), 5 (NIR) and 4 (RED). At the same time, the samples were purified according the J-M distance method. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been used as classifier to extract the plastic-mulched farmland based on the spectral features alone, on the texture features alone and on the combined spectral and texture features respectively. The classification result was validated using confusion matrix. The overall classification accuracy for plastic-mulched farmland based on spectra features alone, on texture features alone and on combined spectral and texture features are 89.45%, 94.68% and 94.73%, respectively. Their respective Kappa coefficients are 0.85, 0.92 and 0.92.

Approaches for time series forecasting should be able to detect and react to concept drift in a timely manner, so that the forecasting model can be updated as soon as possible. Despite the fact that the concept drift problem is well investigated in the literature, little effort has been made to solve this problem for time series forecasting so far. This work proposes two novel methods for dealing with the time series forecasting problem in the presence of concept drift. The proposed methods benefit from the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to detect and react to concept drifts in the time series data stream.

This hypothesis is supported by observed long-term benefits associated with breastfeeding, such as better cognitive development in childhood, and lower risks of obesity and high blood pressure in later life. However, the possible underlying mechanisms are expected to be complex and may be difficult to disentangle due to the lack of understanding of the metabolic processes that differentiate breastfed infants compared to those receiving just formula feed. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: Our aim was to investigate the relationships between infant feeding and the lipid profiles and to validate specific lipids in separate datasets so that a small set of lipids can be used as nutritional biomarkers. ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: We utilized a direct infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry method to analyse the lipid profiles of 3.2 mm dried blood spot samples collected at age 3 months from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-1), which formed the discovery cohort. For validation two sample sets were profiled: Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-2) and Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (POPS). Lipidomic profiles were compared between infant groups who were either exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula-fed or mixed-fed at various levels. Data analysis included supervised Random Forest method with combined classification and regression mode. Selection of lipids was based on an iterative backward elimination procedure without compromising the class error in the classification mode. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: From this study, we were able to identify and validate three lipids: PC(35:2), SM(36:2) and SM(39:1) that can be used collectively as biomarkers for infant nutrition during early development. These biomarkers can be used to determine whether young infants (3-6 months) are breast-fed or receive formula milk.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5272886", "pubmed_id": "28190990", "doi": "10.1007/s11306-017-1166-2", "venue": "Metabolomics", "journal": "Metabolomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2581669322", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["205209433", "15888212", "44221249", "89141", "27430305", "15245447", "215674864", "31085668", "22456199", "206490903", "13501404", "14264617", "3093707", "80294559", "5288260", "33579400", "21516577", "5639343", "37659980", "41236179", "9713056", "36023704", "7652615"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10058873"}

However, PEMFCs are vulnerable to the impurities of hydrogen or fluctuation of operational condition etc., which can lead to the degradation of output performance over time when operating. The prediction of the performance degradation is quite important for the PEMFC system management. In this work, a novel prediction method based on a modified Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is proposed, followed by a comparison with classic Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach.

Usually, lightcurves are represented as a vector of many statistical descriptors designed by astronomers called features. These descriptors commonly demand significant computational power to calculate, require substantial research effort to develop and do not guarantee good performance on the final classification task. Today, lightcurve representation is not entirely automatic; algorithms that extract lightcurve features are designed by humans and must be manually tuned up for every survey. The vast amounts of data that will be generated in future surveys like LSST mean astronomers must develop analysis pipelines that are both scalable and automated. Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the machine learning community to develop methods that prescind from expert-designed and manually tuned features for features that are automatically learned from data. In this work we present what is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised feature learning algorithm designed for variable stars. Our method first extracts a large number of lightcurve subsequences from a given set of photometric data, which are then clustered to find common local patterns in the time series. Representatives of these patterns, called exemplars, are then used to transform lightcurves of a labeled set into a new representation that can then be used to train an automatic classifier. The proposed algorithm learns the features from both labeled and unlabeled lightcurves, overcoming the bias generated when the learning process is done only with labeled data.

In this work we leverage the expressive power of deep neural networks to create a data-driven model of intra- and inter-brain area variability. To this end, we train a convolutional neural network that learns relevant microstructural features directly from brain imagery.

In both research and application of knowledge graph, knowledge representation learning is one of the fundamental tasks. Existing representation learning approaches are mainly based on structural knowledge between entities and relations, while knowledge among entities per se is largely ignored. Though a few approaches integrated entity knowledge while learning representations, these methods lack the flexibility to apply to multimodalities. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a new representation learning method, TransAE, by combining multimodal autoencoder with TransE model, where TransE is a simple and effective representation learning method for knowledge graphs. In TransAE, the hidden layer of autoencoder is used as the representation of entities in the TransE model, thus it encodes not only the structural knowledge, but also the multimodal knowledge, such as visual and textural knowledge, into the final representation. Compared with traditional methods based on only structural knowledge, TransAE can significantly improve the performance in the sense of link prediction and triplet classification. Also, TransAE has the ability to learn representations for entities out of knowledge base in zero-shot.

Correlation filter based classifiers have shown good performance in biometric verification applications. In this paper, we develop a method of fusing soft information from multiple correlation filters. Usually, correlation filters are designed to produce a strong peak in the correlation filter output for authentics whereas no such peak should be produced for impostors. Traditionally, the peak-to-sidelobe-ratio (PSR) has been used to characterize the strength of the peak and thresholds are set on the PSR in order to determine whether the test image is an authentic or an impostor. In this paper, we propose to fuse multiple correlation output planes, by appending them for classification by a Support Vector Machine (SVM), to improve the performance over traditional PSR based classification. Multiple Unconstrained Optimal Tradeoff Synthetic Discriminant Function (UOTSDF) filters having varying degrees of discrimination and distortion tolerance are employed here to create a feature vector for classification by a SVM, and this idea is evaluated on the plastic distortion set of the NIST 24 fingerprint database. Results on this database provide an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.36% when we fuse correlation planes, in comparison to an average EER of 3.24% using the traditional PSR based classification from a filter, and 2.4% EER on fusion of PSR scores from the same filters using SVM, which demonstrates the advantages of fusing the correlation output planes over the fusion of just the peak-to-sidelobe-ratios (PSRs).", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.603540", "venue": "SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1993731520", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["31657207", "32816817", "42555081", "28504600", "31933001", "123154252", "32863215", "623555", "207165665", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["30102631"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108453902"}

Wearable devices show more advantages than polysomnography for home use. In this paper, we propose a novel method for sleep staging using heart rate and wrist actigraphy derived from a wearable device. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The proposed method consists of two phases: multi-level feature learning and recurrent neural networks-based (RNNs) classification. The feature learning phase is designed to extract low- and mid-level features. Low-level features are extracted from raw signals, capturing temporal and frequency domain properties. Mid-level features are explored based on low-level ones to learn compositions and structural information of signals. Sleep staging is a sequential problem with long-term dependencies. RNNs with bidirectional long short-term memory architectures are employed to learn temporally sequential patterns. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: To better simulate the use of wearable devices in the daily scene, experiments were conducted with a resting group in which sleep was recorded in the resting state, and a comprehensive group in which both resting sleep and non-resting sleep were included. The proposed algorithm classified five sleep stages (wake, non-rapid eye movement 1-3, and rapid eye movement) and achieved weighted precision, recall, and F1 score of 66.6%, 67.7%, and 64.0% in the resting group and 64.5%, 65.0%, and 60.5% in the comprehensive group using leave-one-out cross-validation.

The architecture of the model comprises a set of statistical learning synapses and a set of rule-learning synapses, whose weights, crucially, emerge from the statistical network. The network is implemented with a neurobiologically plausible Hebbian learning mechanism. The statistical weights form category representations on the basis of perceptual similarity, whereas the rule weights gradually extract rules from the information contained in the statistical weights. These rules are weightings of individual features; weights are stronger for features that convey more information about category membership. The most significant contribution of this model is that it relies on a novel mechanism involving feeding noise through the system to generate these rules.

Conversely, in a dry year, the utilities must depend more on steam generation and therefore use more oil, coal, and atomic fuel. Agricultural interests use the information to determine crop planting patterns, ground water pumping needs, and irrigation schedules. Operators of flood control projects determine how much water can safely be stored in a reservoir while reserving space for predicted inflows. Municipalities use the information to evaluate their water supply and determine whether (in a dry year) water rationing may be needed. Currently a combination of linear regression equations and human judgment is used for producing these forecasts.

To effectively silence a target gene, it is desirable to select appropriate initiator siRNA molecules having satisfactory silencing capabilities. Computational prediction for silencing efficacy of siRNAs can assist this screening process before using them in biological experiments. String kernel functions, which operate directly on the string objects representing siRNAs and target mRNAs, have been applied to support vector regression for the prediction and improved accuracy over numerical kernels in multidimensional vector spaces constructed from descriptors of siRNA design rules. To fully utilize information provided by string and numerical data, we propose to unify the two in a kernel feature space by devising a multiple kernel regression framework where a linear combination of the kernels is used. We formulate the multiple kernel learning into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which although yields global optimal solution, is computationally demanding and requires a commercial solver package. We further propose three heuristics based on the principle of kernel-target alignment and predictive accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that multiple kernel regression can improve accuracy, decrease model complexity by reducing the number of support vectors, and speed up computational performance dramatically. In addition, multiple kernel regression evaluates the importance of constituent kernels, which for the siRNA efficacy prediction problem, compares the relative significance of the design rules.

In this case, we analyzed data from the Web of Science. The accuracy of various forms of automatic classification was tested here in comparison with manual coding in order to determine their usefulness for data collection and cleaning. We assessed the performance of seven supervised classification algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Scaled Linear Discriminant Analysis, Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear models, Maximum Entropy, Regression Tree, Boosting, and Random Forest) and analyzed two properties: accuracy and recall. We assessed not only each algorithm individually, but also their combinations through a voting scheme. We also tested the performance of these algorithms with different sizes of training data. When assessing the performance of different combinations, we used an indicator of coverage to account for the agreement and disagreement on classification between algorithms. ::: Findings: We found that the performance of the algorithms used vary with the size of the sample for training. However, for the classification exercise in this paper the best performing algorithms were SVM and Boosting. The combination of these two algorithms achieved a high agreement on coverage and was highly accurate. This combination performs well with a small training dataset (10%), which may reduce the manual work needed for classification tasks. ::: Research limitations: The dataset gathered has significantly more records related to the topic of interest compared to unrelated topics. This may affect the performance of some algorithms, especially in their identification of unrelated papers. ::: Practical implications: Although the classification achieved by this means is not completely accurate, the amount of manual coding needed can be greatly reduced by using classification algorithms. This can be of great help when the dataset is big. With the help of accuracy, recall, and coverage measures, it is possible to have an estimation of the error involved in this classification, which could open the possibility of incorporating the use of these algorithms in software specifically designed for data cleaning and classification. ::: Originality/value: We analyzed the performance of seven algorithms and whether combinations of these algorithms improve accuracy in data collection.

In this paper, the discrete and conditional posterior probability distributions of well lithofacies were modeled and predicted through the Kernel Support Vector Machines (KSVM) as a function of well log interpretations in a well in the Upper Sandstone Member of Zubair formation in South Rumaila Oil Field, located in Iraq. The log data include neutron porosity, water saturation, and shale volume. The multinomial response factor is the measured vertical Lithofacies sequence that has mainly sand, shale, and shaly sand. KSVM is a supervised statistical learning algorithm that recognizes the discrete classes for the given data based on maximizing the margin around the separating hyperplane and the decision function is fully specified by a subset of the Support vectors. The predicted lithofacies were validated by computing the total correct percent of predicted facies counts matrix, estimated by KSVM. The nonlinear separations of components handled by KSVM led to obtaining high level of accuracy of lithofacies prediction and attained 99.55% of the total correct percent. After depicting the vertical sand, shale, and shaly sand posterior distribution, it was shown that KSVM prediction has compatible between the sand posterior values with the high records of neutron porosity and low intervals of shale volume. Consequently, the KSVM can be considered for Lithofacies prediction in the other wells in the reservoir to provide a solid basis for the geospatial modeling.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s40808-017-0277-0", "venue": "Modeling Earth Systems and Environment", "journal": "Modeling Earth Systems and Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["129434196", "133008174", "125662484", "55392431", "194951", "128758453", "131190092", "128465029"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189938409"}

Therefore the main issue is to enhance the classification phase to construct better decision-making procedure comparing to conventional classification phase by assigning enhanced logic.

Motivated by the above concerns, we carry out empirical studies on four real-world graph classification tasks, by using three types of sub-graph features, including frequent sub-graphs, frequent sub-graph selected by using information gain, and random sub-graphs, and by using two types of learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines and Nearest Neighbour. Our experiments show that (1) the discriminative power of sub-graphs varies by their sizes; (2) random sub-graphs have a reasonably good performance; (3) number of sub-graphs is important to ensure good performance; and (4) increasing number of sub-graphs reduces the difference between classifiers built from different sub-graphs.

Face membership authentication is basically a two class (enrolled or unenrolled) classification where SVM (Support Vector Machine) has been successfully applied and shows better performance compared to the conventional threshold rule-based authentication methods. Most of previous SVMs for face membership authentication have been trained using image feature vectors extracted from face images in the training set. However, image features extracted from images are not robust to variations of illuminations, poses, and facial expressions. Moreover, enrolled/unenrolled class can be dynamically changing due to memberspsila secession or joining. And, unenrolled class is prohibitively huge. In this paper, we propose an effective class discriminating feature-based SVM for face membership authentication. The adopted features for training and testing the SVM is not extracted from face images but reflect discrimination between enrolled class and unenrolled class. Thus, the proposed SVM is relatively independent from variations in face images and less affected by changes in membership configuration. Through experiments, it is shown that the face membership authentication method based on the proposed SVM performs better than the threshold rule-based or the conventional SVM-based authentication methods and is relatively less affected by change in membership configuration.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MFI.2008.4648065", "venue": "2008 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems", "journal": "2008 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2131672822", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11397126", "12331515", "6519687", "194951", "206787478", "14555654", "30923043", "17529034", "8885668", "961425", "207165665", "894525", "10223132", "12409935"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9021198"}

Since bioscience has entered into the era of genome and proteome, there is a growing demand for the knowledge about PPI network. High-throughput biological technologies can be used to identify new PPIs, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and tedious. Therefore, computational methods for predicting PPIs have an important role. For the past years, an increasing number of computational methods such as protein structure-based approaches have been proposed for predicting PPIs. The major limitation in principle of these methods lies in the prior information of the protein to infer PPIs. Therefore, it is of much significance to develop computational methods which only use the information of protein amino acids sequence. Here, we report a highly efficient approach for predicting PPIs. The main improvements come from the use of a novel protein sequence representation by combining continuous wavelet descriptor and Chou\u2019s pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), and from adopting weighted sparse representation based classifier (WSRC). This method, cross-validated on the PPIs datasets of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Human and H. pylori, achieves an excellent results with accuracies as high as 92.50%, 95.54% and 84.28% respectively, significantly better than previously proposed methods. Extensive experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The outstanding results yield by our model that the proposed feature extraction method combing two kinds of descriptors have strong expression ability and are expected to provide comprehensive and effective information for machine learning-based classification models. In addition, the prediction performance in the comparison experiments shows the well cooperation between the combined feature and WSRC.

On the basis of 2632 pairs of LFPs and spike recordings acquired from five pigeons, 12 multimodal features are used to quantify each channel's temporal, frequency, phase and firing-rate properties.

The results of the two-dimensional scatterplots and classifications demonstrate that correlation coefficient, phase locking value, and coherence have good discriminability.

Specifically, by exploiting such a prior, a semi-supervised scheme is adopted to propagate bounding box annotations to adjacent CT slices to obtain more training data with fewer false positives and more true positives. Furthermore, considering that the NIH DeepLesion dataset has many missing labels, we develop a missing ground truth mining process by considering the continuity (or appearance-consistency) of multi-slice axial CT images.

The RDN is a deconvolutional version of conventional recurrent neural network, which can well model the long-range temporal dependency of generated video frames and make good use of conditional information. The proposed model can be jointly trained by pushing the RDN to generate realistic videos so that the 3D-CNN cannot distinguish them from real ones.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel hand shape descriptor based on a set of geometric features (SoGF) and Fisher Vector (FV), for effective and efficient HPR. Three types of geometric features, including distances, angles and curvatures, are extracted from a hand silhouette to form a discriminative local descriptor, and FV is adopted to encode the set of local descriptors for compact hand shape representation.

In the methodology presented, probable predictor variables are extracted from (1) the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data set for the period 1971\u20132000 and (2) the simulations from the third generation Canadian general circulation model (CGCM3) for SRES emission scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and COMMIT for the period 1971\u20132100. These variables include both the thermodynamic and dynamic parameters and those which have a physically meaningful relationship with the precipitation. The NCEP variables which are realistically simulated by CGCM3 are chosen as potential predictors for seasonal stratification. The seasonal stratification involves identification of (1) the past wet and dry seasons through classification of the NCEP data on potential predictors into two clusters by the use of K-means clustering algorithm and (2) the future wet and dry seasons through classification of the CGCM3 data on potential predictors into two clusters by the use of nearest neighbour rule. Subsequently, a separate downscaling model is developed for each season to capture the relationship between the predictor variables and the predictand. For downscaling precipitation, the predictand is chosen as monthly Thiessen weighted precipitation for the river basin, whereas potential predictors are chosen as the NCEP variables which are correlated to the precipitation and are also realistically simulated by CGCM3. Implementation of the methodology presented is demonstrated by application to Malaprabha reservoir catchment in India which is considered to be a climatically sensitive region. The CGCM3 simulations are run through the calibrated and validated SVM downscaling model to obtain future projections of predictand for each of the four emission scenarios considered.

The Murcia region is one of the most arid regions in southern Europe and also one of the most prone to land abandonment. This study researches which environmental features are more relevant to explain abandonment at the agricultural plot scale. Geomorphometric features were measured at different scales to investigate which scales could be more relevant. Two different models have been used: logistic regression, a statistical model that allows the interpretation of the involved features, and Random Forest, a machine learning model with a higher predictive power but lower interpretability. The combined use of both such models allows a set of predictors to be selected, which, when used with Random Forest, produce a map that is highly accurate for predicting abandonment and, when used with logistic regression, produce an interpretable model. The main conclusion is that climate is the most relevant factor to explain land abandonment.

The state-of-the-art Android malware clustering approaches rely heavily on the raw labels from commercial AntiVirus (AV) vendors, which causes misclustering for a substantial number of weakly-labeled malware due to the inconsistent, incomplete and overly generic labels reported by these closed-source AV engines, whose capabilities vary greatly and whose internal mechanisms are opaque (i.e., intermediate detection results are unavailable for clustering). The raw labels are thus often used as the only important source of information for clustering. To address the limitations of the existing approaches, this paper presents ANDRE, a new ANDroid Hybrid REpresentation Learning approach to clustering weakly-labeled Android malware by preserving heterogeneous information from multiple sources (including the results of static code analysis, the metainformation of an app, and the raw-labels of the AV vendors) to jointly learn a hybrid representation for accurate clustering. The learned representation is then fed into our outlieraware clustering to partition the weakly-labeled malware into known and unknown families. The malware whose malicious behaviours are close to those of the existing families on the network, are further classified using a three-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN). The unknown malware are clustered using a standard density-based clustering algorithm. We have evaluated our approach using 5,416 ground-truth malware from Drebin and 9,000 malware from VIRUSSHARE (uploaded between Mar. 2017 and Feb. 2018), consisting of 3324 weakly-labeled malware. The evaluation shows that ANDRE effectively clusters weaklylabeled malware which cannot be clustered by the state-of-theart approaches, while achieving comparable accuracy with those approaches for clustering ground-truth samples.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/tifs.2019.2947861", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2980750320", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7715150", "11084808", "393948", "2452205", "4755450", "50776071", "2407601", "57375753", "13069148", "2409634", "49303347", "3051291", "1326925", "3828085", "743679", "53752448", "26473187", "4534735", "3948344", "382653", "14445343", "16447573", "207172599", "14242198", "15436965", "7380410", "2690523", "196104600", "3355553", "52292002", "8430322", "17968887", "54092966", "16189570", "13852790", "207238980", "8399404"], "inbound_citations": ["210970599"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207984531"}

There was no automated measurement method to evaluate the quality of the inspection. To address this, we have been investigating automated post-procedure quality measurement. The limitation of post-processing quality measurement is that quality measurements become available only long after the procedure was over and the patient was released. A better approach is to inform any suboptimal inspection immediately so that the endoscopist can improve the quality of the inspection in real-time during the procedure. Both post-processing and real-time quality measurements require a number of analysis tasks such as detecting a bite-block region as an indicator that a procedure is an upper endoscopy, not colonoscopy, detecting a blood region as an indicator for inflammation or bleeding, and detecting a stool region as an indicator of quality of the colon preparation. Color is the most distinguishable characteristic for differentiation among these object classes and normal pixels. In this paper, we propose a method to detect these object classes using color features. The main idea is to partition very large positive examples of these objects into a number of groups. Each group is called a \u201cpositive plane\u201d and is modeled using a convex hull enclosing feature points of that particular group.

ML techniques permit efficient exploration of data, have not been widely used in aggression research, and may have utility for those seeking prediction of aggressive behavior. Objectives: The present study examined predictors of aggression and constructed an optimized model using ML techniques. Predictors were derived from a dataset that included demographic, psychometric, and genetic predictors, specifically FKBP5 polymorphisms, which have been shown to alter response to threatening stimuli, but have not been tested as predictors of aggressive behavior in adults. Methods: The data analysis approach utilized component-wise gradient boosting and model reduction via backward elimination to (a) select variables from an initial set of twenty to build a model of trait aggression, and then (b) reduce that model to maximize parsimony and generalizability. Results: From a dataset of N = 47 participants, component-wise gradient boosting selected eight of twenty possible predictors to model Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) total score, with R2 = 0.65. This model was simplified using backward elimination, retaining six predictors: smoking status, psychopathy (interpersonal manipulation and callous affect), childhood trauma (physical abuse and neglect), and the FKBP5_13 gene (rs1360780). The six-factor model approximated the initial eight-factor model at 99.4% of R2. Conclusions. Using an inductive data science approach, the gradient boosting model identified predictors consistent with previous experimental work in aggression; specifically psychopathy and trauma exposure. Additionally, allelic variants in FKBP5 were identified for the first time, but the relatively small sample size limits generality of results and calls for replication.

Identification of digital traits that characterizes drought stress response (DSR) is challenging due to high volume of image based features. Also, the labelled data that categorizes DSR are either unavailable or subjectively developed, which is a low-throughput and error-prone task. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that provides an automated scoring of DSR based on multi-trait fusion. k-means clustering was used to extract latent drought clusters and the relevant traits were identified using Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Extraction (SVM-RFE). Using these traits, SVM based DSR classification model was constructed. The framework has been validated on visible and thermal shoot images of rice plants, yielding 95% accuracy. Various imaging modalities can be integrated with the proposed framework, thus making it scalable as no prior information about the DSR was assumed.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-0020-2_24", "venue": "NCVPRIPG", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2800763195", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19105142"}

These data sets are commonly encountered in real-life problems. However, performance of well-known classifiers is limited in such cases. Various solution approaches have been proposed for the class imbalance problem using either data-level or algorithm-level modifications. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that have a solid theoretical background also encounter a dramatic decrease in performance when the data distribution is imbalanced. In this study, we propose an L 1-norm SVM approach that is based on a three objective optimization problem so as to incorporate into the formulation the error sums for the two classes independently. Motivated by the inherent multi objective nature of the SVMs, the solution approach utilizes a reduction into two criteria formulations and investigates the efficient frontier systematically.

For most existing hashing methods, an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-engineering visual features, followed by another separate projection or quantization step that generates binary codes. However, such visual feature vectors may not be optimally compatible with the coding process, thus producing sub-optimal hashing codes. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture for supervised hashing, in which images are mapped into binary codes via carefully designed deep neural networks. The pipeline of the proposed deep architecture consists of three building blocks: 1) a sub-network with a stack of convolution layers to produce the effective intermediate image features; 2) a divide-and-encode module to divide the intermediate image features into multiple branches, each encoded into one hash bit; and 3) a triplet ranking loss designed to characterize that one image is more similar to the second image than to the third one.

In this paper, it is shown that simple stochastic gradient descent, besides being much faster, leads to su- perior dictionaries compared to the Method of Optimal Directions (MOD) and the K-SVD algorithm. The gain is most significant in the difficult but relevant case of highly overlapping subspaces, i.e., when the data samples are jointly represented by a restricted set of dictionary elements. Moreover, the so-called Bag of Pursuits method is introduced as an extension of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and it is shown that it provides an improved approxima- tion of the optimal sparse coefficients and, therefore, significantly improves the performance of the here proposed gradient descent as well as of the MOD and K-SVD approaches. Finally, it is shown how the Bag of Pursuits and a generalized version of the Neural Gas algorithm can be used to derive an even more powerful method for sparse coding. Performance is analyzed based on both synthetic data and the practical problem of image deconvolution. In the latter case, two different dictionaries are learned for sample images of buildings and flowers, respectively. It is demonstrated that the learned dictionaries do indeed adapt to the image class and that they therefore yield superior reconstruction results.1", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2183612706", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61814618"}

Experimental methods to determine protein structure are time consuming and expensive. As a result, the gap between protein sequence and its structure has widened substantially due to the high throughput sequencing techniques. Problems of experimental methods motivate us to develop the computational algorithms for protein structure prediction. ::: In this work, the clustering system is used to predict local protein structure. At first, recurring sequence clusters are explored with an improved K-means clustering algorithm. Carefully constructed sequence clusters are used to predict local protein structure. After obtaining the sequence clusters and motifs, we study how sequence variation for sequence clusters may influence its structural similarity. ::: Analysis of the relationship between sequence variation and structural similarity for sequence clusters shows that sequence clusters with tight sequence variation have high structural similarity and sequence clusters with wide sequence variation have poor structural similarity. Based on above knowledge, the established clustering system is used to predict the tertiary structure for local sequence segments. Test results indicate that highest quality clusters can give highly reliable prediction results and high quality clusters can give reliable prediction results. ::: In order to improve the performance of the clustering system for local protein structure prediction, a novel computational model called Clustering Support Vector Machines (CSVMs) is proposed. In our previous work, the sequence-to-structure relationship with the K-means algorithm has been explored by the conventional K-means algorithm. The K-means clustering algorithm may not capture nonlinear sequence-to-structure relationship effectively. As a result, we consider using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to capture the nonlinear sequence-to-structure relationship. However, SVM is not favorable for huge datasets including millions of samples. Therefore, we propose a novel computational model called CSVMs. Taking advantage of both the theory of granular computing and advanced statistical learning methodology, CSVMs are built specifically for each information granule partitioned intelligently by the clustering algorithm.

The resultant video representations effectively encode temporal information of dynamic patterns, which makes them more discriminative to human actions performed with different sequences of action patterns. We evaluate the proposed model on several real video datasets, and the results show that it successfully outperforms the baseline models.

The soil water availability for plants depends on plant root depth and soil properties. Here, we combined for the first time the remote sensing classification of Caatinga physiognomies with soil information derived from geostatistical analysis to relate vegetation distribution with physico-chemical attributes of soils. We evaluated the potential of multi-temporal data acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI)/Sentinel-2 for Random Forest (RF) classification of seven physiognomies. In addition, we analyzed the contribution of airborne LiDAR metrics to improve classification accuracy compared to six vegetation indices (VIs) and 10 reflectance bands from the MSI instrument. Using a detailed soil survey, the spatial distribution of the vegetation physiognomies mapped by RF was associated with the variability of 20 physico-chemical attributes of 75 soil profiles submitted to principal components analysis (PCA) and ordinary kriging. The results showed gains in overall classification accuracy with use of the multitemporal data over the mono-temporal observations. Gains in classification of arboreous Caatinga were also observed after the insertion of LiDAR metrics in the analysis, especially the percentage of vegetation cover with height greater than 5 m, the terrain elevation and the standard deviation of vegetation height. Overall, the most important metrics for classification were the VIs, especially the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII-1), Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The most important MSI/Sentinel-2 bands were positioned in the red-edge spectral interval. From PCA, soil attributes responsible for most of the data variance were related to soil fertility, soil depth and rock fragments in the surface horizon. The amounts of gravels and pebbles were factors of physiognomic variability with shrub and sub-shrub Caatinga occurring preferentially over shallow and stony soils. By contrast, arboreous Caatinga occurred over soils with total profile depth greater than 1 m. Finally, areas of sub-shrub Caatinga had greater values of cation exchange capacity (CEC) and water retention at field capacity. than areas of arboreous Caatinga.

For many different applications, however, most of the available audio-visual datasets are obtained from a single view, essentially due to acquisition limitations. In this work, we address viseme recognition in still images and explore the synthetic generation of additional views to improve overall accuracy. For that, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained with synthetic data and map from mouth images acquired in a single arbitrary view to frontal and side views \u2013 in which the face is rotated vertically at approximately 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0. Then, we use a state-of-art Convolutional Neural Network for classifying the visemes and compare its performance when training only with the original single-view images versus training with the additional views artificially generated by the GANs. We run experiments using three audiovisual corpora acquired under different conditions (GRID, AVICAR, and OuluVS2 datasets) and our results indicate that the additional views synthesized by the GANs are able to improve the viseme recognition accuracy on all tested scenarios.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/FG.2019.8756589", "venue": "FG", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2959515469", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196613751"}

The medical industry faces challenges such as overburdened health-care delivery systems and growth in physician demand. One solution that could potentially help handle the ageing population more efficiently is the automatic prediction of well-being on the basis of different well-being predictors. This could allow for more targeted care for patients. To examine whether it is possible to develop automatic prediction of well-being, we gathered data on sleep, activity, and time away from home for 22 elderly participants living in The Netherlands for a period of 10 days, using a medical sensor watch. In addition, we gathered self-reported assessments of well-being from the participants as well as nurse evaluations on the participants\u2019 well-being. We used and compared different types of classifiers to try to automatically predict well-being from the sensor data. We tried feature selection and different re-sampling techniques to improve the models. We show that, using the Random Forest classifier, both the self-reported assessments (after feature selection) and nurse evaluations (after re-sampling) can be predicted with respectively 94% accuracy (92.75% sensitivity) and 90.64% accuracy (90.14% sensitivity).

However, appliance detection is a challenging task, especially given a very low granularity and partial labeled even unlabeled data. Traditional methods install either a high granularity smart meter or sensors at every appliance, which is either too expensive or requires technical expertise. We propose a novel approach to detect heat pumps that utilizes low granularity smart meter data, prior sales data and weather data. In particular, motivated by the characteristics of heat pump consumption pattern, we extract novel features that are highly relevant to heat pump usage from smart meter data and weather data. Under the constraint that only a subset of heat pump users are available, we formalize the problem into a positive and unlabeled data classification and apply biased Support Vector Machine (BSVM) to our extracted features. Our empirical study on a real-world data set demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

In this work, we propose RCARF (Recurring Concepts Adaptive Random Forests), an ensemble tree-based online classifier that handles recurring concepts explicitly. The algorithm extends the capabilities of a version of Random Forest for evolving data streams, adding on top a mechanism to store and handle a shared collection of inactive trees, called concept history, which holds memories of the way market operators reacted in similar circumstances. This works in conjunction with a decision strategy that reacts to drift by replacing active trees with the best available alternative: either a previously stored tree from the concept history or a newly trained background tree. Both mechanisms are designed to provide fast reaction times and are thus applicable to high-frequency data.

Machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for clinical text classification tasks. However, a successful machine learning model usually requires extensive human efforts to create labeled training data and conduct feature engineering. In this study, we propose a clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation to reduce these human efforts. We develop a rule-based NLP algorithm to automatically generate labels for the training data, and then use the pre-trained word embeddings as deep representation features for training machine learning models. Since machine learning is trained on labels generated by the automatic NLP algorithm, this training process is called weak supervision. We evaluat the paradigm effectiveness on two institutional case studies at Mayo Clinic: smoking status classification and proximal femur (hip) fracture classification, and one case study using a public dataset: the i2b2 2006 smoking status classification shared task. We test four widely used machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using this paradigm. Precision, recall, and F1 score are used as metrics to evaluate performance. CNN achieves the best performance in both institutional tasks (F1 score: 0.92 for Mayo Clinic smoking status classification and 0.97 for fracture classification). We show that word embeddings significantly outperform tf-idf and topic modeling features in the paradigm, and that CNN captures additional patterns from the weak supervision compared to the rule-based NLP algorithms.

Natural disasters such as flood are regarded to be caused by extreme weather conditions as well as changes in global and regional climate. The prediction of flood incoming is a key factor to ensure civil protection in case of emergency and to provide effective early warning system. The risk of flood is affected by several factors such as land use, meteorological events, hydrology and the topology of the land. Predict such a risk implies the use of data coming from different sources such satellite images, water basin levels, meteorological and GIS data, that nowadays are easily produced by the availability new satellite portals as SENTINEL and distributed sensor networks on the field. In order to have a comprehensive and accurate prediction of flood risk is essential to perform a selective and multivariate analyses among the different types of inputs. Multivariate Analysis refers to all statistical techniques that simultaneously analyse multiple variables. Among multivariate analyses, Machine learning to provide increasing levels of accuracy precision and efficiency by discovering patterns in large and heterogeneous input datasets. Basically, machine learning algorithms automatically acquire experience information from data. This is done by the process of learning, by which the algorithm can generalize beyond the examples given by training data in input. Machine learning is interesting for predictions because it adapts the resolution strategies to the features of the data. This peculiarity can be used to predict extreme from high variable data, as in the case of floods.

So, it is significant to develop effective model for NO2 and SO2 forecasting and warning. However, it is not easy to get precise forecasting results for the irregular NO2 and SO2 series. This research focuses on modeling and prediction of the two major sources of acid rain, NO2 and SO2, and four cities in Central China region are selected as the test data. Specially, Central China region has the most severe regions with the acid rain in China for a long time. The proposed procedure is named as two-step-hybrid model, the detailed procedure of the proposed model can be summarized as three steps: First, the original NO2 (or SO2) sequence is decomposed into high-frequency and low-frequency sequences by the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD); Second, Support Vector Regression (SVR) model combined the Cuckoo Search algorithm (CS) and Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm (GWO) are employed to model the high-frequency and low frequency sequences, respectively; Third, forecasting data of low frequency and high frequency are summed as the final prediction results for NO2 (or SO2). In terms of model selection and assessment process, the proposed model and the other established models are compared by the forecasting error measures, such as MAE, MAPE and RMSE. The forecasting comparisons showed that the proposed two-step-hybrid model based on CEEMD, SVR, CS and GWO has higher forecasting precision compared with other forecasting models.

The processing algorithms developed perform the system calibration, damage detection and chemical deterioration analysis. Both photometric and geometric calibrations have been implemented. The photometric calibration is based on a white reference and intensity map and compensates for variation in light intensities. The geometric calibration is based on planar homographies to determine the interior and exterior orientation of the projector and the two cameras. This is used to map the acquired data of the different sensors into a single reference frame. To acquire 3D data, a set of phase-shifted fringe patterns is projected on the object which are processed by Fourier transform. To identify mechanical deterioration, the acquired 3D cloud of points is meshed and differences in surface normals for a given radius are computed. To analyse the chemical deterioration of the pigments a supervised classification method has been implemented. First of all, spectral data is normalized with the Extended Multiplicative Scatter Correction algorithm. Then, data dimensionality is reduced by applying Principal Component Analysis and classification is done with Support Vector Machine.

Spaceborne remote sensing of forest changes across country borders offers great potential for better understanding the underlying drivers of change and for developing comparable indicators between countries. For this paper we evaluated how forests changed in the border region of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia between 1987 and 2005 and how these changes depended on industrial transformations before and after 1989. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to assess forest cover change between 1987 and 2005. Our results showed that 8.12% of the forest stands in our study region were degraded either partially or completely during that time period, a percentage that equals 14,972 ha of the area's total forest cover. At the same time, 7.57% (13,951 ha) of the area were reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands.

First, we propose a new RFbased strategy (BERT) that applies the boosting technique in bags of extremely randomized trees. Second, we empirically demonstrate that this new strategy, as well as the recently proposed BROOF and LazyNN RF classifiers do complement each other, motivating us to stack them to produce an even more effective classifier.

The image quality plays an important role for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\u2019s applications. The small fixed wings UAV is suffering from the image blur due to the crosswind and the turbulence. Position and Orientation System (POS), which provides the position and orientation information, is installed onto an UAV to enable acquisition of UAV trajectory. It can be used to calculate the positional and angular velocities when the camera shutter is open. This study proposes a POS-assisted method to detect the blur image. The major steps include feature extraction, blur image detection and verification. In feature extraction, this study extracts different features from images and POS. The image-derived features include mean and standard deviation of image gradient. For POS-derived features, we modify the traditional degree-of-linear-blur (blinear) method to degree-of-motion-blur (bmotion) based on the collinear condition equations and POS parameters. Besides, POS parameters such as positional and angular velocities are also adopted as POS-derived features. In blur detection, this study uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier and extracted features (i.e. image information, POS data, blinear and bmotion) to separate blur and sharp UAV images. The experiment utilizes SenseFly eBee UAV system. The number of image is 129. In blur image detection, we use the proposed degree-of-motion-blur and other image features to classify the blur image and sharp images. The classification result shows that the overall accuracy using image features is only 56%. The integration of image-derived and POS-derived features have improved the overall accuracy from 56% to 76% in blur detection.

This kind of process in which trees are independently added to the ensemble, offers no guarantee that all those trees will cooperate effectively in the same committee. This statement rises two questions : are there any decision trees in a RF that provide the deterioration of ensemble performance? If so, is it possible to form a more accurate committee via removal of decision trees with poor performance? The answer to these questions is tackled as a classifier selection problem. We thus show that better subsets of decision trees can be obtained even using a sub-optimal classifier selection method. This proves that \u201cclassical\u201d RF induction process, for which randomized trees are arbitrary added to the ensemble, is not the best approach to produce accurate RF classifiers.

A vulnerability is a weakness in the software that, when exploited, causes a security failure. It is difficult to detect vulnerabilities until they manifest themselves as security failures in the operational stage of software, because security concerns are often not addressed or known sufficiently early during the software development life cycle. Numerous studies have shown that complexity, coupling, and cohesion (CCC) related structural metrics are important indicators of the quality of software architecture, and software architecture is one of the most important and early design decisions that influences the final quality of the software system. Although these metrics have been successfully employed to indicate software faults in general, there are no systematic guidelines on how to use these metrics to predict vulnerabilities in software. If CCC metrics can be used to indicate vulnerabilities, these metrics could aid in the conception of more secured architecture, leading to more secured design and code and eventually better software. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically predict vulnerabilities based on CCC metrics. To empirically validate the framework and prediction accuracy, we conduct a large empirical study on fifty-two releases of Mozilla Firefox developed over a period of four years. To build vulnerability predictors, we consider four alternative data mining and statistical techniques - C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Naive-Bayes - and compare their prediction performances. We are able to correctly predict majority of the vulnerability-prone files in Mozilla Firefox, with tolerable false positive rates. Moreover, the predictors built from the past releases can reliably predict the likelihood of having vulnerabilities in the future releases. The experimental results indicate that structural information from the non-security realm such as complexity, coupling, and cohesion are useful in vulnerability prediction.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.sysarc.2010.06.003", "venue": "J.

Applying these methods to nodes on graphs would require embedding the graphs into these spaces. By embedding and then learning the nodes on graphs, most methods are either flexible with different learning objectives or efficient enough for large scale applications. We propose a method to embed a graph into a feature space for a discriminative purpose. Our idea is to include label information into the embedding process, making the space representation tailored to the task. We design embedding objective functions that the following learning formulations become spectral transforms. We then reformulate these spectral transforms into multiple kernel learning problems.

To overcome these problems, a new fault detection approach based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), improved genetic algorithm (GA) and SVM is proposed in this paper. The EMD can deal with the nonlinear and stochastic characteristics of the vibration data of the sliding bearings. Useful fault features may be extracted by EMD.

These positive scans necessitate additional diagnostic procedures to establish a definitive diagnosis that adds cost and risk to the paradigm. A plasma test able to assign benign versus malignant pathology in high-risk patients would be an invaluable tool to complement low-dose computed tomography-based screening and promote its rapid implementation. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We evaluated 17 biomarkers, previously shown to have value in detecting lung cancer, against a discovery cohort, comprising benign (n = 67) cases and lung cancer (n = 69) cases. A Random Forest method based analysis was used to identify the optimal biomarker panel for assigning disease status, which was then validated against a cohort from the Mayo Clinic, comprising patients with benign (n = 61) or malignant (n = 20) indeterminate lung nodules. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Our discovery efforts produced a seven-analyte plasma biomarker panel consisting of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, IL-1ra, sIL-2R\u03b1, stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1+\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 \u03b1.

To reduce the computational cost, instead of entire image sequence, only neutral and emotional faces can be employed.

This means the fatal damage can be caused by these intrusions in the government agency, public office, and company operating various systems. For such reasons, there are growing interests and demand about the intrusion detection systems (IDS)-the security systems for detecting, identifying and responding to unauthorized or abnormal activities appropriately. The intrusion detection models that have been applied in conventional IDS are generally designed by modeling the experts' implicit knowledge on the network intrusions or the hackers' abnormal behaviors. These kinds of intrusion detection models perform well under the normal situations. However, they show poor performance when they meet a new or unknown pattern of the network attacks. For this reason, several recent studies try to adopt various artificial intelligence techniques, which can proactively respond to the unknown threats. Especially, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have popularly been applied in the prior studies because of its superior prediction accuracy. However, ANNs have some intrinsic limitations such as the risk of overfitting, the requirement of the large sample size, and the lack of understanding the prediction process (i.e. black box theory). As a result, the most recent studies on IDS have started to adopt support vector machine (SVM), the classification technique that is more stable and powerful compared to ANNs. SVM is known as a relatively high predictive power and generalization capability. Under this background, this study proposes a novel intelligent intrusion detection model that uses SVM as the classification model in order to improve the predictive ability of IDS. Also, our model is designed to consider the asymmetric error cost by optimizing the classification threshold. Generally, there are two common forms of errors in intrusion detection. The first error type is the False-Positive Error (FPE). In the case of FPE, the wrong judgment on it may result in the unnecessary fixation. The second error type is the False-Negative Error (FNE) that mainly misjudges the malware of the program as normal. Compared to FPE, FNE is more fatal. Thus, when considering total cost of misclassification in IDS, it is more reasonable to assign heavier weights on FNE rather than FPE. Therefore, we designed our proposed intrusion detection model to optimize the classification threshold in order to minimize the total misclassification cost. In this case, conventional SVM cannot be applied because it is designed to generate discrete output (i.e. a class). To resolve this problem, we used the revised SVM technique proposed by Platt(2000), which is able to generate the probability estimate. To validate the practical applicability of our model, we applied it to the real-world dataset for network intrusion detection. The experimental dataset was collected from the IDS sensor of an official institution in Korea from January to June 2010. We collected 15,000 log data in total, and selected 1,000 samples from them by using random sampling method. In addition, the SVM model was compared with the logistic regression (LOGIT), decision trees (DT), and ANN to confirm the superiority of the proposed model. LOGIT and DT was experimented using PASW Statistics v18.0, and ANN was experimented using Neuroshell 4.0. For SVM, LIBSVM v2.90-a freeware for training SVM classifier-was used. Empirical results showed that our proposed model based on SVM outperformed all the other comparative models in detecting network intrusions from the accuracy perspective. They also showed that our model reduced the total misclassification cost compared to the ANN-based intrusion detection model. As a result, it is expected that the intrusion detection model proposed in this paper would not only enhance the performance of IDS, but also lead to better management of FNE.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.13088/jiis.2011.17.4.157", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "339305830", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["189860713"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108084900"}

Owing to the recent release of open datasets for acoustic scene classification problems, representation learning techniques can now be envisioned for solving the problem of feature extraction. This paper makes a step toward this goal by first introducing a supervised nonnegative matrix factorization SNMF. Our goal through this SNMF is to induce the matrix decomposition to carry out discriminative information in addition to the usual generative ones. We achieve this objective by augmenting the nonnegative matrix factorization optimization problem with a novel loss function related to class labels of each column of the matrix to decompose.

We have analyzed the performances of these models on the DCASE-16 dataset and a corrected version of the LITIS Rouen one. Our experiments show that despite the small-scale setting, supervised feature learning is favorably competitive compared to the current state-of-the-art features. We also point out that for smaller scale dataset, SNMF is indeed slightly less prone to overfitting than convolutional neural networks.

Cloud covers are generally present in optical remote-sensing images, which limit the usage of acquired images and increase the difficulty of data analysis, such as image compositing, correction of atmosphere effects, calculations of vegetation induces, land cover classification, and land cover change detection. In previous studies, thresholding is a common and useful method in cloud detection. However, a selected threshold is usually suitable for certain cases or local study areas, and it may be failed in other cases. In other words, thresholding-based methods are data-sensitive. Besides, there are many exceptions to control, and the environment is changed dynamically. Using the same threshold value on various data is not effective. In this study, a threshold-free method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed, which can avoid the abovementioned problems. A statistical model is adopted to detect clouds instead of a subjective thresholding-based method, which is the main idea of this study. The features used in a classifier is the key to a successful classification. As a result, Automatic Cloud Cover Assessment (ACCA) algorithm, which is based on physical characteristics of clouds, is used to distinguish the clouds and other objects. In the same way, the algorithm called Fmask (Zhu et al., 2012) uses a lot of thresholds and criteria to screen clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. Therefore, the algorithm of feature extraction is based on the ACCA algorithm and Fmask. Spatial and temporal information are also important for satellite images. Consequently, co-occurrence matrix and temporal variance with uniformity of the major principal axis are used in proposed method. We aim to classify images into three groups: cloud, non-cloud and the others. In experiments, images acquired by the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and images containing the landscapes of agriculture, snow area, and island are tested.

The existing signature-based intrusion detection mechanisms are often not sufficient in detecting these types of attacks. As a result, anomaly intrusion detection methods have been developed to cope with such attacks. Among the variety of anomaly detection approaches, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is known to be one of the best machine learning algorithms to classify abnormal behaviors. The soft-margin SVM is one of the well-known basic SVM methods using supervised learning. However, it is not appropriate to use the soft-margin SVM method for detecting novel attacks in Internet traffic since it requires pre-acquired learning information for supervised learning procedure. Such pre-acquired learning information is divided into normal and attack traffic with labels separately. Furthermore, we apply the one-class SVM approach using unsupervised learning for detecting anomalies. This means one-class SVM does not require the labeled information. However, there is downside to using one-class SVM: it is difficult to use the one-class SVM in the real world, due to its high false positive rate. In this paper, we propose a new SVM approach, named Enhanced SVM, which combines these two methods in order to provide unsupervised learning and low false alarm capability, similar to that of a supervised SVM approach. We use the following additional techniques to improve the performance of the proposed approach (referred to as Anomaly Detector using Enhanced SVM): First, we create a profile of normal packets using Self-Organized Feature Map (SOFM), for SVM learning without pre-existing knowledge. Second, we use a packet filtering scheme based on Passive TCP/IP Fingerprinting (PTF), in order to reject incomplete network traffic that either violates the TCP/IP standard or generation policy inside of well-known platforms. Third, a feature selection technique using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for extracting optimized information from raw internet packets. Fourth, we use the flow of packets based on temporal relationships during data preprocessing, for considering the temporal relationships among the inputs used in SVM learning. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Enhanced SVM approach using the above-mentioned techniques, such as SOFM, PTF, and GA on MIT Lincoln Lab datasets, and a live dataset captured from a real network.

At the same time, many countries are on a trajectory of increasing forest cover, and secondary, plantation, and scrub forests are a growing proportion of global forest cover. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development, but most forest monitoring with satellite imagery does not distinguish old-growth forest from other forest types. Our goal was to measure changes in forest types, and especially old-growth forests, in the biodiversity hotspot of northwest Yunnan in southwest China. Northwest Yunnan is one of the poorest regions in China, and since the 1990s, the Chinese government has legislated strong forest protection and fostered the growth of ecotourism-based economic development. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ and MSS images, Support Vector Machines, and a multi-temporal composite classification technique to analyze change in forest types and the loss of old-growth forest in three distinct periods of forestry policy and ecotourism development from 1974 to 2009. Our analysis showed that logging rates decreased substantially from 1974 to 2009, and the proportion of forest cover increased from 62% in 1990 to 64% in 2009. However, clearing of high-diversity old-growth forest accelerated, from approximately 1100 hectares/year before the logging ban (1990 to 1999), to 1550 hectares/year after the logging ban (1999 to 2009). Paradoxically, old-growth forest clearing accelerated most rapidly where ecotourism was most prominent. Despite increasing overall forest cover, the proportion of old-growth forests declined from 26% in 1990, to 20% in 2009. The majority of forests cleared from 1974 to 1990 returned to either a non-forested land cover type (14%) or non-pine scrub forest (66%) in 2009, and our results suggest that most non-pine scrub forest was not on a successional trajectory towards high-diversity forest stands. That means that despite increasing forest cover, biodiversity likely continues to decline, a trend obscured by simple forest versus non-forest accounting. It also means that rapid development may pose inherent risks to biodiversity, since our study area arguably represents a \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d for balancing development with maintenance of biodiversity, given strong forest protection policies and an emphasis on ecotourism development.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.010", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2015810210", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["18382250", "12003903", "128277847", "30919760", "205006508", "206511664", "8923306", "140551511", "154512423", "11427598", "55996758", "7717117", "127912712", "84796144", "27693302", "153769267", "129714251", "17181316", "86520000", "9587922", "55168956", "15901539", "126458207", "6513306", "86367603", "3196203", "28935908", "129264523", "30919760", "29207885", "86436706", "27412390", "155022331", "30151959", "165656709", "206580802", "4414279", "23751780", "129627611", "154946254", "154064732", "50374", "128950397", "6809004", "1150028", "9726791", "8610995", "38549378", "86587292", "23977994", "55447691", "129066223", "19709138", "35945075", "153965528", "85226167", "202628088", "39199201"], "inbound_citations": ["18697338", "14421174", "41849166", "42661568", "4112375", "13438370", "131808879", "133616081", "34293897", "2012794", "6676590", "34985993", "197409317", "131951203", "133941464", "18410053", "208224742", "215191821", "26853552", "198171933", "49302100", "54673955", "83801142", "42463173", "145821261", "202160060", "11682673", "14791841"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30027413"}

However, in order to be able to accurately identify the underlying system we require techniques that have the capabilities of describing the complexities therein. In order to perform lesion-function studies a cohort of brain scans with the location of the lesion identified must be collected. Utilising diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging, normally collected in the clinical setting, I propose a new unsupervised lesion segmentation routine. The cohort of brain scans also need to be spatially normalised such that homologous regions of the brain are brought into register with each other. However, this process can be perturbed by the presence of a lesion within the scan. Though a series of simulations I evaluate the performance of 12 different spatial normalisation routines on brains scans that possess a lesion. Historically lesion-function mapping studies have tended to use a univariate statistical approach, where different locations within the brain are treated as being spatially independent from each other. Here I show that biases within the structure of the data have the potential to distort the lesion-function inferences we draw. Though a series of simulations, I show that a mass univariate technique is vulnerable to these biases and assess three different multivariate methods (Support Vector Machines, Relevance Vector Machines and Flexible Bayesian Modelling) as potential solutions to this problem. Asides from making lesion-function inferences, these multivariate models can be used to predict future events.

Nowadays, attempts have been made to automatically infer the modes of transport from positional data (such as GPS data) to significantly reduce the cost in time and budget of conventional travel diary surveys. Some limitations, however, exist in the literature, in aspects of data collection (spatio-temporal sample distribution, duration of study, granularity of data, device type), data pre-processing (managing GPS errors, choice of modes, trip information generalisation, data labelling strategy), the classification method used and the choice of variables used for classification, track segmentation methods used (clustering techniques), and using transport network datasets. Therefore, this research attempts to fully understand these aspects and their effect on the process of inference of mode of transport. Furthermore, this research aims to solve a classification problem of sparse GPS data into different transportation modes (car, walk, cycle, underground, train and bus). To address the data collection issues, we conduct studies that aim to identify a representative sample distribution, study duration, and data collection rate that best suits the purpose of this study. As for the data pre-processing issues, we standardise guidelines for managing GPS errors and the required level of detail of the collected trip information. We also develop an online WebGIS-based travel diary that allows users to view, edit, and validate their track information to assure obtaining high quality information. After addressing the validation issues, we develop an inference framework to detect the mode of transport from the collected data. We first study the variables that could contribute positively to this classification, and statistically quantify their discriminatory power using ANOVA analysis. We then introduce a novel approach to carry out this inference using a framework based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification. The classification process is followed by a segmentation phase that identifies stops, change points and indoor activity in GPS tracks using an innovative trajectory clustering technique developed for this purpose. The final phase of the framework develops a network matching technique that verifies the classification and segmentation results by testing their obedience to rules and restrictions of different transport networks. The framework is tested using coarse-grained GPS data, which has been avoided in previous studies, achieving almost 90% accuracy with a Kappa statistic reflecting almost perfect agreement.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "47355360", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59659786"}

In CaseAdvisor, decision forests are created in real time to help compress a large case base into several small ones. This is done by merging similar cases together through a clustering algorithm. An important side effect of this operation is that it allows up-to-date maintenance operations to be performed for case base management. During the retrieval process, an information-guided subsystem can then generate decision forests based on users' current answers obtained through an interactive process. Possible questions to the user are carefully analyzed through information theory. An important feature of the system is that case-base maintenance and reasoning are integrated in a seamless whole.

There is also an activation level associated with each agent. Activation spreads according to connectionist rules. The speed of each symbolic processor is proportional to the activation level of the corresponding DUAL agent and varies dynamically. Thus multiple candidate-solutions to a given problem can be explored in parallel. More computational resources are dedicated to the more promising candidates and the degree of 'promise' is reevaluated dynamically. This allows for flexible and efficient behavior of the system as a whole. The exact relationship between symbolic speed and connectionist activation is based on an energetic analogy.

This research aims to introduce an advanced machine learning method for a classiflcation problem in Web caching that requires a decision to cache or not to cache Web objects in a proxy cache server. The challenges in this clas- siflcation problem include the issues in identifying attributes ranking and improve the classiflcation accuracy signiflcantly. This research includes four methods that are Classiflcation and Regression Trees (CART), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF) and TreeNet (TN) for classiflcation on Web caching. The experimental results reveal that CART performed extremely well in classifying Web objects from the existing log data with a size of Web objects as a signiflcant attribute for Web cache performance enhancement.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14311/nnw.2011.21.025", "venue": null, "journal": "Neural Network World", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1973623795", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10504769", "31444860", "30582842", "17417489", "1346006", "67097729", "14253876", "62257609", "7367791", "17818054", "2958409", "947095", "1977176", "8553540", "35351897", "60993494", "15394239", "116589214", "16190154", "1307215", "41965832", "60855904", "15948288", "15439572", "13808967", "15644305", "15750400", "37943786"], "inbound_citations": ["86531458", "52855244", "29809323", "14053788", "39860311", "63211430", "17801987", "16677612", "51881780", "14349089", "12178695"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18873639"}

Shultz (thomas.shultz@mcgill.ca) Department of Psychology and School of Computer Science, McGill University, 1205 Penfield Avenue Montreal, QC H3A 1B1 Canada Abstract Successful applications of connectionist learning to educational issues include word reading, single-digit multiplication, and prime-number detection. While closely modeling human learning, these applications underscore the importance of practice, feedback, prior knowledge, and well- structured lessons. Among the remaining simulation challenges in educational domains are other reading and arithmetic skills, learner-generated goals, social aspects of learning, and learning by direct instruction. Keywords: Connectionism; education; multiplication; prime-number detection. reading; Introduction Because connectionism has dominated the theoretical study of learning for the last 20 years, it would be surprising if it yielded no useful applications to the field of education, where learning is obviously a key issue. However, most connectionist research is resolutely theoretical with very little effort expended on solving educational problems. The few systematic treatments of applying connectionism to education were written years ago and seem to have barely scratched the surface of possibilities. This paper reviews some of the more promising lines of connectionist research into learning in the key educational domains of reading and mathematics before attempting to abstract some recommendations that might be of interest to educational researchers. First though, modern connectionism is distinguished from the older, behaviorist connectionism, which had been applied to education nearly a century ago. Finally, some of the considerable challenges that education poses for connectionist modeling are discussed. Connectionism Old and New The central idea of modern connectionism is that mental processes can be modeled by interconnected networks of simple units. This is quite different from the older, behavioristic connectionism. Behaviorism emphasized the learning of associations between stimuli and responses and the idea that responses become habitual by being rewarded. Despite some rather minor historical influence on, and superficial similarities with, modern connectionism, the differences are more profound than some critics believe (e.g., Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). Whereas behaviorists discussed a single association between a stimulus and a response, modern connectionism deals with large, multilevel, massively parallel networks. Moreover, many contemporary networks are designed with recurrent connectivity which allows for sequential processing and complex network dynamics. Following from these differences, the old knowledge representation schemes were entirely local, whereas modern networks often employ distributed schemes in which each unit represents many different ideas and each idea is represented by many different units. These distributed representations are more efficient and robust, more biologically realistic, and account for a variety of interesting psychological phenomena. Behaviorism was uninterested in mental states, while modern connectionists invest considerable energy into determining what their networks know at various points in learning. Such knowledge-representation analyses often become an essential part of explaining psychological phenomena. The law of effect emphasized that habit formation was controlled by rewards. Contemporary connectionist models have demonstrated the difficulty of learning from evaluative reward signals indicating that an organism is doing well or badly (Hertz, Krogh, & Palmer, 1991). In contrast, many neural networks learn from fully specified target vectors that indicate the correct response to particular inputs, making learning faster and more accurate. Taken together, these differences provide modern networks with vastly more learning power than simple habits possess. A habit implements only a simple linear relation between a stimulus and a response, whereas there are now proofs that a network with a single layer of hidden units can learn any continuous function to any degree of accuracy if this layer has enough hidden units (Hertz et al., 1991). There are also proofs that any function can be learned by a network with two hidden layers, if there are enough hidden units in each layer. Finally, although most of the theoretical work in behaviorism was vague and speculative, contemporary connectionism is characterized by working computational models that enable evaluation of the quality of data coverage and generate testable predictions. Connectionism has been more concerned with establishing a theoretical understanding of learning than with developing applications to education or other practical fields. However, because connectionists have had so much success modeling the learning of reading and elementary mathematics, there is the possibility for applications to educational practice. Models of Reading A debate about whether it is better to teach reading with the rules of letter-to-sound correspondence or by learning to visually recognize whole words began in the 1960s (Foorman, 1994). There are hundreds of such phonic rules, but because letter-to-sound correspondence is only quasi- regular, they are not all that useful to learn as universally", "year": 1989, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ML", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2767296883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["10218078", "144928812", "152788061", "15413332", "2014422", "29043627", "144656511", "10301716", "38623065", "45529054", "46176652", "39224507", "18180770", "557347", "59887599", "10347463", "30165868", "141982496", "2792985", "38568699", "145078723"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5180245"}

The service quality matters because system failures could seriously affect business and user experience. A cloud service system typically contains a large number of computing nodes. In reality, nodes may fail and affect service availability. In this paper, we propose a failure prediction technique, which can predict the failure-proneness of a node in a cloud service system based on historical data, before node failure actually happens. The ability to predict faulty nodes enables the allocation and migration of virtual machines to the healthy nodes, therefore improving service availability. Predicting node failure in cloud service systems is challenging, because a node failure could be caused by a variety of reasons and reflected by many temporal and spatial signals. Furthermore, the failure data is highly imbalanced. To tackle these challenges, we propose MING, a novel technique that combines: 1) a LSTM model to incorporate the temporal data, 2) a Random Forest model to incorporate spatial data; 3) a ranking model that embeds the intermediate results of the two models as feature inputs and ranks the nodes by their failure-proneness, 4) a cost-sensitive function to identify the optimal threshold for selecting the faulty nodes. We evaluate our approach using real-world data collected from a cloud service system. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have also successfully applied the proposed approach in real industrial practice.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3236024.3236060", "venue": "ESEC/FSE 2018", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2884697754", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14153733", "397316", "1554582", "2705898", "7953114", "16998445", "5769459", "1316436", "7955044", "29780128", "61727269", "1601317", "61740386", "206778480", "1915014", "8781910", "14468574", "2065665", "22537783", "28826624", "61740386", "52301932", "7961699", "13953294", "9438267", "16339266", "7867595", "114741669", "207179412", "10769502", "20009460", "49566738", "15202821", "18948887", "17555343", "1894827"], "inbound_citations": ["208202331", "174800922", "210116650", "212733953", "202728665", "86393768", "199458012"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53082265"}

ERPs showed negativity (170-450 ms, central-posterior) more negative for word-in-context than for word-before-context. The onset of the negativity was 170 ms, suggesting some context effect at the initial stage of semantic construction. The second EEG classification analysis asked that, within word-in-context, whether EEG patterns differed between affective (positive/negative) context and ontological (animal/human) context. Signals were segmented in 100-ms interval post word onset. Using single-trial multivariate analysis, Support Vector Machine (Vapnik, 2000) classifier was trained to do the binary classification. In word-before-context condition, percentage of correctly classified trials stayed at chance for all intervals (50%), as expected. Remarkably, classification accuracy in word-in-context condition was above the chance across 30 participants in 200-300 ms (54%, p=0.0006, against chance-level). This suggests that semantic representations for the same word in the same brain already differed between \u201cword-in-affectivecontext\u201d and \u201cword-in-ontological-context\u201d, initially. Context effects are detectable at the earliest semantic stage during word processing, evidenced by both grand-averaged ERPs and single-trial EEG.

Feature adaptation is learned with a multi-layer perceptron, which is trained on feature pairs of an image corresponding to the outputs of the original and updated network. We validate experimentally that such a transformation generalizes well to the features of the previous set of classes, and maps features to a discriminative subspace in the feature space.

In the present study, we evaluated the usefulness of this image feature for differentiating between benign and malignant masses using a support vector machine (SVM) with various kernels. The kernel computes the inner product of the functions that embed the data into a feature space where the nonlinear pattern appears linear. Q-FD was calculated using the method previously reported from the database of X-ray mammograms produced by the Japan Society of Radiological Technology. In addition to Q-FD, the image features such as curvature (C) and eccentricity (E) were extracted. The conventional fractal dimension (C-FD) was also calculated using the box-counting method. First, we investigated the SVM performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the task of differentiating between benign and malignant masses by taking 5 parameters (C, E, C-FD, Q-FD and age) as input features in SVM. When using the linear kernel, the best accuracy was obtained at a regularization parameter of 50. For the polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, the best accuracy was obtained when the degree of polynomial and the width of RBF were 1 and 1, respectively. The accuracies were 0.746\u00b10.089, 0.731\u00b10.095 and 0.734\u00b10.086 for the linear, polynomial and RBF kernels, respectively, when using C, E, C-FD and age as input features in the SVM.

Among many techniques of classification the support vector machine (SVM) is widely applied to bioinformatics or genetic analysis, because it gives sound theoretical background and its performance is superior to other methods. The SVM can be rewritten by a combination of the hinge loss function and the penalty function. The smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty function satisfies desirably statistical properties. Since standard SVM techniques typically treat all classes equally, it is not well suited to unbalanced proportion data. We propose a robust method to treat unbalanced cases based on the weights of the class.

In this paper we develop a robust geospatial method for defining and mapping the WUI in the Alpine environment, where most interactions between infrastructures and wildland vegetation concern the fire ignition through human activities, whereas no significant threats exist for infrastructures due to contact with burning vegetation. We used the three Alpine Swiss cantons of Ticino, Valais and Grisons as the study area. The features representing anthropogenic infrastructures (urban or infrastructural components of the WUI) as well as forest cover related features (wildland component of the WUI) were selected from the Swiss Topographic Landscape Model (TLM3D). Georeferenced forest fire occurrences derived from the WSL Swissfire database were used to define suitable WUI interface distances. The Random Forest algorithm was applied to estimate the importance of predictor variables to fire ignition occurrence. This revealed that buildings and drivable roads are the most relevant anthropogenic components with respect to fire ignition. We consequently defined the combination of drivable roads and easily accessible (i.e. 100 m from the next drivable road) buildings as the WUI-relevant infrastructural component. For the definition of the interface (buffer) distance between WUI infrastructural and wildland components, we computed the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) of the percentage of ignition points (observed and simulated) arising at increasing distances from the selected infrastructures. The ECDF facilitates the calculation of both the distance at which a given percentage of ignition points occurred and, in turn, the amount of forest area covered at a given distance. Finally, we developed a GIS ModelBuilder routine to map the WUI for the selected buffer distance. The approach was found to be reproducible, robust (based on statistical analyses for evaluating parameters) and flexible (buffer distances depending on the targeted final area covered) so that fire managers may use it to detect WUI according to their specific priorities.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.02.003", "venue": "Comput.

In some countries, such as Spain, operators of agricultural irrigation are under increasing pressure to improve efficiency. Accordingly, accurate forecasts of water demand are a pre-requisite for the successful implementation of water resources planning and management tools in irrigated areas. However, forecasting approaches based on traditional neural networks have challenges to capture temporal dependencies that generally characterize irrigation flow time series. In this study, for the first time, a recurrent long short-term memory network (LSTM) was coupled with the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) and bootstrap techniques, for accurate and robust irrigation flow forecasting. For comparative purposes, the study also explored the ability of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR), an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a Multi Linear Regression (MLR), to forecast irrigation flow in Palos de la Frontera, an irrigation district located in Huelva (southern Spain), for a one-day lead time. The autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function determined the most significant lagged time series of irrigation flow to be used as model inputs. The wavelet-LSTM (W-LSTM) and waveletbootstrap-ANN models (WB-ANN) had the most accurate forecasts, as measured by statistical metrics including the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (r2), mean relative error (MRE), mean absolute relative error (MARE), Willmott\u2019s index, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index (NASH).

Users with power credentials can do almost anything they want with the systems they own with very little control or oversight. Most breaches occurring nowadays by power users are considered legitimate access and not necessarily intrusions. Developing a solution for such problems is challenging because power users need flexible requirements to administer or maintain their systems. The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. ::: This dissertation describes the design and implementation of a network Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) framework that is intended to defeat the insider threat in organizations. The AVPS sits between privileged users and applications. It monitors traffic that traverses the network and takes actions as needed. A proof of concept prototype for the system was developed in a virtualized environment. FTP and Telnet were part of the application testbed. Rules that pertain to privileged user administration were applied. Actions that were tested successfully included traffic monitoring, replacement, blocking, and dropping. ::: This work also examined the scalability of the AVPS design. An experimental testbed was built to obtain performance measures of the AVPS overhead, throughput, and response time. FTP, Database and Web servers were used in the application testbed. A variety of tests were performed including automated simultaneous transactions and manual simultaneous transactions. An M/M/N//M analytic queuing model was used to assess how well the AVPS system would perform for a finite population where the number of applications, users and AVPS engines vary under different load levels. The results showed that the AVPS exhibits a very low overhead and is therefore scalable. ::: The AVPS architecture design was further enhanced to automate how signatures are created. Autonomic self-protection capabilities were added into the framework by implementing high level rules that set the goal for how violations are detected and signatures are created.

A semi-supervised soft label propagation based on mass function (SSLP) is proposed in this paper. We deal with the imprecise community assignment of each node by mass function which can be regarded as a soft label. And the mass assigned to the whole set of all communities measures the degree of outliers. Based on manifold assumption, the label of each node depends on its neighbors whose label information can be combined by Dempster's rule of combination.

However, conventional context-aware recommendation approaches have the drawbacks of giving the same weight to all context features, ignoring that users may have different preferences to different contexts, and the effects of context features on the process of recommendations may be different. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional context-aware recommendation approach based on improved random forest (MCRIRF) algorithm. The MCRIRF first improves the random forest algorithm by randomly selecting features from multiple feature subspaces that are classified by the importance of features. In addition, the MCRIRF uses the improved random forest algorithm to decompose and reduce the dimensions of context features of users, items, and contexts. Then, the MCRIRF calculates the weights of the 3-D user-item-context recommendation model. In the end, the MCRIRF recommends top- ${n}$ items with high forecasting ratings to users with similar contexts. LDOS-CoMoDa data set and Cycle Share data set are used for simulation, and six other recommendation approaches are considered in comparison. The experimental results indicate that the MCRIRF can reduce the mean absolute error and root mean squared error of the two data sets by about 2%\u201316% and 2%\u201313%, respectively.

This evoked our motivation to investigate soil C pools in the State of Florida covering about 150,000 km2. Our specific objectives were to (i) compare different soil C pool models that quantify stochastic and/or deterministic components, (ii) assess the prediction performance of soil C models, and (iii) identify environmental factors that impart most control on labile and recalcitrant pools and soil total C (TC). We used soil data (0\u201320 cm) from a research collected at 1014 georeferenced sites including measured bulk density, recalcitrant carbon (RC), labile (hot-water extractable) carbon (HC) and TC. A comprehensive set of 327 geospatial soil-environmental variables was acquired. The Boruta method was employed to identify \u201call-relevant\u201d soil-environmental predictors. We employed eight methods - Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), Bagged Regression Tree (BaRT), Boosted Regression Tree (BoRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Regression Kriging (RK), and Ordinary Kriging (OK) \u2013 to predict soil C fractions and TC. Overall, 36, 20 and 25 predictors stood out as \u201call-relevant\u201d to estimate TC, RC and HC, respectively. We predicted a mean of 5.29 \u00b1 3.58 kg TC m\u22122 in the top 20 cm with the best model. The prediction performance assessed by the Ratio of Prediction Error to Inter-quartile Range for TC stocks was as follows: RF > SVM > BoRT > BaRT > PLSR > RK > CART > OK. The best models explained 71.6%, 71.7% and 30.5% of the total variation for TC, RC and HC, respectively. Biotic and hydro-pedological factors explained most of the variation in soil C pools and TC; lithologic and climatic factors showed some relationships to soil C pools and TC, whereas topographic factors faded from soil C models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.037", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "2908031888", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202776082", "215540625", "213753259", "208821256", "132572608"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135339419"}

Sizes and material composition of impervious surfaces changes greatly from urban to rural areas, leading to varying spectral signatures and ultimately misclassification. This creates a challenge in choosing suitable classification algorithms and image processing methods. In this study, the influence of spatial resolution and land-cover spectral and spatial heterogeneity on accuracy of land-cover classification at a rural-urban interface was examined alongside comparison of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms. Further, the performance of spectral unmixing strategies was tested against standard feature extraction methods, namely, NAPCA and PCA. The results showed a 10 % improvement in classification accuracy from 30 m to 10 m spatial resolution for both overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients, however, relatively high per-pixel class disagreement (39 %) was recorded between the different resolution maps, pointing to the fact that overall accuracy or Kappa coefficients may not capture the spatial resolution effects on classification accuracy results in its entirety. SVM classifier proved superior to the RF classifier with even a relatively bigger margin at the coarser spatial resolution (i.e. 4.9 % and 5.7 % higher accuracy at 10 m and 30 m spatial resolution respectively). Higher classification accuracies were observed for partial unmixing and sum-to-unity unmixing feature extraction strategies at both spatial resolutions relative to the results from PCA, NAPCA and original image data (i.e. 62 %, 61 %, 51 %, 61 % and 59 % respectively for 30 m resolution, and, 67 %, 67 %, 62 %, 65 % and 66 % respectively for 10 m resolution image). It was found that the dominance of unmixing-based feature extraction methods reduced while the standard dimensionality reduction approaches (NAPCA and PCA) made a zero contribution to improving classification accuracy at finer spatial resolution (i.e. 10 m). According to the results of land-cover heterogeneity assessment, more fragmented and spatially diverse landscapes were comparably more spectrally diverse along the rural-urban gradient. A high degree of landscape heterogeneity and lowest classification accuracy was observed in the peri-urban region at approximately 11 kilometers from the very urban area.

The architecture's networks compete to learn the training patterns. As a result, a plant's parameter space is partitioned into a number of regions, and a different network learns a control law in each region.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACC.1991.4174652", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1498431753", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203664318"}

But, as more images of pre-defined categories become available, they also become more diverse and cover finer semantic differences. Ultimately, the categories themselves need to be divided into subcategories to account for that semantic refinement. Image classification in general has improved significantly over the last few years, but it still requires a massive amount of manually annotated data. Subdividing categories into subcategories multiples the number of labels, aggravating the annotation problem. Hence, we can expect the annotations to be refined only for a subset of the already labeled data, and exploit coarser labeled data to improve classification. In this work, we investigate how coarse category labels can be used to improve the classification of subcategories. To this end, we adopt the framework of Random Forests and propose a regularized objective function that takes into account relations between categories and subcategories.

Bovine spermatozoa are used as a model system because they have cellular membranes analogous to those of other cell types, and yet are much simpler because they have no cytoplasm and do not participate in DNA transcription or mRNA translation. They can be cultured as single cells and are easily evaluated for membrane characteristics using flow cytometry. These features make the mammalian spermatozoon a useful model for exploring the principles of membrane structure/function in the presence of a variety of environmental challenges such as simulated microgravity. Cryopreserved, washed beef bull sperm (4\u20138 \u00d7 106 mL-1)were incubated under non-capacitating conditions (modified glucose-free Tyrode\u2019s medium containing low bicarbonate, HEPES buffer, pyruvate and 3 mg mL-1 BSA V; 23\u00b0C in air), and these spermatozoa remained alive for 24\u201348 h at 1G. To simulate \u03bcG, spermatozoa were incubated under the same conditions, in a HARV 10 rotating wall vessel (RWV, Synthecon, Inc, Houston, TX, USA) at 9 rpms. Spermatozoa were incubated in 1G and Sim-\u03bcG environments for 2.5\u20134.5 h and subsequently exposed to 0, 60 or 80 \u03bcg mL-1 LC for 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 min. Three fluorochrome combinations were used as probes at each [LC]/time point: (1) propidium Iodide (dead status) + SYBR 14 (live status); (2) PI + FITC-PSA (acrosome reactions [ARs]); (3) PI + MitoTracker Deep Red (mitochondrial activity). Approximately 1 million spermatozoa from 3 bulls were evaluated over 4 days. Data were acquired on a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer, and initially analyzed (quality control) using the bundled FACSVantage SE software package (Cell Quest, BD BioSciences, San Jose, CA, USA). This provided graphics of simple cell relations (fluorescence v. LC exposure time). For further statistical analysis, and incorporation of non-parametric statistical tools (including pattern recognition using Support Vector Machines), the data were processed using a collection of Perl scripts and C programs. Results: Live/dead status: When Sim-\u03bcG + 60 \u03bcg mL-1 LC sperm were compared to 1G + 60 \u03bcg mL-1LC, and 80 \u03bcg mL-1 LC sperm, their profiles were more similar to the 1G 80 \u03bcg mL-1 LC profiles. AR status: the Sim-\u03bcG + 60 \u03bcg mL-1 LC profiles were similar to the 1G + 60 \u03bcg mL-1 LC profiles. Mitochondrial Status: the Sim-\u03bcG + 60 \u03bcg mL-1LC profiles were more similar to 1G + 80 \u03bcg mL-1 LC profiles. Summary: although Sim-\u03bcG sperm lost their motility within 3 h, they were alive. Cell profiles indicate that Sim-\u03bcG sperm nuclear membranes are less stable and their mitochondria are less functional than the 1G controls, but their acrosomes are intact indicating that fertilizing potential may remain. Additional experiments are needed to determine the time course for Sim-\u03bcG, induced changes, and whether Sim-\u03bcG sperm can penetrate eggs.

Disputed authorship is a common problem in Classics, since little information about ancient documents has survived the centuries. Many scholars have questioned the authenticity of the final chapter of Xenophon's Cyropaedia, a 4th century B.C. historical text. In this study, we use N-grams frequency vectors with a cosine similarity function and word frequency vectors with Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBC) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze the authorship of the Cyropaedia. Although the N-gram analysis shows that the epilogue of the Cyropaedia differs slightly from the rest of the work, comparing the analysis of Xenophon with analyses of Aristotle and Plato suggests that this difference is not significant. Both NBC and SVM analyses of word frequencies show that the final chapter of the Cyropaedia is closely related to the other chapters of the Cyropaedia. Therefore, this analysis suggests that the disputed chapter was written by Xenophon. This information can help scholars better understand the Cyropaedia and also demonstrates the usefulness of applying modern authorship analysis techniques to classical literature.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.01684", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2767330327", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207654654", "2968704", "203303797", "162163906", "2427083", "33163185", "169301379", "170956168", "124790138", "10659969", "17446674", "195347319", "203669157", "7664224", "19695987", "61210463"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19662500"}

Experiments on a real dataset collected from Twitter show that our method can achieve performances that are comparable with other state-of-the-art non-incremental techniques.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-11812-3_16", "venue": "Discovery Science", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "203153987", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["56544897", "52874011", "8242133", "17855958", "13093354", "15475509", "58786248", "3264198", "1242274", "355820", "8574004"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36154967"}

This environment is referred to as the ``closed-world'' model, while the ``open-world'' model implies that unknown classes can be incorporated into a recognition algorithm whilst being predicted. Therefore, recognition systems that operate in the real world have to deal with these unknown categories. Our objective was not only to detect data that originate from categories unseen during training, but to identify similarities between pieces of unknown data and then form new classes by automatically labeling them. Our Double Probability Model was extended by an image clustering algorithm, in which Kernel K-means was used. A new procedure, namely the Cluster Classification algorithm for the detection of unknowns and automated labeling, is proposed. These approaches facilitate the transition from open-set recognition to an open-world problem. The Fisher Vector (FV) was used for the mathematical representation of the images and then a Support Vector Machine introduced as a classifier. The measurement of similarity was based on the FV representations. Experiments were conducted on the Caltech101 and Caltech256 datasets of images and the Rand Index was evaluated over the unknown data.

A face recognition system involves three important phases: face detection, feature extraction and classification (identification and/or verification). The robustness of face recognition could be improved by treating the variations in these stages. One of the main issues in design of face recognition system is how to extract discriminative facial features. A precise extraction of a representative feature set will improve the performance of a face recognition system. Various techniques have been used to represent images efficiently, of which the most well-known and widely applied are Wavelet, Contourlet, Shearlet and Curvelet Transform. Their ability to capture localized time-frequency information of image motivates their use for feature extraction. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study on these transforms as feature extractors from face images. To further reduce the feature dimensionality, we adopt Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis to select the most discriminative feature sets. The performance levels delivered by each transform are contrasted in terms of the accuracy measure computed over the outputs generated by the Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM).

To attack the challenge, several machine learning techniques have been developed and applied for automated photo tagging. For example, supervised learning techniques have been applied to automated photo tagging by training statistical classifiers from a collection of manually labeled examples. Although the existing approaches work well for small testbeds with relatively small number of annotation words, due to the long-standing challenge of object recognition, they often perform poorly in large-scale problems. Another limitation of the existing approaches is that they require a set of high-quality labeled data, which is not only expensive to collect but also time consuming. In this article, we investigate a social image based annotation scheme by exploiting implicit side information that is available for a large number of social photos from the social web sites. The key challenge of our intelligent annotation scheme is how to learn an effective distance metric based on implicit side information (visual or textual) of social photos.

Thus, it is very essential to solve the problems related to visual perception. Visual complexity, as a basic aspect of visual perception, is extremely important for human being to understand and perceive the visual stimuli. This leads to an interesting question: what factors affect visual complexity of images and how to evaluate the visual complexity objectively. In order to address this issue, we take digital painting images as the visual stimuli. We firstly conduct an experiment to collect the subjective complexity labels of painting images and then identify the factors that affect visual complexity perception. Three main factors that affect human visual complexity perception are identified, namely, distribution of compositions, colors, and contents. Secondly, we study theoretical and empirical concepts from psychology and art theory to design 29 global, local, and salient region features which represent the above three factors. Moreover, we provide two ways to estimate the visual complexity of painting images. One is to evaluate the visual complexity level of painting images by classifying the complexity level into three levels (low, middle and high complexity). Another one is to predict a complexity value for painting images by a regression model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed classification method (by Random Forest classifiers) can predict the visual complexity perception of paintings with an accuracy of 86.78%. By the comparisons, the proposed method outperforms other measurements of image complexity with a higher correlation coefficient between subjective complexity and objective measures of complexity. Furthermore, we apply the regression model of visual complexity to predict the other features of painting images. The results show that the regression model has a good ability of measuring aesthetic quality, beauty, and liking of color of the painting images involved in JenAesthetics dataset.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2018.06.006", "venue": "Knowl.

Identifying individuals with high suicide probability through online social media has an advantage in its efficiency and potential to reach out to hidden individuals, yet little research has been focused on this specific field. Objective: The objective of this study was to apply two classification models, Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) and Random Forest (RF), to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of identifying high suicide possibility microblog users in China through profile and linguistic features extracted from Internet-based data. Methods: There were nine hundred and nine Chinese microblog users that completed an Internet survey, and those scoring one SD above the mean of the total Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) score, as well as one SD above the mean in each of the four subscale scores in the participant sample were labeled as high-risk individuals, respectively. Profile and linguistic features were fed into two machine learning algorithms (SLR and RF) to train the model that aims to identify high-risk individuals in general suicide probability and in its four dimensions. Models were trained and then tested by 5-fold cross validation; in which both training set and test set were generated under the stratified random sampling rule from the whole sample. There were three classic performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 measure) and a specifically defined metric \u201cScreening Efficiency\u201d that were adopted to evaluate model effectiveness. Results: Classification performance was generally matched between SLR and RF. Given the best performance of the classification models, we were able to retrieve over 70% of the labeled high-risk individuals in overall suicide probability as well as in the four dimensions. Screening Efficiency of most models varied from 1/4 to 1/2. Precision of the models was generally below 30%. Conclusions: Individuals in China with high suicide probability are recognizable by profile and text-based information from microblogs. Although there is still much space to improve the performance of classification models in the future, this study may shed light on preliminary screening of risky individuals via machine learning algorithms, which can work side-by-side with expert scrutiny to increase efficiency in large-scale-surveillance of suicide probability from online social media.

The former are effective and robust but also expensive and time consuming. The latter are cheaper and faster but exhibit lower reliability, require the probe to touch the leaves and heavily depend on the positions chosen for sampling the leaf\u2019s surface. In this paper, a new approach to non-destructively predict total chlorophyll content of fresh-cut rocket leaves without contact is proposed. Fresh-cut rocket leaves were analysed for total chlorophyll content by spectrophotometer and SPAD-502 (used as reference values) and acquired by a computer vision system using a machine-learning model (Random Forest Regression) to predict total chlorophyll content. Finally, the trained and validated model will be used for on-line prediction of total chlorophyll content of unseen fresh-cut rocket leaves. The proposed system can match the physical and timing constraints of a real industrial production line and its performance (R 2 = 0.90), measured on the case study of fresh-cut rocket leaves, outperformed the results of the SPAD chlorophyll meter (R 2 = 0.79).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2017.06.012", "venue": "Comput.

To enhance the efficiency of the numerical model, the Monte Carlo simulations (MCs) are applied and the k-fold cross validation method is used for validating the yielded numerical results. Then, the most significant input parameters are detected for simulating the discharge coefficient. Subsequently, the number of the ELM hidden layer neurons is determined by trial and error process. Next, the most optimized activation function is also chosen. Then, using the input parameters, six ELM models are developed and the superior model and the most effective input parameter are identified through a sensitivity analysis. It is observed that the model estimates the discharge coefficient with acceptable accuracy. For instance, the coefficient of determination (R2) and the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) for this model are surmised to be 0.963 and 5.135, respectively. Also, the Froude number at the downstream of the side weir (Fd) is introduced as the most effective input parameter. Besides, a relationship is provided for calculating the discharge coefficient. Subsequently, through the conduction of an error analysis, it is concluded that the superior model has an overestimated performance.

Frequency Modulated (FM) signal recognition has been a hot topic recently, which focuses on finding the characteristic feature in the noisy signal observations comprehensively identifying the the same or different version of transmitting devices with approximate performance parameters in modern electronic warfare. Direct use of Higher Order Statistics (HOS) becomes unavailable for this on-line application because of its huge computation time and memory space especially in the case of high frequency FM signal. This paper presents a novel view to improve the HOS analysis efficiency greatly by sub-sampling and its ability to detect the nonlinear parasitic amplitude modulation spontaneous frequency coupling while preserving the noise-contaminated feature and eliminating the random Gaussian noise. FM signal-related feature bispectra selection easily and significantly translates the 2-D feature matching pattern to a 1-D one applicable for an adaptive incremental learning Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Network (SLFN), which has been shown to be extremely fast with good generalization performance. Apart from the noise-to-signal level estimation as the expected learning accuracy, no other control parameters have to be manually chosen for this simple SLFN with adaptively incremental random hidden nodes one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk of fixed or varying chunk size.

Each Twitter post was manually classified using a tri-axial scheme, capturing genre, theme and sentiment. The genre category consisted of nine subcategories (e.g. news, marketing), the theme category consisted of nineteen subcategories (e.g. cessation, hookah), and the sentiment category consisted of two categories (positive and negative sentiment). Using the collected data, machine-learning classifiers were trained to detect tobacco-related tweets vs. irrelevant tweets as well as positive vs. negative sentiment using Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine algorithms. Finally, phi contingency coefficients were computed between each of the categories to discover emergent patterns. ::: ::: Results: The most prevalent genres were first- and second-hand experience and opinion, and the most frequent themes were hookah, cessation, and pleasure. Sentiment toward tobacco was overall more positive (46% of tweets) than negative (32%) or neutral, even excluding the 9% of tweets categorized as marketing. Three separate metrics converged on supporting an emergent distinction between, on one hand, hookah and e-cigarettes corresponding to positive sentiment, and on the other hand, traditional tobacco products and more general references corresponding to negative sentiment. These metrics included correlations between categories in the content analysis scheme (hookah/positive = 0.39; e-cigarette/positive =0.19); correlations between search keywords and sentiment (chi-square= 414.50, df= 4, p < 0.001, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.36), and the most discriminating unigram features for positive and negative sentiment ranked by log-odds ratio in the machine learning component of the study. In the automated classification tasks, Support Vector Machines using a relatively small number of unigram features (500) achieved best performance in discriminating tobacco-related from unrelated tweets (F -score = 0.85). ::: ::: Conclusions: Novel insights available through Twitter for tobacco surveillance are attested through the high prevalence of positive sentiment. This positive sentiment is correlated in complex ways with social image, personal experience, and recently popular products such as hookah and e-cigarettes. Several apparent perceptual disconnects between these products and their health effects suggest opportunities for tobacco control education. Finally, machine classification of tobacco-related posts shows a promising edge over strictly keyword-based approaches (keyword accuracy=57%; NLP accuracy=82%), yielding an improved signal-to-noise ratio in Twitter data and paving the way for automated tobacco surveillance applications.

There exist four hypogene alteration types in Sungun: potassic, propylitic, potassic\u2013phyllic, and phyllic. Copper mineralization is essentially associated more with the potassic and less with the phyllic alterations and their separation is, therefore, quite important. This research has tried to separate these two alteration zones in Sungun porphyry copper deposit using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method based on the fluid inclusion data, and seven variables including homogenization temperatures, salinity, pressure, depth, density and the Cu grade have been measured and calculated for each separate sample. To apply this method, use is made of the radial basis function (RBF) as the kernel function. The best values for \u03bb and C (the most important SVM parameters) that perform well in the training and test data are 0.0001 and 1, respectively. If these values for \u03bb and C are applied, the phyllic and potassic alteration zones in the training and test data will be separated with an accuracy of about 95% and 100%, respectively.

Motivated by the above observations, we propose a new architecture coined as Gram-Net, which leverages global image texture representations for robust fake image detection. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that our Gram-Net outperforms existing approaches.

Furthermore, the properties of the network units conform in detail to the characteristics of recently discovered number-selective neurons. In a second study, we simulate symbol learning by presenting symbolic and nonsymbolic input simultaneously. The same number-selective neurons learn to represent the numerical meaning of symbols. In doing so, they show properties reminiscent of the originally available number-selective neurons, but at the same time, the representational efficiency of the neurons is increased when presented with symbolic input.

The present research develops this theory to provide a new account of the error-related negativity (ERN), a scalp potential observed following errors. Connectionist simulations of response conflict in an attentional task demonstrated that the ERN\u2014its timing and sensitivity to task parameters\u2014 can be explained in terms of the conflict theory. A new experiment confirmed predictions of this theory regarding the ERN and a second scalp potential, the N2, that is proposed to reflect conflict monitoring on correct response trials. Further analysis of the simulation data indicated that errors can be detected reliably on the basis of post-error conflict. It is concluded that the ERN can be explained in terms of response conflict and that monitoring for conflict may provide a simple mechanism for detecting errors. Errors are an important source of information in the regulation of cognitive processes. The mechanism by which people detect and correct their errors has been the object of study for many years, but research interest has increased in recent years following the discovery of neural correlates of performance monitoring. In particular, studies of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) have revealed a neural response following errors that has been labeled the errorrelated negativity (ERN or Ne; Falkenstein, Hohnsbein, Hoorman, & Blanke, 1990, 1991; Gehring, Goss, Coles, Meyer, & Donchin, 1993). The most likely neural generator of the ERN is anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an area that in recent years has been implicated in another function related to the evaluation of performance, monitoring for competition (or conflict) during information processing. The present research attempts to provide an integrative account of error- and conflict-related activity observed in anterior cingulate cortex. Specifically, we propose a new account of the ERN and error processing in terms of the conflict monitoring theory of anterior cingulate function.

However, the intrinsic structure of a hyperspectral image often depends on the specific scene and spectrometer, although regularizers like Ridge, LASSO, etc, have been widely used in practical applications. Instead of imposing these regularizers to the probabilistic output of a classifier, this work evaluates the use of extreme learning machines (ELM) with output weights of a single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) regularized with Ridge and LASSO priors, respectively. Experimental results with several real hyperspectral images are conducted to compare the performance and adaptation of these two regularizers with the the original ELM in classification scenarios.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518746", "venue": "IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "journal": "IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2901518346", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15589402", "15037168", "16775850", "13053338", "17030306", "44008632", "21075725", "6793216", "45200939", "16162039", "11927662", "114234187", "205907253"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53225980"}

We propose in this paper an incremental clustering algorithm based on \"growing neural gas\" (GNG), which addresses this issue by using a parameter-free adaptive threshold to produce representatives and a distance-based probabilistic criterion to eventually condense them. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with existing algorithms of the same family, while maintaining fewer representatives and being independent of sensitive parameters.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5220/0004256600420049", "venue": "ICPRAM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2404643725", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14153811", "6594181", "8763340", "6102896", "123120074", "41517545"], "inbound_citations": ["16672086", "6860700", "52984447", "41198843", "46959147", "18674128", "15110477", "15374904", "32340813", "29128044"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8890307"}

In fact, many other optimization techniques have been effectively used in dealing with data separation and analysis. For the last 10 years, the author and his colleagues have proposed and extended a series of optimization-based classification models via Multiple Criteria Linear Programming (MCLP) and Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP). These methods are different from statistics, decision tree induction, and neural networks. The purpose of this paper is to review the basic concepts and frameworks of these methods and promote the research interests in the data mining community. According to the evolution of multiple criteria programming, the paper starts with the bases of MCLP. Then, it further discusses penalized MCLP, MCQP, Multiple Criteria Fuzzy Linear Programming (MCFLP), Multi-Class Multiple Criteria Programming (MCMCP), and the kernel-based Multiple Criteria Linear Program, as well as MCLP-based regression.

Until now, there have been many studies focusing on English implicit discourse relations, and few studies address implicit relation recognition in Chinese even though the implicit discourse relations in Chinese are more common than those in English. In our work, both the English and Chinese languages are our focus. The key to implicit relation prediction is to properly model the semantics of the two discourse arguments, as well as the contextual interaction between them. To achieve this goal, we propose a neural network based framework that consists of two hierarchies. The first one is the model hierarchy, in which we propose a max-margin learning method to explore the implicit discourse relation from multiple views. The second one is the feature hierarchy, in which we learn multilevel distributed representations from words, arguments, and syntactic structures to sentences.

However, these records also contain personal health information (PHI) whose presence limits the use of the records outside of hospitals. The goal of de-identification is to remove all PHI from clinical records. This is a challenging task because many records contain foreign and misspelled PHI; they also contain PHI that are ambiguous with non-PHI. These complications are compounded by the linguistic characteristics of clinical records. For example, medical discharge summaries, which are studied in this paper, are characterized by fragmented, incomplete utterances and domain-specific language; they cannot be fully processed by tools designed for lay language. Methods and results: In this paper, we show that we can de-identify medical discharge summaries using a de-identifier, Stat De-id, based on support vector machines and local context (F-measure=97% on PHI). Our representation of local context aids de-identification even when PHI include out-of-vocabulary words and even when PHI are ambiguous with non-PHI within the same corpus. Comparison of Stat De-id with a rule-based approach shows that local context contributes more to de-identification than dictionaries combined with hand-tailored heuristics (F-measure=85%). Comparison with two well-known named entity recognition (NER) systems, SNoW (F-measure=94%) and IdentiFinder (F-measure=36%), on five representative corpora show that when the language of documents is fragmented, a system with a relatively thorough representation of local context can be a more effective de-identifier than systems that combine (relatively simpler) local context with global context. Comparison with a Conditional Random Field De-identifier (CRFD), which utilizes global context in addition to the local context of Stat De-id, confirms this finding (F-measure=88%) and establishes that strengthening the representation of local context may be more beneficial for de-identification than complementing local with global context.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2271040", "pubmed_id": "18053696", "doi": "10.1016/j.artmed.2007.10.001", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2156061936", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13562425", "1859951", "8815893", "5118729", "14737137", "59875328", "13512847", "17376480", "12965788", "20647719", "2753152", "8746850", "52874011", "194951", "13169886", "5216592", "5225930", "56522394", "60942280", "36744911", "14106352", "6930812"], "inbound_citations": ["177702", "466355", "31357898", "199448353", "41648152", "15141504", "189927975", "16524486", "18090012", "7050746", "210953562", "466607", "17552757", "3764197", "46368116", "205714105", "13580425", "1556054", "19976639", "9200098", "1839478", "3843092", "16843513", "1849790", "195820594", "17446955", "14054376", "20991827", "1969226", "15266848", "45360406", "150386281", "779017", "6402814", "14295591", "17768150", "10591498", "52092091", "14657216", "8407894", "17888160", "199448369", "29733003", "645616", "46949146", "11102236"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13931237"}

The severity of illness scores used are intended to be applicable to all patient populations, and generally evaluate in-hospital mortality. However, patients with sepsis continue to be at risk of death after hospital discharge. Objective To develop a model for predicting 1-year mortality in critical patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patients The data corresponding to 5650 admissions of patients with sepsis from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database were evaluated, randomly divided as follows: 70% for training and 30% for validation. Design A retrospective register-based cohort study was carried out. The clinical information of the first 24 h after admission was used to develop a 1-year mortality prediction model based on Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) methodology. Variable selection was addressed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and SGB variable importance methodologies. The predictive power was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Results An AUROC of 0.8039 (95% confidence interval (CI): [0.8033 0.8045]) was obtained in the validation subset. The model exceeded the predictive performances obtained with traditional severity of disease scores in the same subset. Conclusion The use of assembly algorithms, such as SGB, for the generation of a customized model for sepsis yields more accurate 1-year mortality prediction than the traditional scoring systems such as SAPS II, SOFA or OASIS.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30245121", "doi": "10.1016/j.medin.2018.07.016", "venue": "Medicina intensiva", "journal": "Medicina intensiva", "mag_id": "2889592693", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211056008"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52336614"}

To that end we start by dividing an image into multiple patches and modifying the role of the generative network from producing an entire image, at once, to creating a sparse representation vector for each image patch. We synthesize an entire image by multiplying generated sparse representations to a pre-trained dictionary and assembling the resulting patches. This approach restricts the output of the generator to a particular structure, obtained by imposing a Union of Subspaces (UoS) model to the original training data, leading to more realistic images, while maintaining a desired diversity. To further regularize GANs in generating high-quality images and to avoid the notorious mode-collapse problem, we introduce a third player in GANs, called reconstructor. This player utilizes an auto-encoding scheme to ensure that first, the input-output relation in the generator is injective and second each real image corresponds to some input noise.

Goethals et al. (2005) proposed a method based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) to identify the input-output relationship of the Hammerstein model. Unfortunately, as the data points grow, this kernel learning approach costs much time correspondingly. Besides, Goethals's technique is not suitable for the on-line identification. To this end, a recursive nonlinear identification method is proposed in this paper. The basic idea is to get the recursive form of the parts of the high-dimensional matrix arisen from the optimization derivation, and get the estimation with the trick of sub-inverse matrix. With this new LSSVM approach, the Hammerstein model can be obtained recursively and much quickly, which is crucial to industrial applications that require online estimation and prediction.

However, the heterogeneity among cross-view representations brings a significant challenge on mining the SCP. In this paper, we propose a general framework to discover the SCP for cross-view data. Specifically, aiming at building a feature-isomorphic space among different views, a novel Isomorphic Relevant Redundant Transformation (IRRT) isfirst proposed. The IRRT linearly maps multiple heterogeneous low-level feature spaces to a high-dimensional redundantfeature-isomorphic one, which we name as mid-level space. Thus, much more complementary information from different views can be captured. Furthermore, to mine the semantic consistency among the isomorphic representations in the mid-level space, we propose a new Correlation-based Joint Feature Learning (CJFL) model to extract a unique high-level semantic subspace shared across the feature-isomorphic data.

Feature selection algorithms are frequently adopted to remove non-informative and redundant features from the dataset before building the predictive models.

Importantly, building a model with the best subset of features can make it more interpretable and efficient. This paper proposes a novel feature selection algorithm which is based on the cultural meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. The modified Cultural Algorithm was developed and optimized for achieving high accuracy and Area Under the Curve. The quality of the selected features was assessed using the performance of a Support Vector Machine classifier. The proposed algorithm was tested on five benchmark datasets and achieved an average accuracy of 0.923 and an Area Under the Curve of 0.898 across all datasets.

This research demonstrates how supervised machine learning can be used to predict adults at risk for OUD by considering interactions between various demographic, socioeconomic, physical, and psychological features in an integrated manner. A labeled data set was built from the responses to the 2016 edition of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). This labeled data set was used to train and test a random forest classifier while accounting for class imbalance. The classifier can predict adults at risk for OUD accurately (sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.76, AUC = 0.86), although the prevalence of OUD is only about 1%. Early initiation of marijuana (prior to 18 years of age) emerges as the dominant predictor for developing OUD in adult life. This is surprising because it ranks higher than both mental illness and disability; two conditions that are often comorbid with substance use disorders. Thus, curbing early initiation of marijuana may be the best prevention strategy.

In US waters, snow crabs are found throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas surrounding Alaska, north of the Aleutian Islands, yet commercial harvest currently focuses on the more southerly population in the Bering Sea. Population dynamics are well-monitored in exploited areas, but few data exist for populations further north where climate trends in the Arctic appear to be affecting species\u2019 distributions and community structure on multiple trophic levels. Moreover, increased shipping traffic, as well as fisheries and petroleum resource development, may add additional pressures in northern portions of the range as seasonal ice cover continues to decline. In the face of these pressures, we examined the ecological niche and population distribution of snow crabs in Alaskan waters using a GIS-based spatial modeling approach. We present the first quantitative open-access model predictions of snow-crab distribution, abundance, and biomass in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Multi-variate analysis of environmental drivers of species\u2019 distribution and community structure commonly rely on multiple linear regression methods. The spatial modeling approach employed here improves upon linear regression methods in allowing for exploration of nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables. Three machine-learning algorithms were used to evaluate relationships between snow-crab distribution and environmental parameters, including TreeNet, Random Forests, and MARS. An ensemble model was then generated by combining output from these three models to generate consensus predictions for presence\u2013absence, abundance, and biomass of snow crabs. Each algorithm identified a suite of variables most important in predicting snow-crab distribution, including nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations in overlying waters, temperature, salinity, and annual sea-ice cover; this information may be used to develop and test hypotheses regarding the ecology of this species.

Our method establishes an adversarial game between a generator and two discriminators. The generator aims to generate a real-like fused image based on a specifically designed content loss to fool the two discriminators, while the two discriminators aim to distinguish the structure differences between the fused image and two source images, respectively, in addition to the content loss. Consequently, the fused image is forced to simultaneously keep the thermal radiation in the infrared image and the texture details in the visible image. Moreover, to fuse source images of different resolutions, e.g., a low-resolution infrared image and a high-resolution visible image, our DDcGAN constrains the downsampled fused image to have similar property with the infrared image. This can avoid causing thermal radiation information blurring or visible texture detail loss, which typically happens in traditional methods. In addition, we also apply our DDcGAN to fusing multi-modality medical images of different resolutions, e.g., a low-resolution positron emission tomography image and a high-resolution magnetic resonance image.

This paper proposes a novel scheme for accurate spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral image. It is based on random forests, followed by majority voting within the superpixels obtained by oversegmentation through a graph-based technique. The scheme combines the result of a pixel-wise RF classification and the segmentation map obtained by oversegmentation.

In this paper, we study the use of machine learning and WordNet-based classifiers to generate an interest profile from a user's tweets and use this to recommend loosely related Reddit threads which the reader is most likely to be interested in. We introduce a genre classification algorithm using a similarity measure derived from WordNet lexical database for English to label genres for nouns in tweets. The proposed algorithm generates a user's interest profile from their tweets based on a referencing taxonomy of genres derived from the genre-tagged Brown Corpus augmented with a technology genre. The top K genres of a user's interest profile can be used for recommending subreddit articles in those genres. Experiments using real life test cases collected from Twitter have been done to compare the performance on genre classification by using the WordNet classifier and machine learning classifiers such as SVM, Random Forests, and an ensemble of Bayesian classifiers. Empirically, we have obtained similar results from the two different approaches with a sufficient number of tweets. It seems that machine learning algorithms as well as the WordNet ontology are viable tools for developing recommendation engine based on genre classification. One advantage of the WordNet approach is simplicity and no learning is required.

Amplitude is always used, sometimes combined with phase or a noise measure. In our approach, we employ steady-state brief-onset low-contrast checkerboard stimulation and obtain amplitude and significance for six different check sizes, yielding 12 numbers. The rule-based \u201cheuristic algorithm\u201d (Bach et al. in Br J Ophthalmol 92:396\u2013403, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.2007.130245 ::: ) is successful in over 95% with a limit of agreement (LoA) of \u00b1 0.3LogMAR between behavioral and objective acuity for 109 cases. We here aimed to test whether machine learning techniques with this relatively small dataset could achieve a similar LoA. Given recent advances in machine learning (ML), we applied a wide class of ML algorithms to this dataset. This was done within the \u201ccaret\u201d framework of R using altogether 89 methods, of which rule-based and multiple regression approaches performed best. For cross-validation, using a jackknife (leave-one-out) approach, we predicted each case based on an ML model having been trained on all remaining 108 cases. The ML approach predicted visual acuity well across many different types of ML algorithms. Using amplitude values only (discarding the p values) improved the outcome. Nearly half of the tested ML algorithms achieved an LoA better than the heuristic algorithm; several \u201cRandom Forest\u201d- or \u201cmultiple regression\u201d-type algorithms achieved an LoA of below \u00b1 0.3. In the cases where the heuristic approach failed, acuity was predicted successfully. We then applied the ML model trained with the Bach et al.

The ML approach appears to be a useful alternative to rule-based analysis of acuity-VEP data.

Investigating changes in mangrove forests is essential for ecologists and forest managers to improve the assessment and conservation of natural ecosystems. The goals of the present study include: (I) to evaluate and compare four supervised classification algorithms based on Landsat time series imagery to detect mangrove cover in southern Iran, (II) to detect changes in mangrove cover between 1985, 1998, and 2017; and (III) to compare the four different predictions resulting from the applied classification algorithms. An accuracy assessment was conducted using k-fold cross-validation and independent validation, and differences between the classification techniques were analyzed. Although all four algorithms produced high overall accuracy (ranging from 81% to 93%) and Kappa values (from 0.81 to 0.92), visual comparisons of the predictions revealed that Random Forest (RF) performed best. The results of the change analysis showed that mangrove cover areas decreased by approximately 4% from 1985 to 1998 and then increased by approximately 8.9% from 1998 to 2017. A change detection map shows a decrease in mangrove cover in near coastal regions, such as the Tabl and Gavarzin areas, and an increase in mangrove cover at a distance from the Qeshm coastline that involves open spaces between the trees.

Facial expressions have been investigated in several species and grimace scales have been developed as pain assessment tool in many species including horses (HGS) and mice (MGS). This study is intended to progress the validation of grimace scales, by proposing a statistical approach to identify a classifier that can estimate the pain status of the animal based on Facial Action Units (FAUs) included in HGS and MGS. To achieve this aim, through a validity study, the relation between FAUs included in HGS and MGS and the real pain condition was investigated. A specific statistical approach (Cumulative Link Mixed Model, Inter-rater reliability, Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines) was applied to two datasets. Our results confirm the reliability of both scales and show that individual FAU scores of HGS and MGS are related to the pain state of the animal.

In this work, we propose the Multi-Scale Gradient Generative Adversarial Network (MSG-GAN), a simple but effective technique for addressing this problem which allows the flow of gradients from the discriminator to the generator at multiple scales. This technique provides a stable approach for generating synchronized multi-scale images. We present a very intuitive implementation of the mathematical MSG-GAN framework which uses the concatenation operation in the discriminator computations. We empirically validate the effect of our MSG-GAN approach through experiments on the CIFAR10 and Oxford102 flowers datasets and compare it with other relevant techniques which perform multi-scale image synthesis.

Furthermore, a multivariate correlation analysis of spectra features is performed to prevent the cross-sensitivity errors and to obtain a higher accuracy. Then, support vector machines with two different kernels, i.e., a polynomial function and a Gaussian radial basis function, are explored for the classification of all the samples.

First, an adaptive feature learning probability boosting tree (AFL-PBT) based on both simple handcrafted features and deep learned features was developed for prostate pre-segmentation and for further shape model initialization. The proposed AFL-PBT classifier also provided a boundary searching band, which made the ASM less sensitive to model initialization. Then, the convolutional neutral network (CNN) deep learning method was used to train a boundary model, which separated voxels into three types: near, inside, and outside the boundary. A three-level ASM based on the CNN boundary model was employed for the final segmentation refinement. On MICCAI PROMISE12 test data sets, the proposed method yielded a mean Dice score of 84% with a standard deviation of 4%.

Individual amino-acids are systematically mutated to alanine and changes in free energy of binding (\u0394\u0394G) measured. Several experiments have shown that protein-protein interactions are critically dependent on just a few residues (\"hot spots\") at the interface. Hot spots make a dominant contribution to the free energy of binding and if mutated they can disrupt the interaction. As mutagenesis studies require significant experimental efforts, there is a need for accurate and reliable computational methods. Such methods would also add to our understanding of the determinants of affinity and specificity in protein-protein recognition.ResultsWe present a novel computational strategy to identify hot spot residues, given the structure of a complex. We consider the basic energetic terms that contribute to hot spot interactions, i.e. van der Waals potentials, solvation energy, hydrogen bonds and Coulomb electrostatics. We treat them as input features and use machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes to optimally combine and integrate them, based on a set of training examples of alanine mutations. We show that our approach is effective in predicting hot spots and it compares favourably to other available methods. In particular we find the best performances using Transductive Support Vector Machines, a semi-supervised learning scheme. When hot spots are defined as those residues for which \u0394\u0394G \u2265 2 kcal/mol, our method achieves a precision and a recall respectively of 56% and 65%.ConclusionWe have developed an hybrid scheme in which energy terms are used as input features of machine learning models.

Standard combining methods do not improve local classifiers (e.g. k-nearest neighbors) due to their low sensitivity to data perturbation. Here, we propose an adaptive attribute boosting technique to coalesce multiple local classifiers each using different relevant attribute information. In addition, a modification of boosting method is developed for heterogeneous spatial databases with unstable driving attributes by drawing spatial blocks of data at each boosting round. To reduce the computational costs of k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers, a novel fast k-NN algorithm is designed. The adaptive attribute boosting applied to real life spatial data and artificial spatial data show observable improvements in prediction accuracy for both local and global classifiers when unstable driving attributes are present in the data.

The 15 most influential variables were selected for inclusion in a reduced model. Model performance estimating risk of CIN and new requirement for dialysis (NRD) was evaluated in an independent validation dataset using area under the ROC curve (AUC), with net reclassification improvement (NRI) used to compare full and reduced model CIN prediction after grouping in low, intermediate, and high risk categories. ::: ::: Results: Our study cohort was comprised of 68,573 PCI procedures performed at 46 hospitals between January 2010 and June 2012 in Michigan of which 48,001 (70%) were randomly selected for training the models, and 20,572 (30%) for validation.

This study presents a random forest classification approach for the retrieval of the wetland landcover in the arid regions by fusing the Pleiade-1B data with multi-date Landsat-8 data. The segmentation of the Pleiade-1B multispectral image data was performed based on an object-oriented approach, and the geometric and spectral features were extracted for the segmented image objects. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) series data were also calculated from the multi-date Landsat-8 data, reflecting vegetation phenological changes in its growth cycle. The feature set extracted from the two sensors data was optimized and employed to create the random forest model for the classification of the wetland landcovers in the Ertix River in northern Xinjiang, China. Comparison with other classification methods such as support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers indicates that the random forest classifier can achieve accurate classification with an overall accuracy of 93% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.92.

The inclusion of phenological information in the classification enables the classification errors being reduced down, and the overall accuracy was improved approximately 10%.

This task is particularly relevant for supporting forensic investigation as documents may contain criminal evidence. As an alternative to the laborious and time-consuming manual process, several researchers have been investigating ways to perform automatic digital reconstruction. A central problem in automatic reconstruction of shredded documents is the pairwise compatibility evaluation of the shreds, notably for binary text documents. In this context, deep learning has enabled great progress for accurate reconstructions in the domain of mechanically-shredded documents. A sensitive issue, however, is that current deep model solutions require an inference whenever a pair of shreds has to be evaluated. This work proposes a scalable deep learning approach for measuring pairwise compatibility in which the number of inferences scales linearly (rather than quadratically) with the number of shreds. Instead of predicting compatibility directly, deep models are leveraged to asymmetrically project the raw shred content onto a common metric space in which distance is proportional to the compatibility.

Unlike traditional channels, governed by centralized entities, blockchain offers its users a certain level of anonymity by providing capabilities to interact without disclosing their personal identities and allows them to build trust without a third-party governing entity. Due to the aforementioned characteristics of blockchain, more and more users around the globe are inclined towards making a digital transaction via blockchain than via rudimentary channels.

To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30504014", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.223", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2901247273", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["153800860", "16101225", "54826109", "155979307", "206645956", "85177528", "126577032", "129886831", "129521073", "49292340", "3846924", "133805845", "85389538", "157325268", "62973643", "90488154", "4092177", "4479730", "19244832", "107119039", "7738593", "52062426", "4588112", "30899240", "129096397", "121404510", "157570199", "18801194", "128544801", "12536188", "106917152", "127784606", "37260208", "17707587", "4040658", "18149730", "49526465", "30978684"], "inbound_citations": ["211209113", "199365800", "201303733", "200066957"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56148855"}

The new framework strategy is expected to not only take fully into account the structural information of the training data, but also partition the training data into more meaningful groups. To prove the advantage of the framework, in particular, we adopt two simplest feature selection methods, i.e. F-score and Laplacian score methods, to select the features, then apply a recently proposed clustering technique to get a better partition of training data by the selected features, in which the number of clusters could be found automatically. Three major contributions of this paper can be concluded as: (1) improving the performance of the existing SVM+ classifier; (2) extracting the potential structural information of the training data by using more feature attributes instead of one; (3) replacing the truncation method in SVM+ with a clustering technique.

Both approaches attempt to identify salient characteristics of the stress systems under examination without reference to the workings of the underlying processor. Our theory and computer simulations exhibit some strikingly suggestive correspondences with metrical theory. We show, however, that our high-level pseudo-linguistic account bears no causal relation to processing in the perceptron, and provides little insight into the nature of this processing. Because of the persuasive similarities between the nature of our theory and linguistic theorizing, we suggest that linguistic theory may be in much the same position.

Previous studies have shown that somatic genetic alterations are associated with clinicopathological features of cancers, and array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) analysis is an excellent tool for providing detailed genetic profiles of a tumour from archival material. In this study we performed aCGH analysis on 116 primary stage III/IV serous ovarian adenocarcinomas and used a combined univariate and iterative SVM-based approach to identify regions of chromosomal alteration whose copy number status is associated with survival. Cases were stratified according to survival probability (Pr), identifying 39 good survivors (Pr 0.67). We then identified genomic regions of either common gain/loss in all 116 cases, or in which copy number status differed between the extremes of survival. A sub-set of data from these regions in the 78 cases at the extreme ends of survival was supplied to an iterative Support Vector Machine (SVM) routine, which ranked regions by their contribution to accurate survival classification and refined their boundaries. Hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed the potential of the minimal intervals of these regions to predict survival. A SVM was then validated with independent data and shown to be able to accurately classify survival. The highest-ranked chromosome regions contain candidate genes that may represent prognostic markers and/or therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. One region, containing the CCNE1 gene, is frequently amplified in tumours and has recently been shown to be a prognostic marker for ovarian cancer in other studies. Other regions contain genes involved in pathways that stimulate ovarian cancer cell growth, motility and drug resistance. This study demonstrates the power of tumour profiling in cancer samples to identify prognostic signatures and clues to the underlying biology of tumour development, if the study design is rigorous in the selection of tightly stratified patient subgroups and in the application of the correct computational methodologies. These results require validation in larger sample sizes; but the ability to perform whole genomic profiling in formalin fixed tissues and the establishment of consortia to bring together multiple studies (e.g. the international ovarian cancer association consortium) makes this possible.

Our approach employs automatic relation extraction via statistical co-occurrence of words in a given text collection. We extract relations in the form of word-word proximity matrix and then use the matrix elements as correction factors for the Bag-of-words text representation.

Therefore, in this study, a low cost, real time driver's drowsiness detection system is developed with acceptable accuracy. In the developed system, a webcam records the video and driver's face is detected in each frame employing image processing techniques. Facial landmarks on the detected face are pointed and subsequently the eye aspect ratio, mouth opening ratio and nose length ratio are computed and depending on their values, drowsiness is detected based on developed adaptive thresholding.

Being able to run the algorithms in advance can be a possible solution. However, we do not know which algorithm to run on a given dataset before it is actually used. It is possible to manually insert matching rules for preprocessing algorithms, but it requires high maintenance and does not work well in practice. This paper presents a dynamic machine learning solution for predicting which advanced visualization (AV) algorithm needs to be applied on a given series. The system gets a handful of free text DICOM tags as an input and builds a model in the clinical setting. It incorporates a Bag of Words (BOW) feature extractor and a Random Forest classifier. The approach was tested on two datasets from clinical sites which use different languages and varying scanner models. We show that even without feature extraction, sensitivity of above 90% can be reached on both of them. By using BOW feature extractor, precision and sensitivity can usually be further improved. Even on a noisy and highly unbalanced dataset, only around 100 samples were needed to reach sensitivity of above 80% and specificity of above 97%. We show how the solution can be part of a Smart Preprocessing mechanism in a viewing software. Using such a system will ultimately minimize the time to launch studies and improve radiologists reading time efficiency.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5788832", "pubmed_id": "28762098", "doi": "10.1007/s10278-017-9999-9", "venue": "Journal of Digital Imaging", "journal": "Journal of Digital Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2740261201", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3077937", "89141", "14517044", "63115125", "15245447", "337049", "14454728", "2578504"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3238829"}

Support Vector Machines trained on HOG features are now an object detection standard in many perception fields and have demonstrated good performance on medical images as well. However, the computational complexity and lack of robustness brought by rescaling the original images have prevented its applicability. The proposed multistage detection framework uses lower-level detection result to determine the rescaling regions to reduce the region of interest, thereby decreasing the execution time. We further refine the detection result by segmenting the contour of vertebra using GVF snake, where we use edge detection techniques to increase the robustness of the GVF snake. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework using a large set of clinical X-ray images.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28268506", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590884", "venue": "Conference proceedings : ...

An Extended Kalman Filter pose estimation method was used to estimate kinematic joint variables, and time domain features were generated based on these variables. The most important features were then selected and used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree classifiers. The results of feature selection highlight the importance of the ankle internal rotation (IR) angle in classifying SLS.

Although there are several methods for quantitative determination of AFP, compared with these methods, the gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA)has the advantages of easy to handle, low costs, quick, no requirement for skilled technicians and most important, well suitable for point-of-care measurements. However, GICA mostly has been used for qualitative or semi-quantitative detection visually. This paper presents a rapid quantitative determination method of AFP with GICA strip based on the reflective optical detection. Under the driving of the micro-stepper motor, we can get a curve of GICA strip signal distribution. Then after segmentation of the test line and control line using fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, the features were extracted to be as the input features of Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. SVR was used for prediction of the AFP concentration. To evaluate the reliability and accuracy of GICA for fast quantitatively determination of AFP and its clinical value, the AFP concentration of specimen was tested by GICA and chemiluminescent immunoassay analyzer, and analyzed the coincident rate and correlation of these two methods. The experiment results demonstrated that the correlation coefficient results between the two methods was 0.961. The test results showed that the SVR model yields a good result and is proved to be appropriate in quantitative determination of AFP with GICA strip.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4304/jcp.7.12.2868-2875", "venue": "JCP", "journal": "JCP", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1977589549", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206100640", "3669603", "9821861", "38115882", "32891618", "24212865", "25009450", "27896726", "483685", "30481382", "24486033", "94930612", "25216774", "7138354", "94433066"], "inbound_citations": ["53095990", "1355335", "215592208", "10743822"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15790863"}

Current challenges include temporal data streams, drift and non-stationary scenarios, often with text data, whether in social networks or in business systems. Various efforts have been pursued in machine learning settings to learn in such environments, specially because of their non-trivial nature, since changes occur between the distribution data used to define the model and the current environment. In this work we present the Drift Adaptive Retain Knowledge (DARK) framework to tackle adaptive learning in dynamic environments based on recent and retained knowledge. DARK handles an ensemble of multiple Support Vector Machine (SVM) models that are dynamically weighted and have distinct training window sizes. A comparative study with benchmark solutions in the field, namely the Learn++.NSE algorithm, is also presented. Experimental results revealed that DARK outperforms Learn++.NSE with two different base classifiers, an SVM and a Classification and Regression Tree (CART).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2017.08.004", "venue": "Eng.
