In this study, facial landmark points are detected and tracked over successive video frames using a robust method based on subspace regularization, Kalman prediction and refinement. The trajectories (time series) of facial landmark positions during the course of the head gesture or facial expression are organized in a spatiotemporal matrix and discriminative features are extracted from the trajectory matrix. Alternatively, appearance based features are extracted from DCT coefficients of several face patches. Finally Adaboost algorithm is performed to learn a set of discriminating spatiotemporal DCT features for face and head gesture (FHG) classification.

With $f$-divergence as the objective function, the discriminator essentially estimates the density ratio, and the estimated ratio proves useful in further improving the sample quality of the generator. However, how to leverage the information contained in the discriminator of Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) is less explored. In this paper, we introduce the Discriminator Contrastive Divergence, which is well motivated by the property of WGAN's discriminator and the relationship between WGAN and energy-based model. Compared to standard GANs, where the generator is directly utilized to obtain new samples, our method proposes a semi-amortized generation procedure where the samples are produced with the generator's output as an initial state.

Our rule extraction method is based on a special Multi Layer Perceptron architecture for which axis-parallel hyperplanes are precisely located.

The target is to make the designed architecture feasible for an embedded platform based FER system so that it could assist in monitoring patients in hospitals. Thus, in the context of architectural design, the challenge here is to achieve classification accuracy equivalent to the software-based implementation with a multi-fold improvement in the execution speed. The acceleration in the execution speed of the designed classifier is achieved utilizing the parallelism and the pipelining concepts of the VLSI architecture design. Moreover, to reduce the computational cost and to further boost the execution speed of the architecture, we have adopted the fixed-point data format (Q24.16) in our design. We have trained the classifier offline and then used the designed architecture with learned parameters to perform testing on the hardware. The designed architecture after synthesis operates at a maximum clock frequency of 241.55 MHz on Xilinx ML510 FPGA platform. Classification accuracy of 98.50% equivalent to its software counterpart has been achieved on simulating the designed architecture with different test images.

Based on the generation of superpixels and their boundary feature analysis, the proposed method adaptively divides SAR image into different parts, namely, homogeneous regions, heterogeneous regions, and edges. In homogeneous regions, the regional-level CRF is defined on superpixels, and the pixels within each superpixel force to have the same segmentation label. Oppositely, the pixel-level CRF is defined on pixels within heterogeneous regions or edges, and local autocovariance features are extracted for constructing the unary and pairwise potentials to incorporate effective local contextual information. The integration of regional-level and pixel-level CRFs gives the proposed AHCRF model, and it is validated by experiments on several real SAR images.

It is an important and long-standing problem in data integration and data mining. So far progresses have been made mainly in the form of model improvements, where models with better accuracy are developed when large amounts of training data is available. In real-world applications we find that advanced approaches can often require too many labeled examples that is expensive to obtain, which has become a key obstacle to wider adoption. We in this work take a different tack, proposing a transfer-learning approach to EM, leveraging pre-trained EM models from large-scale, production knowledge bases (KB). Specifically, for each entity-type in KB, (e.g., location, organization, people, etc.), we use rich synonymous names of known entities in the KB as training data, to pre-train type-detection and EM models for each type, using a novel hierarchical neural network architecture we develop. Given a new EM task, with little or no training data, we can either fine-tune or directly leverage pre-trained EM models, to build end-to-end, high-quality EM systems.

In this paper, we investigate constructing of RFs with a small size of labeled data and find that the performance bottleneck is located in the node splitting procedures; hence, existing solutions fail to properly partition the feature space if there are insufficient training data. To achieve robust node splitting with insufficient data, we present semisupervised splitting to overcome this limitation by splitting nodes with the guidance of both labeled and abundant unlabeled data. In particular, an accurate quality measure of node splitting is obtained by carrying out the kernel-based density estimation, whereby a multiclass version of asymptotic mean integrated squared error criterion is proposed to adaptively select the optimal bandwidth of the kernel. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, we project the data points from the original high-dimensional feature space onto a low-dimensional subspace before estimation. A unified optimization framework is proposed to select a coupled pair of subspace and separating hyperplane such that the smoothness of the subspace and the quality of the splitting are guaranteed simultaneously. Our algorithm efficiently avoids overfitting caused by bad initialization and local maxima when compared with conventional margin maximization-based semisupervised methods.

To address this problem, we first construct an integrated graph of a set of bipartite graphs to build a connection among different tasks. We then propose a non-negative matrix factorization-based multitask method (MTNMF) to learn a common semantic feature space underlying different heterogeneous feature spaces of each task. Moreover, an improved version of MTNMF (IMTNMF) is proposed, in which we do not need to construct the correlation matrix between input features and class labels, avoiding the information loss. Finally, based on the common semantic features and original heterogeneous features, we model the heterogenous MTL problem as a multitask multiview learning (MTMVL) problem.

Knowledge about the nature of PPIs can help fill the widening gap between sequence information and functional annotations. Although experimental methods have produced valuable PPI data, they also suffer from significant limitations. Computational PPI prediction methods have attracted tremendous attentions. Despite considerable efforts, PPI prediction is still in its infancy in complex multicellular organisms such as humans. Here, we propose a novel ensemble learning method, LocFuse, which is useful in human PPI prediction. This method uses eight different genomic and proteomic features along with four types of different classifiers. The prediction performance of this classifier selection method was found to be considerably better than methods employed hitherto. This confirms the complex nature of the PPI prediction problem and also the necessity of using biological information for classifier fusion. The LocFuse is available at: http://lbb.ut.ac.ir/Download/LBBsoft/LocFuse . Biological significance The results revealed that if we divide proteome space according to the cellular localization of proteins, then the utility of some classifiers in PPI prediction can be improved. Therefore, to predict the interaction for any given protein pair, we can select the most accurate classifier with regard to the cellular localization information.

The proposed method includes three steps. First, a CNN model is trained by massive labeled samples in the source domain. Then the CNN model is fine-tuned by a few labeled samples in the target domain. Finally, the CNN model is trained with both a large number of unlabeled samples and the limited labeled samples in the target domain to minimize the MK-MMD loss. Experiments investigate detailed configurations and parameters of the proposed STL method with several frequently used CNN structures including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.

The estimation accuracy of the gravity disturbance data is verified by numerical tests. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the ELM estimation method can be improved by 23% and 44% compared with the bilinear interpolation method in plain and mountain areas, respectively. To further validate the proposed gravity compensation method, field experiments with an experimental vehicle were carried out in two regions. Test 1 was carried out in a plain area and Test 2 in a mountain area. The field experiment results also prove that the proposed gravity compensation method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy.

This sometimes requires the combination of several techniques to obtain the desired results for different applications. This work presents and compares two different approaches for segmenting and classifying 3D urban point clouds. In the first approach, detection, segmentation and classification of urban objects from 3D point clouds, converted into elevation images, are performed by using mathematical morphology. First, the ground is segmented and objects are detected as discontinuities on the ground. Then, connected objects are segmented using a watershed approach. Finally, objects are classified using SVM (Support Vector Machine) with geometrical and contextual features. The second method employs a super-voxel based approach in which the 3D urban point cloud is first segmented into voxels and then converted into super-voxels. These are then clustered together using an efficient link-chain method to form objects. These segmented objects are then classified using local descriptors and geometrical features into basic object classes. Evaluated on a common dataset (real data), both these methods are thoroughly compared on three different levels: detection, segmentation and classification. After analyses, simple strategies are also presented to combine the two methods, exploiting their complementary strengths and weaknesses, to improve the overall segmentation and classification results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-27702-8_14", "venue": "FSR", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1157745351", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8396595", "18561280", "15754143", "7234166", "117863033", "10972230", "2646667", "14934755", "161550", "18388296", "864129", "883157", "10128146", "8701858", "6548426", "6362060", "15271577", "14727924", "1514824", "36992239", "18010225", "849935"], "inbound_citations": ["144207769", "134959297", "54731866", "51922626", "209473156", "33956631"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4933926"}

In this paper, a novel pattern recognition model is presented for automatic epilepsy diagnosis. Wavelet transform is investigated to decompose EEG into five EEG frequency bands which approximate to delta (\u03b4), theta (\u03b8), alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), and gamma (\u03b3) bands. Complexity based features such as permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), and the Hurst exponent (HE) are extracted from both the original EEG signals and each of the frequency bands. The wavelet-based methodology separates the alterations in PE, SampEn, and HE in specific frequency bands of the EEG. The effectiveness of these complexity based measures in discriminating between normal brain state and brain state during the absence of seizures is evaluated using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). It is discovered that although there exists no significant differences in the feature values extracted from the original EEG signals, differences can be recognized when the features are examined within specific EEG frequency bands. A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to choose feature subsets that are effective for enhancing the recognition performance. The GA is also examined for weight alteration for both sensitivity and specificity.

Traditional detection algorithms are based on sliding-window searching and shallow-learning-based features, which limits the ability to represent features and generates a lot of computational costs. Recently, with the successful application of convolutional neural network in computer vision, many state-of-the-art detectors have been developed based on deep CNNs. However, these CNN-based models still face some difficulties and challenges in vehicle detection in aerial images. Firstly, the CNN-based detection model requires extensive calculations during training and detection, and the accuracy of detection for small objects is not high. In addition, deep learning models often require a large amount of sample data to train a robust detection model, while the annotated data of aerial vehicles is limited. In this study, we propose a lightweight deep convolutional neural network detection model named LD-CNNs. The detection algorithm not only greatly reduces the computational costs of the model, but also significantly improves the accuracy of the detection. What's more, in order to cope with the problem of insufficient training samples, we develop a multi-condition constrained generative adversarial network named MC-GAN, which can effectively generate samples. The detection performance of the proposed model has been evaluated on the Munich public dataset and the collected dataset respectively. The results show that on the Munich dataset, the proposed method achieves 86.9% on mAP (mean average precision), F1-score is 0.875, and the detection time is 1.64s on Nvidia Titan XP.

Aiming at coping with this drawback, lots of efforts have been made to post-edit those errors either manually or automatically. Manual post-editing is more accurate but can be prohibitive when too many changes have to be made. Automatic post-editing demands less effort but can also be less effective and give rise to new errors. A way to avoid unnecessary automatic post-editing and new errors is by previously selecting only the machine-translated segments that really need to be post-edited. Thus, this paper describes the experiments carried out to automatically identify MT errors generated by a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system. Despite the fact that our experiments have been carried out using a statistical MT engine, we believe the approach can also be applied to other types of MT systems. The experiments investigated the well-known machine-learning algorithms Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines. Using the decision tree algorithm it was possible to identify wrong segments with around 77 % precision and recall when a small training corpus of only 2,147 error instances was used.

To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient implementation of LSVM, termed profile SVM (PSVM). PSVM partitions the training examples into clusters and builds a separate linear SVM model for each cluster.

The caption is comprised of a sequence of words describing the interactive movement between two people, and the action is a captured sequence of poses representing the movement.

An underlying assumption in those models is that the state sequences (tags), observed or latent, take their values from a set of nominal categories. These nominal categories typically indicate tag classes (e.g., part-of-speech tags) or clusters of similar measurements. However, in some sequence modeling settings it is more reasonable to assume that the tags indicate ordinal categories or ranks. Dynamic envelopes of sequences such as emotions or movements often exhibit intensities growing from neutral, through raising, to peak values. In this work we propose a new model family, Hidden Conditional Ordinal Random Fields (HCORFs), that explicitly models sequence dynamics as the dynamics of ordinal categories. We formulate those models as generalizations of ordinal regressions to structured (here sequence) settings. We show how classification of entire sequences can be formulated as an instance of learning and inference in H-CORFs. In modeling the ordinal-scale latent variables, we incorporate recent binning-based strategy used for static ranking approaches, which leads to a log-nonlinear model that can be optimized by efficient quasi-Newton or stochastic gradient type searches.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a more meaningful performance measure for the imbalanced distribution problem. To tackle the problem as well as to make samples from different modalities directly comparable, a CML method is presented by directly maximizing AUC. The method can be further extended to focus on optimizing partial AUC (pAUC), which is the AUC between two specific false positive rates (FPRs). This is particularly useful in certain applications where only the performances assessed within predefined false positive ranges are critical. The proposed method is formulated as a log-determinant regularized semidefinite optimization problem. For efficient optimization, a minibatch proximal point algorithm is developed.

This study proposes a new method to fuse SAR and optical images, which is expected to be visually helpful and minimize the differences between two imaging mechanisms. The algorithm performs the fusion by establishing relationships between SAR and multispectral (MS) images by using a random forest (RF) regression, which creates a fused SAR image containing the surface roughness characteristics of the SAR image and the spectral characteristics of the MS image. The fused SAR image is evaluated by comparing it to those obtained using conventional image fusion methods and the proposed method shows that the spectral qualities and spatial qualities are improved significantly. Furthermore, for verification, other ensemble approaches such as stochastic gradient boosting regression and adaptive boosting regression are compared and overall it is confirmed that the performance of RF regression is superior. Then, change detection between the fused SAR and MS images is performed and compared with the results of change detection between MS images and between SAR images and the result using fused SAR images is similar to the result with MS images and is improved when compared to the result between SAR images.

Moreover it shows public acceptance and new user-friendly capture devices are developed and used in a broadened range of applications. Currently, iris recognition systems work well with frontal iris images from cooperative users. Nonideal iris images are still a challenge for iris recognition and can significantly affect the accuracy of iris recognition systems. Moreover, accurate localization of different eye\u2019s parts from videos or still images is a crucial step in many image processing applications that range from iris recognition in Biometrics to gaze estimation for Human Computer Interaction (HCI), impaired people aid or, even, marketing analysis for products attractiveness. Notwithstanding this, actually, most of available implementations for eye\u2019s parts segmentation are quite invasive, imposing a set of constraints both on the environment and on the user itself limiting their applicability to high security Biometrics or to cumbersome interfaces. In the first part of this Chapter, we propose a novel approach to segment the sclera, the white part of the eye. We concentrate on this area since, thanks to the dissimilarity with other eye\u2019s parts, its identification can be performed in a robust way against light variations, reflections and glasses lens flare. An accurate sclera segmentation is a fundamental step in iris and pupil localization, even in non-frontal noisy images. Furthermore its particular geometry can be fruitfully used for accurate eyeball rotation estimation. The proposed technique is based on a statistical approach (supported by some heuristic assumptions) to extract discriminating descriptors for sclera and non-sclera pixels. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then used as a final supervised classifier. Once the eyeball rotation angle respect to the camera optical axis is estimated and the limbus (the boundary between the iris and the sclera) is extracted, we propose a method to correct off-angle iris image. Taking into account the eye morphology and the reflectance properties of the external transparent layers, we can evaluate the distorting effects that are present in the acquired image. The correction algorithm proposed includes a first modeling phase of the human eye and a simulation phase where the acquisition geometry is reproduced and the distortions are evaluated. Finally we obtain an image which does not contain the distorting effects due to jumps in the refractive index. We show how this correction process reduces the intra-class variations for off-angle iris images.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-04039-4_12", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computational Vision and Biomechanics", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Computational Vision and Biomechanics", "mag_id": "983393707", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["70254056"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60755559"}

We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based transfer learning method to ease these problems. The proposed TH-GAN architecture includes a discriminator and a generator. The network structure of the discriminator is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Inspired by Wasserstein GAN, the loss function of the discriminator aims to measure the probabilistic distribution distance of the generated images and the target images. The network structure of the generator is a CNN based encoder-decoder. The loss function of the generator aims to minimize the distribution distance between the real samples and the generated samples. In order to preserve the complex glyph structure of a historical Chinese character, a weighted mean squared error (MSE) criterion by incorporating both the edge and the skeleton information in the ground truth image is proposed as the weighted pixel loss in the generator. These loss functions are used for joint training of the discriminator and the generator. Experiments are conducted on two tasks to evaluate the performance of the proposed TH-GAN.

We assessed the utility of these urine steroid profiles in detecting ACC recurrence, either when interpreted by expert clinicians, or when analyzed by Random Forest, a machine learning-based classifier. Radiological recurrence detection served as the reference standard. ::: RESULTS Imaging detected recurrent disease in 42 of 135 patients; 32 had provided pre- and post-recurrence urine samples. 39 patients remained disease-free for \u22653 years. The urine \"steroid fingerprint\" at recurrence resembled that observed before R0 resection in the majority of cases. Review of longitudinally collected urine steroid profiles by three blinded experts detected recurrence by the time of radiological diagnosis in 50-72% of cases, improving to 69-92%, if a pre-operative urine steroid result was available. Recurrence detection by steroid profiling preceded detection by imaging by more than 2 months in 22-39% of patients. Specificities varied considerably, ranging from 61 to 97%.

Existing predicting approaches formulate cloud resource provisioning as a regression problem, and aim to achieve the minimal prediction error. However, the resource demand is often time-variant and highly unstable, the regression-based techniques can not achieve a good performance when the demand changes sharply. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a framework of predicting the sharply changed demand of cloud resource to reduce the VM provisioning cost. In this framework, we first formulate the cloud resource demands prediction as a classification problem and then propose a robust prediction approach by combining Piecewise Linear Representation and Weighted Support Vector Machine techniques.

We identify and implement a diverse set of features which are relevant for the identification of biomedical entities and classification of them into some predefined categories. One most important criterion of these features is that these are identified and selected largely without using any domain knowledge.

The GA based feature selection algorithm produces best population that can be used to generate different classification models based on CRF and SVM.

Thirty-one volunteers, including 14 adults clinically diagnosed with MDD and 17 healthy adults, participated in the study. Brain oxyhemodynamic (HbO) responses were recorded using a 16-channel wearable continuous-wave fNIRS device while the volunteers performed the Grasp and Release Test in four 16-minute blocks. Ten features, extracted from HbO signals, from each channel served as inputs to XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms developed for each block and combination of successive blocks. Top 5 common features resulted in a classification accuracy of 92.6%, sensitivity of 84.8%, and specificity of 91.7% using the XGBoost classifier. This study identified mean HbO, full width half maximum and kurtosis, as specific neuromarkers, for predicting MDD across specific depression-related regions of interests (i.e., dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). Our results suggest that a wearable fNIRS head probe monitoring specific brain regions, and limiting extraction to few features, can enable quick setup and rapid assessment of depression in patients.

Traditional mammography and Tissue Microarray has been studied for early cancer detection and cancer prediction. However, there is a need for more reliable diagnostic tools for early detection of breast cancer. This can be a challenge due to a number of factors and logistics. First, obtaining tissue biopsies can be difficult. Second, mammography may not detect small tumors, and is often unsatisfactory for younger women who typically have dense breast tissue. Lastly, breast cancer is not a single homogeneous disease but consists of multiple disease states, each arising from a distinct molecular mechanism and having a distinct clinical progression path which makes the disease difficult to detect and predict in early stages.ResultsIn the paper, we present a Support Vector Machine based on Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross Validation (SVM-RFE-CV) algorithm for early detection of breast cancer in peripheral blood and show how to use SVM-RFE-CV to model the classification and prediction problem of early detection of breast cancer in peripheral blood.The training set which consists of 32 health and 33 cancer samples and the testing set consisting of 31 health and 34 cancer samples were randomly separated from a dataset of peripheral blood of breast cancer that is downloaded from Gene Express Omnibus. First, we identified the 42 differentially expressed biomarkers between \"normal\" and \"cancer\". Then, with the SVM-RFE-CV we extracted 15 biomarkers that yield zero cross validation score. Lastly, we compared the classification and prediction performance of SVM-RFE-CV with that of SVM and SVM Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE).ConclusionsWe found that 1) the SVM-RFE-CV is suitable for analyzing noisy high-throughput microarray data, 2) it outperforms SVM-RFE in the robustness to noise and in the ability to recover informative features, and 3) it can improve the prediction performance (Area Under Curve) in the testing data set from 0.5826 to 0.7879. Further pathway analysis showed that the biomarkers are associated with Signaling, Hemostasis, Hormones, and Immune System, which are consistent with previous findings. Our prediction model can serve as a general model for biomarker discovery in early detection of other cancers.

Moreover, suitable kernel parameters can also be selected at the same time.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CGIV.2009.35", "venue": "2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization", "journal": "2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2137862631", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28637672", "8535397", "6780654", "9294768", "14222558", "38921681", "961425", "30199806"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14814241"}

CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id":

The support vector machine (SVM) approach is introduced into building a regressive function for calculating the ac resistance of layered windings.

This pre-processing is introduced to minimize the challenges due to the variations in illumination and unconstrained face expression recognition. Further, by making use of directional information and ternary pattern the emotion-related features are extracted from the face. The proposed multi-level histogram features extracted from the ternary face code technique delivers the finer grain description of facial emotions to improve the facial expression performance under various illumination conditions.

Deep-level grammatical and semantic analysis usually uses words as the basic unit, and word segmentation is usually the primary task of NLP. In order to solve the practical problem of huge structural differences between different data modalities in a multi-modal environment and traditional machine learning methods cannot be directly applied, this paper introduces the feature extraction method of deep learning and applies the ideas of deep learning to multi-modal feature extraction. This paper proposes a multi-modal neural network. For each mode, there is a multilayer sub-neural network with an independent structure corresponding to it. It is used to convert the features in different modes to the same-modal features. In terms of word segmentation processing, in view of the problems that existing word segmentation methods can hardly guarantee long-term dependency of text semantics and long training prediction time, a hybrid network English word segmentation processing method is proposed. This method applies BI-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) to English word segmentation, and uses the CRF (Conditional Random Field) model to annotate sentences in sequence, effectively solving the long-distance dependency of text semantics, shortening network training and predicted time. Experiments show that the processing effect of this method on word segmentation is similar to that of BI-LSTM-CRF (Bidirectional- Long Short Term Memory-Conditional Random Field) model, but the average predicted processing speed is 1.94 times that of BI-LSTM-CRF, effectively improving the efficiency of word segmentation processing.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974101", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3006156918", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52954870", "53281798", "199440252", "167219018", "51610194", "155092998", "195442791", "197435052", "196199022", "196192802", "214100970", "207959195", "22901106", "202820637", "51614548", "53030374", "58672254", "140328482", "3285833", "3309996", "29150604", "10007434", "195832819", "132907468", "132020160", "56598777", "189991835", "29473256", "18533219", "1841036", "3332126", "25847742", "539875", "3721258", "208007605", "51698594", "199619454", "41505656", "125732814"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213183574"}

Such models that combine the best properties of different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in a single package are very much required in the process of reservoir characterization in petroleum engineering, where a high degree of prediction accuracy is essential for efficient exploration, and management of oil and gas resources. In this paper, we have successfully predicted, with higher accuracy, the porosity and permeability of oil and gas reservoirs through the hybridization of Type-2 Fuzzy Logic (FL), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Functional Networks (FN), using several real-life well log data. While utilizing the capabilities of data mining and CI, two hybrid models (FFS and FSF) were built. In both models, FN, using its functional approximation capability with least-square fitting algorithm, was used to select the best of the predictor variables from the input data. In the FFS model, the selected predictor variables were passed to Type-2 FL to remove uncertainties in the data (if any), and then to SVM for training and making final predictions. In the FSF model, the best predictor variables from FN were passed to SVM to transform them to a feature space, and then passed to Type-2 FL to remove uncertainties (if any), extract inference rules and make final predictions. The results showed that the hybrid models, with their higher correlation coefficients, performed better than the individual techniques when used separately with the same datasets. An extended study, used as a benchmark, showed that the hybrid models also performed better than a hybridization of only two of the techniques viz. Type-2 FL and SVM, both in terms of higher correlation coefficients and lower execution times.

The availability of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets for these two schistosomes now provides unprecedented opportunities to explore their biology, host interactions and schistosomiasis at the molecular level. A particularly important group of molecules involved in a range of biological and developmental processes in schistosomes and other parasites are the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although GPCRs have been studied in schistosomes, there has been no detailed comparison of these receptors between closely related species. Here, using a genomic-bioinformatic approach, we identified and characterised key GPCRs in S. haematobium and S. mansoni (two closely related species of schistosome).MethodsUsing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based pipeline, we classified and sub-classified GPCRs of S. haematobium and S. mansoni, combined with phylogenetic and transcription analyses.ResultsWe identified and classified classes A, B, C and F as well as an unclassified group of GPCRs encoded in the genomes of S. haematobium and S. mansoni.

The SST features were derived from time-series images using original bands, vegetation index, gray-level correlation matrix, and harmonic analysis. Random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) was used to optimize high-dimensional and correlated feature space, and determine the optimal SST feature set. Then, the classification was carried out using an RF classifier and the optimized SST feature set. This method was applied in the Qinling Mountains using Sentinel-2 time-series images. A total of 21 SST features were obtained through the RF-RFE method, and their importance was evaluated using the Gini index. The results indicated that spectral features contribute the most to separating shrubs, spatial features are more suitable for discrimination among evergreen forest types, and temporal features are more useful for evergreen forest, deciduous forest, and shrub types.

Various studies have developed automatic critical fall detection systems for emergency alarms and medical services. Window sizes and segmentation approaches would affect the system performance in terms of power consumption, computational speed and reliability that are essential considerations in the real-world implementation. Intuitively, employing shorter window sizes and simpler segmentation approaches leads to a faster detection speed and better power efficiency. However, few works explore the effects of windowing methods on detection performance, especially for machine learning models. This paper investigates the impact of segmentation approaches and window sizes in wearable-based critical fall detection systems with machine learning models. Two generally used segmentation approaches, including sliding windows and impact-defined windows, are explored with a range of window sizes from 0.5 s to 5.0 s and four machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Naive Bayes (NB).

The adaptive boosting algorithm is a machine learning method that can be used to model relationships of classification data. This method uses a weak base learner to improve accuracy of predicting the correct response class from a set of variables. Because of its learnability, adaptive boosting yields an exponentially decreasing empirical error. From this, an empirical error bound can be derived from the boosting algorithm. This empirical error bound inspires us to see if there is a generalized error bound and what form it takes. Evidence from boosting several real datasets will show that the generalized error follows the same shape as the empirical error, thus suggesting that a shift of the empirical error bound can create a generalized error bound. By simulating datasets from random and varying their characteristics based on criteria that seem to affect the shift, we can boost them and derive a function by which to shift the empirical error bound. We will record the test error of the boosted simulated datasets and build a regression model with that as the response and the varying characteristics of the datasets as the explanatory variables.

Workforce expertise that involve in intelligence gathering always deals with difficulty as the complexity of crime increases, human errors and time constraints. Thus, it is difficult to prevent undesired posts, such as terrorism posts, which are intended to disseminate their propaganda. Hence, an investigating for three term weighting schemes on two datasets are used to improve the automated content-based classification techniques. The research study aims to improve the content-based classification accuracy on Twitter by comparing Term Weighting Schemes in classifying terrorism contents. In this project, three different techniques for term weighting schemes namely Entropy, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Term Frequency Relevance Frequency (TFRF) are used as feature selection process in filtering Twitter posts. The performance of these techniques were examined via datasets, and the accuracy of their result was measured by Support Vector Machine (SVM).

These modules are capable of very precise measuring Times of Flights (ToF) of signals between two UWB-transceivers. We used this capability for more precise estimation of the soil dielectric constant. Besides Time of Flight, the used UWB-modules enabled measuring of channel impulse responses. We propose as the novelty using an impulse response signal shape for soil type characterization with machine learning, precisely, Support Vector Machine (SVM). So, the basic idea of the proposed method is, first, soil type characterization using machine learning and then, according to soil type, choosing an appropriate moisture-dielectric constant model for more accurate moisture measuring. The main advantages of the proposed method are smaller geometrical dimensions of the measuring equipment, i.e. UWB Radio-Frequency (RF) modules and probes (antennas), due to higher operating frequencies and, as proven with experiments, more accurate soil moisture estimation, especially for organic soils in comparison with equipment based on the conventional Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2019.06.042", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2954316234", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208278750"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198481200"}

Consequently, the need for new techniques to harden the protection of users' security and privacy becomes a necessity. The variety of email attacks, namely spam, damages networks' infrastructure and exposes users to new attack vectors daily. Spam is unsolicited email which targets users with different types of commercial messages or advertisements. Porn-related content that contains explicit material or commercials of exploited children is a major trend in these messages as well. The waste of network bandwidth due to the numerous number of spam messages sent and the requirement of complex hardware, software, network resources, and human power are other problems associated with these attacks. Recently, security researchers have noticed an increase in malicious content delivered by these messages, which arises security concerns due to their attack potential. More seriously, phishing attacks have been on the rise for the past couple of years. Phishing is the act of sending a forged e-mail to a recipient, falsely mimicking a legitimate establishment in an attempt to scam the recipient into divulging private information such as credit card numbers or bank account passwords (James, 2005). Recently phishing attacks have become a major concern to financial institutions and law enforcement due to the heavy monetary losses involved. According to a survey by Gartner group, in 2006 approximately 3.25 million victims were spoofed by phishing attacks and in 2007 the number increased by almost 1.3 million victims. Furthermore, in 2007, monetary losses, related to phishing attacks, were estimated by $3.2 billion. All the aforementioned concerns raise the need for new detection mechanisms to subvert email attacks in their various forms. Despite the abundance of applications available for phishing detection, unlike spam classification, there are only few studies that compare machine learning techniques in predicting phishing emails (Abu-Nimeh et al., 2007). We describe a new version of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and apply it to phishing detection. A phishing dataset is constructed from 1409 raw phishing emails and 5152 legitimate emails, where 71 features (variables) are used in classifiers' training and testing. The variables consist of both textual and structural features that are extracted from raw emails. The performance of six classifiers, on this dataset, is compared using the area under the curve (AUC) (Huang & Ling, 2005).

The underlying process underpinning catchment flow generation is complex and depends on many parameters. Determination of these parameters using a trial and error method or optimization algorithm is time consuming. Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network, Genetic Programming (GP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) replaced the complex modeling process and at the same time improved the prediction accuracy of hydrological time-series. However, they still require numerous iterations and computational time to generate optimum solutions. This study applies the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to hydrological flow series modeling and compares its performance with GP and Evolutionary Computation based SVM (EC-SVM). The robustness and performance of ELM were studied using the data from two different catchments located in two different climatic conditions. The robustness of ELM was evaluated by varying number of lagged input variables the number of hidden nodes and input parameter (regularization coefficient). Higher lead days prediction and extrapolation capability were also investigated. The results show that (1) ELM yields reasonable results with two or higher lagged input variables (flows) for 1-day lead prediction; (2) ELM produced satisfactory results very rapidly when the number of hidden nodes was greater than or equal to 1000; (3) ELM showed improved results when regularization coefficient was fine-tuned; (4) ELM was able to extrapolate extreme values well; (5) ELM generated reasonable results for higher number of lead days (second and third) predictions; (6) ELM was computationally much faster and capable of producing better results compared to other leading AI methods for prediction of flow series from the same catchment.

For fea- ture extraction, an explicit guided filter is proposed to extract the eight block-based directional features from the high-quality finger vein contours obtained from noisy, non- uniform, low-contrast finger vein images without intro- ducing any segmentation process. An FC-ELMs consist of eight single ELMs, each trained with a block feature with a pre-defined direction to enhance the robustness against variation of the finger vein images, and an output layer to combine the outputs of the eight ELMs. For the structured training of the vein patterns, the FC-ELMs are designed to first train small differences between patterns with the same angle and then to aggregate the differences at the output layer. Each ELM can easily learn lower-complexity pat- terns with a smaller network and the matching accuracy can also be improved, due to the less complex boundaries required for each ELM. We also designed the ensemble FC-ELMs to provide the matching system with stability. For the dataset considered, the experimental results show that the proposed system is able to generate clearer vein contours and has good matching performance with an accuracy of 99.53 % and speed of 0.87 ms per image.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2495039307", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56170915", "12987308", "210931853", "33091508", "212648315", "215660270"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113841199"}

Before harvest, an array of physical attributes were documented for individual stems of advance reproduction. Across all surveys, the same characteristics were remeasured in years 6, 12, and 23 for all reproduction types (advance reproduction, stump sprouts, and new seedlings). In order to characterize topo-edaphic conditions, soil samples were collected and analyzed in 2011, and slope aspect, slope percent, and slope position were measured in the field. Random Forest (RF) analysis was used to determine the best physical and environmental predictors of height growth for oak species and their competitors in developing stands. Overall, advance reproduction of oak species fared poorly following harvests. Sprout-origin oak stems proved stronger competitors in developing stands, although their abundance relative to competing species was quite low. Advance and sprout origin maple (Acer spp.) stems, along with new seedlings of black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), quickly overtopped oak advance reproduction and established dominance in the developing canopy. The height of stems during prior sampling periods was the best overall predictor of stem height in subsequent sampling periods. Species was also an important predictor of stem height. Comparatively, environmental variables were poor predictors of height growth of individual stems throughout the study, although more mesic aspects, greater cation exchange capacity, and greater soil magnesium saturation were associated with greater height of non-sprout origin stems from species groups other than oak or hickory in year 6. Our results suggest that overstory removal has driven stand demographics towards species favored by infrequent large-scale disturbance events such as clearcutting.

It assists users to quickly focus on recommended (or non-recommended) information by classifying Web search results into four categories: positive, negative, neutral, and non-review documents, by using an automatic classifier based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM).", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1065385.1065416", "venue": "JCDL '05", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2106650899", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["129063", "5857867", "14410965", "566696"], "inbound_citations": ["496614", "15402815", "10207995", "196013581"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14787927"}

In this paper, we have developed a novel watermarking scheme for Advanced Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC) videos using Bi-directional Extreme Learning Machine (B-ELM). Relevant frames to be watermarked are identified by implementing a newly developed fuzzy algorithm based on threshold operation. A binary watermark, encrypted by transposition cipher, is used to ensure enhanced security. The proposed watermarking scheme has been tested on five benchmark videos (Akiyo, Hall_Monitor, Mother_Daughter, Pamphlet, and Silent). High average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) values of the signed video sequences indicate good visual quality post-embedding. Common video interferences such as scaling, noising, cropping, filtering, frame dropping, frame averaging, and frame swapping are used to evaluate the robustness of the watermark embedding scheme. The high values of Normalized Correlation ( N C ( W , W \u2032 ) ) and Bit-Error-Rate ( B E R ( W , W \u2032 ) ) between the original watermark ( W ) and the recovered watermark ( W \u2032 ) establish the good robustness of the proposed scheme. While the established algorithms such as Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), Back Propagation Network (BPN), Meta-heuristic techniques take time of the order of several seconds to process a frame, the proposed algorithm consumes only a few milliseconds.

Then, time domain analysis is conducted to make the feature more concise. A dimension vector will then be constructed by including the intrinsic mode function energy, time domain statistical features, and the maximum value of the HHT marginal spectrum. On the other hand, as the architecture and the learning algorithm of pairwise-coupled sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine (PC-SBELM) are more concise and effective, it could identify the single- and simultaneous-fault more quickly and precisely when compared with traditional identification techniques such as pairwise-coupled probabilistic neural networks (PC-PNN) and pairwise-coupled relevance vector machine (PC-RVM). In this case study, PC-SBELM is applied to build a real-time multi-fault diagnostic system.

GBSA consumes an average of 0.4 Megabytes of memory for a 10 k rule set. The worst-case classification time per packet is 2 microseconds, and the preprocessing speed is 3 M rules/second based on a Xeon processor operating at 3.4GHz. When compared with other state-of-the-art classification techniques, the results showed that GBSA outperforms the competition with respect to speed, memory usage, and processing time. Moreover, GBSA is amenable to implementation in hardware. Three different hardware implementations are also presented in this paper including an Application Specific Instruction Set Processor (ASIP) implementation, and two pure Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementations based on Impulse-C and Handel-C flows, respectively.

It has been demonstrated that the first layers of the human visual cortex are devoted to feature detection.

HT3D is a recent variant of the Hough transform for the combined detection of corners and line segments in images. It uses a 3D parameter space that enables the detection of segments instead of whole lines. This space also encloses canonical configurations of image corners, transforming corner detection into a pattern search problem. Spiking neural networks have previously been proposed for multiple image processing tasks, including corner and line detection using the Hough transform. Following these ideas, this paper presents and describes in detail a model to implement HT3D as a Spiking Neural Network for corner detection. The results obtained from a thorough testing of its implementation using real images evince the correctness of the Spiking Neural Network HT3D implementation. Such results are comparable to those obtained with the regular HT3D implementation, which are turn superior to other corner detection algorithms.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5992504", "pubmed_id": "29910720", "doi": "10.3389/fncom.2018.00037", "venue": "Front.

We propose to use a fully deep neural network (DNN) framework incorporating unsupervised feature learning to handle the multi-label classification task in a regression way. Considering that only chunk-level rather than frame-level labels are available, the whole or almost whole frames of the chunk are fed into the DNN to perform a multi-label regression for the expected tags. The fully DNN, which is regarded as an encoding function, can map the audio features sequence to a multi-tag vector. For the unsupervised feature learning, we propose to use a deep auto-encoder (AE) to generate new features with non-negative representation from the basic features. The new feature can further improve the performance of audio tagging. A deep pyramid structure was also designed to extract more robust high-level features related to the target tags. Further improved methods were adopted, such as the dropout and background noise aware training, to enhance the generalization capability of DNNs for new audio recordings in mismatched environments. Compared with the conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and support vector machine (SVM) methods, the proposed fully DNN-based method is able to utilize the long-term temporal information with the whole chunk as the input.

Recent studies have suggested the possible role of 60 Hz stimulation in STN-deep brain stimulation (DBS) for patients with gait disorder. The objective of this study was to develop a computational model, which stratifies patients a priori based on symptomatology into different frequency settings (i.e., high frequency or 60 Hz). ::: ::: Methods ::: We retrospectively analyzed preoperative MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III scores (32 indicators) collected from 20 PD patients implanted with STN-DBS at Mount Sinai Medical Center on either 60 Hz stimulation (ten patients) or HFS (130\u2013185 Hz) (ten patients) for an average of 12 months. Predictive models using the Random Forest classification algorithm were built to associate patient/disease characteristics at surgery to the stimulation frequency. These models were evaluated objectively using leave-one-out cross-validation approach. ::: ::: Results ::: The computational models produced, stratified patients into 60 Hz or HFS (130\u2013185 Hz) with 95% accuracy. The best models relied on two or three predictors out of the 32 analyzed for classification. Across all predictors, gait and rest tremor of the right hand were consistently the most important. ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Computational models were developed using preoperative clinical indicators in PD patients treated with STN-DBS.

Magnetically controlled shape memory (MSM)-alloy actuators serve as the core part of high-precision positioning system on account of their high precision, large energy density, and small volume. The hysteresis nonlinearity of the MSM-alloy actuator, however, severely damages the positional accuracy of the positioning system. In order to research the hysteresis nonlinearity in the MSM-alloy actuator, hysteresis nonlinearity modeling has become a significant hot spot of research [2] [3]. The purpose of this study is to structure an excellent hysteresis nonlinearity model to capture the hysteresis nonlinearity in MSM-alloy actuators. The criterion for evaluating modeling performance is that the established hysteresis model can embody the actual characteristic of the actuator. In this study, a novel black-box model composed of the hysteresis-like structure and a nonlinear function is proposed to capture the hysteresis nonlinearity of the MSM-alloy actuator. The proposed black-box hysteresis nonlinearity modeling approach has the advantages of requiring no prior knowledge and internal physical mechanism. The hysteresis-like structure solves the multi-value mapping problem and accurately depicts the major and minor hysteresis loops of the MSM-alloy actuator. The nonlinear function represents the nonlinearity part of the MSM-alloy actuator, which is identified using least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) on account of its strong approximation capability, high generalization ability, less parameters, and great computing power. The schematic diagram of black-box model is shown in Fig. 1. u(k) is the input current at k time, y(k) is the output displacement at k time, F[\u22c5] is the nonlinear function, H u [\u22c5] is the hysteresis-like part of the black-box model. In the procedure of modeling, u(k) and y(k) are the input values of hysteresis-like part; u(k), y(k), and H u [\u22c5] are the input values of nonlinear function, which is obtained by the LS-SVM. To certify the effectiveness of the black-box model, the simulations are implemented using the obtained experimental data. The simulations show that the modeling error rate of the novel black-box model based on the LS-SVM is 1.37%, which is improved 73.97% in compared with the results in [4]. It is obvious that the modeling precision of the proposed hysteresis model is within the allowable range. The simulation results are shown in Fig.2. The blue solid line is the obtained experimental data, and the red dotted line is the output of the proposed black-box model. As shown in Fig.2(a), the proposed black-box model based on the LS-SVM can accurately describe the major and minor hysteresis loops of the MSM-alloy actuator. The modeling error curve is shown in Fig.2(b). In the future, the proposed black-box model can lay a foundation for designing an adaptive controller to eliminate the hysteresis nonlinearity in the MSM-alloy actuator.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/INTMAG.2018.8508779", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Magnetic Conference (INTERMAG)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Magnetic Conference (INTERMAG)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2899381004", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53079469"}

In this paper, we provide a solution to the auto-scaling for cloud provider by means of analyzing the impact of various system parameters. The parameters which may impact the QoE on the client side include, but not limited to, average memory consumption, transmission and reception frequency, average CPU consumption on the side of the cloud provider. We perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to find a projection of the parameters, resulting in a set of features which can be sorted by their measure of impact. Next, we introduce scaling decision mechanism based on Random Forest (RF). Only most influencing features are employed for that, which renders the training process of the RF to be computationally effective. The proposed approach is novel in the sense that the scaling decisions found by the RF are in the projected space found by PCA (instead of having threshold derived directly from the original parameters), which is not necessarily intuitive. However, these features are numerically approved to be the most influencing. Moreover, as long as the features in the projected space are uncorrelated, it allows us to base the RF on only small subset of them, which would be ineffective in the original measurements space, where the correlation is high.

Machine learning methods could assist clinicians by analysing this large amount of ICU data to build models that predict the occurrence of specic clinical problems earlier than an experienced intesivist would. Purpose: To evaluate the applicability of machine learning methods for predicting kidney dysfunction and predened hyper-inammatory states. Materials and Methods: A database of 1548 patients from a randomised controlled trial studying intensive insulin therapy in a surgical intensive care unit was used for this study 3 . A total of 12 prediction tasks were considered, consisting of development and recovery from hyper-inammatory states and kidney dysfunction, with predictions ranging from 1 to 4 days in advance. Four dieren t machine learning algorithms were used: Decision trees (DT), First Order Random Forests (FORF), Naive Bayes (NB) and Tree Augmented Naive Bayes(TAN). Results: Criteria for discrimination and calibration were Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (aROC) of at least 80% and a HosmerLemeshow H-statistic p-value greater than 0:05. Except for the prediction of development of inammation, all prediction tasks regarding development satised the required criteria. While recovery from kidney dysfunction was predicted up to 4 days in advance, none of the predictions of recovery from hyper-inammatory states satised the criteria completely.

The main reasons behind these diseases are changes in the lifestyle of people such as alcohol drinking, smoking, food habits etc. After going through the various lifestyle diseases, it has been found that the fertility rates (sperm quantity) in men has considerably been decreasing in last two decades. Lifestyle factors as well as environmental factors are mainly responsible for the change in the semen quality. The objective of this paper is to identify the lifestyle and environmental features that affects the seminal quality and also fertility rate in man using data mining methods. The five artificial intelligence techniques such as Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), Navie Bayes (Kernel), Support vector machine+Particle swarm optimization (SVM+PSO) and Support vector machine (SVM) have been applied on fertility dataset to evaluate the seminal quality and also to predict the person is either normal or having altered fertility rate. While the eight feature selection techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), evolutionary logistic regression (LR), support vector machine plus particle swarm optimization (SVM+PSO), principle component analysis (PCA), chi-square test, correlation and T-test methods have been used to identify more relevant features which affect the seminal quality. These techniques are applied on fertility dataset which contains 100 instances with nine attribute with two classes. The experimental result shows that SVM+PSO provides higher accuracy and area under curve (AUC) rate (94% & 0.932) among multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (92% & 0.728), Support Vector Machines (91% & 0.758), Navie Bayes (Kernel) (89% & 0.850) and Decision Tree (89% & 0.735) for some of the seminal parameters. This paper also focuses on the feature selection process i.e. how to select the features which are more important for prediction of fertility rate. In this paper, eight feature selection methods are applied on fertility dataset to find out a set of good features. The investigational results shows that childish diseases (0.079) and high fever features (0.057) has less impact on fertility rate while age (0.8685), season (0.843), surgical intervention (0.7683), alcohol consumption (0.5992), smoking habit (0.575), number of hours spent on setting (0.4366) and accident (0.5973) features have more impact. It is also observed that feature selection methods increase the accuracy of above mentioned techniques (multilayer perceptron 92%, support vector machine 91%, SVM+PSO 94%, Navie Bayes (Kernel) 89% and decision tree 89%) as compared to without feature selection methods (multilayer perceptron 86%, support vector machine 86%, SVM+PSO 85%, Navie Bayes (Kernel) 83% and decision tree 84%) which shows the applicability of feature selection methods in prediction. This paper lightens the application of artificial techniques in medical domain. From this paper, it can be concluded that data mining methods can be used to predict a person with or without disease based on environmental and lifestyle parameters/features rather than undergoing various medical test. In this paper, five data mining techniques are used to predict the fertility rate and among which SVM+PSO provide more accurate results than support vector machine and decision tree.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24898862", "doi": "10.3233/THC-140816", "venue": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "journal": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "mag_id": "1700338946", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195811842", "80628052", "203372346", "108294426"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207585241"}

First, low-level dense SIFT features are extracted from a grid covering a region of interest (ROIs). ROIs are identified as regions with high-energy along the (down-track, depth) dimensions of the 3-D GPR cube, or with high-energy along the (cross-track, depth) dimensions. Next, we model the training data (in the SIFT feature space) by a mixture of Gaussian components. Then, we construct FV descriptors based on the Fisher Kernel. The Fisher Kernel characterizes low-level features from an ROI by their deviation from a generative model. The deviation is the gradient of the ROI log-likelihood with respect to the generative model parameters. The vectorial representation of all the deviations is called the Fisher Vector. FV is a generalization of the standard Bag of Words (BoW) method, which provides a framework to map a set of local descriptors to a global feature vector. It is more efficient to compute than the BoW since it relies on a significantly smaller codebook. In addition, mapping a GPR signature into one global feature vector using this technique makes it more efficient to classify using simple and fast linear classifiers such as Support Vector Machines. The proposed approach is applied to detect buried explosive objects using GPR data. The selected data were accumulated across multiple dates and multiple test sites by a vehicle mounted mine detector (VMMD) using GPR sensor. This data consist of a diverse set of conventional landmines and other buried explosive objects consisting of varying shapes, metal content, and burial depths.

The semantic relevant images and the irrelevant ones are always assigned into different topics. By exploiting the discriminant information between different topics, Support Vector Machine(SVM) is applied to classify the unlabeled image into the relevant topic, from which the more accurate annotation will be obtained by reducing the bad influence of irrelevant images.

Through experiment and giving comparisons of precision, true positive, false positive and ROC curve between the proposed ensemble method and traditional methods such as naive Bayes(NB) , decision trees(DT) and single DTNB algorithm, we find that the proposed method has a better P2P traffic identification accuracy and stability.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4156/jcit.vol6.issue2.12", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Convergence Information Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2316370646", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1078414", "17760766", "14226937", "9755669", "18734187", "1796528", "15231955", "36234037", "10420740", "7736055", "1975295", "14667458", "10460430", "420680", "10653388", "15246188", "2101369", "9070658", "3231769", "7008247", "16532958", "41677980", "56268059", "7682047", "5747992", "11841279", "510263", "7899103", "4467142", "140109802", "58822317"], "inbound_citations": ["14186628", "18552869"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18964422"}

As a consequence, an increasing effort may be observed from both universities and industry to find suitable failure prediction methods.

Considering the HDD failure prediction task, this problem arises with the numerous HDD models. To overcome such problem, transfer learning strategies offer a valid alternative since it can be used to transfer learning from HDD model with enough data to build failure prediction methods for HDD models with lack of data. In this work we evaluate several transfer learning strategies in the task of HDD failure prediction. Additionally we propose a new strategy to build information sources based on the clustering of similar HDD models. This approach may be a valid alternative when no HDD model has enough data to generate a reliable model. Results showed that all transfer learning scenarios can improve the performance of HDDs failure prediction methods, mainly for HDDs with very limited data.

Many existing TIS prediction approaches investigate the data from one single perspective or apply some static central fusion mechanism on a fixed set of features. Due to the complicated nature of the genetic data, we believe that it is beneficial to consider multiple biological perspectives in the analysis process. In order to provide diversified problem solving techniques as well as modularization to the system, we have proposed a novel solution that uses a multi-agent system (MAS), which investigates the biological data from multiple biological perspectives, each of which is implemented by an independent problem solver agent with a unique expertise. A generalized layered framework is proposed to facilitate the system to take advantage of the synergy of having multiple agents working together and arriving at a single final prediction. In this chapter, we explore the application of particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization in the proposed architecture.

These signatures may not be sufficiently robust for large scale testing, as their performance has not been adequately validated on external, independent datasets. The present study develops human and murine signatures with biochemically-inspired machine learning that are strictly validated using k-fold and traditional approaches. Methods: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of exposed human and murine lymphocytes were preprocessed via nearest neighbor imputation and expression of genes implicated in the literature to be responsive to radiation exposure (n=998) were then ranked by Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). Optimal signatures were derived by backward, complete, and forward sequential feature selection using Support Vector Machines (SVM), and validated using k-fold or traditional validation on independent datasets. Results: The best human signatures we derived exhibit k-fold validation accuracies of up to 98% ( DDB2, PRKDC, TPP2, PTPRE, and GADD45A) when validated over 209 samples and traditional validation accuracies of up to 92% ( DDB2, CD8A, TALDO1, PCNA, EIF4G2, LCN2, CDKN1A, PRKCH, ENO1, and PPM1D) when validated over 85 samples. Some human signatures are specific enough to differentiate between chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Certain multi-class murine signatures have sufficient granularity in dose estimation to inform eligibility for cytokine therapy (assuming these signatures could be translated to humans). We compiled a list of the most frequently appearing genes in the top 20 human and mouse signatures. More frequently appearing genes among an ensemble of signatures may indicate greater impact of these genes on the performance of individual signatures.

Random numbers have important applications in the field of cryptography where the security of the scheme relies upon the random nature of the keys. It is not practically possible to achieve true randomness in a machine, and hence we rely upon Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs) to produce near-true randomness. PRNGs use a mathematical function that relies upon a seed (a preset value required by the function to generate values) and it generates numbers which satisfy certain tests for randomness and appear to be random for a user having no knowledge of the generator function. These pseudorandom functions have their drawbacks due to them being derived from a mathematical function. To generate random numbers that can never be predicted by any observer, requires a causally non-deterministic process where events are not fully determined by prior states. Due to the physical impossibility of acquiring sufficient information to predict the outcome of such an event, its outcomes are guaranteed to be random to all. Various methods to generate pseudorandomness have been employed over the years which includes using mathematical functions, keyboard typing latency of the user, network latency, memory latency etc. as sources of generating random numbers. In this work, we propose a new way of generating pseudorandom numbers using generative adversarial networks.

In this paper, we consider that different apps maybe generate different network flows by different operations, and the ``shapes\" of the benign flows and malicious ones will be diverse. Thus we propose a detection model based on the analysis of relationships between behavior patterns and network flows, which achieves our goal by using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to classify the network flows into benign or malicious.

One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease ( Diplodia sapinea ) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47%) between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.06.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Modelling", "mag_id": "2952895903,2794916302", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208768811", "215722554", "204769555", "201124800"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196678480"}

By analyzing the encephalogram (EEG) signals of patients with epilepsy, their conditions can be monitored and seizure can be detected and intervened in time. As the identification of effective features in EEG signals is important for accurate seizure detection, this paper proposes a multi-view deep feature extraction method in attempt to achieve this goal. The method first uses fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to construct the initial multi-view features. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used to automatically learn deep features from the initial multi-view features, which reduces the dimensionality and obtain the features with better seizure identification ability. Furthermore, the multi-view Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (MV-TSK-FS), an interpretable rule-based classifier, is used to construct a classification model with strong generalizability based on the deep multi-view features obtained. Experimental studies show that the classification accuracy of the proposed multi-view deep feature extraction method is at least 1% higher than that of common feature extraction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), FFT and WPD.

This paper seeks to address this problem by exploiting oil spillage features with sets of collected data of oil spillage scenarios. The proposed system integrates three state-of-the-art tools: self organizing maps, (SOM), ensembles of deep neural network (k-DNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). It begins with unsupervised learning using SOM, where four natural clusters were discovered and used in making the data suitable for classification and prediction (supervised learning) by ensembles of k-DNN and ANFIS. Results obtained showed the significant classification and prediction improvements, which is largely attributed to the hybrid learning approach, ensemble learning and cognitive reasoning capabilities. However, optimization of k-DNN structure and weights would be needed for speed enhancement. The system would provide a means of understanding the nature, type and severity of oil spillages thereby facilitating a rapid response to impending oils spillages.

However, outsourcing projects are often affiliated with high failure rate. Therefore to ensure success in outsourcing projects, past research has aimed to develop intelligent risk prediction models to evaluate the success rate and cost-effectiveness of software projects. In this study, we first summarized related work over the past 20years and observed that all existing prediction models assume equal misclassification costs, neglecting actual situations in the management of software projects. In fact, overlooking project failure is far more serious than the misclassification of a success-prone project as a failure. Moreover, ensemble learning, a technique well-recognized to improve prediction performance in other fields, has not yet been comprehensively studied in software project risk prediction. This study aims to close the research gaps by exploring cost-sensitive analysis and classifier ensemble methods. Comparative analysis with T-test on 60 different risk prediction models using 327 outsourced software project samples suggests that the ideal model is a homogeneous ensemble model of decision trees (DT) based on bagging. Interestingly, DT underperformed Support Vector Machine (SVM) in accuracy (i.e., assuming equal misclassification cost), but outperformed in cost-sensitive analysis under the proposed framework. In conclusion, this study proposes the first cost-sensitive and ensemble-based hybrid modeling framework (COSENS) for software project risk prediction. In addition, it establishes a new rigorous evaluation standard for assessing software risk prediction models by considering misclassification costs.

Conventional metric learning always assumes that the training and test data are sampled from the same or similar distribution. However, to build an effective distance metric, we need abundant supervised knowledge (i.e., side/label information), which is generally inaccessible in practice, because of the expensive labeling cost. In this paper, we develop a robust transfer metric learning (RTML) framework to effectively assist the unlabeled target learning by transferring the knowledge from the well-labeled source domain. Specifically, RTML exploits knowledge transfer to mitigate the domain shift in two directions, i.e., sample space and feature space. In the sample space, domain-wise and class-wise adaption schemes are adopted to bridge the gap of marginal and conditional distribution disparities across two domains. In the feature space, our metric is built in a marginalized denoising fashion and low-rank constraint, which make it more robust to tackle noisy data in reality. Furthermore, we design an explicit rank constraint regularizer to replace the rank minimization NP-hard problem to guide the low-rank metric learning.

This is a binary class classifier which is further converted to a 10 class classifier by means of One against all algorithm. Due to small training time, PSVM classifier is preferable over standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier. The handwritten images both for training and testing are taken from MNIST database.

The time series of produced power is estimated through combination of three main steps including: pre-processing, feature selection and regression steps. In the first step, the time series of wind power is decomposed into different modes by using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique. These modes are then used to construct training patterns and forecasted outputs. In the second step, to eliminate redundant properties, the feature selection method based on Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO) is applied on potential candidates. In the last step, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) as efficient and fast regression tools are trained using subsets of selected features.

The synergistic effect of two catalysts had certain research value. There are still just a few studies on the performance prediction of activated carbon. In this paper, wheat straw, corn straw and sorghum straw were used as the raw materials. ZnCl2 and H3PO4 were used as the catalysts for the synergetic catalysis. Hydrothermal carbonization combined with pyrolysis was used to co-activate with the ultrasonic auxiliary impregnation method in order to prepare straw activated carbon. The straw activated carbon was characterized by different means and the principle of the method was analyzed. Then the performance prediction models of straw pyrolytic activated carbon using methylene blue number and iodine number as the main evaluation index based on Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression were proposed and compared. The results indicated the three kinds of straw showed similar characteristics in the preparation of straw pyrolytic activated carbon whose specific surface area reached 1258.3927 m2/g, 1101.8430 m2/g and 1060.9723 m2/g respectively. The Random Forest Regression model was the most suitable. The n_estimators was set to 10. The evaluation indexes of the model were all good. It demonstrated the three kinds of straw were highly efficient precursor for the preparation of activated carbon used to remove dyes from wastewater.

The clustering problem is composed of two key parts: face representation and choice of similarity for grouping faces. We first propose a representation based on ResNet, which has been shown to perform very well in image classification problems. Given this representation, we design a clustering algorithm, Conditional Pairwise Clustering (ConPaC), which directly estimates the adjacency matrix only based on the similarity between face images. This allows a dynamic selection of number of clusters and retains pairwise similarity between faces. ConPaC formulates the clustering problem as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model and uses Loopy Belief Propagation to find an approximate solution for maximizing the posterior probability of the adjacency matrix. Experimental results on two benchmark face datasets (LFW and IJB-B) show that ConPaC outperforms well known clustering algorithms such as k-means, spectral clustering and approximate rank-order. Additionally, our algorithm can naturally incorporate pairwise constraints to obtain a semi-supervised version that leads to improved clustering performance.

To address is limitation, we develop a novel domain transfer learning method for MCI conversion prediction, which can use data from both the target domain (i.e., MCI) and auxiliary domains (i.e., AD and NC). Specifically, the proposed method consists of three key components: 1) a domain transfer feature selection component that selects the most informative feature-subset from both target domain and auxiliary domains from different imaging modalities; 2) a domain transfer sample selection component that selects the most informative sample-subset from the same target and auxiliary domains from different data modalities; and 3) a domain transfer support vector machine classification component that fuses the selected features and samples to separate MCI-C and MCI-NC patients. We evaluate our method on 202 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that have MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The experimental results show the proposed method can classify MCI-C patients from MCI-NC patients with an accuracy of 79.4%, with the aid of additional domain knowledge learned from AD and NC.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4474791", "pubmed_id": "25751861", "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2015.2404809", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2018935975", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15536204", "207178993", "5364036", "6263889", "15514359", "3899987", "793159", "25491482", "6884758", "13377664", "41819092", "7004692", "8332443", "31451365", "15322428", "54298634", "21368161", "24182714", "4511622", "54295727", "5344813", "15879781", "8470446", "7263397", "4964135", "10975153", "6466898", "2995286", "16281709", "121923358", "6617228", "8153773", "740063", "3226754", "21792806", "961425", "16902615", "5884735", "10054547", "207185083", "8548594", "33742841", "5099946", "371670", "18034940", "16426370", "145159896", "21877334", "12787318", "19011676", "17285766"], "inbound_citations": ["61156321", "195735768", "23618131", "53295414", "3897381", "3897381", "3286869", "36702070", "196178410", "16945078", "33018407", "6466898", "208014931", "207203830", "16711640", "201813961", "4697592", "204229094", "16289291", "13662190", "22362951", "215416754", "15582666", "197680777", "213795830", "195759047", "9491093", "6113444", "208538978", "208538978", "3972672", "85528960", "34611602", "31945059", "49567957", "210910664", "53075890", "3564179", "4435928", "25421989", "215485476", "14535244", "214735921", "54524215", "49547674", "57825700", "215249939", "3778224", "17459727", "54271285", "4962822", "204230855", "195882761", "4348154", "3730688", "51611725", "46380054", "59331906", "215361607", "3571703"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6466898"}

However, even at the risk of losing prediction accuracy due to insufficient runtime information, researchers can only afford to apply offline model training to avoid significant runtime training overhead. Advanced multi- and many-core architectures offer massive parallelism with complex memory hierarchies which can make runtime training possible, but form a barrier to efficient parallel SVM design.

The original training algorithm for the neural network model with the attraction of experimental data is based on the principle of the distribution of the total error in the neural network in proportion to their confidence probabilities. The network model of Dempster-Shafer functions is trained together with the neural network model, which simulates the process of forming empirical estimates of hypotheses on the basis of subjective preferences of experts for the influence of various factors on diagnostic solutions.

Any improvement in its ability to estimate would definitely go a long way in reducing the security risks in the modern power system. One important factor affecting the quality of estimation is the measurement accuracy. Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) has revolutionized the way state estimation is performed. The unique ability to measure the voltage and current phasors (magnitude and phase angle) with very high accuracy makes PMU extremely useful in modern Energy Management Systems (EMS). Due to the high price, technology level and communication capacity, the PMU can't be equipped in all buses in the system nowadays. Therefore, this paper brings forward an improved method on dynamic state estimation that combines some buses measurements from PMU with measurements from SCADA. As Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) has a better performance on the regression, the state estimation algorithm is based on RVM in this article. Since the input data dimension is too large, pre-processing of data is needed. Autoencoder Network (Autoencoder) can be used for data dimensionality reduction.

Predicting genes in this newly sequenced data is an important and essential step towards genome annotation. Genome annotation helps in determining function of these genes. Accurate splice site prediction in DNA sequences leads to correct gene structure prediction in eukaryotes and it requires effective modelling of regions surrounding these sites. A large number of methods for splice site prediction are available in literature but very few of them are suitable to be incorporated as gene prediction module because of their complexity. In this paper, a splice site prediction method based on second order markov model and support vector machine is developed. This method shows improvement over most of the existing splice site predictors in use today. The experimental results suggest that second order markov model is an effective pre-processing approach.

We demonstrate accurate segmentation of the vascular morphology for the superficial capillary plexus and deep vascular complex (SCP and DVC) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for quantitative analysis. Methods: Retinal OCT-A with a 6x6mm field of view (FOV) were acquired using a Zeiss PlexElite. Multiple-volume acquisition and averaging enhanced the vessel network contrast used for training the CNN. We used transfer learning from a CNN trained on 76 images from smaller FOVs of the SCP acquired using different OCT systems. Quantitative analysis of perfusion was performed on the automated vessel segmentations in representative patients with DR. Results: The automated segmentations of the OCT-A images maintained the hierarchical branching and lobular morphologies of the SCP and DVC, respectively. The network segmented the SCP with an accuracy of 0.8599, and a Dice index of 0.8618. For the DVC, the accuracy was 0.7986, and the Dice index was 0.8139. The inter-rater comparisons for the SCP had an accuracy and Dice index of 0.8300 and 0.6700, respectively, and 0.6874 and 0.7416 for the DVC. Conclusions: Transfer learning reduces the amount of manually-annotated images required, while producing high quality automatic segmentations of the SCP and DVC. Using high quality training data preserves the characteristic appearance of the capillary networks in each layer.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the variation of groundwater level is highly nonlinear in nature because of interdependencies and uncertainties in the hydro-geological process. Models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have proved to be effective in modeling virtually any nonlinear function with a greater degree of accuracy. In recent times, combining several techniques to form a hybrid tool to improve the accuracy of prediction has become a common practice for various applications. This integrated method increases the efficiency of the model by combining the unique features of the constituent models to capture different patterns in the data. In the present study, an attempt is made to predict monthly groundwater level fluctuations using integrated wavelet and support vector machine modeling. The discrete wavelet transform with two coefficients (db2 wavelet) is adopted for decomposing the input data into wavelet series. These series are further used as input variables in different combinations for Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to forecast groundwater level fluctuations. The monthly data of precipitation, maximum temperature, mean temperature and groundwater depth for the period 2001\u20132012 are used as the input variables.

The human face finding module finds the candidate face regions from colour sequential images according to skin colour analysis and motion analysis. The human face verification module has been developed to verify the detected human faces by judging of eclipse and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and precisely localize human faces by locating eyes and mouths based on Generalized Symmetry Transform. The features of the relation between face patterns can be extracted and selected by Principal Component Analysis. The selected features are used to train multiple SVMs which can finally classify human faces. The system structure is designed according to the following principle: Firstly simpler methods are used to reduce the search space, and then more complicated methods are used in the reduced space. So the system can have a quick response speed as well as holding high detection and recognition rate. Human face detection accuracy of the system is 97.2% under controllable lightning condition.

However, the currently available BuChE inhibitor screening assays are expensive, labor-intensive, and compound-dependent. It is necessary to develop robust in silico methods to predict the activities of BuChE inhibitors for the lead identification. In this investigation, support vector machine (SVM) models and naive Bayesian models were built to discriminate BuChE inhibitors (BuChEIs) from the noninhibitors. Each molecule was initially represented in 1870 structural descriptors (1235 from ADRIANA.Code, 334 from MOE, and 301 from Discovery studio). Correlation analysis and stepwise variable selection method were applied to figure out activity-related descriptors for prediction models. Additionally, structural fingerprint descriptors were added to improve the predictive ability of models, which were measured by cross-validation, a test set validation with 1001 compounds and an external test set validation with 317 diverse chemicals. The best two models gave Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9551 and 0.9550 for the test set and 0.9132 and 0.9221 for the external test set. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the models in virtual screening, we screened an in-house data set with 3601 compounds, and 30 compounds were selected for further bioactivity assay. The assay results showed that 10 out of 30 compounds exerted significant BuChE inhibitory activities with IC50 values ranging from 0.32 to 22.22 \u03bcM, at which three new scaffolds as BuChE inhibitors were identified for the first time.

The advantages of ELM in efficiency and generalization performance over traditional fuzzy neural network(FNN) algorithms have been demonstrated on a wide range of problems from different fields, thanks to the integration of l 2,1 -norm, the l 2,1 RF-ELM is able to automatically prune the irrelevant and redundant hidden neurons to form a more discriminative and compact hidden layer. The performance of the l 2,1 RF-ELM is compared with other hidden layer enforcement algorithms, two long-term time series data sets, including TianChi and BCS, are used for this comparison. The performance of the l 2,1 RF-ELM was comparable to those of other widely used machine learning techniques like support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) and other popular ELM method. The experiments demonstrate favorable prediction results of the l 2,1 RF-ELM in terms of annualized return, prediction error and running time.

This work focuses on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the non-transmissible and long-lasting diseases since they are the leading cause of death globally. Drugs that are used in NCDs increase the probability of DDIs as a result of long time usage. This work proposes an Integrated Action Crossing (IAC) method that is effective in predicting the NCDs DDIs based on pharmacokinetic (PK) mechanism. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Drug-Enzyme (CYP450) and Drug-Transporter actions including substrate, inhibitor and inducer affect the PK mechanism of other drugs. Hence, this paper proposes an enzyme and transporter protein integrated action crossing method for DDIs prediction in NCDs. The NCDs Drugs information was retrieved from the DrugBank database and the actions of enzymes and transporter proteins that were crossed and integrated. The datasets were generated for machine training. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Three machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks were used for the assessment of the method. Performance evaluation was performed through five-fold cross validation and the different datasets and learning methods were compared.

While numerous techniques for content analysis and similarity measurement of multimedia objects are being developed, these techniques are not directly suitable for efficient retrieval from large multimedia databases. This thesis addresses four challenges faced for making multimedia retrieval scalable. First, a method is proposed to embed objects into a Euclidean space based on dissimilarities computed using an arbitrary, possibly expensive, similarity measure. The method creates an embedding with low computational cost, and the embedding can be used to efficiently compute approximate distances between objects. Second, a distance measure and indexing method is proposed to allow efficient retrieval based on partial similarities between objects. Unlike other measures that utilize partial similarity, this measure is metric, and allows a much lower retrieval cost. Third, we present a system for scalably finding landmarks in images using a local feature representation. Efficiency is achieved by embedding object representations into a Euclidean space. Fourth, an indexing method is proposed for answering Support Vector Machine (SVM) queries, which represent a concept learnt using a training set, and represented by an SVM classifier. This index is independent of the parameter used to train the SVM.

Chemical search engines identify and index chemical formulae and chemical names appearing in text documents to support efficient search and retrieval in the future. Identifying chemical formulae and chemical names in text automatically has been a hard problem that has met with varying degrees of success in the past. We propose algorithms for chemical formula and chemical name tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that achieve higher accuracy than existing (published) methods. After chemical entities have been identified in text documents, they must be indexed. In order to support user-provided search queries that require a partial match between the chemical name segment used as a keyword or a partial chemical formula, all possible (or a significant number of) subformulae of formulae that appear in any document and all possible subterms (e.g., \u201cmethyl\u201d) of chemical names (e.g., \u201cmethylethyl ketone\u201d) must be indexed. Indexing all possible subformulae and subterms results in an exponential increase in the storage and memory requirements as well as the time taken to process the indices. We propose techniques to prune the indices significantly without reducing the quality of the returned results significantly. Finally, we propose multiple query semantics to allow users to pose different types of partial search queries for chemical entities.

Another important fact of real-life application of DAQs concerns the usage of multiple questionnaires, increasing the shortcoming impacts. To pave the way to a more convenient tool to support and facilitate the achievement of organizational strategies and objectives, we proposed an intelligent reduction of DAQs by the use of single-label and multilabel feature selection.

Because of this, the first-order and second-order partial derivatives respect to fluorescence emission wavelength on each of the excitation wavelength were carried out in this paper. Daubechies7 (db7) orthonormal wavelet with compact support was used to compress the spectral data. The forth approximate coefficients were finally chosen as the new data matrix. Then the new data matrix was analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and the principal components were extracted to be used as the inputs of support vector machine (SVM). The K-fold cross validation was applied to optimize the parameters c and y and the prediction model was constructed in the end. Fourteen samples were selected randomly from each brand that in total of ninety-eight samples were selected as the training set, and the rest forty-two samples were collected as the prediction set.

Method: This process begins with identifying 13 influencing factors in software crowdsourcing failures, across four categories including task characteristics, technology popularity, competition network, and workers reliability. Presenting an algorithm to construct worker competition network and extract its network metrics features. The proposed framework was evaluated on 4,872 software crowdsourcing tasks, extracted from TopCoder platform, using five machine learners, compared with in-house TopCoder predictor. Results: 1) Workers reliability, links in the description, number of registered workers, number of required technologies, and task-workers network modularity are the most influencing factors for predicting crowdsourcing failure; 2) The top-three learners for task failure are Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and StackingC, with precision above 98.8%, recall above 81.2%, and F-measure above 91.2%; and 3) The proposed best learners significantly outperform the two baseline models in our evaluation.

Two calibrations have been developed in cascade: the first one identifies the product family while the second one specifies the formulation. A product family comprises different formulations that have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) but in a different amount. Once the tablets have been classified by the SVM model, API peaks detection and correlation are applied in order to have a specific method for the identification and allow in the future to discriminate counterfeits from genuine products.

Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has been successfully demonstrated as a means to derive a suite of forest structure attributes at the plot level; however, these acquisitions are often constrained to limited spatial extents and to a given point in time. Sample based approaches for model development can accommodate the spatial limitations of lidar acquisitions when characterizing large areas. The combination of lidar plot data and time-series satellite imagery is well suited to provide spatially extensive, and temporally dense, information on forest structure and related dynamics over very large areas. In this research, we combine lidar plot-derived information with Landsat pixel-based composites to produce annual forest structure estimates from 1984 to 2016 over 650 million ha of Canada's forest ecosystems using a nearest neighbor imputation approach with a Random Forests-based distance metric. Imputed variables included lidar metrics of height (e.g., mean height, standard deviation of height) and cover, as well as area-based modelled inventory estimates of Lorey's height, basal area, stem volume, and biomass. Models were validated using reserved validation plots, with model R 2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.64 for lidar metrics of height and cover, and R 2 of 0.67, 0.68, 0.71, and 0.70 for Lorey's height, basal area, volume and biomass, respectively. Unique to this study was the assessment of model extension through time, with model performance for imputing lidar metrics evaluated at the forest stand-level using independent lidar data representing a latitudinal gradient of forest conditions and that was not used in model development. The period evaluated was 2006\u20132012, with R 2 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.66 for height metrics, and 0.47\u20130.77 for cover metrics. Ultimately, we show how deriving forest structural estimates on an annual basis enables the analysis of both the dynamics and regional trends of undisturbed forest, as well as regenerating stands following stand-replacing disturbances (i.e., fire, harvesting).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2018.07.024", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2886463967", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53944865", "56481877", "195792539", "208869551", "85499798", "199634010"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134356986"}

Methods Sixty-eight patients (age: 58\u00b19 years, 24 males) with carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque were imaged on a 3 T MR scanner with both traditional multi-contrast vessel wall MR sequences (TOF, T1W, and T2W) and 3D SNAP sequence. The manual segmentations of carotid plaque components including LRNC, intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), calcification (CA) and fibrous tissue (FT) on traditional multi-contrast images were used as reference. By utilizing the intensity and morphological information from SNAP, a machine learning based two steps algorithm was developed to firstly identify LRNC (with or without IPH), CA and FT, and then segmented IPH from LRNC. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of proposed method. The overall pixel-wise accuracy, the slice-wise sensitivity & specificity & Youden's index, and the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the component area between the proposed method and the manual segmentation were reported. Results In the first step, all tested classifiers (Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) had overall pixel-wise accuracy higher than 0.88. For RF, GBDT and ANN classifiers, the correlation coefficients of areas were all higher than 0.82 (p Conclusions The RF is the overall best classifier for our proposed method, and the feasibility of using SNAP to identify plaque components, including LRNC, IPH, CA, and FT has been validated.

In intensive studies, recent GANs have shown promising results for reproducing training images. However, in spite of noise, they reproduce images with fidelity. As an alternative, we propose a novel family of GANs called noise robust GANs (NR-GANs), which can learn a clean image generator even when training images are noisy. In particular, NR-GANs can solve this problem without having complete noise information (e.g., the noise distribution type, noise amount, or signal-noise relationship). To achieve this, we introduce a noise generator and train it along with a clean image generator. However, without any constraints, there is no incentive to generate an image and noise separately. Therefore, we propose distribution and transformation constraints that encourage the noise generator to capture only the noise-specific components. In particular, considering such constraints under different assumptions, we devise two variants of NR-GANs for signal-independent noise and three variants of NR-GANs for signal-dependent noise. On three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of NR-GANs in noise robust image generation. Furthermore, we show the applicability of NR-GANs in image denoising.

The Region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the palmprint image. A tangent is drawn by finding the curves between fingers. The perpendicular bisector of this tangent divides the rectangular area enclosing the palmprint into two equal parts. For the purpose of feature extraction, ROI is divided into a suitable number of non-overlapping windows of different sizes and three types of features, viz. Sigmoid, Energy and Entropy features are extracted. These three sets of features are used for the authentication of users using Euclidean Distance and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifiers. The palmprint as a biometric modality is gaining acceptance in the field of biometrics. As compared to other biometric modalities, it is bestowed with enormous information serving as its discriminating power. We will discuss a few important contributions made on this modality. Matching of palmprints in (5) deals with the feasibility of identifying a person based on a set of features extracted along the prominent palm lines (and the associated line orientation) from a palmprint. Next a decision is made whether two palmprints belong to the same hand by computing a matching score between the corresponding sets of features of the reference and test palmprints. These two sets of features/orientations are matched using point matching technique which takes into account the nonlinear deformations as well as the outliers present in the two sets. An important indexing algorithm is proposed in (10) based on the palmprint classification. This algorithm uses a novel representation involving a two-stage classifier that provides the even-distributed categories. The representation scheme is directly derived from the principal line structures. This scheme does not use wrinkles and singular points and is capable of tolerating poor image quality. In this paper, we will explore features such as Sigmoid, Energy and Entropy extracted from a palmprint.

This implicit knowledge about the surgical workflow allows them to make decisions based on the current context and predict and prepare future steps. Acquiring this model takes time, therefore experienced scrub nurses are in high demand. Additionally to that, qualified scrub nurses are chronically scarce even in developed countries, which led to the development of robotic surgical assistants. In this paper we give a short introduction to surgical workflow analysis and show, how these methods can be applied to support both the education of human scrub nurses, as well as aid robotic scrub nurses. The field of surgical workflow analysis or surgical process modelling has developed in recent years with the goal to enable context-awareness in the operating room of the future [1, 2]. Current approaches to recognize the surgical process involve among other methods manual labeling [3], sensor-based instrument detection [4], evaluation of the laparoscopic video [5], and kinematic data from surgical robot systems [6]. The collected data is then usually turned into a specific model through different techniques, like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), or machine learning approaches like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or random forests [4, 5, 7]. The idea for Scrub Nurse Robots (SNR) has also been in development for several years [8]. Most systems rely on voice commands from the surgeon or another nurse to reach for instruments [9, 10], but one could argue that the state models used internally for the robots are already a step towards a surgical model. Enhancing these systems through surgical phase detection and automatic predictions of upcoming instrument requests would further improve the robots performance as it could then also prepare future actions, much like experienced scrub nurses do. This paper builds on the previous work in [4], so we will apply random forests on instrument detection data in order to recognize workflow phases during a surgery. We will use this information to deduce for every step in the surgery the most probable instruments to be requested next by the main surgeon.

In this study, a new model is proposed to predict long-term streamflow. Several lags that cover several years are abstracted using the potential of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) then after the selected inputs variables are imposed into the predictive model (i.e., Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)). The proposed model is compared with the stand-alone schema in which the optimum lags of the variables are supplied into the XGB and ELM models.

Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks.", "year": 1989, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi":

Text classification is a challenging task in event detection on social media because a large number of irrelevant texts are provided at the same time of collecting relevant texts. Most of existing text classification methods are based on the supervised machine learning which requires labeled and balanced training dataset. However, it is very difficult or even impossible for emergency event detection to collect balanced and labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a novel text classification method based on one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for emergency event detection, which takes only irrelevant texts as training data to detect the relevant texts to the emergency event. More importantly, we propose to extract variable length n-gram features for representing texts that takes the sequential relations and semantic relations among words into account.

Existing works on driving behaviors monitoring using smartphones only provide a coarsegrained result, i.e. distinguishing abnormal driving behaviors from normal ones. To improve drivers' awareness of their driving habits so as to prevent potential car accidents, we need to consider a finegrained monitoring approach, which not only detects abnormal driving behaviors but also identifies specific types of abnormal driving behaviors, i.e. Weaving, Swerving, Sideslipping, Fast U-turn, Turning with a wide radius and Sudden braking. Through empirical studies of the 6-month driving traces collected from real driving environments, we find that all of the six types of driving behaviors have their unique patterns on acceleration and orientation. Recognizing this observation, we further propose a finegrained abnormal Driving behavior Detection and iDentification system, D3, to perform real-time high-accurate abnormal driving behaviors monitoring using smartphone sensors. By extracting unique features from readings of smartphones' accelerometer and orientation sensor, we first identify sixteen representative features to capture the patterns of driving behaviors. Then, a machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is employed to train the features and output a classifier model which conducts fine-grained identification. From results of extensive experiments with 20 volunteers driving for another 4 months in real driving environments, we show that D3 achieves an average total accuracy of 95.36%.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SAHCN.2015.7338354", "venue": "2015 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)", "journal": "2015 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2176240313", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6863087", "111198384", "10826583", "411881", "15062608", "6562189", "899769", "12468103", "10207342", "1785393", "63624640", "59268717", "5156932", "14500908", "3982210", "961425", "54696"], "inbound_citations": ["3915013", "49183527", "204772124", "13332556", "210692010", "210838783", "4512133", "211106442", "49536438", "4711097", "26087128", "210930296", "148565161", "46926995", "155108786", "61811208", "47002746", "1571687", "4081853", "20405527", "62838572", "86441649", "61811077", "56596293", "160003973", "160003973", "13663341", "27194914", "4371434", "51930162", "14562097", "23492506", "15342591", "59234408", "203216722", "17648145", "86836598", "207758289", "117738749", "14200368", "46934982"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206551053"}

If possible this would allow for the development of BCI interfaces to train disorders of action and intention understanding beyond simple imitation, such as autism. We used EEG recordings from 20 healthy participants, as well as electrocorticography (ECoG) in one, based on a virtual reality setup. To test feasibility of discrimination between each type of imagery at the single trial level, time-frequency and source analysis were performed and further assessed by data-driven statistical classification using Support Vector Machines. The main observed differences between self-other imagery conditions in topographic maps were found in Frontal and Parieto-Occipital regions, in agreement with the presence of 2 independent non \u03bc related contributions in the low alpha frequency range. ECOG corroborated such separability. Source analysis also showed differences near the temporo-parietal junction and single-trial average classification accuracy between both types of motor imagery was 67 \u00b1 1%, and raised above 70% when 3 trials were used.

In this study, we aimed at applying machine learning techniques in automating herbarium species identification from leaf traits extracted from images of the families Annonaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Dipterocarpaceae. Furthermore, we investigated the application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) in improving classifier performance on the imbalance datasets. Three machine learning techniques namely Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied with/without SMOTE. For Annonaceae species, the best accuracy was 56% by LDA after applying SMOTE. For Euphorbiaceae, the best accuracy was 79% by SVM without SMOTE. For inter-species classification between Annonaceae and Euphorbiaceae, the best accuracy of 63% was achieved by LDA without SMOTE. An accuracy of 85% was achieved by LDA for Dipterocarpaceae species while 91% accuracy was obtained by both RF and SVM for inter-family classification between the two balanced datasets of Annonaceae and Euphorbiaceae.

However, traditional WiFi based IPS usually requires a central server to collect and process data, which is tremendously vulnerable to server breakdown and communication link failure. To address this issue, we propose Consensus-based Parallel ELM (CPELM) to enhance the robustness by distributing the data on different computation nodes. Specifically, each node keeps updating the corresponding terms in the ELM regression equation as a weighted average of those from neighboring nodes based on the distributed consensus iterative scheme. Upon the agreement of the regression equation within the network, the output weight of ELM can be calculated on some nodes and propagated to other nodes. Extensive simulation with real data has demonstrated that CPELM is able to produce same level of localization accuracy as centralized ELM without incurring additional computational cost, and in the meanwhile provides more robustness to the entire IPS in case of server breakdown and link failures.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841684", "venue": "2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)", "journal": "2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2584947161", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["215609151", "205287824", "206824368", "1718754", "13889600", "8561842", "116858", "561285", "40731222", "23991733", "981528", "124743369"], "inbound_citations": ["58624430", "58670618", "31976323", "52122218", "41227133", "52816888", "67867696"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19218703"}

EEG data are generally only available in small quantities, they are high-dimensional with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and there is considerable variability between individual subjects and recording sessions. Our proposed techniques specifically address these challenges for feature learning. Cross-trial encoding forces auto-encoders to focus on features that are stable across trials. Similarity-constraint encoders learn features that allow to distinguish between classes by demanding that two trials from the same class are more similar to each other than to trials from other classes. This tuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets. Hydra-nets allow for separate processing pathways adapting to subsets of a dataset and thus combine the advantages of individual feature learning (better adaptation of early, low-level processing) with group model training (better generalization of higher-level processing in deeper layers). This way, models can, for instance, adapt to each subject individually to compensate for differences in spatial patterns due to anatomical differences or variance in electrode positions.

Connectionism is a theory from behaviorism which posits that learning happens when desirable associations between stimulus and response are positively rewarded and so create lasting associations. Many studies have reported the efficacy of the elements of connectionism in educational practice. However, being an old theory, its usefulness in relation to modern learning theory is little researched. Therefore, this study investigates the significance of the elements of connectionism in relation to the contemporary conception of learning as schema construction as defined by the contemporary schema theory. A schema is a set of common and logical notions which constitute a network of relationships that make up a person's knowledge and understanding structure. Factor, correlation, and regression analyses and an independent samples t-test show that connectionism is relevant to the creation of schemata. Readiness was found to be the most significant element from connectionism relevant for schema construction with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.49 and a medium to large effect size. Therefore, while repetition and reinforcement have significant contributions to schema construction, the extent to which students are physically, emotionally and psychologically ready to learn is very important to achieving effective learning.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/weef.2017.8467129", "venue": "2017 7th World Engineering Education Forum (WEEF)", "journal": "2017 7th World Engineering Education Forum (WEEF)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2892523616", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["32171758", "10711039", "39896233", "2571538", "143236610", "143555069", "62721148", "143982467", "145183447", "155010286", "145781831", "12401989", "151652837", "54723258", "42624160"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52305546"}

Early treatment of complications is associated with a more favorable prognosis, hence biomarkers to enable early detection and to monitor treatments may be useful. Methods: Plasma (EDTA) samples were obtained from 30 adult (M/F = 20/10) individuals with T1D, age 42\u00b116 years, T1D duration 24\u00b111 years, HbA1c 7.5\u00b11.2% and BMI 26.5\u00b14.0 kg/m 2 (15 with microvascular complications (retinopathy or nephropathy) - CX+, and 15 without complications - CX-) and compared with 15 nondiabetic controls (CON, matched age, gender, smoking and BMI). T1D CX+ and CX- individuals were matched for age, gender, diabetes duration, smoking, BMI, HbA1c and insulin therapy modality (CSII/MDI). In these discovery cohort samples, profiling of 754 miRs was done using a high throughput probe based quantitative PCR on nanofluidics Open Array platform . Results were analyzed using independent T test, Mann-Whitney test and classification trees. Statistical analysis was undertaken using R (ver. 3.5.1) and XLStat (ver. 2018.6). Results: Of 754 available miRs on the array, 186 miRs were detectable in plasma. Using an unbiased approach expression of 32 miRs differed significantly in CON vs. T1D and 16 miRs were differentially expressed between CX+ and CX- T1D subjects. Using a Random Forest wrapper algorithm 5 miRs were identified with importance for segregating CX+ vs. CX- status: miR-483-5p, miR-328, miR-1274B, miR-7 and miR-30a-5p. In logistic regression those 5 miRs provided a ROC curve with AUC=0.90 for the CX+ vs. CX- discrimination. Conclusion: In a discovery analysis of well- matched CX+ and CX- selected miRs provided good discrimination between T1D CX status.

Biometric innovations are the establishment of the personal identification system. A biometric system recognizes a person based on a few characteristics or forms. This is in many instances watched in the region of security, privacy, and forensics. Even for the great of unimodal biometric systems, it is frequently no longer viable to achieve a greater attention rate. Face and iris identification proof has been utilized in one of a kind biometric purpose. Other than moving forward the confirmation execution, the fusion of both of the biometrics has a few other preferences such as user population coverage and reducing enrolment failure. We utilize two distinctive methodologies for intertwining iris and face classifiers. The to begin with the procedure is Iris and face biometrics is created a recognition demonstrate. Different surface feature is extricated utilizing local binary pattern (LBP). The moment methodology is to treat the coordinating separations of face and iris classifiers as a two-dimensional feature vector and utilize a classifier support vector machine (SVM).

When a project has no historical labeled defect data, cross project defect prediction (CPDP) is an alternative technique for this scenario. CPDP utilizes labeled defect data of an external project to construct a classification model to predict the module labels of the current project. Transfer learning based CPDP methods are the current mainstream. In general, such methods aim to minimize the distribution differences between the data of the two projects. However, previous methods mainly focus on the marginal distribution difference but ignore the conditional distribution difference, which will lead to unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we use a novel balanced distribution adaptation (BDA) based transfer learning method to narrow this gap. BDA simultaneously considers the two kinds of distribution differences and adaptively assigns different weights to them. To evaluate the effectiveness of BDA for CPDP performance, we conduct experiments on 18 projects from four datasets using six indicators (i.e., F-measure, g-means, Balance, AUC, EARecall, and EAF-measure).

The comparison between sd-fMCI and sd-aMCI, as well as the analysis of the other diffusion parameters, yielded no significant group differences. The individual-level SVM analysis provided discrimination between the MCI subtypes with accuracies around 97%.

However, there are still some challenges to estimate a \u201cgood\u201d FBN, particularly due to the poor quality and limited quantity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the target domain (i.e., MCI study).

The study was carried out in a restoration area with about 74 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A., in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, Near Infrared) on UAV and LIDAR data composition (intensity image, Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model, normalized Digital Surface Model). The monitored restoration indicator was the land cover separated in three classes: canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the ML and RF algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifications, the Overall Accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index were used, and the last was compared by Z test. The area occupied by different land cover classes was calculated using ArcGIS and R. The results of OA, Kappa and visual evaluation of the images were excellent in all combinations of the imaging methods and algorithms analyzed. When Kappa values for the two algorithms were compared, RF presented better performance than ML with significant difference, but when sensors (UAV camera and LIDAR) were compared, there were no significant differences. There was little difference between the area occupied by each land cover classes generated by UAV and LIDAR images. The highest cover was generated for canopy cover followed by grass cover and bare soil in all classified images, indicating the need of adaptive management interventions to correct the area trajectory towards the restoration success.

In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance.

However, the application of formal methods for software verification is still limited in practise. It is acknowledged that the task of formally stating requirements by specifying the formal properties is a major hindrance. The verification step itself has its shortcoming in its scalability and its limitation to predefined proof tactics in case of automated theorem proving (ATP). These constraints are reduced today by the interaction of the user with the theorem prover (TP) during the execution of the proof. However, this is difficult for non-experts. The objectives of the presented PhD project are the automated inference of declarative property specifications from example data specified by the engineer for a function under development and their automated verification on abstract model level and on code level. We propose the meta-model for Scenario Modeling Language (SML) that allows to specify example data. For the automated property generation we are motivated by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques for first-order logic in pure mathematics. We propose modifications to its algorithm that allow to process the information that is incorporated in the meta-model of SML.

Since damages on the asphalt road, impose economic setbacks and concern for the users, governmental authorities are looking for a proactive approach to detect and classify distresses in their \"early\" stages. As a reason, governmental authorities like the Province of Zuid-Holland (PZH) yearly inspect the road network, which was optimal until now, but as the traffic flows are increasing and weather conditions are worsening, a new approach is required to mitigate the need for a frequent, cost-effective and reliable inspection method. Modern data sources such as smartphones are the biggest data generators. Having an intriguing number of sensors and in-built features, governmental and private authorities are just starting to acknowledge the potential of such crowd-sourced data generators. In this research data-types like vibration and imagery were gathered and synthesized to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the 3 data-driven models. A 7-step methodology was implemented to build all the machine learning models. At first, vibration data was gathered to detect road anomalies and predict the International Roughness Index (IRI), by building a Random Forest decision tree. Secondly, a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) was constructed and utilized to classify pavement surface distresses. The last model, is a next step towards autonomously distinguishing the classified distress with its severity ranking.

Electrical load consumption can be affected by both internal and external factors so that it is hard to forecast accurately due to the random influencing factors such as weather. Besides complicated and numerous internal patterns, electrical load shows obvious yearly, seasonal, and weekly quasi-periodicity. Traditional regression-based models and shallow neural network models cannot accurately learn the complicated inner patterns of the electrical load. Long short-term memory (LSTM) model features a strong learning capacity to capture the time dependence of the time series and presents the state-of-the-art performance. However, as the time span increases, LSTM becomes much harder to train because it cannot completely avoid the vanishing gradient problem in recurrent neural networks. Then, LSTM models cannot capture the dependence over large time span which is of potency to enhance STLF. Moreover, electrical loads feature data imbalance where some load patterns in high/low temperature zones are more complicated but occur much less often than those in mild temperature zones, which severely degrades the LSTM-based STLF algorithms. To fully exploit the information beneath the high correlation of load segments over large time spans and combat the data imbalance, a deep ensemble learning model within active learning framework is proposed, which consists of a selector and a predictor. The selector actively selects several key load segments with the most similar pattern as the current one to train the predictor, and the predictor is an ensemble learning-based deep learning machine integrating LSTM and multi-layer preceptor (MLP). The LSTM is capable of capturing the short-term dependence of the electrical load, and the MLP integrates both the key history load segments and the outcome of LSTM for better forecasting.

Current generation Anti-Virus (AV) engines employ a signature-template type detection approach where malware can easily evade existing signatures in the database. This reduces the capability of current AV engines in detecting malware. In this paper we propose a hybrid framework for malware detection by using the hybrids of Support Vector Machines Wrapper, Maximum-Relevance-Minimum-Redundancy Filter heuristics where Application Program Interface (API) call statistics are used as a malware features. The novelty of our hybrid framework is that it injects the filter's ranking score in the wrapper selection process and combines the properties of both wrapper and filters and API call statistics which can detect malware based on the nature of infectious actions instead of signature. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of hybrid approach has not been explored yet in the literature in the context of feature selection and malware detection. Knowledge about the intrinsic characteristics of malicious activities is determined by the API call statistics which is injected as a filter score into the wrapper's backward elimination process in order to find the most significant APIs. While using the most significant APIs in the wrapper classification on both obfuscated and benign types malware datasets, the results show that the proposed hybrid framework clearly surpasses the existing models including the independent filters and wrappers using only a very compact set of significant APIs. The performances of the proposed and existing models have further been compared using binary logistic regression. Various goodness of fit comparison criteria such as Chi Square, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve ROC are deployed to identify the best performing models.

These schemes transform biometric features and perform pattern matching without restoring the original features. Although they strongly prevent the leakage of the original features, the response time can be very long in a large-scale biometric identification system. Most of the existing indexing schemes cannot be used to speed up the biometric identification system over networks since a biometric index leaks some information about the original feature. Secure and efficient indexing is a major challenge in large-scale biometric identification over networks. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing scheme that is promising with regard to both security and efficiency. The proposed indexing scheme transforms a permutation-based index, which is the state-of-the-art index in the field of similarity search, and performs a query search without recovering the original index.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel classification method with privileged information based on Gaussian processes, called \"soft-label-transferred Gaussian process (SLT-GP).\" Our basic idea is that we construct another learning task of predicting soft labels (continuous values) obtained from privileged information and we perform transfer learning from this task to the target task of predicting hard labels.

In the proposed methodology, we use K-means clustering for partitioning each category EEG data set (e.g. healthy; epileptic seizure) into several clusters and then extract some representative characteristics from each cluster. Subsequently, we integrate all the features from all the clusters in one feature set and then evaluate that feature set by three well-known machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive bayes and Logistic regression.

To address this deficiency, a novel activation function with an affine transformation (AT) on its input is introduced into the ELM, which leads to an improved ELM algorithm that is referred to as an AT-ELM in this paper. The scaling and translation parameters of the AT activation function are computed based on the maximum entropy principle in such a way that the hidden layer outputs approximately obey a uniform distribution. Application of the AT-ELM algorithm in nonlinear function regression shows its robustness to the range scaling of the network inputs. Experiments on nonlinear function regression, real-world data set classification, and benchmark image recognition demonstrate better performance for the AT-ELM compared with the original ELM, the regularized ELM, and the kernel ELM. Recognition results on benchmark image data sets also reveal that the AT-ELM outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in general.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30442621", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2877468", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2901276090", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["19445927", "116858", "13936498", "1417306", "7859623", "23155638", "3570420", "5516512", "11650019", "1411612", "13822802", "11116184", "14670662", "206757279", "6549308", "8327677", "9456719", "14425461", "8561842", "43930966", "21708920", "16329533", "118517", "47266008", "12361989", "54580862", "206634205", "15158069", "5808102", "151231", "5137544", "18800", "195908774", "16489696", "13740328", "14083350", "15037168", "685382", "17870175", "120800745", "239520", "15380825", "125898915", "13144767", "207148609", "36002046", "23712416", "19028028"], "inbound_citations": ["204702045", "208211901", "202688842", "73444946"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53565993"}

This study aims to evaluate the discriminating performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), employed with various transfer learning strategies, on the classification of specific features of osteoporosis in DPRs. For objective labeling, we collected a dataset containing 680 images from different patients who underwent both skeletal bone mineral density and digital panoramic radiographic examinations at the Korea University Ansan Hospital between 2009 and 2018. Four study groups were used to evaluate the impact of various transfer learning strategies on deep CNN models as follows: a basic CNN model with three convolutional layers (CNN3), visual geometry group deep CNN model (VGG-16), transfer learning model from VGG-16 (VGG-16_TF), and fine-tuning with the transfer learning model (VGG-16_TF_FT). The best performing model achieved an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.858. In this study, transfer learning and fine-tuning improved the performance of a deep CNN for screening osteoporosis in DPR images. In addition, using the gradient-weighted class activation mapping technique, a visual interpretation of the best performing deep CNN model indicated that the model relied on image features in the lower left and right border of the mandibular.

Spectral variable selection is an important strategy in spectrum modeling analysis, because it tends to parsimonious data representation and can lead to multivariate models with better performance. In order to simply calibration models, the preprocessed spectra were then used to select sensitive wavelengths by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), Random frog and Successive Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods. Different numbers of sensitive wavelengths were selected by different variable selection methods with SNV preprocessing method. Partial least squares (PLS) was used to build models with the full spectra, and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was applied to build models with the selected wavelength variables. The overall results showed that ELM model performed better than PLS model, and the ELM model with the selected wavelengths based on CARS obtained the best results with the determination coefficient (R2), RMSEP and RPD were 0.82, 14.48 and 2.34 for prediction set. The results indicated that it was feasible to use UV/Vis with characteristic wavelengths which were obtained by CARS variable selection method, combined with ELM calibration could apply for the rapid and accurate determination of COD in aquaculture water.

Typically this data is catalogued and stored in accordance with regulatory requirements, but rarely is it used to enhance subsequent production.

The identification and/or development of tools capable of providing access to this valuable, untapped resource are therefore an important area for research. ::: The main objective of this research is to investigate whether it is possible to attain knowledge from the information inherent within process data. The approach adopted in this thesis is to utilise the tools and techniques prevalent in the areas of data mining and pattern recognition. Through the application of these techniques, it is hypothesised that useful information can be acquired. Specifically the industrial sponsors of the research, Avecia Biologics, are interested in looking at methods for comparing new proteins to those they have previously worked on, with the intention of inferring information pertaining to the large scale manufacturing route for different processes. It is hypothesised that by comparing proteins and looking for similarities at the molecular level, it could be possible to identify potential pit-falls and bottlenecks in the recovery process before they occur. This would then allow Avecia to highlight areas of process development that may require specific attention. ::: Two main techniques are the primary focus of the study; the Self-Organising Map (SOM) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Contrary to common intuition, the features extracted through PCA gave the best results compared to those extracted through non-parametric discriminant analysis (NDA) or random projections. The only ensemble method whose accuracy was statistically indistinguishable from that of Rotation Forest was LogitBoost although it gave slightly inferior results on 20 out of the 32 benchmark data sets. It appeared that the main factor for the success of Rotation Forest is that the transformation matrix employed to calculate the (linear) extracted features is sparse.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-72523-7_46", "venue": "MCS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1865546541", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1088806", "209099422", "207738357", "14669208", "7935550", "7553535", "2071045", "6875871", "62359231", "206617934", "14893859", "37236679", "2619125", "6847493", "18099999", "14483466", "198489576", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["2873035", "3108052", "63548741", "55784005", "17100488", "40210273", "126961375", "60965782", "21334984", "16088404", "53211565", "22526091", "15107573", "16394321", "214728420", "15744514", "195811802", "1608931", "46897307", "24827470", "15781431", "202236743", "15446164", "17226917", "44906176", "17571244", "37817701", "209449736", "18897979", "54183946", "644469", "15637777", "14617197", "125069063", "1537057", "3030310", "56175008", "14677576", "59435797", "17417717", "30136531", "16398235", "210193625", "150375667", "51931783", "5508035", "33326955", "8219577", "15867265", "14845757", "14010214", "37520336", "8676372", "14575090", "18671035", "38036326", "10580365", "15410291", "12194514", "15271758", "198146183"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8888702"}

Using a training set of 136 GRBs, 17 of which are high-z, our cross-validated performance metrics suggest that following up on just 20% of the GRBs will yield roughly 55% of all high-redshift events.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-3520-4_61", "venue": "Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy V", "journal": "Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy V", "mag_id": "110021360", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115389823"}

Consequently, we conducted 108 experiments. For these, three Feature types (1-grams, 2-grams, and 3-grams) of roots, stems and full words were used. For feature selection method, chi square was employed with three thresholds for numbers of features (100, 500, and 1000).

Abnormal expression of human microRNA-200a (hsa-miRNA-200a or miR-200a) has previously been characterized as a clinically noticeable biomarker in several cancers, but its role in CRC is still unclear. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: Three CRC miRNA expression datasets were integratively analyzed by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation (LASSO) and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms. Nine candidate miRNAs were identified and validated for diagnostic and prognostic capability with the prediction model. The potential roles of the tumor suppressor miR-200a-3p in invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CRC cells were elaborated by in vitro studies. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: Nine miRNAs (miR-492, miR-200a, miR-338, miR-29c, miR-101, miR-148a, miR-92a, miR-424, and miR-210) were identified as potentially useful diagnostic biomarkers in the clinic. The overall accuracy rate of the nine miRNAs in the diagnostic model was 0.94, 0.89, and 0.978 in the testing, validation, and independent validation dataset, respectively. CRC patients in the GSE29622 cohort were separated by the prognostic model into the low-risk score group and the high-risk score group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.872 and 0.783 for predicting the 1- to 10-year survival of CRC patients. The performance of the prognostic model was validated by an independent TCGA-Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD) dataset with AUC values between 0.911 and 0.796 in predicting 1- to 10-year survival. Nomograms comprising risk scores, tumor stage, and TNM staging were generated for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) in the GSE29622 and TCGA-COAD datasets. Colony formation, invasion, and migration in DLD1 and SW480 cells were suppressed by overexpression of miR-200a-3p. Inhibition of miR-200a-3p function contributed to abnormal colony formation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). miR-200a-3p binding sites were located within the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) mRNA. ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: We developed and validated a diagnostic and prognostic prediction model for CRC. miR-200a-3p was determined to be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CRC.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7100107", "pubmed_id": "32265979", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2020.00192", "venue": "Frontiers in Genetics", "journal": "Frontiers in Genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3011356804", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["39621204", "73505169", "6761945", "23746270", "52033405", "215304437", "215612633", "4709901", "215256722", "4402778", "4537627", "746451", "19514445", "4773349", "205185091", "206956573", "119104512", "52136895", "3772051", "25060396", "20700155", "16249559", "73502309", "14588918", "9301272", "5471799", "7128851", "10238626", "11572735", "15077482", "35867816", "11173423", "205088946", "17655209", "13964261", "23245088", "13552241", "22166302", "206247785", "35092435", "8407522", "28542082", "5075890", "16216001", "37313593", "14576344", "5980873"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213190969"}

Therefore, there is a crucial need to construct a balanced and high-quality exam, which satisfies different cognitive levels. Thus, many lecturers rely on Bloom's taxonomy cognitive domain, which is a popular framework developed for the purpose of assessing students' intellectual abilities and skills. Several works have been proposed to automatically handle the classification of questions in accordance with Bloom's taxonomy. Most of these works classify questions according to specific domain. As a result, there is a lack of technique of classifying questions that belong to the multi-domain areas. The aim of this paper is to present a classification model to classify exam questions based on Bloom's taxonomy that belong to several areas. This study proposes a method for classifying questions automatically, by extracting two features, TFPOS-IDF and word2vec. The purpose of the first feature was to calculate the term frequency-inverse document frequency based on part of speech, in order to assign a suitable weight for essential words in the question. The second feature, pre-trained word2vec, was used to boost the classification process. Then, the combination of these features was fed into three different classifiers; K-Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine, in order to classify the questions. The experiments used two datasets. The first dataset contained 141 questions, while the other dataset contained 600 questions. The classification result for the first dataset achieved an average of 71.1%, 82.3% and 83.7% weighted F1-measure respectively. The classification result for the second dataset achieved an average of 85.4%, 89.4% and 89.7% weighted F1-measure respectively.

An experimental data bank for detail evaluation of this component in the vapor compression systems has need of a highly equipped laboratory and proper instruments.

We propose a Hybrid-Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (Hybrid-ANFIS) for the fast and precise estimation of the discharge temperature, refrigerant mass flow rate, and electrical power of the OFSCs. The performance of the Hybrid-ANFIS is checked against the other well-known models, including the Particle Swarm Optimization-Artificial Neural Network, Coupled Simulated Annealing-Least Square Support Vector Machine, Genetic Algorithm-Least Square Support Vector Machine, and the existing correlations in the open literature. The results indicated that the proposed Hybrid-ANFIS model is more accurate and has the promising potential for estimating the desired parameters by introducing a coefficient of determination higher than 0.998. The application of the suggested model is further illustrated against the experimental data and new test conditions are evaluated. Finally, the Leverage algorithm, which is a novel statistical approach, is implemented to assess the quality of the experimental data and diagnose the probable doubtful data samples.

It is a challenging task to reduce the global warming effects in a short period, knowing that the human population is increasing along with the electricity and energy demand. In order to reduce the effects, renewable energy is presented as an alternative method to produce energy in a way that will not harm the environment. Oil palm is one of the agricultural crops that produces huge amount of biomass which can be processed and used as a renewable energy source. In 2016, Malaysia has reported over 5 million hectares of land were covered by oil palm plantations. Placing Malaysia as the second largest country of oil palm producer in the world has given it an advantage to produce renewable energy source. However, there is a need to monitor the sustainability of oil palm plantations in Malaysia via effective mapping approaches. This study utilised two different platforms (open source and commercial) using a machine learning algorithm namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform oil palm mapping. An open source Python programming-based technique utilising Scikit-learn module was performed to map the oil palm distribution and the result produced had an overall accuracy of 91.39%.

In order to enhance the image, LRMD i.e. Low rank matrix decomposition is applied on image to remove the noises. It describes the problem of finding and exploiting low-dimensional structures in high- dimensional data.

Then noisy image and enhanced image are compared to obtain higher signal to noise ratio and other parameters like Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, structural similarity index, Mean Square Error for qualitative assessment to the enhancement result.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2556190775", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125337177"}

We claim that the major distinction is that, while both Connectionist and Classical architectures postulate representational mental states, the latter but not the former are committed to a symbol-level of representation, or to a \u2018language of thought\u2019: i.e., to representational states that have combinatorial syntactic and semantic structure. Several arguments for combinatorial structure in mental representations are then reviewed. These include arguments based on the \u2018systematicity\u2019 of mental representation: i.e., on the fact that cognitive capacities always exhibit certain symmetries, so that the ability to entertain a given thought implies the ability to entertain thoughts with semantically related contents. We claim that such arguments make a powerful case that mind/brain architecture is not Connectionist at the cognitive level. We then consider the possibility that Connectionism may provide an account of the neural (or \u2018abstract neurological\u2019) structures in which Classical cognitive architecture is implemented. We survey a number of the standard arguments that have been offered in favor of Connectionism, and conclude that they are coherent only on this interpretation.", "year": 1988, "arxiv_id": null,

The SFA integrates the firefly algorithm (FA), chaotic map (CM), adaptive inertia weight (AIW), and Levy flight (LF). First, an adaptive approach and randomization methods (i.e., CM, AIW, and LF) were incorporated in FA to construct an effective metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization. The SFA was then used to optimize the hyperparameters of the LS-SVR model.

The QoSR is always a tricky problem to determine an optimum route that satisfies variety of necessary constraints in a MANET. The problem is also declared as NP-hard due to the nature of constant topology variation of the MANETs. Thus a solution technique that embarks upon the challenges of the QoSR problem is needed to be underpinned. This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm by modifying the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) with the new position updating mechanism. This updating mechanism is derived from the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, where the candidates learn from diversified search regions. Thus the CSA will act as the main search procedure guided by the updating mechanism derived from DE, called tuned CSA (TCSA). Numerical simulations on MANETs are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TCSA method by determining an optimum route that satisfies various Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The results are compared with some of the existing techniques in the literature; therefore the superiority of the proposed method is established.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4606039", "pubmed_id": "26495429", "doi": "10.1155/2015/703480", "venue": "TheScientificWorldJournal", "journal": "TheScientificWorldJournal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2165291585", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6263366", "167560", "14088590", "17837339", "24762042", "460263", "1762301", "2658925", "43480857", "33321549", "991041", "15267433", "31217963", "38856537", "12541642", "6944989", "61445666", "206893882", "123664420", "64040922", "34889796", "122024546", "12038595", "39218065", "3340118"], "inbound_citations": ["199013800"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14529434"}

Vehicle-related problems are being widely explored and applied practically. Among various techniques, computer vision and machine learning algorithms have been the most popular ones since a vast of video/image surveillance data are available for research, nowadays. In this thesis, vision-based approaches for vehicle detection, recognition, and re-identification are extensively investigated. Moreover, to address different challenges, several novel methods are proposed to overcome weaknesses of previous works and achieve compelling performance. ::: Deep visual feature learning has been widely researched in the past five years and obtained huge progress in many applications including image classification, image retrieval, object detection, image segmentation and image generation. Compared with traditional machine learning methods which consist of hand-crafted feature extraction and shallow model learning, deep neural networks can learn hierarchical feature representations from low-level to high-level features to get more robust recognition precision. For some specific tasks, researchers prefer to embed feature learning and classification/regression methods into end-to-end models, which can benefit both the accuracy and efficiency. In this thesis, deep models are mainly investigated to study the research problems. ::: Vehicle detection is the most fundamental task in intelligent video surveillance but faces many challenges such as severe illumination and viewpoint variations, occlusions and multi-scale problems. Moreover, learning vehicles\u2019 diverse attributes is also an interesting and valuable problem. To address these tasks and their difficulties, a fast framework of Detection and Annotation for Vehicles (DAVE) is presented, which effectively combines vehicle detection and attributes annotation. DAVE consists of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): afastvehicleproposalnetwork(FVPN)forvehicle-likeobjectsextraction and an attributes learning network (ALN) aiming to verify each proposal and infer each vehicle\u2019s pose, color and type simultaneously. These two nets are jointly optimized so that the abundant latent knowledge learned from the ALN can be exploited to guide FVPN training. Once the model is trained, it can achieve efficient vehicle detection and annotation for real-world traffic surveillance data. ::: The second research problem of the thesis focuses on vehicle re-identification (re-ID). Vehicle re-ID aims to identify a target vehicle in different cameras with non-overlapping views. It has received far less attention in the computer vision community than the prevalent person re-ID problem. Possible reasons for this slow progress are the lack of appropriate research data and the special 3D structure of a vehicle. Previous works have generally focused on some specific views (e.g. front), but these methods are less effective in realistic scenarios where vehicles usually appear in arbitrary view points to cameras. In this thesis, I focus on the uncertainty of vehicle viewpoint in re-ID, proposing four different approaches to address the multi-view vehicle re-ID problem: (1) The Spatially Concatenated ConvNet (SCCN) in an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn transformations across different viewpoints of a vehicle, and then spatially concatenate all the feature maps for further fusing them into a multi-view feature representation. (2) A Cross-View Generative Adversarial Network (XVGAN)is designed to take an input image\u2019s feature as conditional embedding to effectively infer cross-view images. The features of the inferred and original images are combined to learn distance metrics for re-ID.(3)The great advantages of a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) loop are investigated of modeling transformations across continuous view variation of a vehicle. (4) A Viewpoint-aware Attentive Multi-view Inference (VAMI) model is proposed, adopting a viewpoint-aware attention model to select core regions at different viewpoints and then performing multi-view feature inference by an adversarial training architecture.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2891048484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69253967"}

It is a well researched problem with extensive commercial applications such as digital camera, video compression, medical imaging and so on. Most super resolution works focus on the features learning architecture, which can recover the texture details as close as possible. However, these works suffer from the following challenges: (1) The low-resolution (LR) training images are artificially synthesized using HR images with bicubic downsampling, which have much richer-information than real demosaic-upscaled mobile images. The mismatch between training and inference mobile data heavily blocks the improvement of practical super resolution algorithms. (2) These methods cannot effectively handle the blind distortions during super resolution in practical applications. In this work, an end-to-end novel framework, including high-to-low network and low-to-high network, is proposed to solve the above problems with dual Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). First, the above mismatch problems are well explored with the high-to-low network, where clear high-resolution image and the corresponding realistic low-resolution image pairs can be generated.

During the last decade, many new nonlinear methods for dimension reduction have been proposed, but it is still unclear how well these methods capture the underlying structure of microarray gene expression data. In this study, we assessed the performance of the PCA approach and of six nonlinear dimension reduction methods, namely Kernel PCA, Locally Linear Embedding, Isomap, Diffusion Maps, Laplacian Eigenmaps and Maximum Variance Unfolding, in terms of visualization of microarray data.ResultsA systematic benchmark, consisting of Support Vector Machine classification, cluster validation and noise evaluations was applied to ten microarray and several simulated datasets. Significant differences between PCA and most of the nonlinear methods were observed in two and three dimensional target spaces. With an increasing number of dimensions and an increasing number of differentially expressed genes, all methods showed similar performance. PCA and Diffusion Maps responded less sensitive to noise than the other nonlinear methods.ConclusionsLocally Linear Embedding and Isomap showed a superior performance on all datasets.

In this article, we present the results of our DL system designed to determine optic disc laterality, right eye vs left eye, in the presence of both normal and abnormal optic discs. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Using transfer learning, we modified the ResNet-152 deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), pretrained on ImageNet, to determine the optic disc laterality. After a 5-fold cross-validation, we generated receiver operating characteristic curves and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values to evaluate performance. The data set consisted of 576 color fundus photographs (51% right and 49% left). Both 30\u00b0 photographs centered on the optic disc (63%) and photographs with varying degree of optic disc centration and/or wider field of view (37%) were included. Both normal (27%) and abnormal (73%) optic discs were included. Various neuro-ophthalmological diseases were represented, such as, but not limited to, atrophy, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, hypoplasia, and papilledema. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Using 5-fold cross-validation (70% training; 10% validation; 20% testing), our DCNN for classifying right vs left optic disc achieved an average AUC of 0.999 (\u00b10.002) with optimal threshold values, yielding an average accuracy of 98.78% (\u00b11.52%), sensitivity of 98.60% (\u00b11.72%), and specificity of 98.97% (\u00b11.38%).

Intuitively, a simple context-free decision process can be thought of as an episodic finite-state MDP with a stack. In fact, many reinforcement learning methods can be applied to the class of simple context-free decision processes with natural modification on their equations. On the other hand, in grammatical inference area, some non-regular subclasses of simple grammars, such as very simple grammars and right-unique simple grammars, have been found to be efficiently identifiable in the limit from positive data. Especially, the class of right-unique simple decision processes, which are simple context-free processes based on right-unique simple grammars, is a superset of the class of episodic finite-state MDPs. Because episodic states histories are regarded as positive data, one might expect that those positive results in grammatical inference area could be applied to reinforcement learning directly. However, one should note that grammars generating the same language can generate different probabilistic languages. While it is enough to find a process representing the target language in the scheme of identification in the limit, in reinforcement learning, one has to find a process representing the target probabilistic language. Therefore, we need to modify the results in grammatical inference area for applying them to reinforcement learning. Actually, a grammar can be more general than another in the sense that it generates all the probabilistic languages generated by the other. Hence, finding a most general grammar gives a solution to this problem. This chapter however shows that both classes of simple grammars and right-unique simple grammars do not admit most general grammars. Besides, we show that there is an intermediate class between right-unique simple grammars and simple grammars that admits an algorithm computing a most general grammar from any two grammars whose languages coincide. We present an algorithm that learns the optimal actions under right-unique simple contextfree processes, by concatenating the algorithm learning right-unique simple grammars from", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/5276", "venue": "Reinforcement Learning", "journal": "Reinforcement Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2150822340", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["18300595", "386824", "7989664", "3838926", "45136408", "5613003", "15154520", "12960872", "41265315", "14876439", "33929570", "33929570"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11379661"}

Here, we address this issue by exploring genome-wide profiles of 24 histone modifications in two distinct human cell types, embryonic stem cells and lung fibroblasts. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types.

The first estimation technique uses the prototypes of the i-th neuron and its K nearest neighbors to build the corresponding local linear model. The second technique builds the i-th local linear model using the data vectors that are mapped into the regions comprised of the Voronoi cells of the i-th neuron and its K nearest neighbors. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed techniques is carried out for the task of inverse identification of three benchmarking Single Input/Single Output (SISO) dynamical systems. Their performances are compared to those achieved by the Multilayer Perceptron and the Extreme Learning Machine networks.

In this work, we introduce the notion of attributed random walks which serves as a basis for generalizing existing methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and many others that leverage random walks. Our proposed framework enables these methods to be more widely applicable for both transductive and inductive learning as well as for use on graphs with attributes (if available). This is achieved by learning functions that generalize to new nodes and graphs. We show that our proposed framework is effective with an average AUC improvement of 16.1% while requiring on average 853 times less space than existing methods on a variety of graphs from several domains.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1709.04596", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2753998599", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6230096", "11482293", "7657656", "3649571", "5865347", "14871685", "121031812", "16689401", "62695172", "15055667", "3582696", "3919301", "8222827", "60047892", "489789", "207238980", "4755450", "10443309", "19908368", "13675759", "918678", "7036086", "19013491", "14707542", "29770705", "40505709", "5959482", "18764978", "4990281", "1508503", "12877077", "3051291", "4783118", "121714719", "16662585", "2980810", "10141934", "14571424", "15380232", "34526687", "1344273", "2703447", "3488610", "8399404", "2745943", "191396", "2452205", "7008752", "27825253", "1052837"], "inbound_citations": ["52048602", "41917762", "118686695", "13747041", "58028844"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26575562"}

Unlike many existing face recognition systems, where conventional feature descriptors, such as local binary patterns and Gabor features, are used for face representation, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method to learn hierarchical feature representation. Since different face regions have different physical characteristics, we propose to use different feature dictionaries to represent them, and to learn multiple yet related feature projection matrices for these regions simultaneously. Hence position-specific discriminative information can be exploited for face representation. Having learned these feature projections for different face regions, we perform spatial pooling for face patches within each region to enhance the representative power of the learned features.

Existing techniques have several drawbacks: i) rule-based approaches are vulnerable because it needs all the signatures defined for the possible attacks, ii) anomaly-based approaches are not efficient because it is easy to find ways to launch attacks that bypass detection, and iii) both rule-based and anomaly-based approaches heavily rely on domain knowledge of networked system and cyber security. The major challenge to existing methods is to understand novel attack scenarios and design a model to detect novel and more serious attacks. In this paper, we investigate network attacks and unveil the key activities and the relationships between these activities. For that reason, we propose methods to understand the network security practices using theoretic concepts such as graph kernels. In addition, we integrate graph kernels over deep learning architecture to exploit the relationship expressiveness among network flows and combine ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures to learn hidden representations, based on the communication representation graph of each network flow in a specific time interval, then the flow-based network attack detection can be done effectively by measuring the similarity between the graphs to two flows. The proposed study provides the effectiveness to obtain insights about network attacks and detect network attacks.

The amount of training data is usually limited, as the data are collected at the beginning of the system use. To compensate for the difference of EMGs over time and device placement with limited-amount training data, transfer learning can be employed. However, it was unclear how transfer learning improve the motion recognition accuracy over long-term use with varying device positions.

The combinations of\"color indices g-i and inverse concentration index R50/R90' and\"color indices g-i and absolute magnitude M_r\"give the best result. We applied this method to classify 317018 galaxies from SDSS DR5 (143263 E, 112 578 S, 61177 L types). Method 2. We used a training sample classified visually into two classes: early E (E, S0, S0a) and late L (Sa to Irr) types. We checked Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier. We used absolute magnitudes, all the color indices and inverse concentration indexes as the attributes of galaxy. To define an accuracy of classifiers we applied the 5-folds validation and found that Random Forest provides the highest accuracy (91% of galaxies were correctly classified (96% for E and 80% for L types)). We tested it to classify 60561 galaxies from SDSS DR9 with a good accuracy onto two classes (47% E and 53% L types of galaxies).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1712.08955", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Astrophysics of Galaxies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2778437674", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["119277652", "115849557", "60402728"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119190218"}

This approach is considered than the other biometric authentication methods such as behavioral biometrics which specially includes Keystroke, Speaker Recognition whereas the another side of biometric authentication is Physical biometrics which specially includes Fingerprint Recognition, Voice Recognition, Finger Geometry Recognition and Facial Recognition. From these considerations, the hybrid approach of Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial for iris recognition has been proposed. The novelty of this proposed method results in improving the Accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER) for the given iris image. In addition to this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for iris image pre-processing. Circular Hough transform (CHT) and Canny edge detection (CED) are applied for iris image segmentation which segments the individual region of the input images. After the image is segmented, Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial have been applied to extract the features from the segmented iris image, which is the most importantstep for obtaining the texture details, which are independent and uncorrelated even for identical pairs. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for image classification. Perhaps, Feature extraction and Classification of iris image are mainly based on the rich texture details present in iris image.

We show how the theory can be applied to optimization problems arising in the theory of risk measures, portfolio optimization and machine learning. ::: First we give some notations and preliminaries we need within the thesis. After that we recall how the well-known Lagrange dual problem can be derived by using the general perturbation theory and give some generalized interior point regularity conditions used in the literature. Using these facts we consider some special scalar optimization problems having a composed objective function and geometric (and cone) constraints. We derive their duals, give strong duality results and optimality condition using some regularity conditions. Thus we complete and/or extend some results in the literature especially by using the mentioned regularity conditions, which are weaker than the classical ones. We further consider a scalar optimization problem having single chance constraints and a convex objective function. We also derive its dual, give a strong duality result and further consider a special case of this problem. Thus we show how the conjugate duality theory can be used for stochastic programming problems and extend some results given in the literature. ::: In the third chapter of this thesis we consider convex risk and deviation measures. We present some more general measures than the ones given in the literature and derive formulas for their conjugate functions. Using these we calculate some dual representation formulas for the risk and deviation measures and correct some formulas in the literature. Finally we proof some subdifferential formulas for measures and risk functions by using the facts above. ::: The generalized deviation measures we introduced in the previous chapter can be used to formulate some portfolio optimization problems we consider in the fourth chapter. Their duals, strong duality results and optimality conditions are derived by using the general theory and the conjugate functions, respectively, given in the second and third chapter.

However, can this tool be transferred to new (hand-held) devices, without loss of the extensive dataset?The objective of this study was to perform a calibration transfer between a newly purchased bench-top (BT) spectrometer and a portable (P) spectrometer with existing calibration models. Both instruments are from the same brand and have identical characteristics and acquisition parameters (FT instrument, resolution of 4 cm\u22121 and wavenumber range 4000 to 500 cm\u22121). The original SVM classification model (n = 515) and SVM quantification model (n = 378) were considered for the transfer trial. Three calibration transfer strategies were assessed: 1) adjustment of slope and bias; 2) correction of spectra from the new instrument BT to P using piecewise direct standardization (PDS) and 3) building a new mixed instrument model with spectra of both instruments. For each approach, additional cocaine powders were measured (n = 682) and the results were compared with GC-MS and GC-FID. The development of a mixed instrument model was the most successful in terms of performance.

The explosive growth of Internet traffic has introduced a practical example that demonstrates the concept of Big Data. Accurate identification and classification of large network traffic data plays an important role in network management including capacity planning, network forensics, QoS and intrusion detection. However, the state-of-the-art solutions, which rely on a dedicated server, are not scalable for analyzing high volume network traffic data. In this paper, we implement a distributed Support Vector Machines (SVMs) framework for classifying network traffic using Hadoop, an open-source distributed computing framework for Big Data processing. We design a global parameter store that maintains the global shared parameters between SVM training nodes. The distributed SVMs have been deployed on a 20 node cluster to analyze real network traffic trace. The results demonstrate that with 19 Mapper nodes the system is around 30% faster than Cloud SVM solution and outperforms the standalone SVM with nearly 9 times faster in training process and 15 times in the classifying process.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the main biomarker that can measure voltage fluctuations of the brain and EEG data analysis helps to investigate the patient with epilepsy syndrome as epilepsy leaves their signature in EEG signals.

A few studies on the topic of federated medical analysis have been conducted recently with the focus on several algorithms. However, none of them have solved similar patient matching, which is useful for applications such as cohort construction for cross-institution observational studies, disease surveillance, and clinical trials recruitment. Objective: The aim of this study was to present a privacy-preserving platform in a federated setting for patient similarity learning across institutions. Without sharing patient-level information, our model can find similar patients from one hospital to another. Methods: We proposed a federated patient hashing framework and developed a novel algorithm to learn context-specific hash codes to represent patients across institutions. The similarities between patients can be efficiently computed using the resulting hash codes of corresponding patients. To avoid security attack from reverse engineering on the model, we applied homomorphic encryption to patient similarity search in a federated setting. Results: We used sequential medical events extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care-III database to evaluate the proposed algorithm in predicting the incidence of five diseases independently. Our algorithm achieved averaged area under the curves of 0.9154 and 0.8012 with balanced and imbalanced data, respectively, in \u03ba-nearest neighbor with \u03ba=3. We also confirmed privacy preservation in similarity search by using homomorphic encryption. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm can help search similar patients across institutions effectively to support federated data analysis in a privacy-preserving manner.

However, the WLPA still exposes insufficient accuracy, and costly time complexity compared with the LPA. In this paper, we optimize the WLPA in accuracy and execution time by modifying the propagation intensity and order in the label propagation process.

However, forecasting the demand of new products is challenging compared to existing products, since historical sales data is not available as an indicator of future sales. Moreover, little attention has been paid in literature to quantitative methods for new product forecasting, especially with respect to quantifying the uncertainty in demand. We present a novel forecasting method demandForest, which combines K-means, Random Forest, and Quantile Regression Forest. This machine learning-based approach combines the historical sales data of previously introduced products and product characteristics of existing and new products to make prelaunch forecasts for new products. demandForest clusters and predicts demand patterns, and predicts the quantiles of the total demand in an introduction period. We validate our approach using real-world data sets of five companies.

With the development of a recommendation system, tourists can select, compare and make decisions almost instantly. This involves the construction of decision models, the ability to predict user preferences, and interpretation of the results. This research aims to develop a Destination Recommendation System (DRS) focusing on the study of machine-learning techniques to improve both technical and practical aspects in DRS. First, to design an effective DRS, an intensive literature review was carried out on published studies of recommendation systems in the tourism domain. Second, the thesis proposes a model-based DRS, involving a two-step filtering feature selection method to remove irrelevant and redundant features and a Decision Tree (DT) classifier to offer interpretability, transparency and efficiency to tourists when they make decisions. To support high scalability, the system is evaluated with a huge body of real-world data collected from a case-study city. Destination choice models were developed and evaluated. Experimental results show that our proposed model-based DRS achieves good performance and can provide personalised recommendations with regard to tourist destinations that are satisfactory to intended users of the system. Third, the thesis proposes an ensemble-based DRS using weight hybrid and cascade hybrid. Three classification algorithms, DT, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Multi- Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), were investigated. Experimental results show that the bagging ensemble of MLP classifiers achieved promising results, outperforming baseline learners and other combiners. Lastly, the thesis also proposes an Adaptive, Responsive, Interactive Model-based User Interface (ARIM-UI) for DRS that allows tourists to interact with the recommended results easily. The proposed interface provides adaptive, informative and responsive information to tourists and improves the level of the user experience of the proposed system.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2883625840", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169848857"}

The expression of late blight susceptibility genes (S-genes) in potato cultivars during the infection often favours the pathogenicity. Thus, the identification of the host S-genes, required to enhance susceptibility towards the pathogens under compatible interaction, is highly essential to control the infection. However, to our limited knowledge, fewer late blight S-genes have been identified in potato till date. Therefore, an attempt was made here to identify such genes through a two step classification approach using the primary and derived sequence information of potato proteins. The results revealed that WRKY transcription factor 6, Catalase protein, Shaggy-Like protein kinase NtK-1 and OTU-Like Cysteine protease were found closer to the candidate susceptibility proteins (S-proteins). These proteins were also classified into susceptible category when validated through the computer intensive techniques like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network. The EST database search for the above proteins has confirmed their expression under the compatible interaction. Besides, the chromosomal locations of the genes encoding these proteins were also identified, so that, the information can be utilized to develop the resistant cultivars. Thus, the predicted S-genes can be used as potential effector targets for late blight resistance in potato.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5958/0975-6906.2014.00160.6", "venue": null, "journal": "Indian Journal of Genetics and Plant Breeding", "mag_id": "1997535932", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:84315351"}

Image texture analysis is an important technique that represents gray level properties of images used to describe non-morphological features. This technique has shown to be a promising technique in analyzing mammographic lesions caused by masses. In this paper, we evaluate texture classification using features derived from co-occurrence matrices, wavelet and ridgelet transforms of mammographic images. In particular, we propose a false positive reduction in computer-aided detection of masses. The data set consisted of 120 cranio-caudal mammograms, half containing a mass, rated as abnormal images, and half with no lesions. The following texture descriptors were then calculated to analyze the regions of interest (ROIs) texture patterns: entropy, energy, sum average, sum variance, and cluster tendency. To select the best set of features for each method, we applied a genetic algorithm (GA). In the ROIs classification stage, we used the Random Forest algorithm, a data mining technique that separates the data into non-overlapping segments.

This work presents a novel framework for a hairstyle recommender system that is based on face shape classifier. This framework enables an automatic hairstyle recommendation with a single face image. This has a direct impact on beauty industry service providers. It can simulate how the user looks like when she is wearing the chosen hairstyle recommended by the expert system. The model used in this framework is based on Support Vector Machine. The framework is evaluated on hand-crafted, deep-learned (VGG-face) features and VGG-face fine-tuned version for the face shape classification task. In addition to evaluating these individual features by a well-designed framework, we attempted to fuse these three descriptors together in order to improve the performance of the classification task. Two combination techniques were employed, namely: Vector Concatenation and Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) techniques. All the hyper-parameters of the model were optimised by using Particle Swarm Optimisation. The results show that combining hand-crafted and VGG-face descriptors with MKL yielded the best results at 70.3% of accuracy which was statistically significantly better than using individual features. Thus, combining multiple representations of the data with MKL can improve the overall performance of the expert system.

One of the challenges is to establish an effective method that can select a parsimonious set of relevant genes. So far, most methods for gene selection in literature focus on screening individual or pairs of genes without considering the possible interactions among genes. Here we introduce a new computational method named the Binary Matrix Shuffling Filter (BMSF). It not only overcomes the difficulty associated with the search schemes of traditional wrapper methods and overfitting problem in large dimensional search space but also takes potential gene interactions into account during gene selection. This method, coupled with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for implementation, often selects very small number of genes for easy model interpretability.ResultsWe applied our method to 9 two-class gene expression datasets involving human cancers. During the gene selection process, the set of genes to be kept in the model was recursively refined and repeatedly updated according to the effect of a given gene on the contributions of other genes in reference to their usefulness in cancer classification. The small number of informative genes selected from each dataset leads to significantly improved leave-one-out (LOOCV) classification accuracy across all 9 datasets for multiple classifiers. Our method also exhibits broad generalization in the genes selected since multiple commonly used classifiers achieved either equivalent or much higher LOOCV accuracy than those reported in literature.ConclusionsEvaluation of a gene\u2019s contribution to binary cancer classification is better to be considered after adjusting for the joint effect of a large number of other genes. A computationally efficient search scheme was provided to perform effective search in the extensive feature space that includes possible interactions of many genes. Performance of the algorithm applied to 9 datasets suggests that it is possible to improve the accuracy of cancer classification by a big margin when joint effects of many genes are considered.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3562261", "pubmed_id": "23148517", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-13-298", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2102247676", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["961425", "13505251", "887404", "7205827", "2478905", "52059378", "14806898", "1831347", "8345846", "6110844", "9061359", "14909890", "27806415", "1714321", "67327661", "206764015", "207720429", "10142996", "30548783", "8401919", "29140743", "206420153", "13300503", "19682573", "207738357", "61291571", "63751177", "14615065", "4419580", "10253140", "1069019", "2914506", "7159780", "10570640", "2245678", "16580703", "19022620", "17802209", "11384384", "34561825", "6839846", "7157851", "8596785", "1597615", "26349635", "32265984", "9576803", "15467622"], "inbound_citations": ["9299356", "195795486", "15467622", "12658565", "18546760", "14468234", "52836036", "202562174", "105122", "17496411", "2649547", "1658401", "89965640", "17186014", "4555526", "6347004", "698533", "23519846", "21604086", "215654144", "54456969", "198980089", "214848373", "80127946", "55057982", "2917645", "46887848", "15975972", "1003811", "49348215", "2960783", "215181031"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15467622"}

The Eigen-matrix translation strategy has a lot of nice properties which deserve more exploration. This paper investigates the major role of Eigen-matrix translation in classification.

It is based on obtaining the functions these learning machines approximate to after training to minimize the empirical risk, and on the possible implementation of the Neyman-Pearson detector with these approximated functions. The function approximated by a C-Support Vector Machine after perfect training is a binary function, with only two possible outputs. When the output of the C-Support Vector Machine is compared to a threshold, whose value is the intermediate between the possible outputs, an implementation of the Maximum-A-Posteriori classifier is obtained. On the other hand, the function approximated by a 2C-Support Vector Machine after perfect training is also a binary function, but this machine implements the Neyman-Pearson detector for a fixed probability of false alarm and probability of detection pair, that can be selected with the parameter \u03b3 which controls the costs of the error function.

The usual PCA is not appropriate to deal with this kind of problems. In this context, we propose the use of a new correlation coefficient as an alternative to Pearson's. This leads to a so-called weighted PCA (WPCA). In order to illustrate the features of our WPCA and compare it with the usual PCA, we consider the problem of analyzing gene expression data sets. In the second part of this work, we propose a new PCA-based algorithm to iteratively select the most important genes in a microarray data set.

First, the geometric amplification relations are analyzed and linear model is built to analyze the mechanical and electrical properties of this amplifier. Next, the accurate modeling method of amplifier is studied for important application of precise servo control. The classical Preisach model (CPM) is generally implemented using a numerical technique based on the first-order reversal curves (FORCs). The accuracy of CPM mainly depends on the number of FORCs. However, it is generally difficult to achieve enough number of FORCs in practice. So, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed in the work to circumvent the deficiency of the CPM. Then the hybrid model, which is based on discrete CPM and SVM is developed to account for hysteresis and dynamic effects. Finally, experimental validation is carried out.

Subsequently, temporal disaggregation of the projected wind speed from monthly to daily scale is performed using modified exponential equation extracted from SWAT model and a k \u2013 nearest neighbor technique developed in this study. The effectiveness of the downscaling and disaggregation models is demonstrated through application to wind speed over the catchment of Malaprabha reservoir in India. For downscaling, the probable predictor variables are extracted from (i) the NCEP reanalysis dataset for the period 1978-2000 and (ii) the simulations from the third generation Canadian Global Climate Model (CGCM3) for SRES emission scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and COMMIT for the period 1978-2100. Large-scale atmospheric variables such as zonal and meridional wind velocities at 925mb are considered as predictors. The scatter plots and cross correlations are used for verifying the reliability of the simulation of the predictor variables by the CGCM3 and to study the predictor-predictand relationships. The downscaled monthly wind speed is disaggregated to daily wind speed values. The performances of the SVM and disaggregation models were evaluated. The results of downscaling show that wind speed is not projected to change in future for A1B, A2, B1 and COMMIT scenarios. The performance evaluation of the temporal disaggregation models developed show that the k \u2013 nearest neighbor technique developed in this study performs better than the modified exponential equation extracted from SWAT model. ::: 2018 IJEWFN.

Most epidemiological studies, including the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), classify women based on self-reported bleeding history. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study developed an algorithm using menstrual and reproductive history and serum hormone levels to reproduce the menopausal status classifications assigned by the WISE hormone committee. We applied that algorithm to women participating in SWAN and examined characteristics of women with concordant and discordant SWAN and WISE classifications. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Of the 3215 SWAN women with complete information at baseline (1995-1997), 2466 (76.7%) received concordant classifications (kappa = 0.52); at the fifth annual follow-up visit, of the 1623 women with complete information, 1154 (72.7%) received concordant classifications (kappa = 0.57). At each time point, we identified subgroups of women with discordant SWAN and WISE classifications. These subgroups, ordered by chronological age, showed increasing trends for menopausal symptoms and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and a decreasing trend for estrogen (p < 0.001). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The WISE algorithm is a useful tool for studies that have access to blood samples for hormone data unrelated to menstrual cycle phase, with or without an intact uterus, and no resources for adjudication. Future studies may want to combine aspects of the SWAN and WISE algorithms by adding hormonal measures to the series of bleeding questions in order to determine more precisely where women are in the perimenopausal continuum.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17199459", "doi": "10.1089/jwh.2006.15.1184", "venue": "Journal of women's health", "journal": "Journal of women's health", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2051803666", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8147229", "17465095", "86719256", "75320168", "33063845", "28673617", "25535253", "36881212", "28430089", "38188089", "13009053", "38491322", "6293576", "44848241", "70422052", "30854383", "2482641", "11113181", "72212710", "21386123", "34862778"], "inbound_citations": ["145821679", "4228942", "36946457", "43924886", "10425581", "3814711"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21805724"}

Unfortunately, current metric learning approaches for supervised clustering do not scale to large or even medium-sized datasets.

Large margin classifiers have shown great effectiveness in the binary classification task and, recently, also for single-label multiclass classification. This dissertation proposes several original extensions of state-of-the-art methods for single-label classification and a new framework generalizing a large set of multiclass problems and algorithms. Specifically, the contribution of this thesis is three-fold. First of all, it investigates large margin techniques for the well known problem of learning polychotomies. Within this setting we propose a convergent additive reweighting strategy that is able to improve the margin of the examples of the training set. This strategy is very general and can be applied to any model with very weak assumptions. This scheme is applied for two different settings, namely a kernel based linear model and a Nearest-Neighbor framework involving tangent-distance models. Second, we present an extension of the well known multiclass Support Vector Machine of Crammer and Singer to multiple prototypes per class. The problem results in a compact formulation that is not convex. For this, we propose a locally optimal algorithm and novel stochastic strategies for improving the solutions we are able to find. A combination of few simple linear models have shown a performance comparable to that obtained by far more complex kernel-based methods but with a significant reduction (of one or two orders) in response time. Third, a framework for general multiclass problems including single-label classification, multi-label classification, hierarchical classification, category ranking and ordinal regression, is proposed in such a way that previous methods can be easily interpreted within this setting and new algorithms can be more easily developed and studied. Finally, kernel-based methods for general multiclass problems particularly suited for the afore-mentioned framework have been devised, analyzed and tested with state-of-the-art results in ranking tasks.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2181990881", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3891957", "5957035", "31926726", "1543029", "834469", "561188", "14189168", "16409368", "5608905"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124993859"}

First, we exploit context as the statistical relation between the appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in the training set. This enables to jump across distant regions in the image (e.g. observing a sky region suggests that cars might be far below) and is done efficiently in a Random Forest framework. Second, we exploit the score of the classifier to attract the search to promising areas surrounding a highly scored window, and to keep away from areas near low scored ones. Our search strategy can be applied on top of any classifier as it treats it as a black-box.

Different conventional techniques utilizing the Gauss Markov model and neural network method have been previously utilized to model the errors. However, Gauss Markov model works unsatisfactorily in the case of MEMS units due to the presence of high inherent sensor errors. On the other hand, modeling the random drift utilizing Neural Network (NN) is time consuming, thereby affecting its real-time implementation.

In this paper the set of available variables are firstly reduced using filter feature selection methods such as chi- square, gain ratio, information gain, relief F, and symmetric uncertainly. In addition, ensemble feature selection of the input variables based on these individual methods is also used. The impact of feature selection is measured by fitting seven classification algorithms, i.e., Random Forest, C4.5, PART, C5.0, Bagging, Boosting, and SVM Linear. The performance of the models is compared by calculating parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negatively predictive values, and AUC. The data used is German bank data of 1000 records and 20 features and one target variable", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/AICT47866.2019.8981771", "venue": "2019 IEEE 13th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 13th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3005325845", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211056896"}

In this paper, we show the use of machine learning algorithms in the prediction of tumour content in Fresh Frozen (FF) histological samples of head and neck. More specifically, we explore a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), namely the AlexNet, to build two common machine learning classifiers. For the first classifier, the pre-trained AlexNet network is used to extract features from the activation layer and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier is trained by using these extracted features. In the second case, we replace the last three layers of the pre-trained AlexNet network and then fine tune these layers on the FF histological image samples. The results of our experiments are very promising. We have obtained percentage classification rates in the high 90s, and our results show there is little difference between SVM and transfer learning. Thus, the present study show that an AlexNet driven CNN with SVM and fine-tuned classifiers are a suitable choice for accurate discrimination between tumour and non-tumour histological samples from the head and neck.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SKIMA47702.2019.8982508", "venue": "2019 13th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA)", "journal": "2019 13th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3005085357", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3343318", "9802806", "215388648", "4677396", "196664422", "8193575", "22592624", "195908774", "18917597", "150297385", "57191557", "31141210", "15615409"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211057603"}

Finally, we use a local neighborhood mapping in the manifold to reconstruct the high-dimensional HRTF from measured HRTFs of all subjects.

However, it was not clear whether musical training impacts memory in general, beyond working memory. By recruiting professional musicians with extensive training, we investigated if musical training has a broad impact on memory with corresponding electroencephalography (EEG) signal changes, by using working memory and long-term memory tasks with verbal and pictorial items. Behaviorally, musicians outperformed on both working memory and long-term memory tasks. A comprehensive EEG pattern study has been performed, including various univariate and multivariate features, time-frequency (wavelet) analysis, power-spectra analysis, and deterministic chaotic theory. The advanced feature selection approaches have also been employed to select the most discriminative EEG and brain activation features between musicians and non-musicians. High classification accuracy (more than 95 %) in memory judgments was achieved using Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM). For working memory, it showed significant differences between musicians versus non-musicians during the delay period. For long-term memory, significant differences on EEG patterns between groups were found both in the pre-stimulus period and the post-stimulus period on recognition.

Substantial efforts have been made to study regional crop distribution from year to year, but less attention is paid to the dynamics of composition and spatial extent of crops within a season. Understanding how crops are distributed at the early developing stages allows for the timely adjustment of crop planting structure as well as agricultural decision making and management. To address this knowledge gap, this study presents an approach integrating object-based image analysis with random forest (RF) for mapping in-season crop types based on multi-temporal GaoFen satellite data with a spatial resolution of 16 meters. A multiresolution local variance strategy was used to create crop objects, and then object-based spectral/textural features and vegetation indices were extracted from those objects. The RF classifier was employed to identify different crop types at four crop growth seasons by integrating available features. The crop classification performance of different seasons was assessed by calculating F-score values. Results show that crop maps derived using seasonal features achieved an overall accuracy of more than 87%. Compared to the use of spectral features, a feature combination of in-season textures and multi-temporal spectral and vegetation indices performs best when classifying crop types. Spectral and temporal information is more important than texture features for crop mapping. However, texture can be essential information when there is insufficient spectral and temporal information (e.g., crop identification in the early spring).

Since excretion of modified nucleosides from increased RNA metabolism has been proposed as a potential target in pathogenesis of breast cancer, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the predictability of breast cancer by means of urinary excreted nucleosides.MethodsWe analyzed urine samples from 85 breast cancer women and respective healthy controls to assess the metabolic profiles of nucleosides by a comprehensive bioinformatic approach. All included nucleosides/ribosylated metabolites were isolated by cis-diol specific affinity chromatography and measured with liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS). A valid set of urinary metabolites was selected by exclusion of all candidates with poor linearity and/or reproducibility in the analytical setting. The bioinformatic tool of Oscillating Search Algorithm for Feature Selection (OSAF) was applied to iteratively improve features for training of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to better predict breast cancer.ResultsAfter identification of 51 nucleosides/ribosylated metabolites in the urine of breast cancer women and/or controls by LC- ITMS coupling, a valid set of 35 candidates was selected for subsequent computational analyses. OSAF resulted in 44 pairwise ratios of metabolite features by iterative optimization. Based on this approach ultimately estimates for sensitivity and specificity of 83.5% and 90.6% were obtained for best prediction of breast cancer. The classification performance was dominated by metabolite pairs with SAH which highlights its importance for RNA methylation in cancer pathogenesis.ConclusionExtensive RNA-pathway analysis based on mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites and subsequent bioinformatic feature selection allowed for the identification of significant metabolic features related to breast cancer pathogenesis.

Furthermore, a revisit to previous visited nodes is often required in order to visit all the nodes in one continuous route. In this thesis, some techniques to solve problems for Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) involving isolated characters are proposed. HCR consists of three stages which are pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. In the pre-processing, thinning algorithm was applied to remove the redundancies of pixel in character binary image. In the feature extraction, Freeman Chain Code (FCC) was used as data representation that uses 8-neighbourhood directions labelled as 1 to 8. However, the FCC representation is dependent on the route length and branches of the characters\u2019 node. The larger the number of branches, which is common for isolated characters, the longer the time required for the extraction. Here, a FCC extraction based on Heuristic Randomized-based algorithm was proposed to reduce the route length and computational time. Based on the experiment, it was demonstrated that the proposed FCC extraction is superior in terms of producing the shortest route length with minimum computational time, compared to Enumeration-based algorithm, Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization. In this thesis, features vector extracted using the FCC extraction was used as input to the classification. There were 69 features used, 64 features were from the chain codes and 5 features were from original image. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were chosen as classifier in the classification of image characters. The performance of ANN is better than SVM in terms of accuracy.

Anderson (kanders@cs.ucsd.edu) Garrison W. Cottrell (gary@cs.ucsd.edu) Computer Science and Engineering Department 0114 Institute for Neural Computation University of California, San Diego La Jolla, CA 92093-0114 USA Abstract Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of the Age of Acquisition (AoA) of an item in determining subjects\u2019 reaction time in naming words, objects, and faces. Using the number of epochs required to learn an item as a direct measure of AoA in connectionist networks, Smith, Cottrell & Anderson (in press) have shown that AoA is a stronger predictor of final Sum Squared Error than frequency. In this paper, we replicate Smith et al. using more realistic frequency distributions for the items, and examine why some patterns may be learned earlier than others. First, we have found that the same patterns tend to be learned early and late by networks differing in their initial random weights; hence, the issue is, what property of the patterns determines AoA? We have found that even very weak pattern similarity structure is a strong predictor of AoA when frequency is controlled for. Also, we have found evidence that such a similarity structure may still be an important factor in determining AoA even when pattern frequency is varied. Introduction Ever since Carroll & White (1973) reanalyzed Oldfield & Wingfield' s (1965) naming latency data and discovered that frequency was not significant when AoA was considered, controversy has surrounded discussions of the import of the two variables. Technological and methodological refinements have led to agreement that both frequency and AoA play significant roles. Hence, interest has returned to the pursuit of understanding the mechanisms underlying AoA effects. It had been proposed recently (Morrison & Ellis, 1995; Moore & Valentine, 1998) that connectionist networks would be incapable of exhibiting AoA effects because training on late patterns would cause \u201ccatastrophic interference\u201d resulting in the unlearning of early patterns. However, this sort of interference is only found if training on early patterns ceases. Ellis & Lambon Ralph (2000) demonstrated AoA effects in a neural network by training the net on an \u201cearly\u201d set of patterns and then simply adding a second set of \u201clate\u201d patterns halfway through training. Smith et al. (in press) independently demonstrated AoA effects in networks. In contrast to the staging method of Ellis & Lambon Ralph (2000), where AoA is assumed to correspond to the time at which patterns are presented to the network (early or late), all patterns were presented to the model from the outset. AoA can then be measured for each pattern individually as the time during training when the pattern is learned. Using this more natural definition, Smith et al. reported significant effects of AoA on naming latency (defined as the residual error on a pattern after training is completed, a measure of the network\u2019s uncertainty). What we would like to know is why certain patterns are learned earlier than others, and how early learning of a pattern comes to affect the network' s performance. Ellis & Lambon Ralph\u2019s (2000) approach cannot be used to find out why patterns are acquired in a particular order as it imposes an order by staging pattern presentation. Instead, we vary properties of the patterns and then measure AoA, as in Smith et al. Ellis & Lambon Ralph (2000), do suggest why early AoA is important for final performance \u2013 the network is more \u201cplastic\u201d earlier in training, so items that are learned first have the opportunity to make the biggest impression on the weights. We also want to know whether our finding that AoA is a stronger predictor of final error than frequency survives a more realistic version of Zipf\u2019s (1935) frequency distribution than was used by Smith et al. Here we show that it does. Methods Our investigation is organized around a series of experiments in which we replicate and extend network simulations and analyses previously reported by Smith et al. (in press). We begin with one of the simplest connectionist models of lexical access, an autoencoder network. This kind of network simply reproduces its input on its output through a set of hidden units, and has seen surprisingly wide application in cognitive modeling. We then extend our simulations to more complex mappings.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2619251399", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149110244"}

These results suggest that ILP methods could enhance the model-construction capabilities of software tools being developed for the emerging discipline of knowledge discovery from databases. One significant concern in the use of ILP for this purpose is that of efficiency. The performance of modern ILP systems is principally affected by two issues: (1) they often have to search through very large numbers of possible rules (usually in the form of definite clauses); (2) they have to score each rule on the data (usually in the form of ground facts) to estimate goodness. Stochastic and greedy approaches have been proposed to alleviate the complexity arising from each of these issues. While these techniques can result in order-of-magnitude improvements in the worst-case search complexity of an ILP system, they do so at the expense of exactness. As this may be unacceptable in some situations, we examine two methods that result in admissible transformations of clauses examined in a search. While the methods do not alter the size of the search space (that is, the number of clauses examined), they can alleviate the theorem-proving effort required to estimate goodness. The first transformation simply involves eliminating literals using a weak test for redundancy. The second involves partitioning the set of literals within a clause into groups that can be executed independently of each other. The efficacy of these transformations are evaluated empirically on a number of well-known ILP datasets. The results suggest that for problems that require the use of highly non-determinate predicates, the transformations can provide significant gains as the complexity of clauses sought increases.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-44960-4_14", "venue": "ILP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2595129212,1549345179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9156849", "9394000", "6489412", "128946", "9124688"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18104124"}

The visualizations of spectral images shall convey as much information as possible from the original signal and facilitate image interpretation.

In particular, the idea of NLU is presented, on the one hand, as the relation between the discourse of a specific speech message and the meta-discourse of a language, in turn, activated by the need-motivational factors. On the other hand, it is conceptualized as a process with a specific structure of information metabolism, the study of which implies the necessity to differentiate the affective (emotional) and need-motivational influences on the NLU, as well as to take into account their interaction. At the same time, the hypothesis about the influence of needs on NLU under the scenario similar to the pattern of Yerkes-Dodson is argued. And the theoretical conclusion that emotions fulfill the function of the operator of the structural features of the information metabolism of NLU is substantiated.

Digital TV providers are struggling to restrict access to their video contents only to authorized users, by deploying more and more sophisticated conditional access systems. At the state-of-the-art, the most significant menace is the card-sharing activity which exploits a known weakness allowing an authorized subscriber to provide access to digital contents to a potentially large group of unauthorized ones connected over a communication network. This is usually realized by using ad hoc customized devices. Detecting the presence of these illegal systems on a network, by recognizing their related traffic is an issue of primary importance. Unfortunately, to avoid the identification of such traffic, payload obfuscation strategies based on encryption are often used, hindering packet inspection techniques. This paper presents a strategy for the detection of card-sharing traffic, empowered by machine-learning-driven traffic classification techniques and based on the natural capability of wavelet analysis to decompose a traffic time series into several component series associated with particular time and frequency scales and hence allowing its observation at different frequency component levels and with different resolutions. These ideas have been used for the proof-of-concept implementation of an SVM-based binary classification scheme that relies only on time regularities of the traffic and not on the packet contents and hence is immune to payload obfuscation techniques.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2012.08.045", "venue": "Appl.

NER, which is a sequence-labeling task, has been performed using various traditional techniques including dictionary-, rule-, machine learning-, and deep learning-based methods. However, as existing biomedical NER models are insufficient to handle new and unseen entity types from the growing biomedical data, the development of more effective and accurate biomedical NER models is being widely researched. Among biomedical NER models utilizing deep learning approaches, there have been only a few studies involving the design of high-level features in the embedding layer. In this regard, herein, we propose a deep learning NER model that effectively represents biomedical word tokens through the design of a combinatorial feature embedding. The proposed model is based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM) with Conditional Random Field (CRF) and enhanced by integrating two different character-level representations extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and bi-LSTM. Additionally, an attention mechanism is applied to the model to focus on the relevant tokens in the sentence, which alleviates the long-term dependency problem of the LSTM model and allows effective recognition of entities. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the JNLPBA and NCBI-Disease, and a comparative analysis with the existing models is performed. The proposed model achieved a relatively higher performance with an F1-score of 86.93% in case of NCBI-Disease, and a competitive performance for the JNLPBA with an F1-score of 75.31%.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32004641", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103381", "venue": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "mag_id": "3004047707", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210998307"}

In these cases it is important to define priorities avoiding to waste time and resources for not savable victims. Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) methodology is the well-known and standard system usually used by practitioners to predict the survival probability of trauma patients. However, practitioners have noted that the accuracy of TRISS predictions is unacceptable especially for severely injured patients. Thus, alternative methods should be proposed. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: In this work we evaluate different approaches for predicting whether a patient will survive or not according to simple and easily measurable observations. We conducted a rigorous, comparative study based on the most important prediction techniques using real clinical data of the US National Trauma Data Bank. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Empirical results show that well-known Machine Learning classifiers can outperform the TRISS methodology. Based on our findings, we can say that the best approach we evaluated is Random Forest: it has the best accuracy, the best area under the curve, and k-statistic, as well as the second-best sensitivity and specificity. It has also a good calibration curve. Furthermore, its performance monotonically increases as the dataset size grows, meaning that it can be very effective to exploit incoming knowledge. Considering the whole dataset, it is always better than TRISS. Finally, we implemented a new tool to compute the survival of victims. This will help medical practitioners to obtain a better accuracy than the TRISS tools. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Random Forests may be a good candidate solution for improving the predictions on survival upon the standard TRISS methodology.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28229175", "doi": "10.1007/s00068-016-0757-3", "venue": "European Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery", "journal": "European Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2590887673", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25997339", "13964705", "137975015", "78730720", "19920867", "89141", "40704901", "202590023", "3132966", "60577818", "62245742", "6370985", "123582503", "22695723", "45455619", "40134858", "667586", "1536643", "10097148", "2367747", "16663667", "1206", "1858029", "56563878", "43532502", "116485081", "12892110", "10412651", "12872746", "14020529", "55809223", "34771780", "9764511", "17746214"], "inbound_citations": ["51667497"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13558116"}

The visual features of a surgical video can be used to identify the surgical phases in laparoscopic interventions. Owing to the significant improvement in performance exhibited by convolutional neural networks (CNN) on various challenging tasks like image classification, action recognition etc., they are widely used as feature extractors. In the proposed framework, features extracted by a CNN are used for phase recognition. The task of phase recognition in surgical videos is rendered challenging because of the presence of motion blur produced to the mobile nature of the recording device and the high variance in scenes observed during the course of the surgery. Also, blood stains on the camera lens and complete or partial occlusion of the scene captured by the laparoscopic camera poses additional challenges. These challenges can be overcome by using temporal features in addition to the spatial visual features. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is used to learn the temporal information of the video.

In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naive forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM.

In this study, LSSVM is employed as a predictor to predict water level. Accurate water levels modeling and prediction is vital for safety especially during the monsoon season. It is worth noting that, mitigating the effects of floods can be accomplished by using either structural or non-structural measures, or by a combination of both. Structural measures incorporated of engineering works, such as channelization or flood reservoirs which changes the shape of the flood hydrograph. On the other hand, non-structural measures such as flood warning scheme is intended to reduce the economic losses in a flood ::: situation. In most cases, disaster prevention operation such flood warning scheme proved to be more efficient in mitigating the effects of major floods than structural measures. Thus, for this study, a hybrid algorithm of LSSVM with one of the recent bio-inspired optimization algorithm, namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO-LSSVM) is presented for water level prediction. The GWO is utilized to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. The feasibility of GWO-LSSVM is compared against LSSVM optimized by Firefly Algorithm (FA-LSSVM) and single GWO. Findings of the study demonstrated that the GWO-LSSVM able to provide competitive results and able to perform well for the problem under study.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1049/cp.2016.1360", "venue": "4th IET Clean Energy and Technology Conference (CEAT 2016)", "journal": "4th IET Clean Energy and Technology Conference (CEAT 2016)", "mag_id": "2736184227", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67253263"}

But due to the diversity of naming conventions and traditions for such molecules, this task is highly complex and should be supported by computational tools. Results: We present ChemSpot, a named entity recognition (NER) tool for identifying mentions of chemicals in natural language texts, including trivial names, drugs, abbreviations, molecular formulas and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry entities. Since the different classes of relevant entities have rather different naming characteristics, ChemSpot uses a hybrid approach combining a Conditional Random Field with a dictionary. It achieves an F1 measure of 68.1% on the SCAI corpus, outperforming the only other freely available chemical NER tool, OSCAR4, by 10.8 percentage points.

DRASTIC is the acronym for seven data layers using a prescribed scoring system in terms of rates to account for local variations and weights to account for the relative importance of data layers. Also, the term framework signifies the consensual nature of choosing the data layers without any theoretical or empirical basis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) or similar techniques are used to reduce inherent subjectivities through a strategy of unsupervised learning from data by formulating Multiple Frameworks (MF) and supervised learning from Multiple Models (MMs) without searching for any \u2018superior\u2019 model. Notably, a framework lacks the procedure for iterative training and testing, as usual in modelling procedures. In this strategy, models are organised in two hierarchical levels: Level 1 comprises the construction of MFs (two frameworks) and/or MMs (two models); Level 2 comprises a model or an algorithm to reuse the outputs from Level 1 through formulating four strategies, including a mixture of MFs/ MMs, in which Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen by the paper to run models at Level 2. The supervision process uses target values as a function of observed nitrate-N values. The strategy is applied to the aquifer in the Malekan region, where the past extensive agricultural practices have been transformed into intensive use of fertilisers without protecting water quality in the aquifers.

The mass profiles of light and heavy peptide pairs produced by SILAC and LC-MS are often affected by the collection instrument and the collection methods. Such influences may reduce the accuracy of further ratio estimations. So we applied Random Forest (RF) to remove the low quality mass spectra which deviated from expected theoretical isotopic distributions. Specifically, based on some features of the peptides, we trained a RF classifier and got the probability of positive or negative class for each mass profile via a training set obtained from some yeast samples.

This is oriented to the discovery and management of customized and adaptive biomedical information concerning the assisted users, organizational workflows, and living situations. Signal processing in e-health is deployed by means of layers of distributed components from smart sensors to mathematical models in computing provider centers. Mathematical models have been typically considered as pertaining to data-driven category in this field, notwithstanding there is a recent trend to use also structural mathematical models like those of VPH initiatives in e-health systems. ::: ::: This special issue tries to present this new research scenario by means of a set of articles addressing several aspects of the crossroads. ::: ::: Chronic pathologies are one of the main targets of telehealthcare systems. Cardiovascular diseases are among those with highest prevalence rates, and many efforts have been addressed towards this healthcare domain in e-health. ::: ::: In this regard, the paper published in this special issue by Pinheiro et al. presents an outstanding review of ballistocardiography. This is a method for measuring the heart beat induced movements of human body, due to forces related to heart contraction. This technique has been proved to be very useful in the evaluation of the global state of the cardiovascular system. ::: ::: Ballistocardiography reached its first golden age in mid 20th, but some difficulties in the interpretation of signals, together with restrictions of electronic technology, avoided the expected clinical diffusion. Current advances in piezoelectric sensors and signal processing methods, together with advantages of ballistocardiographs, which could be embedded in daily life objects, like a bed or a chair, in line with trends of ambient assisted living and unobtrusive monitoring, are boosting ballistocardiography. ::: ::: Authors propose a new concept of ballistocardiograph monitoring in the area of telehealthcare as an alternative to traditional electrocardiograms. This is in agreement with the current trend in the development of non-invasive sensors, unobtrusive and ubiquitous care, allowing the users themselves to take part in the monitoring of their disease and pushing personal care at home. ::: ::: In additions to developments in signal processing and ubiquitous computing able to integrate ballistocardiographs within the environment, there is a new interest to focus the physiological interpretation of measured signals. Advances in this research line suggest that multilevel biomedical knowledge from initiatives in the systems biology domain like Physiome and VPH should have an important influence. Advances performed in other biomedical processing signal areas such the study of heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) are helping in this task. ::: ::: The electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the first successful paradigms in biomedical engineering. It started in the beginning of 20th and the contributions to the knowledge in this field has evolved together with other relevant areas, providing methods and technologies to the telehealthcare arena, both in sensors and signal processing techniques, as well as to the Physiome and VPH initiatives. ::: ::: The paper of Bakul and Tiwary published in this special issue proposes an efficient method to identify the risk of myocardial infarction early from 12-lead ECG. The incorporation of automatic methods to support medical diagnosis is extremely important to ensure the best interpretation from biomedical signals acquired, such as electrocardiogram. Nowadays, there are a large amount of available data, more precision and less noise in sensors and devices, which provide high quality and an increasingly quantity of items to be analyzed. ::: ::: Current sensors allow the estimation of changes in the amplitude and frequency of the samples, providing a method with accurate results and, the most relevant, discarding the influence of the particular subject under study. In this work, authors present a method based on new features from the ECG to reduce the influence of the subject\u2019s body composition. They show how a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on a sigmoid kernel, working over these new features, gives a better accuracy, sensitivity and specificity than previous features-based methods. It is important to realize the potential of extending the proposed technique for other uses in the pathologies diagnostic. ::: ::: Magnetoencephalography MEG is an imaging technique for mapping brain activity with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Its emergence to the biomedical market started in 1980\u2019s, once superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) were available. There are currently whole-head helmets with more than 300 sensors. Advances in signal processing methods and microelectronic devices, together with its non-invasive character, suggest that this measurement technique can be very relevant in many brain-diseases diagnostics and prognosis. ::: ::: The study by Gomez and Hornero published in this special issue presents a very relevant finding in this direction. They performed a MEG study over 36 Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients and 20 controls, analyzing the complexity of brain activity by six entropy and complexity measurements. Their results showed that MEG recordings are less complex in AD patients than in controls. In additions, it was possible to design a classifier based on the Shannon spectral entropy index with an accuracy of 77 %. ::: ::: AD is the main cause of dementia among the elderly in western countries. The inversion of demographic pyramid and the growing incidence of dementia have propelled the research in this area of e-health. The major interest is focused on the prognosis of dementia and the delay of more severe stages. The non-invasive character of MEG, together with current fusion imaging modalities and advances in mathematical neurophysiological models, suggest the relevance of this technique to validate reduced models that could be used as a basis of smart sensors in telehealthcare systems for the elderly. ::: ::: The connection between smart sensors and VPH has been analyzed with detail in the paper by Fernandez-Peruchena and Prado-Velasco published in this special issue. Authors present a novel paradigm for addressing the design of personalized therapies in diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is also one of the chronic pathologies in modern societies with highest growing rates of prevalence and incidence, particularly in the case of type 2 DM. ::: ::: Diabetes mellitus has a high influence on the growing of other chronic pathologies like renal disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Authors perform a detailed review of DM pathology from different perspectives, and suggest the way in which VPH initiatives together with smart sensors, in the framework of e-health, can help to design a personalized, preventive, and predictive healthcare model that improves the low quality of life of patients suffering this pathology. ::: ::: Conclusions of the last study are not restricted to DM. A relevance suggestion is that this converging approach should help to exploit the existing synergies among knowledge generation and management in e-health and knowledge generation and management in VPH, using different methodologies and perspectives.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3103879", "pubmed_id": "21629672", "doi": "10.2174/1874120701004020199", "venue": "The Open Biomedical Engineering Journal", "journal": "The Open Biomedical Engineering Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1890133989", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6119650"}

However, most of the past research in automatic analysis of human affect has focused on the recognition of affect displayed by people in individual settings and little attention has been paid to the analysis of the affect expressed in group settings. In this article, we first analyze the affect expressed by each individual in terms of arousal and valence dimensions in both individual and group videos and then propose methods to recognize the contextual information, i.e., whether a person is alone or in-a-group by analyzing their face and body behavioral cues.

However, the study shows that the meteorological factors have an important influence on forest fire.

The level of mismatch between tasks in the sequence determines the level of forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting is interrelated to mode collapse and can make the training of GANs non-convergent. We investigate the landscape of the discriminator's output in different variants of GANs and find that when a GAN converges to a good equilibrium, real training datapoints are wide local maxima of the discriminator.

To the best of our knowledge, the experiments reported in the literature consider only small datasets containing few species.

To gain better insight into this dataset, we test three different feature sets, along with three different classifiers. Two experiments were performed. In the first, the classifiers were trained to discriminate between Hardwoods and Softwoods, and in the second, they were trained to discriminate among the 112 species. A comprehensive set of experiments shows that the tuple Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) achieved the best performance in both cases, with a recognition rate of 98.6 and 86.0% for the first and second experiments, respectively.

The Laplacian manifold regularization method has been incorporated to explore the geometry of the underlying manifold structure. However, the Laplacian manifold regularization lacks the extrapolating ability and biases the solution to a real constant function. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, the Laplacian-Hessian regularization SS-ELM (LHRSS-ELM), to enhance the performance of conventional SS-ELM. The main advantages of LHRSS-ELM are as follows: 1) LHRSS-ELM exhibits the learning capability and computational efficiency of traditional SS-ELMs; 2) LHRSS-ELM algorithm combines both Laplacian and Hessian term to enhance the extrapolating power, accuracy, and robustness and also show significant performance in multiclass classification tasks; and 3) for the purpose of pursuing the best pair of hyperparameters to establish a comparable model, we dynamically update them from sequences. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on publicly available data sets and further applied for the state classification of superheating degree in the aluminum electrolysis process. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is superior to the existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms in the matter of accuracy and robustness.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900267", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2917628310", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15589402", "28964781", "15037168", "4708453", "116858", "10802494", "30416161", "16801466", "10783271", "26893209", "52929128", "19287620", "3385204", "16902615", "59230757", "53096949", "40762240", "3472451", "17128241", "2186348", "3472451", "8981848", "12776433", "26745518", "51726054", "39133036", "5568968", "54444773", "7634850", "207110905", "9331106", "52837019", "67105961", "207102170", "12450925", "44318252", "51921050", "35161776", "52903624", "195681938", "57754850", "34130217", "28020", "51610358", "28845618", "28771235", "57374945", "10067980"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85500514"}

The work is motivated by the aim of creating a synthetic agent that can observe a scene containing interactions between unknown objects and agents, and learn models of these sufficient to act in accordance with the implicit protocols present in the scene. Discrete concepts (utterances and object properties), and temporal protocols involving these concepts, are learned in an unsupervised manner from continuous sensor input alone. Crucial to this learning process are methods for spatio-temporal attention applied to the audio and visual sensor data. These identify subsets of the sensor data relating to discrete concepts. Clustering within continuous feature spaces is used to learn object property and utterance models from processed sensor data, forming a symbolic description. The progol Inductive Logic Programming system is subsequently used to learn symbolic models of the temporal protocols presented in the presence of noise and over-representation in the symbolic data input to it. The models learned are used to drive a synthetic agent that can interact with the world in a semi-natural way.

This involves developing independent PC models for each group in the class, and calculating both the Q statistic (square prediction error) for each sample to the class model and a separate statistic about how well samples are classified within the projected PC space. The latter statistic can be applied to different types of classifiers, in this paper we choose to illustrate by Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (D statistic) and one class Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD) (f-value). The two measures (Q and the classifier dependent statistic) are combined into a joint decision function which uniquely classifies each sample. The disjoint hard models are contrasted to conjoint models where PCA is performed on the entire dataset using both QDA and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers. The optimum number of PCs for each model is determined using the bootstrap, and model performance assessed on 100 test sets obtained using different iterative splits, using %PA (Predictive Ability) and %CR (Classification Rate). The method is illustrated using a dataset consisting of 293 samples from nine groups of polymers obtained using thermal profiling. The approach described, in this paper, has many of the advantages of one class disjoint models (e.g. SIMCA) and of conventional hard models, and is useful if it is known that all samples must belong to one of a series of known groups but each group has a very different structure.

In this study, we present a resampling strategy based Random Forests (RF) ensemble classifier to improve diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. Random forests is an ensemble classifier that consists of many decision trees and outputs the class that is the mode of the class's output by individual trees. In this way, an RF ensemble classifier performs better than a single tree from classification performance point of view. In general, multiclass datasets having unbalanced distribution of sample sizes are difficult to analyze in terms of class discrimination. Cardiac arrhythmia is such a dataset that has multiple classes with small sample sizes and it is therefore adequate to test our resampling based training strategy. The dataset contains 452 samples in fourteen types of arrhythmias and eleven of these classes have sample sizes less than 15. Our diagnosis strategy consists of two parts: (i) a correlation based feature selection algorithm is used to select relevant features from cardiac arrhythmia dataset. (ii) RF machine learning algorithm is used to evaluate the performance of selected features with and without simple random sampling to evaluate the efficiency of proposed training strategy. The resultant accuracy of the classifier is found to be 90.0% and this is a quite high diagnosis performance for cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, three case studies, i.e., thyroid, cardiotocography and audiology, are used to benchmark the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this work, we introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that allows learning in such a class-incremental way: only the training data for a small number of classes has to be present at the same time and new classes can be added progressively. iCaRL learns strong classifiers and a data representation simultaneously. This distinguishes it from earlier works that were fundamentally limited to fixed data representations and therefore incompatible with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of time where other strategies quickly fail.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1611.07725", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2017.587", "venue": "2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964189064,2949400163,2554863749", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["5700960", "393948", "12350611", "8165330", "7748515", "33982236", "5637934", "2691726", "12730344", "206594692", "7200347", "5808102", "6628106", "4704285", "18268744", "941783", "7016601", "14263819", "47259365", "61019113", "9296691", "16435300", "14803303", "41397562", "10725353", "8502955", "15662659", "5252774", "22882861", "11094762", "2930547", "15350923", "6844431", "14018161", "3355837"], "inbound_citations": ["211075859", "204008339", "214775034", "213005255", "201646793", "210911896", "152282823", "210860954", "49393697", "784912", "49655438", "56475888", "174798397", "214714399", "212614536", "23072045", "199367283", "49658791", "208158188", "73497737", "102486799", "53240328", "210966259", "198906238", "214692159", "52959234", "209531954", "71147690", "71147690", "476005", "208139404", "209496382", "202784677", "208547551", "1358160", "44098606", "37308416", "167217796", "174797826", "212645695", "67855769", "214775266", "12253672", "55701187", "214605804", "208193904", "52168079", "201646443", "203655262", "174802341", "203837695", "88478967", "202783008", "208513125", "211259028", "145048418", "54088176", "214612001", "44079577", "211097040", "210700925", "210700925", "208248180", "204800400", "167217505", "67855427", "84187257", "209486564", "83458730", "202539644", "4115755", "210931745", "207969372", "52117892", "156051839", "214667973", "209531820", "3502468", "51817214", "208285070", "52191991", "201088102", "119309522", "198920237", "203986887", "174801844", "57189100", "198908049", "209832425", "145037561", "108378369", "53104001", "2254246", "211133013", "195437046", "211096737", "209497567", "195848136", "199488736", "209405263", "213176907", "2157345", "173990797", "198931387", "53941707", "204949873", "209415197", "211091947", "52287130", "53111057", "54443381", "209515942", "209515942", "53232976", "214603715", "211011110", "3376478", "19260843", "35249701", "90260009", "214667523", "52065531", "67855851", "209862398", "173187918", "211572588", "207853020", "207149377", "108297547", "160021870", "119113172", "207994757", "52964778", "212628529", "210023666", "4254748", "199405568", "211193221", "53106595", "198905397", "199501781", "199552250", "33360239", "202776088", "44868747", "201314887", "52880246", "208000091", "47012197", "195820644", "54446770", "202539000", "52335906", "56657834", "212714917", "3632108", "195767516", "202677215", "128249594", "202704049", "53100211", "70349918", "146121255", "44086178", "49563782", "53242009", "52840651", "52986657", "59608630", "214714373", "202579262", "198953137", "208263120", "174819688", "214743106", "204923710", "24688669", "209892153", "208857392", "214743272", "102353035", "4047127", "155637168", "6028387", "3283439", "210716004", "59337593", "211119761", "53776855", "52289145", "53288620", "202660584", "208202124", "50785377", "195822218", "13746427", "195750851", "195453293", "88517848", "67856359", "56292118", "46898034", "54446723", "195584373", "208280698", "210696454", "52051232", "202577403", "209059582", "212705194", "196809954", "214624162", "214582862", "33142497", "208909917", "208157845", "195767066", "210472567", "54459227", "211132405", "214727773", "53104309", "49314653", "195584108", "214612169", "49548116", "214728084", "54462131", "85567252", "85567252", "4956314", "214761171", "199000946", "53217510", "53413879", "56256307", "204764685", "209386658", "203641883"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206596260"}

The failure of rolling bearings on spindle is main cause of machine tool faults. Therefore, the significant focus of health management of CNC machine tools and other rotating machines is fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. In terms of the fault diagnosis, it is the most critical task to extracting bearing fault characteristics from vibration signals of rolling bearings. As a result, a new fault diagnosis method for bearing fault classification is proposed in this paper, which is built on the hierarchical entropy and improved Cuckoo Search-Support Vector Machine(CS-SVM). Firstly, ensemble empirical mode decomposition(EEMD) is adopted to decompose time domain vibration signals, aiming at eliminating modal confusion in empirical mode decomposition(EMD) method. Afterwards, the hierarchical entropy is chosen as fault feature parameters compared with sample entropy to construct feature vectors. In addition, the classification algorithm of multiple SVM optimized by the improved CS algorithm is utilized to identify rolling bearing fault modes.

Various hyperspectral indices such as Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Desertification Soil Index (DSI), Salinity Index (SI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were chosen, generated and effectively used for characterizing and mapping soil salinity severity. Salt infestation in the study area was categorized into four classes of normal, slight, moderate, high soil salinity. Hyperspectral indices helped in identification of various features like vegetation, waterlogged area and soil areas under various classes of soil salinity. The salinity index and desertification soil indices were found to respond well to varying degrees of soil salinity. The SVM technique generated soil salinity map with overall classification accuracy of 78.13 percent, with a kappa statistic of 0.71. The results indicated highest accuracy in high soil salinity class in comparison to other classes, attaining producers and users accuracies of 85.71% and 90.0% respectively. Slight saline class showed poor producers and users accuracy. The result showed high accuracy for mapping soil salinity severity with machine learning classifier like SVM using various indices generated from hyperspectral remote sensing data.

In the ICA based fusion, the coefficients of the inpu t images are combined simply by selecting the coeffic ients with maximum magnitude. But this method resulted in fused images with poor contrast, due to the distortion introduced in constant background a reas. The performance of ICA based fusion can be greatly improved by using a region based approach with intelligent decision making in order to choose the significant regions in the source images.

Feature points are then extracted with Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm, whose features are derived through Bag of Features (BoF). Support Vector Machine (SVM) is subsequently applied to classify our gesture image dataset; where the trained dataset is used to recognize future sign language gesture inputs. The proposed framework has been successfully implemented on smartphone platforms, and experimental results show that it is able to recognize and translate 16 different American Sign Language gestures with an overall accuracy of 97.13%.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TENCONSpring.2016.7519386", "venue": "2016 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)", "journal": "2016 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2500655499", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207079297", "211225838", "10323459", "18284918", "28173070", "14612883", "34795221", "19676073", "7008929", "461853", "17957882", "382110", "18452523", "1443500", "130535382", "3705154"], "inbound_citations": ["198929411", "198114969", "199457101", "36114328", "212645178", "52284622", "55783931", "34974521", "50783506", "41302555", "5146363", "59601275", "209696227", "28791125", "52130475"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24008641"}

However, hierarchical structures have two intrinsic issues; back-tracking and empty internal nodes.

The back-tracking is avoided by using the set-pruning and the empty internal nodes are avoided by applying the binary search tree.

The edge priori based SISR methods tend to estimate HR image by edge-preserving constraint. In this paper, a novel learning based SISR method is proposed to reconstruct HR image by using joint HR gradient field and high frequency constraint. In the training phase, interpolated training LR patches with similar structure are partitioned into the same cluster by K-means clustering, and the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are used to get gradient and high frequency regressors in each cluster by training LR/HR patch pairs. In the prediction phase, multi-ELM regressor fusion strategy is used to estimate more accurate gradient and high frequency data, in which the fusion weights are based on the distance of the cluster centers with patch isotropic characteristics. Then, the estimated HR image gradient and high frequency are regarded as a joint constraints priori to reconstruct HR image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better estimating accuracy of gradient and high frequency and have competitive SR quality compared with the other state-of-the-art SISR methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-3005-5_12", "venue": "CCPR", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2534979300", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9852828"}

Recently, many researchers have directed attention to methods of predicting shoreline changes by the use of multispectral images.

Therefore, identification of multi class features which includes vegetation and shoreline using multispectral satellite image is one of the challenges encountered in the detection of shoreline. An efficient framework using the near infrared\u2013histogram equalisation and improved filtering method is proposed to enhance the detection of the shoreline in Tanjung Piai, Malaysia, by using SPOT-5 images. Sub-pixel edge detection and the Wallis filter are used to compute the edge location with the subpixel accuracy and reduce the noise. Then, the image undergoes image classification process by using Support Vector Machine.

However, the not parallel planes may not be accurately determined when the labeled samples is not sufficient. To overcome this disadvantage, in this paper, we introduce a new semi-supervised multi-surface proximal support machine model, which can effectively utilize the labeled and unlabeled samples by incorporating the manifold regularization strategy. Based on this model, we propose a linear semi-supervised multi-surface classification algorithm called SGEPSVM. Further, we develop a non-linear classifier by using kernel trick called SKGEPSVM.

Subjects had to covertly shift their attention with simultaneous visual stimulation and motor planning. The imaging response showed modulation for spatial conditions. Various analysis and decoding methods were assessed to extract a prediction signature from this brain activity. The Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) was the most appropriate for implementing a reliable brain-computer interface (BCI). The LSVM method was applied to the imaging data with various temporal parameters. All variations proved to be suitable to predict experimental parameters (left vs. right eye movement) from the hemodynamic response over PPC. However, due to the slow hemodynamic signal, performance for the LSVM reached only 60% during the later task phases. Thus, the subject s response could not be predicted reliably before the actual movement. Electrophysiological recordings (single unit and local field potentials) were performed in the previously imaged regions to allow comparison with the hemodynamic response. These electrical signals especially the local field potentials proved to be fast and strongly tuned for the spatial parameters of the task. Thus, a reliable BCI that can predict upcoming movements or behaviors will need to combine signals from various sources.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "284047728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60282224"}
