The objects are clustered or grouped based on the principle of maximizing intra-class similarity and minimizing interclass similarity. In this paper, the rough set theory (RST) has been used for attribute clustering. RST is a theory adopted to deal with rough and unsure knowledge, which analyzes the clusters and finds the data principles when previous knowledge is not available, providing a new method for data classification. With the continuous change in data objects we have to improve these relevant technologies over time, and we have to propose creative theory in response, meeting the demands of application, though there are many rough set methods.

At the end, the same classification techniques are applied to classify the original leukemia dataset before application of rough set based attribute clustering.

We propose an new approximation approach to SP-HO-CRFs that resolves these problems. Our approach is a two-layer CRF framework that inherits the simplicity from pairwise CRFs by formulating both the higher-order and pairwise cues into the same pairwise potentials in the first layer.

In this paper, we address the problem of selecting the most informative time instants in multivariate functional data, a case much less studied than its single-variate counterpart. Our proposal allows one to use in a very simple way high-order information of the data, e.g. monotonicity or convexity by means of the functional data derivatives. The aforementioned problem is addressed with tools of Global Optimization in continuous variables: the time instants are selected to maximize the correlation between the class label and the Support Vector Machine score used for classification.

For Gabor wavelets part, local features can be extracted at multiple scales and orientations to form Gabor-feature based image, which in turn improves the recognition rate. Besides, in the presence of occluded face image, the scale of Gabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed accordingly because redundancies exist in Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary. For ELM-AE part, the dimension of Gabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed because high-dimensional face images can be rapidly represented by low-dimensional feature.

The network is trained to produce the plurals and past tense forms of a large corpus of monosyllabic English nouns and verbs.

These include an initial error-free period of performance on both nouns and verbs followed by a period of intermittent over-regularization of irregular nouns and verbs. Errors in the model show evidence of phonological conditioning and frequency effects. Furthermore, the network demonstrates a strong tendency to regularize denominal verbs and deverbal nouns and masters the principles of voicing assimilation.

Most classical works, such as supervised information extraction and distant supervision, focus on how to construct the knowledge base (KB) by utilizing the large number of labels or certain related KBs. However, in many real-world scenarios, the existing methods may not perform well when a new knowledge base is required but only scarce labels or few related KBs available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called, Relation Extraction via Domain-aware Transfer Learning (ReTrans), to extract relation mentions from a given text corpus by exploring the experience from a large amount of existing KBs which may not be closely related to the target relation. We first propose to initialize the representation of relation mentions from the massive text corpus and update those representations according to existing KBs. Based on the representations of relation mentions, we investigate the contribution of each KB to the target task and propose to select useful KBs for boosting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on selected KBs, we develop a novel domain-aware transfer learning framework to transfer knowledge from source domains to the target domain, aiming to infer the true relation mentions in the unstructured text corpus. Most importantly, we give the stability and generalization bound of ReTrans.

Two realms of study were investigated here, including the exploitation of 1) unintentional RF emissions in the field of Side Channel Analysis (SCA), and 2) intentional RF emissions from physical devices in the field of RF-Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting. Statistical analysis on the linear model fit to measured SCA data in Linear Regression Attacks (LRA) improved performance, achieving 98% success rate for AES key-byte identification from unintentional emissions. However, the presence of non-Gaussian noise required the use of a non-parametric classifier to further improve key guessing attacks. RndF based profiling attacks were successful in very high dimensional data sets, correctly guessing all 16 bytes of the AES key with a 50,000 variable dataset. With variable reduction, Random Forest still outperformed Template Attack for this data set, requiring fewer traces and achieving higher success rates with lower misclassification rate. Finally, the use of a RndF classifier is examined for intentional RF emissions from ZigBee devices to enhance security using RF-DNA fingerprinting. RndF outperformed parametric MDA/ML and non-parametric GRLVQI classifiers, providing up to GS =18.0 dB improvement (reduction in required SNR). Network penetration, measured using rogue ZigBee devices, show that the RndF method improved rogue rejection in noisier environments - gains of up to GS =18.0 dB are realized over previous methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "300523827", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["122345787"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107752065"}

Elman (elman@crl.ucsd.edu) Center for Research in Language, UC San Diego; 9500 Gilman Dr. La Jolla, CA 92093-0526 USA Abstract Based on the apparent paucity of input, and the non- obvious nature of linguistic generalizations, Chomskyan linguists assume an innate body of linguistically detailed knowledge, known as Universal Grammar (UG ), and at- tribute to it principles required to account for those \u201cprop- erties of language that can reasonably be supposed not to have been learned\u201d (Chomsky, 1975). A definitive ac- count of learnability is lacking, but is implicit in exam- ples of the application of the logic. Our research demon- strates, however, that important statistical properties of the input have been overlooked, resulting in UG being credited for properties which are demonstrably learnable; in contradiction to Chomsky\u2019s celebrated argument for the innateness of structure-dependence (e.g. Chomsky, 1975), a simple recurrent network (Elman, 1990), given input modelled on child-directed speech, is shown to learn the structure of relative clauses, and to generalize that structure to subject position in aux-questions. The result demonstrates that before a property of language can rea- sonably be supposed not to have been learned, it is neces- sary to give greater consideration to the indirect positive evidence in the data and that connectionism can be invaluable to linguists in that respect. Introduction Chomskyan linguists argue that language acquisition cannot strictly be a matter of learning the child\u2019s tar- get grammar is \u201chopelessly underdetermined by the frag- rather mentary evidence available\u201d (Chomsky, 1968) it must rest on a set of innate linguistic principles; the goal of the Chomskyan linguist is to determine the con- tents of this set, known as Universal Grammar ( UG ). The idea is to attribute to UG all and only the princi- ples required to account for those \u201cproperties of lan- guage that can reasonably be supposed not to have been learned\u201d (Chomsky, 1975). Learning theory is thus of central importance to the enterprise, but, oddly, a defini- tive account of the notion of learning that Chomskyans adopt is lacking, and is given only implicitly in the examples of the principles attributed to UG . Statisti- cal approaches, however, and the notions of generaliza- tion and analogy have been explicitly rejected as irrel- evant (Chomsky, 1975). In this paper we demonstrate that UG has been that this rejection is a serious error attributed with principles to account for properties of lan- guage that are demonstrably learnable from the statistical properties of the input. Chomsky\u2019s celebrated argument for the innateness of the principle of structure-dependence (Chomsky, 1975) serves as an example. Chomsky claims that, during the course of language acquisition, children entertain only hypotheses which respect the abstract structural organization of language, though the data may also be consistent with structure-independent hypotheses, i.e. relationships over utterances considered only as linearly ordered word sequences. As support for this claim, Chomsky notes that though questions like (1) are apparently absent in the child\u2019s input, questions like (2) are never erroneously produced a claim subsequently 1) Is the man who is smoking crazy? 2) * Is the man who smoking is crazy? empirically tested and substantiated by Crain and Nakayama (1987, also see Crain 1991). Chomsky sug- gests that it is reasonable to suppose that children de- rive aux-questions from declaratives, and exposed to only simpler structures, might hypothesize either of two sorts of rules: a structure-independent rule i.e. move or the correct structure-dependent rule. the first \u2018is\u2019 Chomsky claims that \u201ccases that distinguish the hy- potheses rarely arise; you can easily live your whole life without ever producing a relevant example to show that you are using one hypothesis rather than the other one\u201d (Piatelli-Palmarini, 1980). The fact that children do not produce questions like (2), despite that the correct rule is supposedly more complex, and that the learner might not encounter the relevant evidence leads Chom- sky to suggest that \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion is that UG contains the principle that all such rules must be structure-dependent\u201d (Chomsky, 1975). As a number of researchers have noted, however, there are several weaknesses in this argument. Slobin (1991), for instance, points out that the conclusion rests on the assumption that aux-questions are derived from declar-", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2767487109", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["14144332", "145428748", "60438898", "146954908", "9640291", "170501691", "146789070", "145428868", "62554493", "2763403", "211724331", "2105042", "850782", "141325313", "18074295", "15177593", "147554918", "106798131"], "inbound_citations": ["195814634", "9166220", "113403469", "16541054", "52200586", "16561398", "440636", "15997449", "8752384", "7498466", "59849792", "54825684", "1974029", "1098532", "16801069"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2067309"}

The purpose of this study was to explore the application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model in merging search engine query data and traditional influenza data. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: The official monthly reported number of influenza cases in Liaoning province in China was acquired from the China National Scientific Data Center for Public Health from January 2011 to December 2015. Based on Baidu Index, a publicly available search engine database, search queries potentially related to influenza over the corresponding period were identified.

A reservoir computer is composed bya recurrent nonlinear network, which performs feature recognition on the inputs, and alinear output layer. Learning only occurs in the linear layer; a reservoir computer cantherefore use many more nonlinear units in the recurrent layer without becomingunmaneageable. Reservoir computers excel in processing time-dependent signals, withperformances at the state-of-the-art level for various tasks; at the same time, they aregood candidates for hardware implementations.Here we present an overview of our lab\u2018s activities in the field of physical reservoircomputers. We have built an optoelectronic[2] and a full-optical[3] reservoir computer,both based on time multiplexing, i.e. the idea of using a single nonlinear node and a delayline rather than several physically distinct nonlinear nodes.For the optoelectronic setup we use a Mach-Zehnder modulator as the nonlinear element,while we use a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) for the all-optical setup; a fiberspool is used in both cases as the delay line. We show in both cases the performance onbenchmark tasks, which is on par with the one from software reservoirs of comparablesizes.We also show an hardware implementation of the analogh readout layer[4]. For this, weuse a Mach-Zehnder modulator to multiply the reservoir states, encoded as lightintensities, by arbitrary coefficients, and a capacitor to integrate the multiplicated statesand produce the output of the linear layer.Preliminary results show that while we sacrifice some of the performance of our reservoirusing this readout, we also gain a factor of 20 in its operating speed, by removing theneed for postprocessing the reservoir outputs. The main advantage of the analog readouthowever is that it opens the possibility of online training, which we hope that will lead toa further improvement on the reservoir performance and eventually to the first allhardware,self-operating reservoir.References[1]M.

Typical classification models hardly deal with artifacts and low discrimination of landmark regions by using only local image information, while regression models suffer from ambiguity between random samples and label, also the imbalance of samples. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a left ventricle landmark localization and identification method in cardiac MRI based on deep distance metric learning and CNN (convolutional neural network) regression. The method includes sample generation and regression stages, where super-pixel over-segmentation and unsupervised deep metric learning are integrated to extract the embedding information of local images, then a dual-channel salient sample mining module is designed by integrating specific super-pixel patches and grid patches extracted by the embedded triplet network. The weights of this triplet network are fed to build the CNN regression model, and the salient samples are employed to predict the landmark coordinate point cloud clusters. Furthermore, the centroid of each point cloud cluster is refined as landmark by Mean Shift iteration.

Such learning requires that the robot can observe behavior and extract the sine qua non conditions for when particular actions can be produced. The observed behavior can be either the robots own explorative behavior, or the behavior of humans that it observes. In either case, the only additional information should be from the human, stating whether the observed behavior is legal or not. Such learning may mimic the way that infants learn, through interaction with their caregivers. In the current research we implement a learning capability based on these principals of extracting rules from observed behavior using \"Human-Robot\" interaction or \"Human-Human\" interaction. We test the system using three games: In the first, the robot must copy a pattern formed by the human; in the second the robot must perform the mirror action of the human. In the third game, the robot must learn the legal moves of Tic Tac Toe.

Recently, the generative adversarial networks (GAN) has become one of the most popular architectures for image steganography. However, the GAN-based image steganographic algorithms directly conduct the secret data embedding on the entire cover images and do not sufficiently take the regional texture complexity into account, which will compromise the anti-detection ability. To address this issue, we propose a novel image steganographic algorithm on the generated foreground object region with rich textures. More specifically, the foreground object region is generated onto a given cover image by the GAN, and the secret data is embedded in the foreground object region simultaneously during the generation of the region.

A review is proposed of the impact of word representations and classification methods in the task of theme identification of telephone conversation services having highly imperfect automatic transcriptions. We firstly compare two word-based representations using the classical Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency with Gini purity criteria (TF-IDF-Gini) method and the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) approach. We then introduce a classification method that takes advantage of the LDA topic space representation, highlighted as the best word representation. To do so, two assumptions about topic representation led us to choose a Gaussian Process (GP) based method. Its performance is compared with a classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method. Experiments showed that the GP approach is a better solution to deal with the multiple theme complexity of a dialogue, no matter the conditions studied (manual or automatic transcriptions) (Morchid et al., 2014). In order to better understand results obtained using different word representation methods and classification approaches, we then discuss the impact of discriminative and non-discriminative words extracted by both word representations methods in terms of transcription accuracy (Morchid et al., 2014). Finally, we propose a novel study that evaluates the impact of the Word Error Rate (WER) in the LDA topic space learning process as well as during the theme identification task. This original qualitative study points out that selecting a small subset of words having the lowest WER (instead of using all the words) allows the system to better classify automatic transcriptions with an absolute gain of 0.9 point, in comparison to the best performance achieved on this dialogue classification task (precision of 83.3%).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.csl.2015.12.001", "venue": "Comput.

Pollen morphological characters are very useful in plant classification and identification of plants. Pollen studies are widely used in allergy and epidemiology research, fossil fuel exploration, forensic science, food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industry, biotechnology, and so many other fields. Hence classification of pollen grains is a challenge that can be effectively done by computational intelligence approach. The traditional method of pollen classification analyses the pollen morphological characters using microscopy. This procedure is tedious and requires experts from the field of palynology. With a view to extract features from pollen images, a new classification strategy is developed which proposes Image Histogram coefficients in addition to image statistics and shape descriptor. The suitability of classifiers based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is explored with the optimization of their respective parameters in view of reduction in time as well as space complexity. Performance of two classifiers has been compared with respect to MSE, NMSE, and Classification accuracy. The Average Classification Accuracy of MLP comprising of two hidden layers is found to be superior (95 % on Cross Validation dataset) to SVM based classifier. Finally, optimal Classification strategy has been developed, which could be easily modified to classify more than 10 species. The proposed strategy will provide an effective alternative to traditional method of pollen image analysis for plant taxonomy and species identification, which is obvious from the cross-validation performance on the dataset containing ten different plant species.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/I2CT.2014.7092120", "venue": "International Conference for Convergence for Technology-2014", "journal": "International Conference for Convergence for Technology-2014", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2011038894", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14160844", "15395771", "62769375", "84785753", "18726829", "13900893", "61945090", "82211982", "16377564", "52874011"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26492278"}

To help doctors to be more selective on biopsies and provide a second opinion on diagnosis, in this work, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for lung diseases including cancers and tuberculosis (TB). The system is developed based on transfer learning. We propose a novel transfer learning method: sentential fine-tuning .

We obtained a overall accuracy of 77.0% a dataset of 81 normal cases, 76 tuberculosis cases and 277 lung cancer cases while the other traditional transfer learning methods achieve an accuracy of 73% and 68%. . The detection accuracy of our method for cancers, TB and normal cases are 87%, 54% and 91% respectively.

The majority of these domains are highly declarative and usually lack procedural-oriented knowledge. Also, most of the systems have been devoted to acquire rules that represent domain knowledge.

Utilizing the features from the terminal voltage response of the Li-ion battery under current pulse test, a new method is proposed in this paper by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for accurately estimating the battery SOH. Since the terminal voltage measured at the same condition varies with the battery aging process, the features for SOH estimation are extracted from the voltage response under a specific current pulse test. The benefit of the proposed method is that the features come from the short-term test, which is much convenient to be obtained in real applications. After applying the short term current pulse test (few seconds), the keen points and the slopes in the voltage response curve are selected as the potential candidate features. In order to find the most effective feature for SOH estimation, all the possible combinations of the features are investigated and compared.

The bug reports are submitted into the bug tracking system with high speed, and owing to this, bug repository size has been increasing at an enormous rate. This increased bug repository size introduces biases in the bug triage process. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the severity of a bug report to balance the bug triaging process. Previously, many machine learning models were proposed for automation of bug severity classification. The accuracy of these models is not up to the mark because they do not extract the important feature patterns for learning the classifier. This paper proposes a novel deep learning model for multiclass severity classification called Bug Severity classification to address these challenges by using a Convolutional Neural Network and Random forest with Boosting (BCR). This model directly learns the latent and highly representative features. Initially, the natural language techniques preprocess the bug report text, and then n-gram is used to extract the features. Further, the Convolutional Neural Network extracts the important feature patterns of respective severity classes. Lastly, the random forest with boosting classifies the multiple bug severity classes. The average accuracy of the proposed model is 96.34% on multiclass severity of five open source projects. The average F-measures of the proposed BCR and the existing approach were 96.43% and 84.24%, respectively, on binary class severity classification. The results prove that the proposed BCR approach enhances the performance of bug severity classification over the state-of-the-art techniques.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6651582", "pubmed_id": "31284398", "doi": "10.3390/s19132964", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2955518678", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["86839791", "41356", "214266", "126979578", "28687801", "52194924", "38360709", "14686380", "5700223", "6399332", "17710598", "17209097", "12658488", "54459008", "13618178", "52278301", "52119305", "21703619", "85542081", "12713943", "15486640", "3839934", "32692295", "38128528", "51842173", "9312951", "51922218", "64892690", "26907619", "43802929", "29047675", "46884080", "117317109", "6942653", "5011125", "196004521", "7378736"], "inbound_citations": ["211120422"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195845068"}

Hence, Health Index (HI) construction is a research field of interest. In conventional HI construction methods, performance features have to be selected manually based on experience and expert knowledge. This is a time-consuming procedure requiring a detailed understanding of the component. Furthermore, outliers usually exist in any HI constructed, and these can result in false alarms when HIs are subsequently used. To solve those problems, a new 'end-to-end' methodology, which combines Deep Convolutional Inner-Ensemble Learning (DCIEL) with an Outlier Removal method, is proposed for the degradation assessment of roller bearings. In the DCIEL algorithm, an inner-ensemble structure including multiple Deep Learning (DL) blocks is used to extract features directly from raw vibrational signals obtained from bearings. A novel DL block including two convolution layers and one nonlinear pooling layer is proposed. The obtained features are mapped into the HI using a Global Average layer, an Averaging layer, and a Logistic Regression layer.

The scope of transfer is essentially a knowledge representation question. Experiences during learning can lead to alternative latent representations of the acquired knowledge, not all of which are equally useful. Productive learning facilitates a general representation that yields accurate behavior in a large variety of new situations, thus enabling transfer. This chapter explores two hypotheses. First, learning to think happens in pieces and these pieces, or knowledge components, are the basis of a mechanistic explanation of transfer. This hypothesis yields an instructional engineering prescription: that scientific methods of cognitive task analysis can be used to discover these knowledge components, and the resulting cognitive models can be used to redesign instruction so as to foster better transfer. The second hypothesis is that symbolic languages act as agents of transfer by focusing learning on abstract knowledge components that can enhance thinking across a wide variety of situations. The language of algebra is a prime example and we use it to illustrate (1) that cognitive task analysis can reveal knowledge components hidden to educators; (2) that such components may be acquired, like first language grammar rules, implicitly through practice; (3) that these components may be \u201cbig ideas\u201d not in their complexity but in terms of their usefulness as they produce transfer across contexts; and (4) that domain-specific knowledge analysis is critical to effective application of domain-general instructional strategies.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199734689.013.0040", "venue": "Oxford Handbooks Online", "journal": "Oxford Handbooks Online", "mag_id": "2127523403", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["58915570", "576114", "87222", "17902518", "30355391"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61208257"}

Firstly, the feature bands including the main information at the bottom of the ancient tomb are selected by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation to realize the data dimension. Then, the image classification was performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on feature bands. Finally, the material at the bottom of ancient tomb is identified by spectral analysis and spectral matching. The results show that SVM based on feature bands can not only ensure the classification accuracy, but also shorten the data processing time and improve the classification efficiency.

Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods either learn a single domain discriminator to align the global source and target distributions, or pay attention to align subdomains based on multiple discriminators. However, in real applications, the marginal (global) and conditional (local) distributions between domains are often contributing differently to the adaptation. There is currently no method to dynamically and quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of these two distributions for adversarial learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Adversarial Adaptation Network (DAAN) to dynamically learn domain-invariant representations while quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of global and local domain distributions. To the best of our knowledge, DAAN is the first attempt to perform dynamic adversarial distribution adaptation for deep adversarial learning.

In this work we propose a practically viable procedure to perform website categorization, based on the automatic generation of data records summarizing the content of each entire website. This is obtained by using web scraping and optical character recognition, followed by a number of nontrivial text mining and feature engineering steps. When such records have been produced, we use classification algorithms to categorize the websites according to the aspect of interest. We compare in this task Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Logistic classifiers. Since in many practical cases the training set labels are physiologically noisy, we analyze the robustness of each technique with respect to the presence of misclassified training records.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are trained for each modality respectively. For fusing multiple features extracted with CNNs, we propose to add a fusion layer on the top of CNNs to learn a joint video representation.

Compare to existing works, (1) our work measures the benefits of taking audio information into consideration and (2) implements sophisticated fusion methods. The effectiveness of proposed approach is evaluated on UCF101 and UCF101-50 (selected subset in which each video contains audio data) for action recognition. The experimental results show that different modalities are complementary to each other and multimodal representation can be beneficial for final prediction.

It plays an important role in the process of protein structure prediction by guiding us to select an appropriate combination of templates out of many possibilities [1]. We formulate the QA problem as mapping and regression. Protein models are mapped into R n space by extracting n features from each model, and the space is divided into subspaces according to the feature values in order to represent models\u2019 closeness (between 0 and 1) to the native structure. For the feature values, we measure the degree of agreement between the predicted property from the sequence analysis and the calculated one from the 3D model. Properties that we use include the secondary structure, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity, and energy components from MODELLER [2], DFIRE [3], and TASSER [4]. One advantage of using the consensustype feature is that models with similar quality are prone to be clustered together in R n space, and thus they tend to be well classified. Assigning closeness values to regions of R n space is carried out using decoy structures generated during the CASP7 with known native structures [1] by applying Support Vector Machine regression techniques (SVM). SVM that we used has the character of non-linearity which can be applied to the linearly non-separable cases. In other words, for given features, SVM is more efficient than the linear method such as linear programming. The proposed method was used to select final models during the CASP8 prediction.

To address this, cross-spectral pedestrian detection methods have been presented using color and thermal, and shown substantial performance gains on the challenging circumstances. However, their paired cross-spectral settings have limited applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we propose a novel learning framework for cross-spectral pedestrian detection in an unpaired setting. Based on an assumption that features from color and thermal images share their characteristics in a common feature space to benefit their complement information, we design the separate feature embedding networks for color and thermal images followed by sharing detection networks. To further improve the cross-spectral feature representation, we apply an adversarial learning scheme to intermediate features of the color and thermal images.

With the rise in global energy awareness, smart grids enhance the potency and peak levelling of power systems. DSM is the controlling scheme in such grids and it aims to optimize several characteristics of load demand. This smart grids comprises energy storage (battery) and distributed solar photovoltaic generation storage. In this proposed methodology the combination of Glow-worm Swarm Optimization (GSO) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for decision making process in battery storage to reduce the electricity tariff. GSO is a powerful technique to obtain near optimal solution which is used for this load rescheduling problem for a sample test system to minimize the cost of end user. Especially, the electricity expenditures of the end user can be reduced by responding to pricing which changes with different hours of a day. Then optimized range of the battery's energy storage is extracted from the GSO. Here, the SVM is trained based on the optimized data from the GSO. This combination is used for finding the amount of energy is transferred in/out the battery which aims the minimal electricity bill value. The electricity tariff of the proposed methodology of Average gosc is 2.27 for residential load, while considering it is less when compared to the existing method of 2.3 at the consumed load of 8.2 kWh/day.

Our focus lies on exploring the effects that perceived risks and benefits as well as user characteristics and propagation mechanisms had on causing such resistance. With survey data from 339 airport users, a support vector machine (SVM) model was implemented to provide a tool for classifying resistance causes correctly, and csQCA (crisp set Qualitative Comparative Analysis) was implemented in order to understand the complex underlying causes.

We propose in this paper a novel architecture for cloud computing called Community-based Cloud Computing whose main goal is to improve the quality and performance of the cloud services. In this architecture, cloud services sharing the same domain of interest are partitioned into a set of communities led by a central entity called master. The advantages of such an architecture are (1) facilitating the discovery of cloud services, (2) providing efficient means for better QoS management and resources utilization, and (3) easing intra-layer and cross-layer compositions. However, one of the serious challenges against the success of such an architecture is the presence of malicious services that launch attacks either against the whole community or against some partners in that Community. Therefore, we address this problem by proposing a misbehavior detection framework based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning technique. In this framework, the master of the community monitors the behavior of its community members to populate the training set of the classifier. Thereafter, SVM is used to analyze this set and predict the final classes of the cloud services. Simulation results show that our framework is able to produce highly accurate classifiers, while maximizing the attack detection rate and minimizing the false alarms.

More specifically, a novel methodology is investigated for discriminating defects by applying a supervised neural classification technique, namely SVM, to innovative multidimensional wavelet based feature vectors. These vectors are extracted from the K-Level 2-D DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) transformed original image using Vector Quantization techniques and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Analysis applied to these wavelet domain quantization vectors. The results of the proposed methodology are illustrated in defective textile images where the defective areas are recognized with higher accuracy than the one obtained by applying two rival defect detection methodologies.

The effectiveness of this net has already been shown by applications to function approximation, control, precipitation estimation, and other problems. The learning algorithm essentially includes competitive learning based on the gradient method and suffers from the local solution problem. The purpose of this paper is to circumvent this problem. First, the asymptotic optimality condition, that is, the optimality condition for minimizing the mean-square error of the approximation function, is derived for the case in which the net is composed of a very large number of units. This condition can be used to decide whether the weight assignment each time is close to the optimal solution, and also to suggest weight assignments closer to the optimal solution. The condition is incorporated into a learning algorithm based on the gradient method, resulting in the following learning algorithm: when it is decided that the weight assignment obtained by the gradient method is not close to the optimal solution, the weights of some units are reinitialized so that the weight assignment is closer to the optimal solution. Finally, numerical experiments are performed in which the proposed learning algorithm is applied to several benchmark functions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified. The results are compared to the results of experiments by BPN (Back-Propagation Net), RBFN (Radial Basis Function Net), and SVR (Support Vector Regression), and it is shown that CAN2 based on the proposed algorithm has excellent function approximation performance. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

But, if accurate information is not provided to the driver on time then it is of no use and the delay can even lead to disastrous consequences. To improve behavioral realism in real life navigation scenarios we need intelligent and speedy decisions. Such decisions rely on the information being extracted from real-time images. We need to select the best available features/information that can be used as neural network inputs and ultimately predict the next move of the vehicle. Little work has been done on selection of best features of navigation images and research needs to be done in this gray area as its results have direct impact on the classification accuracy and generalized performance of automotive navigation planning. This article proposes a novel approach to find the best possible set of features from real-time navigation images by using Boruta Algorithm and Earth Algorithm so as to improve the prediction power of vehicle to either move or stop in the next course of action. The results obtained were cross-validated by using three classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor on the basis of parameters: Classification accuracy and prediction performance. It was identified that the proposed model maintained the classification accuracy and performed with more superiority by getting rid of the irrelevant features of images and thereby reducing the training time as compared to computations done on the basis of original feature set. The prediction speed of the proposed model was found to be much better than the model without feature selection.

The proposed method extracts unique shapes of text components by studying the relationship between dominant points such as straight or cursive over contours of text components, which is called COLD in polar domain. We consider edge components as text candidates if the edge components in Canny and Sobel of an input image share the COLD property. For each text candidate, we further study its COLD distribution at component level to extract statistical features and angle oriented features. Next, these features are fed to a random forest classifier to eliminate false text candidates, which results representatives. We then perform grouping using representatives to form text lines based on the distances between edge components in the edge image. The statistical and angle orientated features are finally extracted at word level for eliminating false positives, which results in text detection.

SVM is firmly based on the theory of statistical learning, uses regression technique by introducing varepsilon-insensitive loss function. RVM is based on a Bayesian formulation of a linear model with an appropriate prior that results in a sparse representation. It also gives variance of predicted data. The inputs of models are width of footing (B), depth of footing (D), footing geometry (L/B), unit weight of sand (\u03b3) and angle of shearing resistance (\u03d5). Equations have been developed for the determination of qu of shallow foundation on cohesionless soil based on the SVM and RVM models. Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to determine the effect of each input parameter. This study shows that the developed SVM and RVM are robust models for the prediction of qu of shallow foundation on cohesionless soil.

Various classifiers from the Classification Learner App in MATLAB is used to recognize the common sport activity. In data collection, 10 subjects are asked to perform several common sport activities which is stationary, walking, jogging, sprinting, and jumping. The data is collected by using Physilog\u00ae 4 Silver which is an inertial sensor from Gait Up that is attached to the chest of the subject using strap. 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data from inertial sensor is observed and processed in this study. To recognize the common sport activity from the data, time-domain features such as mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum value is extracted from the signal produced by inertial sensor. After that, the data is trained using the selected features and 10-fold cross validation is applied to set the training and testing data. The confusion matrix and accuracy result from each classifier is observed. In conclusion, Support Vector Machine with Cubic SVM is selected as the best model in recognizing common sport activity as it produced the highest accuracy, 91.2% in the confusion matrix.

Many studies have compared the prediction accuracy of different SDM modeling methods, but few have quantified the similarity among prediction maps. There has also been little systematic exploration of how the relative importance of different predictor variables varies among model types. Our objective was to expand the evaluation of SDM performance for 45 plant species in southern California to better understand how map predictions vary among model types, and to explain what factors may affect spatial correspondence, including the selection and relative importance of different environmental variables. Four types of models were tested. Correlation among maps was highest between generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) and lowest between classification trees and GAMs or GLMs. Correlation between Random Forests (RFs) and GAMs was the same as between RFs and classification trees. Spatial correspondence among maps was influenced the most by model prediction accuracy (AUC) and species prevalence; map correspondence was highest when accuracy was high and prevalence was intermediate. Species functional type and the selection of climate variables also influenced map correspondence. For most (but not all) species, climate variables were more important than terrain or soil in predicting their distributions. Environmental variable selection varied according to modeling method, but the largest differences were between RFs and GLMs or GAMs. Although prediction accuracy was equal for GLMs, GAMs, and RFs, the differences in spatial predictions suggest that it may be important to evaluate the results of more than one model to estimate a range of spatial uncertainty before making planning decisions based on map outputs.

This paper describes a novel approach for the problem of pose estimation and eye detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experimental results using frontal, and 33.75\u00b0 rotated left and right poses, respectively, demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for pose estimation. The image (face) data comes from the standard FERET data base, the training set consists of 150 images equally distributed among frontal, 33.75\u00b0 rotated left and right poses, respectively, and the test set consists of 450 images again equally distributed among the three different types of poses.

Traditional methods employed in language analysis have focused on developing powerful formalisms to represent syntactic or semantic structures along with rules for transforming language into these formalisms. However, they make use of only small subsets of knowledge. This article describes how to use the whole range of information through a neurosymbolic architecture which is a hybridization of a symbolic network and subsymbol vectors generated from a connectionist network. Besides initializing the symbolic network with prior knowledge, the subsymbol vectors are used to enhance the system's capability in disambiguation and provide flexibility in sentence understanding. The model captures a diversity of information including word associations, syntactic restrictions, case-role expectations, semantic rules and context. It attains highly interactive processing by representing knowledge in an associative network on which actual semantic inferences are performed. An integrated use of previously analyzed sentences in understanding is another important feature of our model. The model dynamically selects one hypothesis among multiple hypotheses. This notion is supported by three simulations which show the degree of disambiguation relies both on the amount of linguistic rules and the semantic-associative information available to support the inference processes in natural language understanding. Unlike many similar systems, our hybrid system is more sophisticated in tackling language disambiguation problems by using linguistic clues from disparate sources as well as modeling context effects into the sentence analysis.

Domain adaptation techniques solve this problem by training transferable models from the label-rich source domain to the label-scarce target domain. Unfortunately, a majority of the existing domain adaptation techniques rely on the availability of the target-domain data, and thus limit their applications to a small community across few computer vision problems. In this paper, we tackle the challenging zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) problem, where the target-domain data is non-available in the training stage. For this purpose, we propose conditional coupled generative adversarial networks (CoCoGAN) by extending the coupled generative adversarial networks (CoGAN) into a conditioning model. Compared with the existing state of the arts, our proposed CoCoGAN is able to capture the joint distribution of dual-domain samples in two different tasks, i.e. the relevant task (RT) and an irrelevant task (IRT). We train the CoCoGAN with both source-domain samples in RT and the dual-domain samples in IRT to complete the domain adaptation. While the former provide the high-level concepts of the non-available target-domain data, the latter carry the sharing correlation between the two domains in RT and IRT. To train the CoCoGAN in the absence of the target-domain data for RT, we propose a new supervisory signal, i.e. the alignment between representations across tasks. Extensive experiments carried out demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGAN outperforms existing state of the arts in image classifications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2019.00347", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2986915914", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206764694", "8577357", "206595056", "10686834", "12507257", "7559976", "6755881", "2871880", "7045213", "12825123", "1033682", "59785963", "20186541", "21012775", "1010081", "9286850", "1865113", "12353172", "49655941", "6037691", "52956008", "10627900", "556999", "745350", "14542261", "12803511", "3172259", "2630174", "2202933", "4922468", "53034461", "12570770", "4547917", "2268966", "8229065", "2871984", "2655115", "4357800", "17169365", "49883347", "41805341", "702279", "24919744", "59291917", "6746686", "11824004"], "inbound_citations": ["211082618"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208002892"}

Multi-Task sequence labeling is essential for action recognition, since motions can be often classified into multi-labels, e.g. he is folding arms while sitting. The MT-CRFs: extensions of conditional random fields (CRFs), incorporate jointly interaction between action labels as well as Markov property of actions, to improve the performance of the joint accuracy: the accuracy for whole labels at specific time. The MT-CRFs offer several advantages over the generative dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), which are often utilized as multi-task sequence labelers. First, the MT-CRFs allow relaxing the strong assumption of conditional independence of observed motion, which is used in DBNs. Second, the MT-CRFs exploit the power of non-Markovian discriminative classification frameworks instead of generative models in DBNs.

It is argued how urban vegetation change could also be derived from the building change study. Two areas of four square kms each, from central Spain, were considered to test the proposed approach. The first area corresponds to the university Campus of Alcala, where few changes have happened in the last years; and the second area corresponds to a new residential area in the suburb of the city of Alcala, with many constructions in the last years. Results showed a 1% and 7% increase of buildings respectively. The proposed method was evaluated for efficacy and suitability using ground truth obtained manually for the second area.

In order to prevent such life threatening and life quality reducing conditions it is essential to provide better algorithms, capable of being integrated in low-cost personalized health systems. This paper presents a new algorithm for AF detection, which is based on the analysis of the three physiological characteristics of AF: 1) Irregularity of heart rate and; 2) Absence of P-waves and 3) Presence of fibrillatory waves. Based on these characteristics several features were extracted from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and selected according to their discrimination ability. The classification between AF and non-AF episodes was performed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model.

In this paper, we address the problem of mites infestation detection using temporal hyperspectral data and also evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for mites infestation detection. The reflectance data from grape leaves with healthy and low infestations of mites have been collected using spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm during 15th Jan \u2013 18th Feb 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multitemporal data difficult. Data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis but this large feature set may cause the over-fitting problem and also poses the requirement of large storage and greater processing time. To avoid this, feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) has been carried out to get the optimum band set. Features selected by LASSO were fed to classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to evaluate their performance. Results suggest that LR based model provides maximum accuracy of 93.24%. In addition to this, to investigate the potential of using Sentinel-2, data in 213 narrow bands were simulated to Sentinel-2.

For such predictions, it is crucial to avoid underestimating power since reliability issues and possible chip damage might occur. It becomes necessary to eliminate or strictly limit underestimations by relaxing accuracy constraints while decreasing the likelihood that the estimation undershoots the actual value.

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network with fast training rate and good generalization capability, but due to the existence of training error, ELM cannot be directly used to handle monotonic classification problems. This work proposes a generalization of ELM for processing the monotonic classification, named as Monotonic Classification Extreme Learning Machine (MCELM) in which the monotonicity constraints are imposed to the original ELM model. Mathematically, MCELM is a quadratic programming problem in which the monotonicity relationships are considered as constraints and the training error is the objective to be minimized. The mathematical model of MCELM not only can make the generated classifier monotonic but also can minimize the classification error. MCELM does not need to tune parameters iteratively, and therefore, keeps the advantage of extremely fast training which is the essential characteristic of ELM. MCELM does not require that the monotonic relationships existing between features and the output are consistent, which essentially relaxes the assumption of consistent monotonicity used in most existing approaches to handling monotonic classification problems. In comparison with exiting approaches to handling monotonic classification, MCELM can indeed generate a monotonicity-reserving classifier which experimentally shows a much better generalization capability on both artificial and real world datasets.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2016.11.021", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2551832303", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53047106", "212415141", "209502481", "53111799", "209325191"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20288851"}

The collection of such samples is expensive and time demanding. Hence, unsupervised feature learning, which has a quick access to arbitrary amounts of unlabeled data, is conceptually of high interest. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, fully Conv\u2013Deconv network, for unsupervised spectral\u2013spatial feature learning of hyperspectral images, which is able to be trained in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, our network is based on the so-called encoder\u2013decoder paradigm, i.e., the input 3-D hyperspectral patch is first transformed into a typically lower dimensional space via a convolutional subnetwork (encoder), and then expanded to reproduce the initial data by a deconvolutional subnetwork (decoder). However, during the experiment, we found that such a network is not easy to be optimized. To address this problem, we refine the proposed network architecture by incorporating: 1) residual learning and 2) a new unpooling operation that can use memorized max-pooling indexes. Moreover, to understand the \u201cblack box,\u201d we make an in-depth study of the learned feature maps in the experimental analysis. A very interesting discovery is that some specific \u201cneurons\u201d in the first residual block of the proposed network own good description power for semantic visual patterns in the object level, which provide an opportunity to achieve \u201cfree\u201d object detection.

Here, we present an exhaustive evaluation and validation of a robust, replicable and scalable framework that maps forest aboveground biomass over large areas at fine-resolution by linking airborne lidar and field data with machine learning algorithms. We developed this framework over multiple phases of bottom-up monitoring efforts within NASA's Carbon Monitoring Program. Lidar data were collected by different local and federal agencies and provided a wall-to-wall coverage of three states in the USA (Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware with a total area of 157,865 km2). We generated a set of standardized forestry metrics from lidar-derived imagery (i.e. canopy height model, CHM) to minimize inconsistency of data quality. We then estimated plot-scale biomass from field data that had the closet acquisition time to lidar data, and linked to lidar metrics using Random Forest models at four USDA Forest Service ecological regions. Additionally, we examined pixel-scale errors using independent field plot measurements across these ecoregions. Collectively, we estimate a total of ~680 Tg C in aboveground biomass over the Tri-State region (13 DE, 103 MD, 564 PA) circa 2011. A comparison with existing products at pixel-, county-, and state-scale highlighted the contribution of trees over \"non-forested\" areas, including urban trees and small patches of trees, an important biomass component largely omitted by previous studies due to insufficient spatial resolution. Our results indicated that integrating field data and low point density (~ 1 pt\u2022m-2) airborne lidar can generate large-scale aboveground biomass products at an accuracy close to mainstream lidar forestry applications (R2=0.46 ~ 0.54, RMSE=51.4 ~ 54.7 Mg\u2022ha-1; and R2=0.33 ~ 0.61; RMSE=65.3 ~ 100.9 Mg\u2022ha-1; independent validation).

ICML is the annual conference of the lnternational Machine Learning Society (IMLS), and forms an international forum for the discussion and presentation of the latest results in the field of machine learning. This year, ICML was co-located with the 15th lnternational Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP-2005), the proceedings of which are published by Springer Verlag in a separate volume. ::: ::: The papers in this volume were selected on the basis of a thorough review process. In the first round of reviewing, three program committee members produced individual reviews for a paper. Authors then had the opportunity to view those reviews and submit an author's reply to the reviewers. Led by the responsible area chair, the reviewers then engaged in a discussion about the paper, ultimately leading to the decision by the program chairs. In sum, of the 491 papers that were initially submitted, 62 were accepted immediately, and a further 81 were conditionally accepted and reconsidered after resubmission in a second round of reviewing. Of those 81 conditionally accepted papers, 72 were finally accepted, leading to a total of 134 accepted papers, which translates into an acceptance rate of 27.3 %. The author reply was a new feature of ICML this year, while the option of working with conditional accepts has already become a tradition. ::: ::: In addition to the presentations of the accepted papers, the ICML program included several other features. On the first and last day of the conference, 11 workshops and 6 tutorials on current topics of machine learning were held. For many of these, proceedings and/or presentation materials are available online from the ICML website. The other days of the conference each featured an invited talk by a prominent researcher as a program highlight. We were delighted that Johannes Gehrke of Cornell University, Michael Jordan of the University of California at Berkeley, and Gerhard Widmer of the University of Linz in Austria, agreed to deliver an invited talk. The abstracts of their talks are also published as part of these proceedings. ::: ::: Continuing a long standing tradition at ICML, all papers presented in a talk at the conference were also exhibited at evening poster sessions, giving everyone ample time to discuss the results in depth. In order to emphasize the co-location with ILP-2005, the program contained joint elements in both invited speakers, paper sessions, poster sessions, and tutorials. As usual, the scientific program was complemented by a social program, this time featuring an excursion to the scenic surroundings of the city of Bonn. ::: ::: During the conference best paper and best student paper awards were presented, the former being sponsored by NICTA, the later by the Machine Learning Journal.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1102351", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2610534071,2911997683", "mag_field_of_study": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:65247889"}

This article describes detailedly Active Leaning sampling algorithm which is used to select representative training samples to reduce the dependence of model on the measured value. In this paper, the mean of spectrum and image entropy of hyperspectral images are extracted to build model with TVB-N. For reflecting the performance of Active Leaning algorithm, there are two cases to be considered, in the first case, randomly select 135 samples from 180 samples as modeling samples at first, and the rest of 45 samples are set as testing samples, then respectively use Random, KS (Kennard and Stone ) and Active Leaning sampling algorithm to select n(n=15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135) training samples from modeling samples ; in the second case, respectively use Random, KS and Active Leaning sampling algorithm to select n training samples from all the samples, and the rest of samples are set as testing samples set.

A continuous wave 32-channel fNIRS from OxyMonfNIRS device (Artinis) and 19-channel EEG from (g.tec's company) were utilized to study the oxygenation procedure as well as the electrical activity of the brain when doing the problems of Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) intelligence test. We used this information to estimate the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the individual without performing a complete logical-mathematical intelligence test in a long-time period and examining the answers of people to the questions. After EEG preprocessing, different features including Higuchi's fractal dimension, Shannon entropy values from wavelet transform coefficients, and average power of frequency sub-bands were extracted. Clean fNIRS signals were also used to compute features such as slope, mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, and peak.

There is the need to extract the most relevant features out of these datasets to keep predictive models simple, accurate and free of pollution with irrelevant information. Multi-variate regression methods and evolutionary algorithms have been used to achieve this feat. However, the former could not handle the non-linearity in most problems that involve natural phenomena such as oil and gas reservoir characterization. The latter have been shown to introduce computational and time complexities, and are sometimes not very efficient. Accurate predictions of oil and gas reservoir properties are important for more efficient exploration and production of fossil energy resources. This paper proposes three non-linear feature selection based hybrid models in the prediction of porosity and permeability of two geographically and lithologically differentiated heterogeneous reservoirs. The hybrid models utilized the non-linear feature selection capabilities of Functional Networks (FN), Decision Trees (DT) and Fuzzy Ranking (FR) algorithms with the excellent functional approximation capability of Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results of the proposed models were then compared with a previously implemented FN-based Type-2 Fuzzy Logic hybrid model and the respective standalone components of the hybrid models. The comparative results provided more understanding of the architecture of these feature selection algorithms and further confirmed the importance of the feature selection process in oil and gas reservoir characterization. In the overall, the FN\u2013SVM hybrid model showed superior performance in terms of correlation coefficient, root mean square error and execution time.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jngse.2014.09.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "1967931845", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55964772", "125920030", "62822150"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109400546"}

Traditionally, wave models do not explicitly use the wave observations to estimate the present sea state: the only input to the models is a sequence of wind fields from a meteorological model. However, it is obvious that the model estimate of both the present and the future sea state can be improved if all available knowledge is combined, which can be done by assimilation of the observations into the model. In the present study a new approach for assimilating wave measurements is presented. A soft computing method namely Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used as a surrogate model to simulate wave heights. This model is trained with a data set of wind and wave measurements and is capable of predicting wave characteristics with relatively good quality. In the other hand, swells and short duration storms cannot be well modeled by the SVR model. Therefore assimilating the wave height measurements into the SVR model using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) was utilized to ensure better efficiency of the model. A pretty complicated Matlab and Shell scripts were modified in order to establish appropriate data assimilation (DA) system. Using two data sets from NDBC buoys in different geographical zones and performing statistical comparisons showed that the assimilation scheme can reduce the errors in predicting swells, storm peaks and also the storm duration and time. Also it was seen that the combination of SVR model and the EnKF method can be easily used for producing high quality wave forecasts.Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/OMAE2012-83873", "venue": "Volume 5: Ocean Engineering; CFD and VIV", "journal": "Volume 5: Ocean Engineering; CFD and VIV", "mag_id": "2010510995", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109404315"}

This palm is shade-tolerant, and its populations are restricted to the interior of forest patches. The geographic distribution of E. edulis has been reduced due to deforestation and overexploitation of its palm heart. To quantify the impacts of deforestation on the geographical distribution of this species, we compared the potential distribution, estimated by climatic variables, with the current distribution of forest patches. Potential distribution was quantified using five different algorithms (BIOCLIM, GLM, MaxEnt, Random Forest and SVM). Forest cover in the biome was estimated for the year 2017, using a recently-released map with 30 m resolution. A total of 111 records were kept to model climatic suitability of E. edulis , varying from 6 to 1500 m a.s.l and spanning almost the entire latitudinal gradient covered by the Atlantic Forest (from 7.72o S to 29.65o S). Based on climatic suitability alone, ca. 93 million hectares, or 66% of the area of the Atlantic Forest, would be suitable for the occurrence of E. edulis . However, 76% of this climatically suitable area was deforested. Therefore, currently, only ca. 15% of the biome retains forest patches that are climatically suitable for E. edulis . Our analyses show that E. edulis has suffered a dramatic loss of potential distribution area in the Atlantic Forest due to widespread deforestation.

We can classify the evolutionary development of web query processing from database query processing and SQL optimizations as Learning and Adaptive query processing, Web query through HTML and web search taxonomies, Web search query and search engines, Web query languages and its models, Semantic web and Ontologies, Web query optimizations on distributed web as well as on semantic web and Use of context-based techniques in web query processing. In this survey we are discussing on each of these topics and including how synonyms adding approach and Linguistic based approach are used in web query processing. There are three stages of query processing in general namely, Statistics generation, query optimization and query execution. Further, queries are optimized using performance and correctness measures namely Precision, Recall, Fall-out, F-measure, Average precision, R-Precision, Mean average precision, discounted cumulative gain and some more measures. Some of this surveyed paper discusses these details and others concentrate on their research work in different contexts. Our further work will be on the query using synonym based classifier or statistical classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

The model combines selection of features, clustering and classification techniques. Three techniques are used (Information Gain (IG), K-means and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) over QWS dataset with collected 5,000 web services.

To solve these issues, based on the multivariate fuzzy Taylor theorem, the Feature Subsets Ensemble (FSE) method has been proposed. However, data sampled from measurements have noise. The FSE uses the entire data set at least once, and for data with noise this property may reduce the generalization of Mach number prediction. In this paper, a Modified Feature Subsets Ensemble (MFSE) method is proposed to overcome the limitation of the FSE on noisy data by introducing the bootstrap to the feature subsets. The bootstrap has the potential to avoid noise. In addition, the generating procedure of the bootstrap replications is straightforward, simple, and quick, which keeps the complexity of the MFSE low. Experiments show that the MFSE outperforms the FSE and the Random Forest method, particularly on high-noise data sets.

Decision makers and business analysts emphasized that attaining new customers is costlier than retaining the existing ones. Business analysts and customer relationship management (CRM) analyzers need to know the reasons for churn customers, as well as, behavior patterns from the existing churn customers' data. This paper proposes a churn prediction model that uses classification, as well as, clustering techniques to identify the churn customers and provides the factors behind the churning of customers in the telecom sector. Feature selection is performed by using information gain and correlation attribute ranking filter. The proposed model first classifies churn customers data using classification algorithms, in which the Random Forest (RF) algorithm performed well with 88.63% correctly classified instances. Creating effective retention policies is an essential task of the CRM to prevent churners. After classification, the proposed model segments the churning customer's data by categorizing the churn customers in groups using cosine similarity to provide group-based retention offers. This paper also identified churn factors that are essential in determining the root causes of churn. By knowing the significant churn factors from customers' data, CRM can improve productivity, recommend relevant promotions to the group of likely churn customers based on similar behavior patterns, and excessively improve marketing campaigns of the company.

Due to the nature of these models as well as the practical challenges which include time-varying parameters, the transition from numerical/analytical modeling of machining to the analysis of real cutting signals remains challenging. Some studies have focused on studying the time series of cutting processes using machine learning algorithms with the goal of identifying and predicting undesirable vibrations during machining referred to as chatter. These tools typically decompose the signal using Wavelet Packet Transforms (WPT) or Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, these methods require a significant overhead in identifying the feature vectors before a classifier can be trained. In this study, we present an alternative approach based on featurizing the time series of the cutting process using its topological features. We utilize support vector machine classifier combined with feature vectors derived from persistence diagrams, a tool from persistent homology, to encode distinguishing characteristics based on embedding the time series as a point cloud using Takens embedding. We present the results for several choices of the topological feature vectors, and we compare our results to the WPT and EEMD methods using experimental time series from a turning cutting test.

Therefore, the detection of these communities is a topic of great interest and importance in many applications and different algorithms including label propagation have been developed for such purpose. Speaker-listener label propagation algorithm (SLPA) enjoys almost linear time complexity, so desirable in dealing with large networks. As an extension of SLPA, this study presented a novel weighted label propagation algorithm (WLPA), which was tested on four real world social networks with known community structures including the famous Zachary's karate club network. Wilcoxon tests on the communities found in the karate club network by WLPA demonstrated an improved statistical significance over SLPA. Withthehelp of Wilcoxon tests again, we were able to determine the best possible formation of two communities in this network relative to the ground truth partition, which could be used as a new benchmark for assessing community detection algorithms.

Our paper is oriented towards the study of a sample of algorithms to representing differents stages in the evolutive process of CF. Experiments were conducted on two datasets with different characteristics, using two protocols and three evaluation metrics for the different algorithms.

In this paper, the concept of (heterogeneous) image-rich information network and the problem of how to perform information retrieval and recommendation in such networks is introduced. A fast algorithm, heterogeneous minimum order k-SimRank (HMok- SimRank) is proposed to compute link-based similarity in weighted heterogeneous information networks. Then, we propose an algorithm Integrated Weighted Similarity Learning (IWSL) to account for both link-based and content based similarities by considering the network structure and mutually reinforcing link similarity and feature weight learning.

This project uses state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers in order to classify materials and analyze the results. Building on various widely used material databases collected, a selection of CNN architectures is evaluated to understand which is the best approach to extract features in order to achieve outstanding results for the task. The results gathered over four material datasets and nine CNNs outline that the best overall performance of a CNN using a linear SVM can achieve up to ~92.5% mean average precision, while applying a new relevant direction in computer vision, transfer learning.

In the contemporary era, the ceaseless use of social media has reached unprecedented levels, which has led to the belief that the expressed public sentiment could be correlated with the behavior of stock prices. The idea is to recognize patterns which confirm this correlation and use them to predict the future behavior of the various stock prices. With no doubt, though uninteresting individually, tweets can provide a satisfactory reflection of public sentiment when taken in aggregate. In this paper, we develop a system which collects past tweets, processes them further, and examines the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes Bernoulli classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for providing a positive or negative sentiment on the tweet corpus. Subsequently, we employ the same machine learning algorithms to analyze how tweets correlate with stock market price behavior. Finally, we examine our prediction's error by comparing our algorithm's outcome with next day's actual close price. Overall, the ultimate goal of this project is to forecast how the market will behave in the future via sentiment analysis on a set of tweets over the past few days, as well as to examine if the theory of contrarian investing is applicable.

First, we have developed a character based model for NER in financial documents and a word and character based model with attention for NER in biomedical documents. Further, we have analyzed how transfer learning addresses the problem of limited training data in a target domain. We demonstrate through experiments that NER models trained on labeled data from a source domain can be used as base models and then be fine-tuned with few labeled data for recognition of different named entity classes in a target domain. We also witness an interest in language models to improve NER as a way of coping with limited labeled data. The current most successful language model is BERT.

The rCRI predicted poor outcome with AUC = 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83\u20130.91), S e 100 = 0.66 (0.65\u20130.78), and AUC = 0.88 (0.78\u20130.93), S e 100 = 0.60 (0.51\u20130.75) at 12 and 24 h after CA, respectively. The rCRI predicted good outcome with S e 95 = 0.72 (0.61\u20130.85) and 0.40 (0.30\u20130.51) at 12 and 24 h after CA, respectively. Conclusions Results obtained in this study suggest that with machine learning algorithms and large set of qEEG features, it is possible to efficiently monitor patient outcome after CA. We also demonstrate the importance of selection of optimal performance metric to train a classifier model for outcome prediction.

The hybrid zone between these species has been studied extensively for more than 100 years and represents an excellent system for investigations of the evolution of reproductive isolation. Shifts in the proportions of phenotypes at hybrid localities since 1910 that were inferred using specimens from museum collections were confirmed using species distribution models. We predicted the historical, current, and future distributions of parental and hybrid sapsuckers using Random Forests models to quantify how climate change is affecting hybrid zone movement in the Pacific Northwest. We found observed distribution shifts of parental sapsuckers were likely the result of climate change over the past 100 years, with these shifts predicted to continue for both sapsuckers over the next 80 years. We found Red\u2010breasted Sapsuckers are predicted to continue to expand, while Red\u2010naped Sapsuckers are predicted to contract substantially under future climate scenarios. As a result of the predicted changes, the amount of overlap in the distribution of these sapsuckers may decrease. Using hybrid phenotypes, we found the climate niche occupied by the hybrid zone is predicted to disappear under future conditions. The disappearance of this climate niche where the two parental species come into contact and hybridize may lead to a substantial reduction in genetic introgression.

Furthermore, a parametric pricing approach is proposed to formulate pricing variables, which represent pricing factors and are calculated in terms of VMMs, as well as a regression relation between the pricing variables and price.

Thus, this paper proposes a Machine Learning approach for classifying patients of MCI into two groups one who converted to AD and the others who are not diagnosed with any signs of AD. The proposed algorithm is also used to distinguish MCI patients from controls (CN). This work uses the Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging data. This work proposes a 3-D variant of Local Binary Pattern (LBP), called LBP-20 for extracting features. The method has been compared with 3D-Discrete Wavelet Transform (3D-DWT). Subsequently, a combination of 3D-DWT and LBP-20 has been used for extracting features. The relevant features are selected using the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and finally the classification has been carried out using the Support Vector Machine. The combination of 3D-DWT with LBP-20 results in a maximum accuracy of 88.77. Similarly, the proposed combination of methods is also applied to distinguish MCI from CN. The proposed method results in the classification accuracy of 90.31 in this data. The proposed combination is able to extract relevant distribution of microstructures from each component, obtained with the use of DWT and thereby improving the classification accuracy. Moreover, the number of features used for classification is significantly less as compared to those obtained by 3D-DWT. The performance of the proposed method is measured in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity and is found superior in comparison to the existing methods.

Because it is difficult to engineer the behaviors of multiple cooperating agents by hand, multiagent learning has become a popular approach to their design. While there are a variety of traditional approaches to multiagent learning, many suffer from increased computational costs for large teams and the problem of reinvention (that is, the inability to recognize that certain skills are shared by some or all team member). This paper presents an alternative approach to multiagent learning called multiagent HyperNEAT that represents the team as a pattern of policies rather than as a set of individual agents. The main idea is that an agent\u2019s location within a canonical team layout (which can be physical, such as positions on a sports team, or conceptual, such as an agent\u2019s relative speed) tends to dictate its role within that team. This paper introduces the term policy geometry to describe this relationship between role and position on the team. Interestingly, such patterns effectively represent up to an infinite number of multiagent policies that can be sampled from the policy geometry as needed to allow training very large teams or, in some cases, scaling up the size of a team without additional learning. In this paper, multiagent HyperNEAT is compared to a traditional learning method, multiagent Sarsa(\u03bb), in a predator\u2013prey domain, where it demonstrates its ability to train large teams.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12065-012-0086-3", "venue": null, "journal": "Evolutionary Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2057010516", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5140043", "44767", "14015234", "10861040", "14906701", "85293509", "7010011", "11866341", "3247164", "60899328", "5943662", "10143063", "871178", "18548936", "15484983", "17566887", "3010227", "16135755", "3083498", "11507017", "3083498", "11493961", "12866385", "2942634", "8283691", "10030620", "2200122", "8679169", "60742600", "1033946", "32956645", "16811386", "15437475", "11625249", "1797464", "7671810", "37462265", "9022934", "8887578", "62576069", "15856893", "783933", "365905", "8814190", "8108362", "4413091", "14610547", "76557", "6336712", "3208492", "19706", "1579573", "33023", "27062291", "12863107", "13620780", "14262564", "1588520", "56506830", "941858", "6723259", "7273153", "31293164", "40739617", "2201486", "14910807", "224746", "61632911", "1166528", "498161", "2124332", "9361399", "9695324", "377561", "7335456", "5894831", "8129915", "42807109", "5240957", "11379650", "10253791", "9166388", "11332261", "3177337", "17216004", "2775855", "2360495", "1165354", "14098526", "5885928", "11572547", "7580652", "61519731"], "inbound_citations": ["1819124", "53641197", "208617632", "8939299", "44051752", "3607600", "3464331", "211243972", "14724092", "61864954", "31848510", "40841409", "15333444", "2012398", "754999"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18800251"}

The success of existing methods is generally built upon large scale data annotated with 3D human joints. However, it is a labor-intensive and error-prone process to annotate 3D human joints from input depth images or point clouds, due to the self-occlusion between body parts as well as the tedious annotation process on 3D point clouds. Meanwhile, it is easier to construct human pose datasets with 2D human joint annotations on depth images. To address this problem, we present a weakly supervised adversarial learning framework for 3D human pose estimation from point clouds. Compared to existing 3D human pose estimation methods from depth images or point clouds, we exploit both the weakly supervised data with only annotations of 2D human joints and fully supervised data with annotations of 3D human joints. In order to relieve the human pose ambiguity due to weak supervision, we adopt adversarial learning to ensure the recovered human pose is valid. Instead of using either 2D or 3D representations of depth images in previous methods, we exploit both point clouds and the input depth image. We adopt 2D CNN to extract 2D human joints from the input depth image, 2D human joints aid us in obtaining the initial 3D human joints and selecting effective sampling points that could reduce the computation cost of 3D human pose regression using point clouds network. The used point clouds network can narrow down the domain gap between the network input i.e. point clouds and 3D joints.

The proposed method incorporates the two Lagrange multipliers that mimic Support Vector Regression (SVR) into the basis of ELM to cope with infeasible constraints of the regression optimization problem. Thus, CO-ELM-R will complement the recursive iterations of SVR in the training phase due to the fact that ELM is much simpler in structure and faster in implementation.

English verbs are of two types: regular verbs, which form their past tense based on a productive rule, and irregular verbs, which form their past tenses through exceptions to that rule. Although many connectionist models exist for capturing language development, few consider individual differences. In this article, we explore the use of populations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that evolve according to behavioral genetics principles in order to create computational models capable of capturing the population variability exhibited by children in acquiring English past tense verbs. Literature in the field of behavioral genetics views variability in children's learning in terms of genetic and environmental influences. In our model, the effects of genetic influences are simulated through variations in parameters controlling computational properties of ANNs, and the effects of environmental influences are simulated via a filter applied to the training set. This filter alters the quality of information available to the artificial learning system and creates a unique subsample of the training set for each simulated individual. Our approach uses a population of twins to disentangle genetic and environmental influences on past tense performance and to capture the wide range of variability exhibited by children as they learn English past tenses. We use a novel technique to create the population of ANN twins based on the biological processes of meiosis and fertilization. This approach allows modeling of both individual differences and development (within the lifespan of an individual) in a single framework. Finally, our approach permits the application of selection on developmental performance on the quasi-regular task across generations. Setting individual differences within an evolutionary framework is an important and novel contribution of our work. We present an experimental evaluation of this model, focusing on individual differences in performance. The experiments led to several novel findings, including: divergence of population attributes during selection to favor regular verbs, irregular verbs, or both; evidence of canalization, analogous to Waddington's developmental epigenetic landscape, once selection starts targeting a particular aspect of the task domain; and the limiting effect on the power of selection in the face of stochastic selection (roulette wheel), sexual reproduction, and a variable learning environment for each individual. Most notably, the heritability of traits showed an inverse relationship to optimization. Selected traits show lower heritability as the genetic variation of the population reduces. The simulations demonstrate the viability of linking concepts such as heritability of individual differences, cognitive development, and selection over generations within a single computational framework.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32271632", "doi": "10.1162/artl_a_00316", "venue": "Artificial Life", "journal": "Artificial Life", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2996602253", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3965270", "37088113", "142931653", "146923331", "9292273", "140510420", "22147627", "2016766", "144686658", "11809855", "17708035", "9756229", "15168415", "39721303", "60849547", "19003520", "472907", "976262", "62166684", "142577342", "3998953", "15134180", "557347", "144675973", "36452794", "5734393", "17126604", "23789004", "16848428", "56499839", "30332418", "15450656", "38121658", "198972698", "14795581", "2397164", "16010286", "122153", "9177428", "6273216", "17056225"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43500657"}

According to a recent report by the FAA\u2019s Aviation Weather Research Program, over 23% of these accidents are weather-related, typically taking place during the takeoff and landing phases. When pilots fly through severe convective weather, regardless of whether or not an accident occurs, they cause damage to the aircraft, increasing maintenance cost for airlines. These concerns, coupled with the growing demand for air transportation, put an enormous amount of pressure on the existing air traffic control system. Moreover, the degree to which weather impacts airspace capacity, defined as the number of aircraft that can simultaneously fly within the terminal area, is not well understood. Understanding how weather impacts terminal area air traffic flows will be important for quantifying the effect that uncertainty in weather forecasting has on flows, and developing an optimal strategy to mitigate this effect. In this thesis, we formulate semi-dynamic models and employ Multinomial Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forests to accurately predict the severity of convective weather penetration by flights in several U.S. airport terminal areas. Our models perform consistently well when re-trained on each individual airport rather than using common models across airports. Random Forests achieve the lowest prediction error with accuracies as high as 99%, false negative rates as low as 1%, and false positive rates as low as 3%. CART is the least sensitive to differences across airports, exhibiting very steady performance. We also identify weather-based features, particularly those describing the presence of fast-moving, severe convective weather within the projected trajectory of the flight, as the best predictors of future penetration.

Thus, smartphone users may face financial as well as sentimental consequences if such information fall in the wrong hands. To address this problem all smartphones provide some form of user authentication, that is the process of verifying the user's identity. Existing authentication mechanisms, such as using 4-digit passcodes or graphical patterns, suffer from multiple limitations - they are neither highly secure nor easy to input. As a results, recent studies found that most smartphone's users do not use any authentication mechanism at all. In this paper, we present a fully unobtrusive user authentication scheme based on micro-movements of the user's hand(s) after the user unlocks her smartphone. The proposed scheme collects data from multiple 3-dimensional smartphone sensors in the background for a specific period of time and profiles a user based on the collected hand(s) movement patterns. Subsequently, the system matches the query pattern with the pre-stored patterns to authenticate the smartphone owner. Our system achieved a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 96% at an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 4%, on a dataset of 31 qualified volunteers (53, in total), using Random Forest (RF) classifier.

Machine learning algorithms have been suggested as candidates for handling big data security problems. Among these algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved remarkable success on various classification problems. However, to establish an effective SVM, the user needs to define the proper SVM configuration in advance, which is a challenging task that requires expert knowledge and a large amount of manual effort for trial and error. In this paper, we formulate the SVM configuration process as a bi-objective optimization problem in which accuracy and model complexity are considered as two conflicting objectives. We propose a novel hyper-heuristic framework for bi-objective optimization that is independent of the problem domain. This is the first time that a hyper-heuristic has been developed for this problem. The proposed hyper-heuristic framework consists of a high-level strategy and low-level heuristics. The high-level strategy uses the search performance to control the selection of which low-level heuristic should be used to generate a new SVM configuration. The low-level heuristics each use different rules to effectively explore the SVM configuration search space. To address bi-objective optimization, the proposed framework adaptively integrates the strengths of decomposition- and Pareto-based approaches to approximate the Pareto set of SVM configurations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been evaluated on two cyber security problems: Microsoft malware big data classification and anomaly intrusion detection.

This paper presents a pattern recognition and analysis method (PRAM) for the characterization of surface defects in FTS machining of MLA. The PRAM makes use of the Gabor filters to extract the features from the MLA. These features are used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for defects detection and analysis. To verify the method, a series of experiments have been conducted and the results show that the PRAM produces good accuracy of defects detection using different features and different classifiers.

Before image classification, we tested the separability of the LCZs, using the Transformed Divergence Separability Index (TDSI) based on the digitized training datasets and Landsat 8 data. Derived LCZs were then linked with Landsat 8 derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) for the cool and hot seasons. TDSI values greater 1.9 were obtained indicating that LCZs were highly separable. Comparatively, the WUDAPT method produced more accurate LCZs results (Overall accuracy = 95.69%) than the SVM classifier (Overall accuracy = 89.86%) based on seasonal Landsat 8 data. However, SVM derived accuracies were within the acceptable range of at least 80% (overall accuracy) in literature. Further, LST was observed to be high in LCZs with high built-up density and low vegetation proportion, when compared to other zones. Due to high proportion of vegetation, sparsely built areas were at least 1 \u00b0C cooler. Although LCZs are usually linked at 2 m air temperature, they also strongly explain LST distribution.

However, determining the effects of changing climate on the occurrence of disease remains a challenge. Bimodal peaks of cholera in Bengal Delta are hypothesized to be linked to asymmetric flow of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. Spring cholera is related to intrusion of bacteria-laden coastal seawater during low flow seasons, while autumn cholera results from cross-contamination of water resources when high flows in the rivers cause massive inundation. Coarse resolution of General Circulation Model (GCM) output (usually at 100 \u2013 300 km)cannot be used to evaluate variability at the local scale(10\u201320 km),hence the goal of this study was to develop a framework that could be used to understand impacts of climate change on occurrence of cholera. Instead of a traditional approach of downscaling precipitation, streamflow of the two rivers was directly linked to GCM outputs, achieving reasonable accuracy (R2 = 0.89 for the Ganges and R2 = 0.91 for the Brahmaputra)using machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Regression-Particle Swarm Optimization). Copula methods were used to determine probabilistic risks of cholera under several discharge conditions. Key results, using model outputs from ECHAM5, GFDL, andHadCM3for A1B and A2 scenarios, suggest that the combined low flow of the two rivers may increase in the future, with high flows increasing for first half of this century, decreasing thereafter. Spring and autumn cholera, assuming societal conditions remain constant e.g., at the current rate, may decrease. However significant shifts were noted in the magnitude of river discharge suggesting that cholera dynamics of the delta may well demonstrate an uncertain predictable pattern of occurrence over the next century.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.11.018", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Water Resources", "mag_id": "2565275061", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207940660", "117149905"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125664261"}

The active nature of these movements entails precise control of the sensory apparatus, which is task-specific and maximizes sensory information from the environment. This collection brings together a group of articles from progressive, early career scientists who are researching active touch sensing from a variety of different perspectives including behavioral, physiological, neuronal, computational, and robotic. There are a host of different model systems that are used to investigate active touch sensing and this collection sees the three main systems represented; that of the human hand, mammalian whiskers, and insect antennae. In this collection we have grouped the studies together into sections by their system and each section contains a collection of articles from both Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience and Frontiers in Neurorobotics. We feel that this indicates the truly multidisciplinary nature of studying active touch. ::: ::: The first section of articles covers various aspects of human touch. As with all active touch systems, humans move their fingertips through a sequence of exploratory movements that yields the most information from the task. These movements depend on both the task in hand and prior experience. Ackerley et al. (2012), demonstrated using fMRI that different brain areas are functional in active touch tasks compared to passive touch ones. Articles within this section of the collection demonstrate that biomimetic robots can exploit the information generated by different movements to select the most \u201cuseful\u201d movements that maximize information to successfully discriminate between different textures (Fishel and Loeb, 2012; Pape et al., 2012) and are able to judge surface compliance (Su et al., 2012). Texture tasks can be achieved by processing sensor information from fingertips, but also the movements of the wrists and fingertips in relation to the surface, which can code for surface properties (Delhaye et al., 2012). Klocker et al. (2012) show that as well as movement, force and vibration data, touch can also be related to feelings of pleasantness, with fingertip moisture levels as a good correlate of unpleasantness. ::: ::: The whisker, or vibrissal, system of small mammals is an important model of active touch sensing. The majority of the work in this area is aimed at understanding the neural substrates that are involved in this complex sensorimotor system. In order to obtain reliable tactile information about their environment most of the whiskered mammals move their vibrissae rhythmically, a motion known as whisking. Unlike in human touch, the whiskers are ultimately made up of dead cells, with sensory information obtained at the base of the whisker, in the follicle. Boubenec et al. (2012) propose that the contact and detachment of a whisker with a surface is likely to give rise to the most significant neural responses. Changes in the bending moment of the whisker can then be used to calculate the position of contact with an object along the whisker, and used to predict the object curvature and translation (Schroeder and Hartmann, 2012). However, predicting the position of object contact from bending moments is complex, and changes with whisker velocity (Evans et al., 2013). As with humans, movements of the sensory apparatus, the whiskers, are dependent on prior experience. Small mammals have functional whiskers from birth. Grant et al. (2012) show that rats orient to whisker contacts from conspecifics from a young age to maintain aggregations, indicating the crucial role the whiskers play in development. Anjum and Brecht (2012) show that young shrews can use their whiskers to locate and hunt crickets in an adult manner, and can moderate their attack strategy to novel prey items. This demonstrates that hunting behavior is both innate, subject to modification from experience and reliant on active touch. ::: ::: In our final section we look for inspiration in the insect antennal system. Insects have a pair of antennae on their head that are involved in a range of sensory-guided behaviors. Just like with the mammalian whiskers, these antennae can be used to locate the position of an object contact along the antennae, discriminate between surfaces and their sensory information is also affected by velocity (Pape et al., 2012). However, as well as object discrimination and orienting to prey and conspecifics, tactile information can also be used to guide locomotion. Krause and Durr (2012) show that antennal touches guide the positions and speeds of joint movements as stick insects step over objects. ::: ::: We believe that this collection of papers on humans, small mammals, and insects represents the current state of research in active touch sensing. As biologists, neuroscientists, roboticists, and computational modelers continue to work together, we predict that this field will continue to expand and hope to see more active touch behaviors defined and characterized in the future; with an emphasis on their function in the behaving animals.

Action value input was measured in superior colliculus activity while monkeys played a saccade version of matching pennies. We found that model simulations based on these measures exhibit similar choice biases as found in behavioural data.

They have one parameter: the ground metric, which can be any metric between the features themselves. As is the case for all parameterized distances, transportation distances can only prove useful in practice when this parameter is carefully chosen. To date, the only option available to practitioners to set the ground metric parameter was to rely on a priori knowledge of the features, which limited considerably the scope of application of transportation distances. We propose to lift this limitation and consider instead algorithms that can learn the ground metric using only a training set of labeled histograms. We call this approach ground metric learning. We formulate the problem of learning the ground metric as the minimization of the difference of two polyhedral convex functions over a convex set of distance matrices.

This is done by first training a classifier by using a labeled training set containing labeled samples from the two populations, and then using that classifier to predict the labels of new samples. Such predictions have recently been shown to improve the diagnosis and treatment selection practices for several diseases. This procedure is complicated, however, by the high dimensionality of the data. While microarrays can measure the levels of thousands of genes per sample, case-control microarray studies usually involve no more than several dozen samples. Standard classifiers do not work well in these situations where the number of features (gene expression levels measured in these microarrays) far exceeds the number of samples. Selecting only the features that are most relevant for discriminating between the two categories can help construct better classifiers, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. This paper provides a comparison between dimension reduction technique, namely Partial Least Squares (PLS)method and a hybrid feature selection scheme, and evaluates the relative performance of four different supervised classification procedures such as Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP), Support Vector Machine using Polynomial kernel function(Polynomial- SVM) and Support Vector Machine using RBF kernel function (RBF-SVM) incorporating those methods. Experimental results show that the Partial Least-Squares(PLS) regression method is an appropriate feature selection method and a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to construct high performance classification models for microarray data.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5815/ijieeb.2012.02.07", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Information Engineering and Electronic Business", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2115335928", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["279065", "120638419", "6669059", "10039376", "35935736", "8051299", "20255975", "8051299", "8312711", "140109802", "31251383", "119648053", "16538498", "13866112", "16538498", "3142931", "40255977", "59790709", "11893285"], "inbound_citations": ["56027609", "13606362", "53330698", "14468234", "57190440", "54658938", "28227655", "28227655", "214848373", "18149724"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56410389"}

The rate of attacks against networked systems has increased dramatically, and the tactics used by the attackers are continuing to evolve. Intrusion detection is one of the solutions against these attacks. A common and effective approach for designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is Machine Learning. The performance of an IDS is significantly improved when the features are more discriminative and representative. This study uses two feature dimensionality reduction approaches: (i) Auto-Encoder (AE): an instance of deep learning, for dimensionality reduction, and (ii) Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting low-dimensional features from both techniques are then used to build various classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Network, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for designing an IDS. The experimental findings with low-dimensional features in binary and multi-class classification show better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR), F-Measure, False Alarm Rate (FAR), and Accuracy. This research effort is able to reduce the CICIDS2017 dataset\u2019s feature dimensions from 81 to 10, while maintaining a high accuracy of 99.6% in multi-class and binary classification.

The existing methods that utilize pre-event and post-event images not only require the immediate and guaranteed availability of the appropriate data set but are also encumbered by manual mapping of the images, necessitating the indication of corresponding control points in the two images. This paper highlights the use of only post-event imagery in the absence of reference data to achieve a more timely delivery to produce damage maps as the output. This eliminates the need for manual georeferencing of images. Our method incorporates simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) for segmenting the images into uniform superpixels and extraction of 62 features for each superpixel. We used various classifiers of which Random Forest classifier was found to give a comparatively high accuracy of 90.4% over others. To enumerate the accuracy of the method proposed, we used 1500 data regions of which 20% were used for testing, and 80% were used for training. The aerial images taken by GeoEye1 after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami are utilized in this study to detect building damage. In the case of availability of ground truth, we compare the histograms of the pre- and post-imagery to quantify similarity as the SSD (Sum of Squared Distances) value and thus, our approach produces an assessment as an output map displaying the extent of damage in the area covered by each superpixel.

However, existing SVM hardware implementations attempting to speed up SVM classification, have either targeted only simple applications, or SVM training.

Our hybrid method takes the mechanistic 4D eXtended CArdiac Torso (XCAT) heart model as the anatomical ground truth and synthesizes CMR images via a data-driven Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We employ the state-of-the-art SPatially Adaptive De-normalization (SPADE) technique for conditional image synthesis to preserve the semantic spatial information of ground truth anatomy. Using the parameterized motion model of the XCAT heart, we generate labels for 25 time frames of the heart for one cardiac cycle at 18 locations for the short axis view. Subsequently, realistic images are generated from these labels, with modality-specific features that are learned from real CMR image data. We demonstrate that style transfer from another cardiac image can be accomplished by using a style encoder network. Due to the flexibility of XCAT in creating new heart models, this approach can result in a realistic virtual population to address different challenges the medical image analysis research community is facing such as expensive data collection.

Data and feature sampling are two popular methods of increasing such diversity. This is exemplified by Random Forests (RFs), known as a very effective classifier. However real-world data remain challenging due to several issues, such as multi-class imbalance, data redundancy, and class noise. Ensemble margin theory is a proven effective way to improve the performance of classification models. It can be used to detect the most important instances and thus help ensemble classifiers to avoid the negative effects of the class noise and class imbalance. To obtain accurate classification results, this paper proposes the Ensemble-Margin Based Random Forests (EMRFs) method, which combines RFs and a new subsampling iterative technique making use of computed ensemble margin values. As for comparative analysis, the learning techniques considered are: SVM, AdaBoost, RFs and the Subsample based Random Forests (SubRFs). The SubRFs uses Out-Of-Bag (OOB) estimation to optimize the training size.

In the last decade, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Power Spectral Density Analysis (PSDA) have been utilized in combination with the commonly used methods for reliable SSVEP recognition. Although CCA and PSDA are considered as robust methods for SSVEP recognition, reliable SSVEP recognition is still under ongoing research investigation due to non-stationary and noisy electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics, subject variability, and the physiological changes in the human body. This paper investigates an SSVEP-based wearable BCI system comprised of a wireless EEG recording device coupled with an Android tablet-based user interface toward daily and portable applications. We propose the fusion of CCA and PSDA at the feature level by partitioning their score spaces into multiple partitions following three different cases, extracting their heterogeneous yet complementary discriminative infor\u00admation, and combining them to generate a high dimensional fusion space.

We first consider an important class of machine learning algorithms: large margin classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines. The notion of margin complexity quantifies the extent to which a given class of functions can be learned by large margin classifiers. We prove that up to a small multiplicative constant, margin complexity is equal to the inverse of discrepancy. This establishes a strong tie between seemingly very different notions from two distinct areas. ::: ::: In the same way that matrix rigidity is related to rank, we introduce the notion of rigidity of margin complexity. We prove that sign matrices with small margin complexity rigidity are very rare. This leads to the question of proving lower bounds on the rigidity of margin complexity. Quite surprisingly, this question turns out to be closely related to basic open problems in communication complexity, e.g., whether PSPACE can be separated from the polynomial hierarchy in communication complexity. ::: ::: Communication is a key ingredient in many types of learning.

Although there are a lot of models to predict bankruptcy in the financial literature, Ohlson O-score and Altman Z-score are models that are used quite often. The fact that these two models are both linear models and companies are only interested in their latest balance sheets can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Considering bankruptcy as a process, to interest in only the latest financial reports of the companies has some drawbacks. For this reason, in addition to the current, previously financial reports of companies should be interested to predict bankruptcy risk of the company correctly. In the literature, these two classical models interest in only the current financial reports of companies. Additionally, there are grey areas that are not decided about the bankruptcy of companies in these two classical models. In this study, it is tried to predict the bankruptcy risk of companies by using non-linear machine learning algorithms rather than classical linear models in the financial literature. In line with this main purpose, as feature selection methods Information Gain, Principle Component Analysis algorithms by combining Linear Discrimination Analysis algorithm and as machine learning methods Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest algorithms are used.

Considering these problems, we propose a new approach that combines PET (metabolic information) with CT (anatomical information). Our approach is semi-automatic, it consists of three steps. First, an anatomical multi-atlas segmentation is applied on CT to locate and remove the organs having physiologic hypermetabolism in PET. Then, CRFs (Conditional Random Fields) detect and segment a set of possible lymphoma volumes in PET. The conditional probabilities used in CRFs are usually estimated by a learning step. In this work, we propose to estimate them in an unsupervised way. The final step is to visualize the detected lymphoma volumes and select the real ones by simply clicking on them. The false detection is low thanks to the first step. Our method is tested on 11 patients. The rate of good detection of lymphoma is 100%.

To address this issue, we propose a deep metric learning-based feature embedding model, which can meet the tasks both for same- and cross-scene HSI classifications. In the first task, when only a few labeled samples are available, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep embedding features and make a similarity learning between pairs of samples. In this case, the proposed model can learn well to compare whether two samples belong to the same class. In another task, when an HSI image (target scene) that needs to be classified is not labeled at all, the embedding model can learn from another similar HSI image (source scene) with sufficient labeled samples and then transfer to the target model by using an unsupervised domain adaptation technique, which not only employs the adversarial approach to make the embedding features from the source and target samples indistinguishable but also encourages the target scene\u2019s embeddings to form similar clusters with the source scene one.

For more diverse tasks and open-ended environments, robotic behaviours are mainly hand-tuned: for most of the one million robots deployed today basically, the environment should be modeled and the robot's skills and strategies programmed by hand. This is a perfectly feasible approach as long as this hand-coding is inexpensive and reliable enough. This will be the case if the environment is well structured and stable and if the robot's tasks are restricted in scope and diversity, with only limited Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). However, if the robot has to face a diversity of tasks and/or a variety of environment, then the robot has to use more complex approaches based on machine learning and planning techniques in order to decide how to act in the environment. Recently, an increasing interest in the research community is how to enable robots to interact and communicate with humans, which is a major step towards integrating robots in our daily life. Within the large domain of HRI, this research area is called Social robotics. Communicating with humans is a complex process, involving several modalities such as speech, facial expressions, gaze, head movements, hand gestures, etc. Social robotics focuses on modeling how humans use these communication channels in order to smoothly interact with each other, and how to endow a robot with similar skills. Modeling such complex multimodal interactions has proven to be a challenge. Machine learning is invading this domain. Recent research performed on interactive data (i.e. challenging the problem of generating co-verbal gestures of one participant given the co-verbal gestures of the other and verbal activities of both participants) showed a great potential for machine learning in learning complex HRI behaviors. However, the behavioural models are task- and situation-specific: if anything changes in the learning problem (the input distribution or shape, the interaction scenario, etc), we need to learn everything again from scratch. This means that policies learnt in one environment might not work -- or work sub-optimally -- in other environments and conditions. A growing interest of research in machine learning is on how to transfer knowledge learned from one task (source task) to a new task (target task). The idea is to capture the similarities between the source and the target tasks, and exploit them in order to learn the target task faster. The shared knowledge can be implicit, like finding latent variables for the input distributions of both tasks. It can also be explicit, like representing robotic knowledge as skills. Our challenge is thus to develop methods to transfer the knowledge model the robot learns on one interactive situation with humans to new tasks/situations -~notably to new interactive tasks~-, in order to enable rapid learning and adaptation to these new tasks.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3029798.3034823", "venue": "HRI '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2591592925", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16372911", "2122274", "38493877", "3172261", "28305971", "59566327", "27490733", "39290532", "76564"], "inbound_citations": ["59555512"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37067779"}

To improve the ability of rolling bearing fault diagnosis under multi-rotating situation, this paper proposes a novel rolling bearing fault characteristic product function correntropy (PFC), and employs Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to implement intelligent fault identification of rolling bearings under multi-stationary working situations. Firstly, rolling bearing vibration acceleration signal is decomposed by Local Mean Decomposition (LMD) to extract product functions (PF). Secondly, PFC needs to be obtained. PFC is the solution of the correntropy mathematical model of primary signal and PF component that is modified by Correlation Coefficient Entropy (CCE) as amplitude modulation operator. Finally, drawing support from LSSVM, the fault identification is achieved. Through the bearing identification experiments in different rotating situations, it is verified that PFC generates higher diagnosis accuracy than traditional fault features. Meanwhile, it is proved that PFC has more robustness than traditional fault features under cross-mixed roller bearing rolling status. Above all, the higher efficiency and availability of LMD-PFC-LSSVM are confirmed from the experiment consequence. It can be concluded that LMD-PFC-LSSVM is a reliable technology for rolling bearing fault diagnosis online under complicated rolling conditions and possesses the broad application prospect.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2016.10.037", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2530285255", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210957721", "212645003"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114003710"}

Such rules are, however, very important for users to describe trends in the data they have to analyze. In this framework, an association-rule based approach has been proposed by Bing Liu (CBA). We propose, in this paper, to extend this approach by using sequential patterns in the SPaC method (Sequential Patterns for Classification) for text categorization. Taking order into account allows us to represent the succession of words through a document without complex and time-consuming representations and treatments such as those performed in natural language and grammatical methods.

First the Body of the message is evaluated and after preprocessing the tokens are extracted. Then using a term selection method, the best discriminative terms are retained and other terms are removed. Then iterative patterns are extracted and a feature vector is built for each sample. Finally Random Forest is applied as classifier. If identified category is 0 then it is non-spam otherwise if identified category is 1 then it is spam.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2183138249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51856250", "51798524"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16807603"}

In this study, gas samples including methanol, acetonitrile, and benzene are used for system performance measurement. Each gas sample generates a specific acoustic signal data in the form of a frequency change recorded by the SAW sensor. Then, the acoustic signal data is analyzed to obtain the acoustic features, i.e. the peak amplitude, the negative slope, the positive slope, and the length.

Although elucidated recently in prokaryotes, this type of PTM is present across all three domains of life. In prokaryotes, two types of protein glycan linkages are more widespread namely, N- linked, where a glycan moiety is attached to the amide group of Asn, and O- linked, where a glycan moiety is attached to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr/Tyr. For their biologically ubiquitous nature, significance, and technology applications, the study of prokaryotic glycoproteins is a fast emerging area of research. Here we describe new Support Vector Machine (SVM) based algorithms (models) developed for predicting glycosylated-residues (glycosites) with high accuracy in prokaryotic protein sequences. The models are based on binary profile of patterns, composition profile of patterns, and position-specific scoring matrix profile of patterns as training features. The study employ an extensive dataset of 107 N-linked and 116 O-linked glycosites extracted from 59 experimentally characterized glycoproteins of prokaryotes. This dataset includes validated N-glycosites from phyla Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota (domain Archaea), Proteobacteria (domain Bacteria) and validated O-glycosites from phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (domain Bacteria). In view of the current understanding that glycosylation occurs on folded proteins in bacteria, hybrid models have been developed using information on predicted secondary structures and accessible surface area in various combinations with training features. Using these models, N-glycosites and O-glycosites could be predicted with an accuracy of 82.71% (MCC 0.65) and 73.71% (MCC 0.48), respectively. An evaluation of the best performing models with 28 independent prokaryotic glycoproteins confirms the suitability of these models in predicting N- and O-glycosites in potential glycoproteins from aforementioned organisms, with reasonably high confidence.

This two class classification method suffers from two main drawbacks. Firstly, the learning result may be unreliable when the number of training samples is not large enough. Secondly, the binary classifier tends to drift because of the complex background tracking conditions. In this paper, we propose a new model called Time Varying Metric Learning (TVML) for visual tracking. We adopt the Wishart Process to model the time varying metrics for target features, and apply the Recursive Bayesian Estimation (RBE) framework to learn the metric from the data with \"side information contraint\". Metric learning with side information is able to omit the clustering of negative samples, which is more preferable in complex background tracking scenarios.

Toward this goal, we define nine classes of movements, and design a machine learning algorithm using Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost techniques to classify a movement into one of nine classes. For every movement, we have extracted 24 features and used them in our model. This movement detection/classification system was evaluated on data collected from 40 subjects who performed 35 predefined movements in each experiment.

The introduced scheme starts with a preprocessing phase to enhance the quality of the input breast ultrasound images and to reduce speckle without destroying the important features of input ultrasound images for diagnosis. This is followed by performing the seeded-threshold growing region algorithm in order to identify the region of interest and to detect the boundary of the breast pattern.

It is closely related to sequence-to-sequence models, which learn fixed-sized latent representations for sequences, and have been applied to a number of challenging supervised sequence tasks such as machine translation, as well as unsupervised representation learning for sequences. In contrast to sequences, sets are permutation invariant. The proposed set autoencoder considers this fact, both with respect to the input as well as the output of the model. On the input side, we adapt a recently-introduced recurrent neural architecture using a content-based attention mechanism. On the output side, we use a stable marriage algorithm to align predictions to labels in the learning phase. We train the model on synthetic data sets of point clouds and show that the learned representations change smoothly with translations in the inputs, preserve distances in the inputs, and that the set size is represented directly. We apply the model to supervised tasks on the point clouds using the fixed-size latent representation.

To be blunt, that seems to be the point. Boden did not intend Mind as machine to be a pleasant read for a weekend\u2019s leisure. She intended it for people whose work includes being active readers, and for them it does represent a useful work of synthesis. ::: ::: Boden begins by noting that some might mistake \u201cman as machine\u201d for an ancient idea. Yet, according to her, this analogy, as well as its parallel \u201cmind as machine\u201d, is of recent origin. It was only by the close of the nineteenth century that mechanistic theories of mind acquired respectability. These theories, however, were mere analogies; no one seriously contemplated consilience between the behaviours of machines and men. Still less did anyone outside science fiction circles propose that machines could be intelligent in the same way as humans. By the mid-1800s, Charles Babbage had invented an analytical engine, somewhat akin to a programme-controlled digital computer, but he never claimed it to have implications for psychology or biology, though perhaps his student Ada Lovelace hinted at the possibility. Thus, it was during the war years of the 1940s, at the height of collaborations between Anglo-American scientists, that computers began being developed, and with them, some investigators, such as Alan Turing, began to study questions about machine intelligence. These questions would have ramifications for the cognitive sciences, including the hypothesis that a scientific theory might explain, \u201cprocesses in both minds and mindlike artefacts\u201d (p. 168). ::: ::: In the 1950s, these claims led to the emergence of the multi-disciplinary field of the cognitive sciences, a discipline well provided for by philanthropic and institutional sources of support, stocked with new venues for publication, and bolstered by artificial intelligence research paradigms. It was, none the less, a field riddled with intellectual divides, which developed over the next half century. Behaviourism, then predominant, was on the wane. Seen as too universalist, it was criticized by Gestaltists, linguists, ethologists, proto-connectionists, anthropologists, and Noam Chomsky alike (the last comes bizarrely in Boden\u2019s narrative with a \u201chealth warning\u201d, p. 591). In this ferment, the \u201cmind as machine\u201d debate took different paths: cyberneticists, for example, assumed that the mind as a machine was identical with the body. Computational psychologists\u2014little more than a smattering of research endeavours\u2014treated the human mind as different from its body, and concerned themselves with questions about how the mind was different. The majority of psychologists, however, focused on what made the mind different. Always lurking in the background was the question of whether human thought was \u201cconstituted by, or identical with\u201d symbolic processes (p. 702). Those questions especially plagued papers and programmes on artificial intelligence\u2014even when their authors were uninterested in the answers. ::: ::: Artificial intelligence research bolstered this nascent field enormously during the last half of the century. AI research, however, was perhaps more tied to the geopolitical context of the Cold War period and the neo-Liberal period of the 1980s and 1990s than the cognitive sciences. While much AI work focused on developing programming languages and had modest goals (seek general intelligence but not human-like intelligence, appeared almost as an injunction), critics levelled numerous charges at AI-workers, despite the fact that few were seeking to understand the human mind as a machine. Seymour Papert, an early pioneer, for instance, used only simple programmes to understand thinking processes. Yet, as defence spending increased, AI\u2019s proponents and detractors became uncomfortable with the glib assertions being promulgated within policy and media exaggerations, especially the belief that enormous computer systems controlling weapon systems could be \u201cbug\u201d free in their script, and commonsensical in their behaviour. This political and social context was only a part of the story. Connectionists, a new but inchoate group of psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers of the mind, also tore into the AI project. They argued that phenomena were represented within emerging networks (usually neurological) and not symbolic systems, which many within old-fashioned AI paradigms had claimed. In hindsight, all of AI\u2019s failed promises and faulty philosophical assumptions have led some to pronounce it a failed research programme. On this point, Boden demurs. She observes that AI enormously advanced both itself and the cognitive sciences. In that sense, and contrary to its critics, AI continued as a fruitful area of research, but like its latest corollaries, computational neuroscience and artificial life, the field remains embryonic even today. ::: ::: Whether Boden\u2019s volumes really ought to culminate in a penultimate discussion of the philosophies of mind as machine or in a final summary in the last chapter of triumphal sounding claims for the cognitive sciences, I shall leave to others to decide. Having read those chapters alongside M R Bennett and P M S Hacker\u2019s excellent Philosophical foundations of the neurosciences (2003), I find myself having misgivings about the conceptual foundations of much of the cognitive sciences project as outlined by Boden. ::: ::: In any case, Boden\u2019s volumes, despite their evident value, will aggravate many. Those least charitable will see them as a rather devoted effort to restore attention to Warren S McCulloch\u2019s contributions to the cognitive sciences. Historians studying periods before 1945 will find fault both with her facts and pithy generalizations. Similarly, those still living cognitive scientists whose careers spanned 1945 and 2000 are bound not to recognize the caricatures of themselves, or people they knew, in her story. Instead they will likely encounter a narrative that for them fails to capture things \u201cas they were\u201d and summarizes scientific arguments without paying them full justice. Such criticisms, which have already begun circulating about this work, strike me as unwarranted, especially because Boden\u2019s practitioner viewpoint brings with it the hindrances such life experience implies. Anyone failing to note Boden\u2019s polemical tone is just not awake. Putting it simply, the work is too large to be free of an agenda. However, for that same reason, criticisms of this work from other practitioners appear no less problematic. In my view, these volumes and the responses of critics to them will be of greater significance as primary source material than they will be in defining the historiography of the cognitive sciences. On balance, these volumes are thought provoking and open a doorway towards improved understanding of the patterns of science in the second half of the twentieth century.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1017/s0025727300004580", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical History", "mag_id": "177605810", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:141250619"}

In order to meet these goals, the field of process control works on understanding and improving industrial processes. Process chemometrics can be seen as an important contributor to this field. The key approach in process chemometrics is the use of multivariate statistical process control (MSPC). This technique plays an important role, not only for fault detection, but also for the related steps of fault identification, fault diagnosis, fault estimation, and fault reconstruction. Additionally, to enable online and early fault detection it is often necessary to derive the process or product parameters in an indirect way using multivariate calibration (MVC) methods. This makes it possible to predict future parameters on basis of current and past parameter values (time series prediction) but also allows process or product parameters to be obtained from easily measurable parameters that only give indirect information. The drawbacks of the methods described above are that MSPC only uses linear multivariate analysis techniques and strictly assumes the data to be normally distributed. Furthermore, many MVC methods used are also linear or do not result in global or unique solutions. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is twofold: (1) possibly improving the framework of MSPC for fault detection by using techniques that allow both nonlinear and linear multivariate data analysis but also loosen the strict assumption of using normal distributed data and (2) investigating the theoretical and practical benefits of using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Least Squares SVMs (LS-SVMs) for nonlinear MVC in process chemometrics.

The solvent accessibility of protein residues is one of the driving forces of protein folding, while the contact number of protein residues limits the possibilities of protein conformations. The de novo prediction of these properties from protein sequence is important for the study of protein structure and function. Although these two properties are certainly related with each other, it is challenging to exploit this dependency for the prediction. Method. We present a method AcconPred for predicting solvent accessibility and contact number simultaneously, which is based on a shared weight multitask learning framework under the CNF (conditional neural fields) model. The multitask learning framework on a collection of related tasks provides more accurate prediction than the framework trained only on a single task.

Having a few samples of microarrays in cancer researches is always one of the most concerns which lead to some problems in designing the classifiers. For this matter, preprocessing gene selection techniques should be utilized before classification to remove the noninformative genes from the microarray data. An appropriate gene selection method can significantly improve the performance of cancer classification. In this paper, we use selective independent component analysis (SICA) for decreasing the dimension of microarray data. Using this selective algorithm, we can solve the instability problem occurred in the case of employing conventional independent component analysis (ICA) methods. First, the reconstruction error and selective set are analyzed as independent components of each gene, which have a small part in making error in order to reconstruct new sample.

Specifically, we firstly combine the task-specific classification and domain adversarial learning to obtain the cross-domain features by mapping the data of both domains with the shared feature extractor. Secondly, we integrate the domain adversarial learning and the within-domain reconstruction to disentangle the semantic information from the domain information.

Our chief aim is to use leaning offsets of sub-clusters obtained according to imbalance ratios of sub-clusters to adjust classifier to achieve the best results. For this purpose, firstly, a geometry-based partitions method for imbalance dataset is introduced to partition the input space into several linearly separable partitions so as to construct a quasi-linear kernel and obtain an SVM classifier. Then a local offset method based on F-score value for linearly separable imbalance dataset is introduced to obtain leaning offset of each partition. At last the quasi-linear SVM with local offset adjustment is used to get the classifier for imbalance datasets.

This paper presents Conditional Flow and Texture GAN (CFT-GAN), a GAN-based video generation method from action-appearance captions. We propose a novel way of generating video by encoding a caption (e.g.,\"a man in blue jeans is playing golf\") in a two-stage generation pipeline. Our CFT-GAN uses such caption to generate an optical flow (action) and a texture (appearance) for each frame. As a result, the output video reflects the content specified in the caption in a plausible way. Moreover, to train our method, we constructed a new dataset for human video generation with captions.

Sudden deafness is generally defined as sensorineural hearing loss of 30 dB or greater over at least three contiguous audiometric frequencies and within a three-day period, which is usually unilateral and can be associated with tinnitus. The exact pathogenesis of such auditory diseases is still unknown, and alterations in the functional connectivity of the brain network are suspected to involve one possible pathogenesis. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is a common approach to capture brain neural activity. This paper conducts a twofold study in terms of brain network analysis for auditory diseases based on EEG data. Specifically, the brain network is constructed in view of the phase lag index (PLI) between signals. The unsupervised study is first conducted via the unsupervised network community detection algorithm. The goal is to reveal the underlying characteristics of functional connectivity concerning subjects with and without auditory diseases from the brain network perspective. The second study is the supervised learning. A new strategy termed FBA (Features from Brain Areas) is proposed to abstract each brain network as a feature vector and the supervised classification method, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized to perform the three-class classification concerning the regular control group, tinnitus patient group and sudden deafness patient group. Extensive experiments have been conducted on totally 146 subjects including 41 regular controls, 51 sudden deafness patients and 54 tinnitus patients.

RATIONALE: The prevalence of eczema among children of industrialized countries is increasing. There is some evidence that DNAmethylation plays a role in eczema, however, there is lack of epi-genome-wide study on their association. METHODS: Association between eczema and DNA methylation was studied in 18year-old subjects (n5366) from the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth Cohort. To efficiently screen cytosine-phospate-guanine (CpG) sites in epi-genome-wide, we applied the approach of random forest (RF) ensemble. A total of 307,357 CpGs were subjected to random forest data reduction, repeatedly dropping 50% of variables with lowest variable importance measures until the misclassification rate showed a significant increase. Functional annotation and pathway analyses along with logistic regressions were performed to further evaluate the selected RF-CpG sites. RESULTS: The RF method yielded 75 CpGs, 72 of which are linked to eczema corroborated by logistic regression. Eczema-associated CpGs, e.g., in genes PARD3 and GUCY1A3, were significantly enriched within the pathways \u2018Tight junction\u2019 and \u2018Gap junction\u2019 (P values 0.0008 and 0.002 respectively, after correcting for multiple testing with false discovery rate of 0.05). It has been shown that genes in these pathways are correlated to allergic and immune related diseases. CONCLUSIONS: TheRFEnsemblemethodwas successfully utilized for epigenome-wide scanning to identify epigenetic loci associated with eczema, detecting both previously known and novel CpG sites. The significant enrichment of differentially methylated CpGs within tight and gap junction pathway genes implicates epigenetic regulation in epidermal barrier dysfunction in eczema.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jaci.2014.12.1456", "venue": null, "journal": "The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology", "mag_id": "2013384545", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202746672", "73471848"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:71216855"}

In this paper, user interest prediction based on the Markov chain modeling on clustered users is proposed with the following procedure: collect dataset from 4613 users and more than 16 million messages from Sina Weibo; obtain each user's interest eigenvalue sequence and establish single-Markov chain model; and implement user clustering algorithm for the multi-Markov chain construction in order to divide users into a set of predefined interest categories. The proposed solution is capable of predicting both long-term and short-term user interests based on a suitable selection of the initial state distribution, \u03bb. The proposed solution also proves that short-term interests are consistent with long-term interests if the influences of social or user-related events that cause interruptions e.g., earthquake and birthday are not considered. Furthermore, experiments show that the proposed solution is feasible and efficient and can achieve a higher accuracy of prediction than that of the other approaches such as Support Vector Machine SVM and K-means.

The technique is based on the Mode Directed Inverse Entailment approach to ILP, where a bottom clause is generated for each example and the generated clauses are subsets of the literals of such bottom clause. We propose to store in a prefix-tree all clauses that can be generated from all bottom clauses together with some extra information. We show that this information is sufficient to estimate the number of examples that can be deduced froma clause and present an ILP algorithmthat exploits this representation.

Conventional statistical crash prediction models frequently suffer from severe data quality issues and require a significant amount of historical data. On the other hand, even though machine learning (ML) based algorithms have proven to be powerful in predicting future outcomes in different fields of applications, they likely fail to provide satisfactory results unless a tuning parameter approach is conducted. The main objective of this article is to develop real-time crash prediction models that will potentially be employed within traffic management systems.Methods: In this study, two highly optimized data-driven models for crash occurrence prediction have been designed based on the popular machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deep neural network Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed algorithms produce robust and stable performance, the optimal scheme for models' construction has been thoroughly examined and discussed. Additionally, the further boost of models' performance requires the systemic assessment of crash strongest precursors within the driver-vehicle-environment triptych. Therefore, three categories of features, including driver input responses, vehicle kinematics and weather conditions, were measured during the execution of various driving tasks performed on a desktop driving simulator. Moreover, since crash events typically occur in rare instances tending to be underrepresented in the dataset, an imbalance-aware strategy to overcome the issue was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE).Results: The results show that MLP exhibited the best performing prediction results, most particularly, in clear, overcast and snow conditions, in which MLP recall values were above 94%. Higher F1-score values were achieved in overcast and rain weather by MLP and snow conditions by SVM; whereas over 90% of G-mean levels were obtained under fog and rain conditions for MLP and snow condition for SVM.Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into crash events forecasting and may be used to promote enforcement efforts related to designing crash avoidance/warning systems that enhance the effectiveness of the system's application based on driver input and vehicle kinematics under various weather conditions.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32125890", "doi": "10.1080/15389588.2020.1723794", "venue": "Traffic injury prevention", "journal": "Traffic injury prevention", "mag_id": "3010406054", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212406005"}

From the experiments, the highest accuracy rates of BP prediction from / a / vowel have been obtained based on Systolic BP values with CNN-R. In the study, 89.43 % for MLR, 92.15 % for SVM-R and 93.65 % for CNN-R are obtained when ReliefF has been used. When the root mean square errors (RMSE) are considered, the lowest error value is obtained with CNN-R as RMSE = 0.2355. In conclusion, it can be observed that the proposed feature vector (FVx) shows a relationship between BP and the human voices, and in this direction, it can be used as an FVx in a system that will be developed in order to follow the tension of individuals.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101842", "venue": "Biomed.

The second component predicts the presence of coarse substrates from underwater video.

Spatial cross-validation methods also suggested evidence of overfitting in the coarse sediment model caused by the spatial dependence of transect samples. The quantitative modelling approach was able to predict rare and unsampled sediment classes but the flexibility of probabilistic predictions from the categorical approach allowed for tuning to maximize extrapolative performance. Results demonstrate that the apparent accuracies of these models failed to convey important differences between map predictions and that spatially explicit evaluation strategies may be necessary for evaluating extrapolative performance.

The difficulty in accelerating GBM lies in the fact that weak (inexact) learners are commonly used, and therefore the errors can accumulate in the momentum term. To overcome it, we design a \"corrected pseudo residual\" and fit best weak learner to this corrected pseudo residual, in order to perform the z-update. Thus, we are able to derive novel computational guarantees for AGBM. This is the first GBM type of algorithm with theoretically-justified accelerated convergence rate.

This paper presents a classification method combining with random forest classification and oversampling strategy to improve the training performance. A strategy with an oversampling ability is used to generate hot spots data to balance the given training set. Random forest classification is then invoked to generate a set of forest trees for this oversampled training set. The final prediction performance can be computed recursively after the oversampling and training process.

The presented approach is based on a robust registration approach (MAPER), highly performant label fusion (joint label fusion) and intensity-based label refinement using EM. We further adapt this framework to be applicable for the segmentation of brain images with gross changes in anatomy. We propose to account for consistent registration errors by relaxing anatomical priors obtained by multi-atlas propagation and a weighting scheme to locally combine anatomical atlas priors and intensity-refined posterior probabilities. The method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset used in a recent MICCAI segmentation challenge. In this context we show that MALP-EM is competitive for the segmentation of MR brain scans of healthy adults when compared to state-of-the-art automatic labelling techniques. To demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach, we employed MALP-EM to segment 125 MR brain images into 134 regions from subjects who had sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI). We employ a protocol to assess segmentation quality if no manual reference labels are available. Based on this protocol, three independent, blinded raters confirmed on 13 MR brain scans with pathology that MALP-EM is superior to established label fusion techniques. We visually confirm the robustness of our segmentation approach on the full cohort and investigate the potential of derived symmetry-based imaging biomarkers that correlate with and predict clinically relevant variables in TBI such as the Marshall Classification (MC) or Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). Specifically, we show that we are able to stratify TBI patients with favourable outcomes from non-favourable outcomes with 64.7% accuracy using acute-phase MR images and 66.8% accuracy using follow-up MR images. Furthermore, we are able to differentiate subjects with the presence of a mass lesion or midline shift from those with diffuse brain injury with 76.0% accuracy. The thalamus, putamen, pallidum and hippocampus are particularly affected. Their involvement predicts TBI disease progression.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25596765", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2014.12.003", "venue": "Medical image analysis", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1982132176", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15729548", "10998222", "8192210", "206869502", "29323944", "18468567", "3789099", "16624759", "30458036", "510007", "2517460", "11557689", "21649776", "19204259", "527509", "14094415", "206747551", "14246679", "53335638", "23714982", "9629554", "53185024", "207165453", "15532229", "7391760", "11439269", "4636780", "54230482", "20357745", "6515178", "12859901", "15567793", "16962487", "8008351", "10840552", "21001506", "18720990", "15737562", "205847133", "17091192", "5299173", "20387773", "29788271", "405538", "10207540", "12220680", "330039", "14322900", "2996599", "13168820", "2276967", "2303742", "43782707", "2751960", "6411928", "7859796", "9919502", "16295841", "2668311", "3025202", "37776969", "40256591", "16845999", "7047389", "18817208", "120128683", "16281709"], "inbound_citations": ["53295414", "80556763", "71143674", "12466263", "4491362", "22134944", "207060888", "20392384", "16598763", "215039303", "4652021", "67855801", "211477494", "67855483", "53711768", "208122816", "46941272", "215097423", "43263055", "207889036", "215459568", "214982811", "8181961", "8541538", "7196283", "50782262", "13738446", "214721138", "206695500", "215249034", "6338629", "153315115", "162183844", "52154967", "211139199", "214896772", "4921294", "3796386", "58552931", "4630694", "28598209", "88496104", "148067", "198939479", "201651469", "215249939", "51968089", "67858555", "78093958", "53772318", "44155476", "208283100", "198935538", "20342058", "7690089", "208208904", "214967840", "205534878", "11987241", "8308607"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6250857"}

Unfortunately, the conventional screening methods for AUD patients are subjective and manual. Hence, to perform automatic screening of AUD patients, objective methods are needed. The electroencephalographic (EEG) data have been utilized to study the differences of brain signals between alcoholics and healthy controls that could further developed as an automatic screening tool for alcoholics. Method In this work, resting-state EEG-derived features were utilized as input data to the proposed feature selection and classification method. The aim was to perform automatic classification of AUD patients and healthy controls. The validation of the proposed method involved real-EEG data acquired from 30 AUD patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls. The resting-state EEG-derived features such as synchronization likelihood (SL) were computed involving 19 scalp locations resulted into 513 features. Furthermore, the features were rank-ordered to select the most discriminant features involving a rank-based feature selection method according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Consequently, a reduced set of most discriminant features was identified and utilized further during classification of AUD patients and healthy controls. In this study, three different classification models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayesian (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR) were used. Results The study resulted into SVM classification accuracy = 98%, sensitivity = 99.9%, specificity = 95%, and f-measure = 0.97; LR classification accuracy = 91.7%, sensitivity = 86.66%, specificity = 96.6%, and f-measure = 0.90; NB classification accuracy = 93.6%, sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 87.9%, and f-measure = 0.95.

Therefore, MARTA GANs obtain the state-of-the-art results which outperform the results got from UC-Merced Land-use dataset and Brazilian Coffee Scenes dataset.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1612.08879", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/LGRS.2017.2752750", "venue": "IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters ( Volume: 14, Issue: 11, Nov. 2017 )", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2762941833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18850741", "9062671", "15960930", "5808102", "6628106", "15539264", "14958228", "9560434", "11758569", "18646605", "46638242", "17804904", "993769"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18876219"}

In this method, the number of hidden layer neurons of the Block L, the data set size N, and the hidden layer activation function are selected by the Algorithm Genetic optimization algorithm. Through simulation test, the fault diagnosis of transformer is 99.56%, and the test time is 0.0024 s. Compared with the optimization, the diagnostic accuracy and the test time of the transformer fault are improved obviously. Introduction In the long run,the transformer will inevitably lead to failure, Using the historical data and current status data of transformer fault to analyze and identify the fault to eliminate potential failures and defects as soon as possible, has been the concern of researchers study. There were many traditional transformer fault diagnosis intelligent methods,for example, IEC recommended three ratio method, Rogers and Dornerburg method etc. But coding boundary is too absolute and coding need be artificially drawn in the traditional threshold detection means. There is some defects especially lack of encoding[1][2];At the same time, emerging intelligent methods such as BP neural network, SVM,Bayesian network and so on, are facing the main problems example high intensity human interference, learning speed slowly, poor learning extensibility and a large sample of demand etc[5].The existing DGA data cannot meet the demand of their training[3][6].When applied to the high response demanding online program, these emerging intelligent methods are often inefficient[4]. At present, the research of the online sequence extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is used in the diagnosis of transformer fault[7], and the data are effectively avoided,However, the artificial choice of the online sequence of extreme learning machine parameters, resulting in the limit of learning machine training accuracy is not high enough. Genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the fault diagnosis method of OS-ELM, and the parameters of the machine parameters are optimized by using genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of OS-ELM[8][9].The feasibility and superiority of the proposed method is verified by the comparison of the training accuracy and training time. Introduction of OS-ELM Online sequence extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is a single hidden layer forward neural network (SLFN) training algorithm which can be applied to some regression and classification tasks. The method adopts the way of partitioned matrix effectively to avoid the repeated training data and to a great extent improve the efficiency of learning.

The CLQA system consists of four modules: question analyzer, keyword translator, passage retriever and answer finder. We used machine learning in two modules, the question classifier (part of the question analyzer) and the answer finder. In the question classifier, we classify the EAT (Expected Answer Type) of a question by using SVM (Support Vector Machine) method. Features for the classification module are basically the output of our shallow question parsing module. To improve the classification score, we use statistical information extracted from our Indonesian corpus. In the answer finder module, using an approach different from the common approach in which answer is located by matching the named entity of the word corpus with the EAT of question, we locate the answer by text chunking the word corpus. The features for the SVM based text chunking process consist of question features, word corpus features and similarity scores between the word corpus and the question keyword. In this way, we eliminate the named entity tagging process for the target document. As for the keyword translator module, we use an Indonesian-English dictionary to translate Indonesian keywords into English. We also use some simple patterns to transform some borrowed English words. The keywords are then combined in boolean queries in order to retrieve relevant passages using IDF scores. We first conducted an experiment using 2,837 questions (about 10% are used as the test data) obtained from 18 Indonesian college students. We next conducted a similar experiment using the NTCIR (NII Test Collection for IR Systems) 2005 CLQA task by translating the English questions into Indonesian.

The key issue for high prediction accuracy is the selection of SVR parameters, which is essentially an optimization problem. As one of the most effective evolutionary optimization methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been successfully applied to tune SVR parameters and is shown to perform well. However, the inherent drawbacks of PSO, including slow convergence and local optima, have hindered its further application in practical reliability prediction problems. To overcome these drawbacks, many improvement strategies are being developed on the mechanisms of PSO, whereas there is little research exploring a priori information about historical data to improve the PSO performance in the SVR parameter selection task. In this paper, a novel method controlling the inertial weight of PSO is proposed to accelerate its convergence and guide the evolution out of local optima, by utilizing the analytical selection (AS) method based on a priori knowledge about SVR parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed ASPSO method is almost as accurate as the traditional PSO and outperforms it in convergence speed and ability in tuning SVR parameters. Therefore, the proposed ASPSO-SVR shows promising results for practical reliability prediction tasks.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TR.2016.2515581", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2343803939", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207511325", "42101925", "58741688", "111220810", "10426018", "7138354", "15480929", "110312215", "5543127", "1778325", "2443126", "117879538", "43787103", "122669076", "38492907", "6152774", "5628229", "2131662", "15480929", "7138354", "207165665", "58731659", "580307", "16708577", "119835760", "39007732", "63956269", "110312215"], "inbound_citations": ["38098636", "210921229", "56954865", "3777299", "125926579", "57427913", "20634614", "189856336", "53969349", "44198135", "3831249"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7593398"}

Our proposed framework, mixed bagging, is a form of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) in which the sampling process takes into account the classification hardness of the training instances. The classification hardness, or simply hardness, of an instance is defined as the probability that the instance will be misclassified by a classification model built from the remaining instances in the training set. We incorporate instance hardness into the bagging process by varying the sampling probability of each instance based on its estimated hardness. Bootstraps of differing hardness can be created in this way by over-representing, under-representing and equally representing harder instances. This results in a diverse committee of classifiers induced from the bootstraps, whose individual outputs can be aggregated to achieve a final class prediction. We propose two versions of mixed bagging \u2013 one where the bootstraps are grouped as easy, regular or hard, with all bootstraps in one group having the same hardness; and the other where the hardness of bootstraps change gradually from one iteration to the next. We have tested our system on 47 publicly available binary classification problems using C4.5 Decision Trees of varying depth as base learners. We find that the proposed mixed bagging methods perform better than traditional bagging and weighted bagging (wagging) regardless of the base learner. The proposed method also outperforms AdaBoost when the base learner consists of deeper decision trees. We examine the results of mixed bagging in terms of bias-variance decomposition and find that mixed bagging is better than AdaBoost at reducing variance and better than traditional bagging at reducing inductive bias.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2018.00137", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2907470663", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207738357", "11674608", "1088806", "1836349", "14215320", "14229903", "17043461", "10130261", "873046", "52850408", "14951986", "2739931", "123503916", "16087804", "89141", "16296761", "19064873", "120343213", "15799850", "13988757", "3770261", "2702042", "53662922"], "inbound_citations": ["215238926", "207863243", "202542296"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57365456"}

In this paper, a comparison is made of eight proposed Measure-Correlate-Predict (MCP) models to estimate the WPDs at a target site. Seven of these models use the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the eighth the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) technique, which serves as a basis to compare the performance of the other models. In addition, a wrapper technique with 10-fold cross-validation has been used to select the optimal set of input features for the SVR and MLR models. Some of the eight models were trained to directly estimate the mean hourly WPDs at a target site. Others, however, were firstly trained to estimate the parameters on which the WPD depends (i.e. wind speed and air density) and then, using these parameters, the target site mean hourly WPDs. The explanatory features considered are different combinations of the mean hourly wind speeds, wind directions and air densities recorded in 2014 at ten weather stations in the Canary Archipelago (Spain). The conclusions that can be drawn from the study undertaken include the argument that the most accurate method for the long-term estimation of WPDs requires the execution of a specially trained model which considers the variability of the wind speeds of the reference stations, as well as of the wind directions and air densities, and in addition the functional manner in which these variables participate in the proposed MCP models. It is also concluded that it is important to consider the annual variation of air density even in regions at sea level. It is further concluded that, of the eight MCP models under comparison, the one that predicts the WPDs based on two sub-models (which estimate the wind speeds and air densities in an unlinked manner) always provides the best MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MARE (Mean Absolute Relative Error) and R 2 (Coefficient of determination) metrics, with the differences being statistically significant (5% significance) for most of the cases assessed. Additionally, the regulatory capacity of the SVR technique was sufficient to manage most of the overfitting problems, and hence the contribution of the wrapper method was not relevant in our study.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enconman.2017.02.064", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy Conversion and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2595507848", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201700922"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:99937375"}

These rendering errors artificially inflate the WER of an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system and complicate its evaluation. Furthermore, these errors make it harder to accurately evaluate modeling errors originating from code-switched language and acoustic models. In this work, we propose the use of a new metric, transliteration-optimized Word Error Rate (toWER) that smoothes out many of these irregularities by mapping all text to one writing system and demonstrate a correlation with the amount of code-switching present in a language.

DL model requires many training data to combat with over-fitting, but adding high quality labels to training data manually is not always cheap and accessible, especially in real-time system, which may counter unprecedented data in dataset. Semi-supervised Learning is a way to exploit unlabeled data effectively to reduce over-fitting in DL. In this paper, we extend Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the semi-supervised learning will show it is a method can be used to create a more data-efficient classifier.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3970/cmc.2018.01755", "venue": null, "journal": "Cmc-computers Materials & Continua", "mag_id": "2908997014", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["96431961", "167211057", "155986463", "73703560", "59236738", "88482045", "54450989", "70236084", "88494612", "208280987", "211733475", "195884827", "77391361", "59600529", "51894991", "86485018", "199408062", "59601329", "52278087", "67858826", "67858390", "211243254", "171095406", "174820216", "202889151", "198474671", "52299634", "59606568", "212650084", "208840859", "214691919", "53214550", "108377317", "208629747", "211206630", "201065766", "207852324", "86610855", "209382680", "96431326", "54035931", "211056606", "209059110", "84187114", "201666011", "211216658", "196195327", "208355570", "208039848", "202230882", "86427796", "75136271", "204828932", "155108205", "212733774", "209523087", "211525104", "163164159", "70339982", "211836243", "208816263", "53633249", "146116496", "209444663", "56288822", "155108019", "125658849", "210972446", "214691415", "52961628", "59477493", "155108191", "67867015", "210698189", "53247975", "204512284", "117734771", "85458398"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:139426589"}

Unfortunately, Telco position recovery requires sufficient amount of MR samples across different areas and suffers from high data collection cost.

In this paper, by leveraging the recently developed transfer learning techniques, we design a novel Telco position recovery framework, called TLoc, to transfer good models in the carefully selected source domains (those fine-grained small subareas) to a target one which originally suffers from poor localization accuracy. Specifically, TLoc introduces three dedicated components: 1) a new coordinate space to divide an area of interest into smaller domains, 2) a similarity measurement to select best source domains, and 3) an adaptation of an existing transfer learning approach. To the best of our knowledge, TLoc is the first framework that demonstrates the efficacy of applying transfer learning in the Telco outdoor position recovery. To exemplify, on the 2G GSM and 4G LTE MR datasets in Shanghai, TLoc outperforms a nontransfer approach by 27.58% and 26.12% less median errors, and further leads to 47.77% and 49.22% less median errors than a recent fingerprinting approach NBL.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.04521", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/tmc.2020.2968899", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3002652589,2995128391", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29192939", "17738635", "11596016", "2112704", "89141", "20597562", "13840395", "61828744", "60017212", "29216952", "14790516", "6110572", "2702042", "110404346", "164835", "43665409", "738391", "3067880", "6766352", "740063", "18123405", "67874873", "2328574", "53307569", "14173436", "1253091", "14471340", "25650064", "362467", "6377515", "1119209", "2467509", "8365865", "207214926", "1950648"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209140665"}

A time series prediction task and a waveform recognition task are employed to examine the parallel tasks processing performance in two polarization-resolved modes of the VCSEL-based RC system. Through numerical simulations, the dependences of parallel tasks processing performance of the VCSEL-based RC system on the feedback strength, injection strength are analyzed carefully and compared for the two feedback cases.

It is found that, for both feedback cases, good performance of parallel tasks processing in two polarization modes of the VCSEL-based RC system could be obtained in broad parameter regions, and in these regions a better performance is achieved for the PPOF case.

The aim of our study is to use Kwak's model to evaluate the tradeoffs of both sensitivity and specificity of SRU 2005, ATA 2009 and ATA 2015 management algorithms. ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: 1,000,000 thyroid nodules were modeled in MATLAB. Ultrasound characteristics were modeled after published data. Malignancy risk was estimated per Kwak's model and assigned as a binary variable. All nodules were then assessed using the published management algorithms. With the malignancy variable as condition positivity and algorithms' recommendation for FNA as test positivity, diagnostic performance was calculated. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Modeled nodule characteristics mimic those of Kwak et al. 12.8% nodules were assigned as malignant (malignancy risk range of 2.0-98%). FNA was recommended for 41% of nodules by SRU 2005, 66% by ATA 2009, and 82% by ATA 2015. Sensitivity and specificity is significantly different (< 0.0001): 49% and 60% for SRU; 81% and 36% for ATA 2009; and 95% and 20% for ATA 2015. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: SRU 2005, ATA 2009 and ATA 2015 algorithms are used routinely in clinical practice to determine whether thyroid nodule biopsy is indicated. We demonstrate significant differences in these algorithms' diagnostic performance, which result in a compromise between sensitivity and specificity.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28554789", "doi": "10.1067/j.cpradiol.2017.04.005", "venue": "Current problems in diagnostic radiology", "journal": "Current problems in diagnostic radiology", "mag_id": "2605973813", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["71145963"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4598001"}

The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging.

If a newly discovered protein which is responsible for the cause of new disease ::: gets correctly classified to its superfamily, then the task of the drug analyst becomes much easier. The analyst can perform molecular docking to find the correct relative orientation of ligand for the protein. The ligand database ::: can be searched for all possible orientations and conformations of the protein belonging to that superfamily paired with the ligand. Thus, the search space ::: is reduced enormously as the protein-ligand pair is searched for a particular protein superfamily. Therefore, correct classification of proteins becomes a very ::: challenging task as it guides the analysts to discover appropriate drugs. In this thesis, Neural Networks (NN), Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA),and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied to perform the classification ::: task.Adaptive MultiObjective Genetic Algorithm (AMOGA), which is a variation of MOGA is implemented for the structure optimization of Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN). The modification to MOGA is done based on the ::: two key controlling parameters such as probability of crossover and probability of mutation. These values are adaptively varied based upon the performance of ::: the algorithm, i.e., based upon the percentage of the total population present in the best non-domination level. The problem of finding the number of hidden centers remains a critical issue for the design of RBFN. The most optimal RBF ::: network with good generalization ability can be derived from the pareto optimal set. Therefore, every solution of the pareto optimal set gives information regarding the specific samples to be chosen as hidden centers as well as the update weight matrix connecting the hidden and output layer. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used for dimension reduction and significant feature extraction from long feature vector of amino acid sequences.In two-stage approach for protein superfamily classification, feature extraction process is carried in the first stage and design of the classifier has been proposed in the second stage with an overall objective to maximize the performance ::: accuracy of the classifier. In the feature extraction phase, Genetic Algorithm(GA) based wrapper approach is used to select few eigen vectors from the PCA space which are encoded as binary strings in the chromosome. Using ::: PCA-NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting GA), the non-dominated solutions obtained from the pareto front solves the trade-off problem by compromising between the number of eigen vectors selected and the accuracy obtained by the ::: classifier.

In this paper, we propose a method to detect eyes from frontal face images. The proposed method consists of two major steps. The first is two dimensional Hough transformation for detecting circle of unknown radius. The circular Hough transform first generates two dimensional parameter space (x c , y c ) using the gradient of grayscale. The radius of circle r is determined for each local maximum in the (x c , y c ) space. The second step of the proposed method is evaluation of likelihood of eye using histogram of gradient and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The eye detection step of proposed method firstly detects possible eye center by the circular Hough transform. Then it extracts histogram of gradient from rectangular window centered at each eye center.

CVA, also know as stroke, is a serious global health problem, and can cause significant physical limitations to those affected. Computed tomography is the most appropriate procedure to diagnose and evaluate the dimensions and magnitude of a stroke. Thus, in this article we present an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the classification of stroke from CT images applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order to identifying a healthy brain, an ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke. Following the Transfer Learning concept CNN was combined with different consolidated Machine Learning methods such as Bayesian Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. Our approach contributes to the automation of the diagnostic process by a competent method that is able to obtain information imperceptible to the human eye, and thus it contributes to a more precise diagnosis. In addition, with the advent of IoT, a highly efficient and flexible new instrument emerges to address issues related to health care services and specifically in our approach can provide remote diagnoses and monitoring of patients. The approach was validated by analyzing the parameters Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall, Precision and processing time. The results showed that CNN obtained 100% Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall and Precision in combination with most of the classifiers tested. The shortest training and test times were 0.015 s and 0.001 s, respectively, both in combination with the Bayesian Classifier.

Consequently, we propose a framework that casts a variety of approaches -- random walk based, matrix factorization and deep learning based -- into a unified context-based optimization function. We systematically group the methods based on their similarities and differences. We study the differences among these methods in detail which we later use to explain their performance differences (on downstream tasks). We conduct a large-scale empirical study considering 9 popular and recent UNRL techniques and 11 real-world datasets with varying structural properties and two common tasks -- node classification and link prediction. We find that there is no single method that is a clear winner and that the choice of a suitable method is dictated by certain properties of the embedding methods, task and structural properties of the underlying graph.

This paper outlines an automatic computer vision system for the detection and differential spraying of Avena sterilis, a noxious weed growing in cereal crops. The proposed system involves two processes: image segmentation and decision making. Image segmentation combines basic suitable image processing techniques in order to extract cells from the image as the low level units. Each cell is described by two area-based attributes measuring the relations among the crops and the weeds. From these attributes, a hybrid decision making approach, under a Bayesian framework determines, if a cell must be or not sprayed.

We propose a method for improving classification performance for such classes by discovering similar classes and transferring knowledge among them. Our method learns to organize the classes into a tree hierarchy. This tree structure imposes a prior over the classifier's parameters. We show that the performance of deep neural networks can be improved by applying these priors to the weights in the last layer. Our method combines the strength of discriminatively trained deep neural networks, which typically require large amounts of training data, with tree-based priors, making deep neural networks work well on infrequent classes as well.

Being able to accurately forecast exchange rate movements provides considerable benefits to both firms and investors. This research aims to propose a decision support aid to these firms and investors, enabling them to better anticipate on possible future exchange rate movements, based on one of the most promising prediction models recently developed within computational intelligence, the Support Vector Machine. The economics of supply and demand largely determine the exchange rate fluctuations. Calculating the supply and demand curves to determine the exchange rate has shown to be unfeasible. Therefore, one needs to rely on various forecasting methods. The traditional linear forecasting methods suffer from their linear nature, since empirical evidence has demonstrated the existence of nonlinearities in exchange rates. In addition, the usefulness of the parametric, and nonparametric, nonlinear models, has shown to be restricted. For these reasons, the use of computational intelligence in predicting the Euro Dollar exchange rate (EUR/USD) is investigated, in which these previously mentioned limitations may be overcome. The methods used are the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The ANN, more specifically the Multilayer Perceptron, is composed of several layers containing nodes that are interconnected, allowing the neurons to signal each other as information is processed. The basic idea of the SVM is finding a maximum margin classifier that separates a training set between positive and negative classes, based on a discriminant function that maximizes the geometric margin. The model selection for the prediction models was chosen to be based on the bias-variance dilemma, which denotes the trade-off between the amount of variation within different estimators on different values of a specific data set (variation) and the difference between the estimator\u2019s expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated (bias). Experiments on the Mackey-Glass dataset and on the EUR/USD dataset have yielded some appropriate parameter ranges for the ANN and SVM. On theoretical grounds, it has been shown that SVMs have a few interesting properties which may support the notion that SVMs generally perform better than ANNs. However, on empirical grounds, based on experimentation results in this research, no solid conclusion could be drawn regarding which model performed the best on the EUR/USD data set. Nevertheless, in light of providing firms and investors the necessary knowledge to act accordingly on possible future exchange rate movements, the SVM prediction model may still be used as a decision-support aid for this particular purpose. While the predictions on their own as provided by the SVM are not necessarily accurate, they may provide some added value in combination with other models. In addition, users of the model may learn to interpret the predictions in such a way, that they still signal some sort of relevant information.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "600474740", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["69791162", "41212544", "14776700"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106904590"}

This big data analysis is useful and enables powerful insight but studies on small, local areas of the larger system needs to be explored further. By focusing on single components such as generators, we can provide concrete and detailed insights to individual operators. For instance, direct impact on the local area can be studied after an event \u2014 allowing for better understanding of its propagation effects throughout the entire system. This provides \u201czoomed-in\u201d situational awareness on a single component and its local area, aiding in event detection and protection efforts. In this paper, we use localized data to classify generator control actions based on voltage dip information measured at generator terminals and at neighboring buses. We perform root cause analysis using the measurement data. By using single-level one dimensional wavelet decomposition and Support Vector Machine methodologies, we have developed an algorithm, Generator Control Action Classification (GCAC) that examines the voltage disturbances and classifies the cause as a certain control action at a particular bus.

MSRAA supports QoS parameters, including Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Maximum Delay Budget. Using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, we predict network slices bandwidth requirements for efficiently allocating the resources. To reduce revenue loss to the network operators due to forecasting errors, the proposed Bandwidth Admission Control (BAC) algorithm, reallocates resources from lower priority slices (e.g., best-effort users) to higher priority slices (e.g., guaranteed service users).

Traditional landslide susceptibility mapping techniques, based on field inspection, aerial photograph interpretation, and contour map analysis are often subjective, tedious, difficult to implement, and may not have the spatial resolution and temporal frequency necessary to map small slides, which is the focus of this investigation.We present a methodology that is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that utilizes a lidar-derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to quantify and map the topographic signatures of landslides. The algorithm employs several geomorphological features to calibrate the model and delineate between landslide and stable terrain. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a road corridor in Zanesville, Ohio, was used for testing. The resulting landslide susceptibility map was validated to correctly identify 67 of the 80 mapped landslides in the independently compiled landslide inventory map of the area. These results suggest that the proposed landslide surface feature extraction method and airborne lidar data can be used as efficient tools for small landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14358/PERS.81.3.239", "venue": null, "journal": "Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2094528008", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203123364", "182429742", "117901378", "204920317"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128693034"}

However, TCGA data is faced with the problem of class imbalance and of high data dimensionality leading to an increase in the false negative rate. In this paper, uses Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm in the pre-processing phase as a method to maintain a balanced class distribution. SMOTE is combined with the Tomek Link (T-Link) under-sampling technique for data cleaning and removing noise. To reduce the feature space of the data only those genes for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer is considered. These are obtained through resources like Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC).

This paper presents a multi-stage approach toward the robust classification of travel-modes from GPS traces.

In the first stage of classification three main travel-mode classes are identified: pedestrian, bicycle, and motorized vehicles; this is achieved based on the identified segments using speed, acceleration and heading related parameters. Then, segments are linked up to form sub-traces of individual travel-mode. After the first stage is achieved, a breakdown classification of the motorized vehicles class is implemented based on sub-traces of individual travel-mode of cars, buses, trams and trains using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) method.

It must take into account the particular properties of the human language processor and the (linguistic and nonlinguistic) input, as well as the specific motivation which causes the learner to apply the former to the latter. Neglecting, or even not keeping constant, some of these factors leads to a very distorted picture of the nature of language acquisition. In particular, claims about the difference between first (L1) and second language (L2) acquisition that ignore major variation in one of these components go astray. In the second part, the articles of White, Clahsen, Gasser, and Tomlin are discussed. If it is true that Universal Grammar plays no role in L2 acquisition, then, contrary to the claims made by those working in both areas, it can't play any role in L2 research, and thus L2 acquisition should look elsewhere for an appropriate theory. Connectionism, as suggested by Gasser, might be a place to look. At present, however, it is too unconstrained and more a descriptive language than a theory.

The key task of G-ReID is to learn representations robust to these changes. To address this issue, we design a Transferred Single and Couple Representation Learning Network (TSCN). The merits are two aspects: 1) Due to the lack of training samples, existing methods exploit unsatisfactory hand-crafted features. To obtain the superiority of deep learning models, we treat a group as multiple persons and transfer the labeled ReID dataset to the G-ReID dataset style to learn the single representation. 2) Taking into account neighborhood relationship in a group, we also propose the couple representation, which maintains more discriminative features in some cases.

Cutting-plane based method is one of the state-of-the-art training algorithms for linear SVMs. Within this cutting-plane framework, the quadratic programming(QP) subproblem, which consists of boundary constraints and a single inequality constraint, need to be solved at each iteration. This step is one of the most time consuming tasks in the whole method. In the current software, the QP subproblems are usually solved by the interior point method. In order to improve the efficiency of the cutting-plane based training algorithm, we transform the inequality constraint to an equation by introducing the slack variable and propose using projection gradient algorithm to solve the transformed QP subproblem. Compared with the existing method, the new algorithm has the following advantages. Firstly, because the special structure information in the subproblem is used carefully, the efficiency of solving the subproblem can be improved significantly. Secondly, through projecting the variables to the bound constraints explicitly, the variables that are not related to support vectors can be identified directly. Therefore, the rounding techniques, which is a necessary step in the widely used interior point method based solvers, is not required anymore.

The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform state-of-the-art solutions for videobased face recognition.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5564344", "venue": "2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing", "journal": "2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1968335755", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["44850486", "296341", "3732690", "10726702", "7138354", "40097546", "12771184", "29146526", "207228399", "10309149", "7635678", "117848957"], "inbound_citations": ["2615243", "15117600", "18261421", "14959680"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15532746"}

With the early diagnosis of breast cancer survival will increase from 56% to more than 86%. Therefore, an accurate and reliable system is necessary for the early diagnosis of this cancer. The proposed model is the combination of rules and different machine learning techniques. Machine learning models can help physicians to reduce the number of false decisions. They try to exploit patterns and relationships among a large number of cases and predict the outcome of a disease using historical cases stored in datasets. ::: OBJECTIVE: ::: The objective of this study is to propose a rule-based classification method with machine learning techniques for the prediction of different types of Breast cancer survival. ::: METHODS: ::: We use a dataset with eight attributes that include the records of 900 patients in which 876 patients (97.3%) and 24 (2.7%) patients were females and males respectively. Naive Bayes (NB), Trees Random Forest (TRF), 1-Nearest Neighbor (1NN), AdaBoost (AD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), RBF Network (RBFN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning techniques with 10-cross fold technique were used with the proposed model for the prediction of breast cancer survival. The performance of machine learning techniques were evaluated with accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve. ::: RESULTS: ::: Out of 900 patients, 803 patients and 97 patients were alive and dead, respectively. In this study, Trees Random Forest (TRF) technique showed better results in comparison to other techniques (NB, 1NN, AD, SVM and RBFN, MLP). The accuracy, sensitivity and the area under ROC curve of TRF are 96%, 96%, 93%, respectively. However, 1NN machine learning technique provided poor performance (accuracy 91%, sensitivity 91% and area under ROC curve 78%). ::: CONCLUSIONS: ::: This study demonstrates that Trees Random Forest model (TRF) which is a rule-based classification model was the best model with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, this model is recommended as a useful tool for breast cancer survival prediction as well as medical decision making.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26409558", "doi": "10.3233/THC-151071", "venue": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "journal": "Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine", "mag_id": "1915129189", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53101582", "184488421", "53712848", "71148216", "208314305", "4024213", "211032520", "67873073", "53032142", "132259313", "6049797", "55364629", "215487861", "195066189", "215251278", "204764484", "10193999", "215419256", "215267209", "195186684", "215335705", "59340421", "85543313"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25393176"}

This model is at a higher level of cognitive function than much connectionist work. Its units are each at the level of an already trained backpropagation pattern recognizer. Although similar in certain respects to Hendler's work, the model described herein offers several additional features: first, it is a connectionist model; secondly it learns relationships via a modified Hebbian learning rule and so does not need to input a database; thirdly, spreading activation is an integral part of the model. The model introduced here also differs from backpropagation models in two important respects. First, it does not require correct training input; rather, it learns from ordinary experience. Secondly, it does not converge to a fixed point or equilibrium state; thus, more sophisticated mechanisms are required to control the network's activity.

Existing methods for single network learning cannot solve this problem due to the domain shift across networks. Some multi-network learning methods heavily rely on the existence of cross-network connections, thus are inapplicable for this problem. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel network transfer learning framework AdaGCN by leveraging the techniques of adversarial domain adaptation and graph convolution. It consists of two components: a semi-supervised learning component and an adversarial domain adaptation component. The former aims to learn class discriminative node representations with given label information of the source and target networks, while the latter contributes to mitigating the distribution divergence between the source and target domains to facilitate knowledge transfer. Extensive empirical evaluations on real-world datasets show that AdaGCN can successfully transfer class information with a low label rate on the source network and a substantial divergence between the source and target domains.

Second, since the stream data distribution usually changes in nature (concept drift), there is a constraint for Capacity Sustainability. That is, how to update the model while preserving previous knowledge for overcoming the catastrophic forgetting. To this end, in this paper, we develop an incremental adaptive deep model (IADM) for dealing with the above two capacity challenges in real-world incremental data scenarios. Specifically, IADM provides an extra attention model for the hidden layers, which aims to learn deep models with adaptive depth from streaming data and enables capacity scalability. Also, we address capacity sustainability by exploiting the attention based fisher information matrix, which can prevent the forgetting in consequence. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world data and show that IADM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a substantial margin. Moreover, we show that IADM has better capacity scalability and sustainability in incremental learning scenarios.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3292500.3330865", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2949071326", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207585383", "6618074", "4047127", "49362425", "6702706", "158439617", "7634271", "8153773", "14005036", "44122877", "207208264", "19060379", "206594692", "1872922", "3619626", "22910766", "2274179", "18268744", "14542261", "3693512", "119659969", "5160005", "17822803", "15085443", "18556305", "3719281", "7197134", "1286512", "18977944", "50773541", "7909405", "12620738", "5805711", "20522266"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196206431"}

Features were extracted using three different techniques in separate ways to compare the effectiveness; these techniques are Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). After that the sounds are categorized using four different classification techniques which include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB).

Two lesion-level models were built based on the InceptionV3 and VGG19 models, which were pretrained with the ImageNet dataset. The effects of different depths of transfer learning were examined. The network\u2019s performance was evaluated through five-fold cross validation. In the lesion-level models, the model based on Inception V3 obtained better results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.89) when the weights were frozen before layer-276. The other model based on VGG19 obtained better results (AUC = 0.87) when the weights were frozen before layer-13.

Earlier edas used multivariate normal distributions to model low-cost regions of the search space. The multivariate t distribution has heavier tails and so is more likely to maintain diversity, while still allowing convergence to occur. The current population of potential solutions has limited ability to represent all the best regions of the search space explored so far. The archive allows storage of a larger population of promising solutions, which are then used in model building. However, the eda model and archive may still become stuck at suboptimal solutions, so to combat this we introduce a decomposition mutation operation which retains most of the attributes of a current solution but attempts large changes in others. A comparison with generic eda, genetic algorithms and the Nelder\u2013Mead method shows that tam-eda is an effective optimization algorithm for a range of test problems. References Alfi, A.

During field campaigns, we collected hyperspectral data with a spectrometer and in situ measured chlorophyll a concentrations of 13 inland water bodies with different spectral characteristics. One objective of this study is to estimate chlorophyll a concentrations of these inland waters by applying three machine learning regression models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and an Artificial Neural Network. Additionally, we simulate four different hyperspectral resolutions of the spectrometer data to investigate the effects on the estimation performance. Furthermore, the application of first order derivatives of the spectra is evaluated in turn to the regression performance.

Each machine learning model achieves an R2-score between 80 % to 90 % for the regression on chlorophyll a concentrations.

Obviously the current practice involves a large amount of time and money, and then may even fail to tune up the engine optimally because a formal performance model of the engine has not been determined yet. With an emerging technique, Support Vector Machines (SVM), the approximate per- formance model of a petrol vehicle engine can be determined by training the sample engine performance data acquired from the dynamometer.

Traditional classification algorithms can be limited in their performance on highly imbalanced data sets. In this dissertation, we study two common problems when training data is imbalanced, and propose effective algorithms to solve them. Firstly, we investigate the problem in building a multi-class classification model from imbalanced class distribution. We develop an effective technique to improve the performance of the model by formulating the problem as a multi-class SVM with an objective to maximize G-mean value. A ramp loss function is used to simplify and solve the problem. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets confirm that our new method can effectively solve the multi-class classification problem when the datasets are highly imbalanced. Secondly, we explore the problem in learning a global classification model from distributed data sources with privacy constraints. In this problem, not only data sources have different class distributions but combining data into one central data is also prohibited. We propose a privacy-preserving framework for building a global SVM from distributed data sources. Our new framework avoid constructing a global kernel matrix by mapping nonlinear inputs to a linear feature space and then solve a distributed linear SVM from these virtual points. Our method can solve both imbalance and privacy problems while achieving the same level of accuracy as regular SVM. Finally, we extend our framework to handle high-dimensional data by utilizing Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning to select a sparse combination of features and kernels. This new model produces a smaller set of features, but yields much higher accuracy.

From the partition given by the maximal overlap of these clusterings (the cluster cores), we continue the search for a strong clustering. We demonstrate the performance of this scheme by using it to maximize the modularity of a graph clustering. We show, that the quality of the initial weak clusterings is of minor importance for the quality of the final result of the scheme if we iterate the process of restarting from maximal overlaps.

It is unquestionably important to analyze these data with unbiased and generalized methodology for obtaining the deeper insights into cancer biology. Machine learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests (RF), have been applied to biological data analysis including cancer research. In this area, deep learning is gaining attention due to its high performance and generalized characteristics for analyzing complex data. To explore the possibilities for applying deep learning algorithms to the cancer multi-omics data analysis, we compared the performance among SVM, RF, and deep learning. We build the models for predicting cancer types of TCGA pan-cancer data set, and confirmed the advantages for deep learning. When we applied the algorithm to multi-omics data such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and somatic mutations, the input nodes of the neural network represented each data type. Autoencoders, components of the deep learning models, involve the weighted relationships among the input nodes, therefore we can find the unknown dependencies of some nodes by analyzing the networks of the model.

Although shared filter matrices and pooling layers in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are capable of reducing the dimensionality of the problem and extracting high-level information simultaneously, grids and highly regular data format are required as input. In order to balance model performance and complexity, we introduce a novel neural network architecture exploiting local features from a manually subsampled point set.

Successively, we employ the k-nearest neighbours (knn) algorithm to gather local neighbourhood for each group of the subsampled points. Finally, a multiple layer perceptron (MLP) is applied on the subsampled points and edges that connect corresponding point and neighbours to extract local features.

Though the distributed ELM* based on MapReduce framework can handle very large scale training dataset in big data applications, how to cope with its rapidly updating is still a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, a novel Elastic Extreme Learning Machine based on MapReduce framework, named Elastic ELM (E2LM), is proposed to cover the shortage of ELM* whose learning ability is weak to the updated large-scale training dataset. Firstly, after analyzing the property of ELM* adequately, it can be found out that its most computation-expensive part, matrix multiplication, can be incrementally, decrementally and correctionally calculated. Next, the Elastic ELM based on MapReduce framework is developed, which first calculates the intermediate matrix multiplications of the updated training data subset, and then update the matrix multiplications by modifying the old matrix multiplications with the intermediate ones.

This new paradigm is variously named connectionism or parallel distributed processing. As the latter name suggests, the new discipline comes out of the computing sciences, full of terms such as connection weights and parallel processing elements and under the leadership of two specialists in the field, James McClelland and David Rumelhart. For language teachers, the questions arise: What is it and what relevance does it have for classroom teachers? A direct answer to the first question is perhaps difficult for, as Sampson (p. 882) points out, the consumers of the last paradigm shift for linguistics were language teachers and literary students turned linguists. They are not likely to understand the new paradigm since only the computer specialist is fully trained in its intricacies. However, some of the terms in connectionism are not so new. In fact, \"connectionism\" derives from the behaviorist era, as Lachter and Bever (p. 234) suggest: \"The learning models in McClelland & Rumelhart are a complex variant on traditional--or at least Hullean s-r connections formed in time.\" In addition, like the behaviorists, \"The connectionist focuses on overt behavior\" (19: p. 89). Most important, connectionism is a term which can be used of machines that \"learn.\" It provides for computer simulation through the scanning of input and the adjustment of \"weights\" in \"networks\" until the desired output is achieved. In the words of Fodor and Pylyshyn (p. 6), connectionist \"networks can be made to learn; this is achieved by modifying the weights on the connections as a function of certain kinds of feedback.\" This learnability is a startling discovery, which is probably the reason that Classical transformational theoreticians, if not language teachers, are considering it worthy of attention. Regarding the second question posed at the beginning of this article, Chomskyan linguists presently argue against the viability of connectionism as a description of human psychology or language. However, to understand their arguments, some mention of the early tenets of Chomsky which so immensely impacted on language teaching, in spite of Chomsky's own apparent lack of interest in this applied domain, is necessary. Furthermore, a brief update on what Chomsky sometimes now refers to as \"the second major conceptual shift\" (10 as cited in 12: p. 173), the development of the principles and parameters of Universal Grammar, is also in order.

This study presents a novel expert-based approach to assess the quality of ongoing Spoken Dialog System (SDS) interactions. We call this approach \"Interaction Quality\" (IQ). It is an objective measure which relies on statistical classification with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We compare objective expert IQ annotations of ongoing SDS interactions with subjective User Satisfaction (US) ratings and show that IQ and US correlate ( ? = . 66 ). Expert annotations obviously mirror the subjective user impression to a great extent while they are, above all, much easier to obtain. The IQ score that quantifies the quality of the interaction is generated using the median score of exchange annotations of several experts. US is tracked in a study with 38 users interacting with an SDS. A large, comprehensive set of domain-independent, automatic interaction parameters is introduced to quantify the interaction at arbitrary dialog exchanges. Furthermore, a manually annotated negative emotion feature is added to the parameter set in order to evaluate the contribution of emotions on the classification of IQ and US. For evaluation we use the CMU Let's Go bus information system. The model yields a correlation of ? = . 80 when classifying IQ scores annotated in field data from the CMU system. Furthermore, the model achieves ? = . 74 for predicting US on lab data, and ? = . 89 for IQ on lab data. The presented approach outperforms related studies in the field. Only a marginal contribution of the emotion feature to the performance can be observed, implying that US is not influenced by visible emotions. We analyze causalities and correlations between the interaction parameters and the target variables US/IQ and identify relevant predictors.

In particular, we investigate the potential of RCNs in achieving competitive performance on the well-known MNIST dataset by following the aforementioned parameter optimizing strategy.

In view of the step-like characteristic, the Particle Swarm Optimization and Support Vector Machine (PSO\u2013SVM) coupling model based on the response of the induced factors was proposed to predict the landslide displacement. The moving average method was adopted to divide the total displacement into trend term and periodic term. The trend displacement was controlled by the geological conditions and predicted by polynomial function, while the periodic displacement was under the combined control of the triggers and the evolution state of the landslide. Therefore, the PSO\u2013SVM model, based on the factors of the precipitation, the variation range of the reservoir and the displacements of the prior-periods, was proposed to predict the periodic displacement. The typical step-like landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir, which is known as the Bazimen landslide, was taken as a case study to verify the prediction results. The values of the root mean square error and the mean absolute percentage error were 13.28 and 25.95, respectively. The results showed that rainfall and reservoir water level were the dominant factors for the step-like landslide deformation. The evolution state of the landslide was also significant in reflecting the response relationship between the displacement and inducing factors. In conclusion, the proposed PSO\u2013SVM model can better represent the response relationship between the factors and the periodic displacement, which made the predicted values of the total displacement fit with the measured values greatly.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.02.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Engineering Geology", "mag_id": "2284304237", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212652626", "164623050", "133621514", "181730074", "132940533", "201780281", "135201726", "55590721", "211065657", "134939539", "195188405", "199059510", "135378850", "198490768", "134628619", "209503104", "212651953", "211074583", "199112592", "195332775", "133661028", "211196355", "146091944", "208212223", "211527665", "134085805", "56325023", "146389084", "115439542", "22337746", "199111775", "134353250", "133650258", "195749319", "208038929", "208812194", "13683071", "115598735", "133696742"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130732807"}

This thesis explores several automated methods for recognising homologous relationships between these domains using the structural data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The aim of this work was to aid the manual classification of domains into the database and provide putative functional assignments to structures solved by the structural genomics initiatives. A fast and novel algorithm, CATHEDRAL, was developed to make fold assignments to regions of polypeptide chains. By combining a fast secondary-structure method (GRATH) and a slower residue-based method (SSAP), the algorithm was able to accurately assign boundaries for distant relatives, undetectable by sequence methods. Sequence and structural conservation patterns were combined in a novel algorithm, FLORA, to develop structural templates specific to catalytic function. FLORA was able to predict the correct functional site in 80% of cases and combined with global structure comparison, it was able to assign domains to enzyme families within diverse superfamilies. Techniques in structure comparison were also applied to ab initio models of protein domains, in order to assign them to fold groups within the CATH database. A novel scoring method was developed to pre-select models that were more likely to have adopted the correct fold. A selected sample of models for each target structure was then compared against representatives from the CATH database using the MAMMOTH and SSAP algorithms. Data from these alignments were combined using a Support Vector Machine to assign the target to a fold group within CATH.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great promise in imitating high dimensional data distributions. State of the art GANs are capable of performing tasks such as image to image translation as well as auditory and image signal synthesis, producing novel plausible samples from the data distribution at hand.

This alignment process allows for efficient processing of digitally scanned geometric data via image processing tools. Using this methodology, we propose a novel face synthesis model for generation of realistic facial textures together with their corresponding geometry.

HAR relies on the machine learning models trained using sufficient activity data. However, when the labels from a certain body position (i.e. target domain) are missing, how to leverage the data from other positions (i.e. source domain) to help recognize the activities of this position? This problem can be divided into two steps. Firstly, when there are several source domains available, it is often difficult to select the most similar source domain to the target domain. Secondly, with the selected source domain, we need to perform accurate knowledge transfer between domains in order to recognize the activities on the target domain. Existing methods only learn the global distance between domains while ignoring the local property. In this paper, we propose a Stratified Transfer Learning (STL) framework to perform both source domain selection and activity transfer. STL is based on our proposed Stratified distance to capture the local property of domains. STL consists of two components: 1) Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS), which can select the most similar source domain to the target domain; and 2) Stratified Activity Transfer (STL-SAT), which is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of STL.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1806.09776", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.pmcj.2019.04.004", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2811277026,2949843150", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1241495", "26369352", "5269411", "4884866", "207399351", "24768529", "14682828", "13195869", "8020936", "4491462", "2670121", "15978939", "1284099", "59566327", "6742009", "17105302", "195674358", "33982236", "1236130", "10985974", "206583924", "207330385", "8180206", "13952185", "24136410", "571148", "7842520", "16722013", "49902207", "3074096", "207241157", "6953522", "8548594", "52308023", "15042288", "10254641", "6480652", "13798326", "562168", "14060413", "18235792", "5807252", "16493272", "10091257", "5049210", "4412459", "17532005", "9261451", "8961518", "61724311", "4452604", "16372911", "10337279", "9038218", "31738180", "49883347"], "inbound_citations": ["209393377", "202660978", "186202575", "202660604", "203164981", "198147615", "210838728", "215433981"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49428582"}

While SVM/LSSVM can only provide a point estimation of the prediction result, RVM gives a probabilistic prediction result, which is more sophisticated for the soft sensor application. Furthermore, RVM can successfully avoid several drawbacks of the traditional support vector machine type method, such as kernel function limitation, parameter tuning complexity, and etc. Due to the advantages of RVM, a practical application of this method is made for soft sensor modeling in this paper.

A new general framework is proposed, which consists of adding a new term to the evaluation function of a filter feature selection method so that the cost is taken into account. Although the proposed methodology could be applied to any feature selection filter, in this paper the approach is applied to two representative filter methods: Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) and Minimal-Redundancy-Maximal-Relevance (mRMR), as an example of use.

Much work has gone into identifying such \"shortcut\" features and hand-designing schemes to reduce their effect. Here, we propose a general framework for removing shortcut features automatically. Our key assumption is that those features which are the first to be exploited for solving the pretext task may also be the most vulnerable to an adversary trained to make the task harder. We show that this assumption holds across common pretext tasks and datasets by training a \"lens\" network to make small image changes that maximally reduce performance in the pretext task.

These modifications are aimed to provide zero steady-state error in case of constant reference signal and constant disturbances. The internal model of the plant implemented by the neural network (NN)trained off-line is also useddirectly to obtainan approximate inverse neural controller without need for a further training. The inverse neural controller (Q controller)as a part of the IMC structure is designed using the first order approximation of Taylor series expansion of the trained NN plant model. Having in mind that in spite of a very good approximation ability of the NN model, there might be very large errors in its first derivative compared to exact one, we have proposed some heuristics to overcome the problems in calculating control increments, especially for slow nonlinear processes. Thanks to performance improvement obtained by the Fast Clustered Radial Basis Function Network (FCRBFN) with respect to some other popular types of learning algorithms such as backpropagation (BP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), we proposed the FCRBFN architecture and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum term learning algorithm for the implementation of the internal models of slowly varying nonlinear processes. For not so strong nonlinearity contained in plant the model, the Q controller can be designed using a linear approximate inverse of the dominant plant dynamics and an adjustment of the Q controller gain at the current time instant based on the simplified calculation from several values of preceding inputs and outputs of the FCRBFN. In the cases of high nonlinearity and slow variable dynamics present in the plant model (for example, with characteristics of hysteres is type), in order to achieve good performance during transient changes and zero steady-state error in case of constant reference signal and constant disturbances, we proposed embedding integral action into the considered neuro adaptive IMC system structure.

Current zone establishment methods are ordinary based on solar radiation observation stations (SROS) which present a sparse and non-uniform distribution. As a result, the possibility of misclassifications of the stations occurs in cases there are no records of radiation and far away from SROS. Therefore, by using k-means cluster and Support Vector Machine-Genetic Algorithm, a two-step radiation zoning method was proposed in this paper according to: (a) H , sunshine duration, temperature and relative humidity from 98 SROS and (b) sunshine duration, temperature and relative humidity from 562 stations without radiation. The method is capable to combine the SROS and the stations without radiation in the process of classification. Thus, these misclassifications have been effectively reduced and the accuracy of each classification has been significantly improved. Based on the method, five radiation zones have been identified. Concurrently, four sunshine-based models were obtained for each SROS and the analysis of statistical indexes indicated that the cubic models presented the best performances in each zone. According to the best site-specific models and radiation zones, the general models of regional H estimation were developed by introducing the geographical parameters, including latitude and altitude.

Existing style transfer methods for natural images generally assume that the source and target images share similar high-frequency features. However, this assumption is no longer true in typeface transformation. Inspired by the recent advancement in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we propose a Hierarchical Adversarial Network (HAN) for typeface transformation. The proposed HAN consists of two sub-networks: a transfer network and a hierarchical adversarial discriminator. The transfer network maps characters from one typeface to another. A unique characteristic of typefaces is that the same radicals may have quite different appearances in different characters even under the same typeface. Hence, a stage-decoder is employed by the transfer network to leverage multiple feature layers, aiming to capture both the global and local features. The hierarchical adversarial discriminator implicitly measures data discrepancy between the generated domain and the target domain. To leverage the complementary discriminating capability of different feature layers, a hierarchical structure is proposed for the discriminator. We have experimentally demonstrated that HAN is an effective framework for typeface transfer and characters restoration.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.06448", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2770341865", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["712416", "5273326", "8758543", "206593710", "1033682", "5808102", "6200260", "980236", "211227", "10627900", "56507745", "56507745", "12803511", "2202933", "11758569", "3719281", "1687220", "14124313", "206592484", "25931462", "9286187", "11922819", "50698", "3708198", "26176073", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["69460064", "77389804", "207943487"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3760713"}

Over large-scale networks, the difficulty of addressing such inverse questions (or problems) is compounded by the fact that usually only a limited portion of nodes can be probed, giving rise to a second important question: Despite the presence of several unobserved nodes, are partial and local observations still sufficient to discover the graph linking the probed nodes? The article surveys recent advances on this inverse learning problem and related questions. Examples of applications are provided to illustrate how the interplay between graph learning and distributed optimization arises in practice, e.g., in cognitive engineered systems such as distributed detection, or in other real-world problems such as the mechanism of opinion formation over social networks and the mechanism of coordination in biological networks. A unifying framework for examining the reconstruction error will be described, which allows to devise and examine various estimation strategies enabling successful graph learning.

An original bone-wise color descriptor is generated and reduced with PCA to compute the person signature.

We applied a random forest machine learning classifier to detect CWD in centimetric aerial imagery acquired over a 270-hectare study area in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. We used a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach in the classification with spectral, spatial, and LiDAR (light detection and ranging)-derived height predictor variables. We found CWD to be detected with great accuracy (93.4 \u00b1 4.2% completeness and 94.5 \u00b1 3.2% correctness) when training samples were located within the application area, and with very good accuracy (84.2 \u00b1 5.2% completeness and 92.2 \u00b1 3.2% correctness) when training samples were located outside the application area. The addition of LiDAR-derived variables did not increase the accuracy of CWD detection overall (<2%), but aided significantly (p < 0.001) in the distinction between logs and snags.
