We propose a deep non-linear classifier whose layers are SVMs and which incorporates random projection as its core stacking element. Our method learns layers of linear SVMs recursively transforming the original data manifold through a random projection of the weak prediction computed from each layer. Our method scales as linear SVMs, does not rely on any kernel computations or nonconvex optimization, and exhibits better generalization ability than kernel-based SVMs. This is especially true when the number of training samples is smaller than the dimensionality of data, a common scenario in many real-world applications.

Here, majority voting technique has been applied over Neural Network (NN), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Input vector of NN, DT, SVM and KNN consists of various acoustic and prosodic features like Pitch, Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients etc. From speech signal many feature have been extracted and only promising features have been selected. To consider a feature as promising, Fast Correlation based feature selection (FCBF) and Fisher score algorithms have been used and only those features are selected which are highly ranked by both of them. The proposed approach has been tested on Berlin dataset of emotional speech [3] and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) dataset [4].

Therefore, the present study pioneers in applying Feng Shui theories for developing a high accuracy real estate price prediction system with back-propagation neural network(BPN), fuzzy neural network (FNN) and Hybrid Genetic-based SVR (HGA-SVR) to compare.Our results obtained from the comparison between two house price models with various artificial neural network models. By comparing the accuracy with various network architectures, the result demonstrates that HGA-SVR is the best network architecture and the Feng Shui model has a better performance in BPN, FNN and HGA-SVR. Our house price prediction system discovers some real estate price much higher than the reasonable prices. This result shows these unreasonable price needs adjusting to become more reasonable to conform the housing market.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.41", "venue": "2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "journal": "2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2168450733", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9737524", "12324268", "5398743", "16950792", "58731659", "123661614", "1753032", "145206158", "145221348", "108502243", "111104003", "145050322", "52107264", "145032600", "153695390", "154671520", "154338687", "154815555", "150669050", "153363323", "5494092", "23780485", "153203380"], "inbound_citations": ["19142388"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18551762"}

Development of automatic approach for accurate segmentation of psoriasis skin biopsy image is the initial prerequisite for developing such system. However, the complex cellular structure, presence of imaging artifacts, uneven staining variation make the task challenging. This paper presents a pioneering attempt for automatic segmentation of psoriasis skin biopsy images. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Several deep neural architectures are tried for segmenting psoriasis skin biopsy images. Deep models are used for classifying the super-pixels generated by Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) and the segmentation performance of these architectures is compared with the traditional hand-crafted feature based classifiers built on popularly used classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). A U-shaped Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) is also used in an end to end learning fashion where input is the original color image and the output is the segmentation class map for the skin layers. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: An annotated real psoriasis skin biopsy image data set of ninety (90) images is developed and used for this research. The segmentation performance is evaluated with two metrics namely, Jaccard's Coefficient (JC) and the Ratio of Correct Pixel Classification (RCPC) accuracy. The experimental results show that the CNN based approaches outperform the traditional hand-crafted feature based classification approaches. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The present research shows that practical system can be developed for machine assisted analysis of psoriasis disease.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29650319", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.01.027", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2794251468", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["213186573", "52054704", "212691074", "214810015", "215294793", "73724694", "204246840"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4802618"}

The original resulting method is able to simultaneously recognize and track an object using only a statistical model learnt from a generic database. ::: ::: Our main contribution is the definition of a likelihood function which is produced directly from the outputs of a classifier. This function is an estimation of calibrated probabilities P(class|data). Parameters of the function are estimated to minimize the negative log likelihood of the training data, which is a cross-entropy error function. ::: ::: Since a generic statistical model is used, the tracking does not need any image based model learnt inline. Moreover, the tracking is robust to appearance variation because the statistical learning is trained with many poses, illumination conditions and instances of the object. ::: ::: We have implemented the method for two recent popular classifiers: (1) Support Vector Machines and (2) Adaboost.

The common wisdom in statistical downscaling, for selection of downscaling algorithms, is to select the model with the best overall system performance measure for observed period (training and testing). However, this does not guarantee that such selection will work best for any rainfall states, viz., low rainfall, or extreme rainfall. In the present study, for Assam and Meghalaya meteorological subdivision, India, three downscaling methods, Linear Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for simulating rainfall with reanalysis data and similar training and testing performances are obtained for observed period. When the developed relationships are applied to GCM output for future (21st century), differences are observed in downscaled projections for extreme rainfalls. ANN shows decrease in extreme rainfall, SVM shows increase in extreme rainfall and LR shows first decrease and then increase in extreme rainfall. Such results motivate further investigation, which reveals that, although, the overall performances of training and testing for all the transfer functions are similar, there are significant differences, when the performance measures are computed separately for low, medium, and high rainfall states. To model such uncertainty resulting from multiple downscaling methods, different transfer functions (LR, ANN and SVM) are used for different rainfall states (viz., low, medium and high), where they perform best. The rainfall states are predicted from large scale climate variables using Classification and Regression Tree (CART). As muti-model averaging (with equal weights or performance based weights) is commonly used in climatic sciences, the resulting output are also compared with the average of multiple downscaling model output. Rainfall is projected for Assam and Meghalaya meteorological subdivision, using this logic, with multiple GCMs. GCM uncertainty, resulting from the use of multiple GCMs, is further modeled using reliability ensemble averaging.

But it is still a hard work to obtain accurate prediction results because of the complexity of the building energy behavior and the frequent undulations in the energy demand. In the building energy consumption prediction, the existing historical data are usually used to construct the traditional machine learning models and the deep learning models. However, compared with the data sets in the research domains of image recognition, speech processing and other fields, the data sets in the time series prediction of building energy consumption do not have a large quantity. Although the gray model can reduce the reliability on sufficient data, the model is difficult to develop, and it still needs detailed building information that may be lost in existing buildings. To overcome such issues, based on the parallel learning theory, we propose the parallel prediction scheme for the building energy consumption using Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN). The parallel prediction firstly makes use of a small number of the original data series to generate the parallel data via GAN, and then forms the mixed data set which includes the original data and the artificial data, and finally utilizes the mixed data to train the prediction models. To verify the proposed parallel prediction method, two experiments which adopts different kinds of data sets from two real-world buildings are conducted. In each experiment, the availability of the parallel data and the rationality of the parallel prediction model are evaluated, and detailed comparisons are made. Experimental results show that the parallel data have similar distributions to the original data, and the prediction models trained by the mixed data perform better than those trained only using the original data. Comparison results demonstrated that the proposed method performs best compared with the existing methods such as the information diffusion technology (IDT), the heuristic Mega-trend-diffusion (HMTD) method and the bootstrap method. The proposed parallel prediction scheme can also be extended to other time series forecasting problems, such as the electricity load forecasting, and the traffic flow prediction.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.01.034", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy and Buildings", "mag_id": "2913226484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210074025", "203078631", "211205996", "202095542", "209007760", "210878020", "196215916"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115373804"}

The first proposed supervised approach is a low-complexity method that requires very short training period and is fairly accurate even in the presence of labelling errors. The second approach relies on a database of appliance signatures that we designed using publicly available datasets.

Since it is hard to achieve robustness using a single model, we have combined several methods into an integrated system. The masked grey world algorithm is introduced to handle sudden illumination change. Colour co-occurrence modelling is then fused with the probabilistic edge-based background modelling. Colour co-occurrence modelling is good in filtering moving background and robust to gradual illumination change, while an edge-based modelling is used for solving a colour similarity problem.

The performance of the K-d tree is augmented by introducing a spatial weighting. The Random Forests yield a classification accuracy of 97% on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. Moreover, the processing and memory requirements are reduced by employing a feature space reduction. The classifiers attain an equally high classification rate using only a fraction of the feature dimension, selected using the Random Forest or Fisher's Criterion. This technique is also validated on two different multiclass benchmarks: ETH80 and Caltech 101.

Decision Tree Learning (DTL) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used for classification and model recognition. Both of these estimated models generated an averaged accuracy of more than 80.0%, for predicting grasping, pinching, left flexion, and wrist rotation. As the classification showed a distinct feature in the signal, a real-time control system based on the threshold value has been implemented in a prosthetic hand. The hand motion has also been recorded through Virtual Motion Glove (VMD) to establish dynamic relationship between the FMG data and the different hand gestures.

State aggregation models like the self-organizing maps have been used to make this possible by generalizing the input space and mapping the value functions into the states. This paper proposes a new algorithm called TD-GNG that uses the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) network to solve reinforcement learning problems by providing a way to map value functions into states. In experimental comparison against TD-AVQ and uniform discretization in three reinforcement problems, the TD-GNG showed improvements in three aspects, namely, 1) reduction of the dimensionality of the problem, 2) increase the generalization and 3) reduction of the convergence time.

In this paper, we propose a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based deep Q-network (DQN) framework for solving the dynamic resource allocation (DRA) problem in a real-time C-RAN, where the heavy computation to solve SOCP problems is cut down and significant power consumption can be saved. First, we apply the GBDT to the regression task to approximate the solutions of second order cone programming (SOCP) problem formulated from beamforming design which consumes heavy computing resources by traditional algorithms. Then, we design a deep Q-network (DQN), coming from a common deep reinforcement learning, to autonomously generate the robust policy that controls the status of remote radio heads (RRHs) and saves the power consumption in long term. The DQN deploys deep neural networks (DNN) to solve the problem of innumerable states in the real-time C-RAN system and generates the policy by observing the state and the reward engendered by GBDT. The generated policy is error-tolerant considering that the gradient boosting regression may not be strictly subject to the constraints of the original problem.

The generated fuzzy models are used for modeling nonlinear benchmark processes. In the proposed procedure, first one fuzzy rule is generated by subtractive clustering algorithm from available data of a given nonlinear process. Then this fuzzy rule is considered as a base model and AdaBoostR is employed in order to combine some of the weak learners (i.e. rules). Parameters of a rule are coded as the state vector in UKF and then UKF is used for fine tuning of these parameters. Moreover, as the second proposed method, Linear Kalman Filter (LKF) is utilized for adjusting only the output membership functions parameters (first order sugeno's parameters) of base models (i.e. rules). Three case studies are considered for illustrating the applicability of our proposed boosting methods. Results apparently show the obtained fuzzy models are superior to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in terms of both modeling accuracy and computational requirements.

Hence, Pattern recognition needs to be applied to ultrasonic signals as well. Machine Learning requires extensive data sets and those measurements are time-consuming, expensive and not flexible to hardware and environmental changes. On the other hand, there exists no method to simulate those signals deterministically. We present a novel approach for synthetic ultrasonic signal simulation using conditional GANs (cGANs).

Due to temporal dynamics in climate and vegetation activity, there are significant regional variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere in forests that are affecting the global C cycle. Current forest CO2 flux dynamics are controlled by instantaneous climate, soil, and vegetation conditions, which carry legacy effects from disturbances and extreme climate events. Our level of understanding from the legacies of these processes on net CO2 fluxes is still limited due to their complexities and their long-term effects. Here, we combined remote sensing, climate, and eddy-covariance flux data to study net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) at 185 forest sites globally. Instead of commonly used non-dynamic statistical methods, we employed a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that captures information from the vegetation and climate\u2019s temporal dynamics. The resulting data-driven model integrates interannual and seasonal variations of climate and vegetation by using Landsat and climate data at each site. The presented LSTM algorithm was able to effectively describe the overall seasonal variability (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.66) and across-site (NSE = 0.42) variations in NEE, while it had less success in predicting specific seasonal and interannual anomalies (NSE = 0.07). This analysis demonstrated that an LSTM approach with embedded climate and vegetation memory effects outperformed a non-dynamic statistical model (i.e. Random Forest) for estimating NEE. Additionally, it is shown that the vegetation mean seasonal cycle embeds most of the information content to realistically explain the spatial and seasonal variations in NEE. These findings show the relevance of capturing memory effects from both climate and vegetation in quantifying spatio-temporal variations in forest NEE.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6364965", "pubmed_id": "30726269", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0211510", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2913061600", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210697469", "195065526", "210776886", "214150555"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67858591"}

However, most problems associated with training Deep Neural Networks still revolve around lack of data that is rich enough for a given task. Data is required not only for training an initial model, but also for future learning tasks such as Model Compression and Incremental Learning. A diverse dataset may be used for training an initial model, but it may not be feasible to store it throughout the product life cycle due to data privacy issues or memory constraints. We propose to bridge the gap between the abundance of available data and lack of relevant data, for the future learning tasks of a given trained network.

To date, bouton detection has been largely manual or semi-automated, relying on a step that traces the axons before detection the boutons. If tracing the axon fails, the accuracy of bouton detection is compromised. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that does not require tracing the axon to detect axonal boutons in 3D two-photon images taken from the mouse cortex. To find the most appropriate techniques for this task, we compared several well-known algorithms for interest point detection and feature descriptor generation. The final algorithm proposed has the following main steps: (1) a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) based feature enhancement module to accentuate the appearance of boutons; (2) a Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) interest point detector to find candidate locations for feature extraction; (3) non-maximum suppression to eliminate candidates that were detected more than once in the same local region; (4) generation of feature descriptors based on Gabor filters; (5) a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, trained on features from labelled data, and was used to distinguish between bouton and non-bouton candidates. We found that our method achieved a Recall of 95%, Precision of 76%, and F1 score of 84% within a new dataset that we make available for accessing bouton detection.

The certain and possible membership degrees are lower and upper bounds of the actual membership degree. Using the certain and possible membership degrees, we express rough approximations in possibilistic information systems. The rough approximations consist of objects with membership degrees described by not a single, but an interval value. This leads to that lower and upper approximations are linked with each other. Next, we show that it is not sufficient to use the rough approximations in order to obtain objects certainly supporting a rule. To solve the difficulty, we formulate rough approximations under considering characteristic values of equivalence classes. Furthermore, we introduce a criterion for valuable rules.

Generally, detailed surveillance has been conducted as fieldwork, numerical analysis of satellite images or manual interpretation of aerial images, but methods of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine learning have recently produced promising examples of automated classifications of aerial imagery. The spatial application potential of such models is however still questionable since the transferability has rarely been evaluated. We investigated the potential of mosaic aerial orthophoto red, green and blue (RGB)/near infrared (NIR) imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data for mapping very fine-scale vegetation structure in semi-natural terrestrial coastal areas in Denmark. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm, with a wide range of object-derived image and DEM variables, was applied for classification of vegetation structure types using two hierarchical levels of complexity. Models were constructed and validated by cross-validation using three scenarios: (1) training and validation data without spatial separation, (2) training and validation data spatially separated within sites, and (3) training and validation data spatially separated between different sites. Without spatial separation of training and validation data, high classification accuracies of coastal structures of 92.1% and 91.8% were achieved on coarse and fine thematic levels, respectively. When models were applied to spatially separated observations within sites classification accuracies dropped to 85.8% accuracy at the coarse thematic level, and 81.9% at the fine thematic level. When the models were applied to observations from other sites than those trained upon the ability to discriminate vegetation structures was low, with 69.0% and 54.2% accuracy at the coarse and fine thematic levels, respectively. Evaluating classification models with different degrees of spatial correlation between training and validation data was shown to give highly different prediction accuracies, thereby highlighting model transferability and application potential. Aerial image and DEM-based RF models had low transferability to new areas due to lack of representation of aerial image, landscape and vegetation variation in training data. They do, however, show promise at local scale for supporting conservation and management with vegetation mappings of high spatial and thematic detail based on low-cost image data.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2015.05.008", "venue": "Int.

The substitution of conventional cash crops with the alternative underutilised crop can only be successful if the cost per nutrition is lower for the underutilised crop. One main result of this effort, which may be of interest to governments, is a reduction in the rate of migration of young people to towns and cities. However, the prediction of success before implementation may be a little complicated. This is because data may not be readily available and in enough volume to use simple machine learning techniques. Hence it is proposed that accurate prediction can be accomplished by training the SVM (Support Vector Machine) to recognise successful villages through only a few significant variables that improve local economic growth.

In practice, training documents are often scarce and limited to certain domains which makes it difficult to train a model that generalises well to varying domains. This paper analyses the influence of domain shifts on the performance of document analysis tasks. It further explores the improvements that can be achieved with visual domain adaptation using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The results show that the impact of the domain shift on the performance is not only depending on the difference between the domains but also on the analysis task itself. While some tasks such as document binarization are noticeably affected by the domain shift, other tasks like page classification are less sensitive.

Most of the existing similarity learning algorithms are online similarity learning method, since online learning is more scalable than offline learning. However, most existing online similarity learning algorithms learn a full matrix with d^2 parameters, where d is the dimension of the instances.

In weather forecasting, predicting effectiveness of treatments, outcomes in healthcare and in many other domains, networks are often large, while intervals between consecutive time moments are brief. Therefore, models are required to forecast in a more scalable and efficient way, without compromising accuracy. The Gaussian Conditional Random Field (GCRF) is a widely used graphical model for performing structured regression on networks. However, GCRF is not applicable to large networks and it cannot capture different network substructures (communities) since it considers the entire network while learning. In this study, we present a novel model, Adaptive Skip-Train Structured Ensemble (AST-SE), which is a sampling-based structured regression ensemble for prediction on top of temporal networks. AST-SE takes advantage of the scheme of ensemble methods to allow multiple GCRFs to learn from several subnetworks. The proposed model is able to automatically skip the entire training or some phases of the training process. The prediction accuracy and efficiency of AST-SE were assessed and compared against alternatives on synthetic temporal networks and the H3N2 Virus Influenza network. The obtained results provide evidence that (1) AST-SE is \\(\\sim \\)140 times faster than GCRF as it skips retraining quite frequently; (2) It still captures the original network structure more accurately than GCRF while operating solely on partial views of the network; (3) It outperforms both unweighted and weighted GCRF ensembles which also operate on subnetworks but require retraining at each timestep.

Recently, the construction industry maintains high growth rate that have not been seen for over a decade. New construction projects, both large and small, are appearing throughout the country, including luxury homes and rental apartment buildings. As the construction industry relies heavily on financial leverage, it is particularly vulnerable to both domestic and external economic shocks. In addition, construction firms often face cash-flow problems, which can lead to serious financial difficulties and cause ripple effect on related parties. This situation may act as a constraint on the competitiveness of the whole construction industry. The issue of companies\u2019 financial distress has always been concerned by government agencies, financial institutions, business enterprises, and investors. Since W.H. Beaver first proposed a model for predicting bankruptcy in 1966, a large number of scholars pursue this line of research by adopting a wide range of estimation techniques to develop a new predictive model or refine the previous predictive models for financial failure. The characteristics and the accounting principles of construction industry differ from those of other industries. Given the current economic climate, there is an urgent need for further research on the prediction of financial failure, particularly in the construction industry. Therefore, this study attempts to establish a financial failure forecasting model on public construction companies in Taiwan. By enhancing the accuracy of the forecasting model, it is anticipated that the established model can provide financial distress early warning of construction companies, thereby helping construction industry business owners and managers, financial institutions, insurance companies, investors, companies in related industries to accurately identify which construction industry firms are likely to be at risk of financial failure. Previous research has suggested that there are some problems with the use of the Support Vector Model (SVM) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model in forecasting financial failure with sample matching. Because neither SVM nor ANN is capable of distinguishing between default and non-default, this will lead to bias in sample selection. This study employs an Enforced Support Vector Machine-based Model (ESVM) to forecast financial failure in the construction industry, and uses firm-year data to solve the problem of unbalanced samples. The traditional logistic regression model can provides as a benchmark to evaluate the ESVM model\u2019s prediction ability. After selected by stepwise logistic regression method, the variables were imported into the models for comparison. Five predictive models are applied in this study as to identify the best model for predicting financial failure in the Taiwanese construction industry, including the market model (Merton), two accounting models (Logistic and ESVM), Hybrid Model 1 (an integrated model with the Merton market model and the Logistic accounting model), Hybrid Model2 (an integrated model with the Merton market model and the ESVM accounting model). The data of Taiwanese construction firms are collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) database. The empirical results of three types of models are shown as follows. 1.Market model: Merton model (AUC=0.7197) ; 2. Accounting models: Logistic model with 20 variables (AUC= 0.7425) , ESVM model with 20 variables (AUC=0.7974) ;Logistic model with 4 variables (AUC\uff1a0.8154), ESVM model with 4 variables (AUC=0.8258); 3. Hybrid model: Hybrid model 1 with 21 variables (AUC=0.7459), Hybrid model 2 with 21 variables (AUC=0.8189), Hybrid model 1 with 5 variables (AUC=0. 8220), Hybrid model 2 with 5 variables (AUC= 0.8252). The empirical result indicates the following implication. First, the information from Taiwanese stock market is hardly to reflect the real situation of the Taiwanese construction contractors, this implicates the Taiwanese stock market is still a low-efficiency market. Second, choosing variables can improve the models\u2019 performance. Third, Hybrid model can enhance the predicting ability by integrating the market-based model and accounting-based model. Fourth, the accounting information in Taiwan is more reliable and stable than the information from the stock market. Fifth, the ESVM model can reduce the disturbance of selecting error thus it has higher stability and better performance in predicting construction contractor default.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211690434"}

Recent state-of-the-art approaches use learning based methods, such as Random Forests (RFs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to regress for each pixel in the image its corresponding position in the scene's world coordinate frame, and solve the final pose via a RANSAC-based optimization scheme using the predicted correspondences. In this paper, instead of in a patch-based manner, we propose to perform the scene coordinate regression in a full-frame manner to make the computation efficient at test time and, more importantly, to add more global context to the regression process to improve the robustness. To do so, we adopt a fully convolutional encoder-decoder neural network architecture which accepts a whole image as input and produces scene coordinate predictions for all pixels in the image. However, using more global context is prone to overfitting. To alleviate this issue, we propose to use data augmentation to generate more data for training. In addition to the data augmentation in 2D image space, we also augment the data in 3D space.

A constellation of theory-thick, macroscopic or semi-microscopic models has been developed during the last decades for generating \u03b2\u2212-decay halflives. However, the predictive power of these models is rather limited for nuclides far from stability (and often inaccessible to experiment). The recent advances in statistical learning theory present, on the other hand, the opportunity to develop statistical models of quantum many-body systems exhibiting remarkable predictive power. Statistical modeling of nuclear data, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) [2, 3, 4] and more recently Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [5, 6], is providing a complementary theory-thin approach to the prediction of nuclear systematics. In this work, we examine the potential of such theory-thin approaches via a detailed comparison of halflife estimates of neutron-rich \u03b2\u2212 unstable nuclei produced by the global models developed using ANNs and SVMs. The former have been developed by following the methodology of reference [4] for each class of nuclei with given even-odd character in Z, N that decay 100% by the \u03b2\u2212 mode in their ground states. Corresponding models using the same data sets have been developed by means of SVMs in reference [6]. The halflife estimates generated by both types of machines are discussed and compared with the available experimental data [7], with previous results obtained with neural networks [8], and with estimates coming from traditional global nuclear models. Particular attention is paid to r-process nuclides. Our results demonstrate that in the framework of the \u03b2\u2212-decay problem considered here the statistical models based on machine learning can match or even surpass the predictive performance of the best conventional theory-thick global models based on nuclear phenomenology. Regarding extrapability, the models based on Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks are slightly better than those based on SVMs. Accordingly, work is in progress to develop global statistical models of other quantities of nuclear systematics using both techniques of machine learning.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.12681/hnps.2602", "venue": "HNPS Proceedings", "journal": "HNPS Proceedings", "mag_id": "3006356420", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214346557"}

Simultaneously, the changes in the antioxidant system in roots and leaves were monitored to be able to follow synergistic effects of both heavy metals. Moreover, a statistical analysis based on the Random Forests Analysis (RFA) was performed in order to determine the most important predictors affecting growth and antioxidative machinery activities of poplar under heavy metal stress. The study demonstrated that tested poplar could be a good candidate for phytoextraction processes of Cd in moderately contaminated soils, while in heavily contaminated soil it could be only considered as a phytostabilisator. For Pb remediation only phytostabilisation process could be considered. By using RFA we pointed out that it is important to conduct the experiments in an outdoor space and include environmental conditions in order to study more realistic changes of growth parameters and accumulation and distribution of heavy metals.

Thus prediction of solar power generation is highly essential in different time horizons for maintaining proper power adjustment techniques and management. In this work a smart and competent prediction model has been implemented on a real time photovoltaic power plant. The Extreme learning machine (ELM) which is a new prediction technique is applied in this work. The weights of ELM are selected randomly in general. The performance of the forecasting model also depends on proper weight selection. Thus a new optimization technique such as harmony search optimization is applied to select the optimized weights. The forecasting model is implemented on an historical data set of real time solar power plant whose geographical location is given in the last part of section-II. The ELM model is activated to mobilize the feed forward neural network, iteratively, to achieve better forecasting error in each step. ELM model and the Harmony Search optimized ELM model are simulated for error calculation and their results are compared in terms of different measuring indices and their forecasting errors are compared.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSSIT46314.2019.8987820", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3005785228", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["109206317", "154077105", "26494054", "114688850", "112495874", "110280431", "55693482", "108453813", "109658267", "116858", "5553789", "31905689", "2584944", "109097486", "116858", "49541780"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211119655"}

Each leaf node is treated equally and the class with the most number of votes wins. Certain leaf nodes in the topology have better classification accuracies and others often lead to a wrong decision. Also the performance of the forest for different classes differs due to uneven class proportions. In this work, a novel voting mechanism is introduced: each leaf node has an individual weight. The final decision is not determined by majority voting but rather by a linear combination of individual weights leading to a better and more robust decision.

Field data collection is often costly and time-consuming; remote sensing with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) provides aerial images with sub-decimetre resolution and offers a potential data source for vegetation mapping. In a manual mapping approach, UAS true-colour images with 5-cm-resolution pixels allowed for the identification of non-submerged aquatic vegetation at the species level. However, manual mapping is labour-intensive, and while automated classification methods are available, they have rarely been evaluated for aquatic vegetation, particularly at the scale of individual vegetation stands. We evaluated classification accuracy and time-efficiency for mapping non-submerged aquatic vegetation at three levels of detail at five test sites (100 m \u00d7 100 m) differing in vegetation complexity. We used object-based image analysis and tested two classification methods (threshold classification and Random Forest) using eCognition\u00ae. The automated classification results were compared to results from manual mapping. Using threshold classification, overall accuracy at the five test sites ranged from 93% to 99% for the water-versus-vegetation level and from 62% to 90% for the growth-form level. Using Random Forest classification, overall accuracy ranged from 56% to 94% for the growth-form level and from 52% to 75% for the dominant-taxon level. Overall classification accuracy decreased with increasing vegetation complexity. In test sites with more complex vegetation, automated classification was more time-efficient than manual mapping. This study demonstrated that automated classification of non-submerged aquatic vegetation from true-colour UAS images was feasible, indicating good potential for operative mapping of aquatic vegetation.

However, the problem of small pathology detection and segmentation still remains an unresolved challenge due to the small size of these pathologies, their low contrast and variable position, shape and texture. In many contexts, early detection of these pathologies is critical in diagnosis and assessing the outcome of treatment. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic Adaptive Multi-level Conditional Random Fields (AMCRF) with the incorporation of higher order cliques for detecting and segmenting such pathologies. In the first level of our graphical model, a voxel-based CRF is used to identify candidate lesions. In the second level, in order to further remove falsely detected regions, a new CRF is developed that incorporates higher order textural features, which are invariant to rotation and local intensity distortions. At this level, higher order textures are considered together with the voxel-wise cliques to refine boundaries and is therefore adaptive. The proposed algorithm is tested in the context of detecting enhancing Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in brain MRI, where the problem is further complicated as many of the enhancing voxels are associated with normal structures (i.e. blood vessels) or noise in the MRI. The algorithm is trained and tested on large multi-center clinical trials from Relapsing-Remitting MS patients. The effect of several different parameter learning and inference techniques is further investigated. When tested on 120 cases, the proposed method reaches a lesion detection rate of 90%, with very few false positive lesion counts on average, ranging from 0.17 for very small (3\u20135 voxels) to 0 for very large (50+ voxels) regions. The proposed model is further tested on a very large clinical trial containing 2770 scans where a high sensitivity of 91% with an average false positive count of 0.5 is achieved.

The key idea of DGB is that back-propagated gradients inferred using the chain rule can be viewed as pseudo-residual targets of a gradient boosting problem. Thus at each layer of a neural network the weight update is calculated by solving the corresponding boosting problem using a linear base learner. The resulting weight update formula can also be viewed as a normalization procedure of the data that arrives at each layer during the forward pass.

It is, for example, important for issues such as wildlife habitat modeling and close-to-nature forest management. We examined the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite data for the identification of 10 tree species in a temperate forest in Austria. We performed a Random Forest (RF) classification (object-based and pixel-based) using spectra of manually delineated sunlit regions of tree crowns. The overall accuracy for classifying 10 tree species was around 82% (8 bands, object-based). The class-specific producer\u2019s accuracies ranged between 33% (European hornbeam) and 94% (European beech) and the user\u2019s accuracies between 57% (European hornbeam) and 92% (Lawson\u2019s cypress). The object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based approach. We could show that the 4 new WorldView-2 bands (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared 2) have only limited impact on classification accuracy if only the 4 main tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and English oak) are to be separated. However, classification accuracy increased significantly using the full spectral resolution if further tree species were included. Beside the impact on overall classification accuracy, the importance of the spectral bands was evaluated with two measures provided by RF. An in-depth analysis of the RF output was carried out to evaluate the impact of reference data quality and the resulting reliability of final class assignments.

In this study, utilizing Land coverage maps and Forest type maps of national geographic information instead of collecting field data was tested for conducting supervised classification on SPOT-5 and KOMPSAT-2 imagery focusing on forested areas. Supervised classification were conducted in two ways: analysing a whole area around the study site and/or only forested areas around the study site, using Support Vector Machine. The overall accuracy for the classification on the whole area ranged from 54.9% to 68.9% with kappa coefficients of over 0.4, which meant the supervised classification was in general considered moderate because of sub-classifying forested areas into three categories (i.e. hardwood, conifer, mixed forests). Compared to this, the overall accuracy for forested areas were better for sub-classification of forested areas probably due to less distraction in the classification. To further improve the overall accuracy, it is needed to gain individual imagery rather than mosaic imagery to use more spetral bands and select more suitable conditions such as seasonal timing. It is also necessary to obtain precise and accurate training data for sub-classifying forested areas.

These variations result in a gap between the distribution of each mini-batch and the distribution of the whole dataset when using mini-batch training. In this paper, we study model fine-tuning from the perspective of the aggregation and utilization of the global information of the dataset when using mini-batch training. Specifically, we introduce a novel network structure called Batch-related Convolutional Cell (BConv-Cell), which progressively collects the global information of the dataset into a latent state and uses this latent state to rectify the extracted feature. Based on BConv-Cells, we further proposed the Progressive Transfer Learning (PTL) method to facilitate the model fine-tuning process by joint training the BConv-Cells and the pretrained ReID model.

With the emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high spatial resolution (cm-level) images can be collected. This thesis aims at testing different methods for classifying UAV images from an agricultural crop site in the south of Skane, Sweden. To classify the UAV images, the Random Forest algorithm was used. Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble classifier which consists of multiple classification-trees, where the results of each individual tree contributes a single vote for to which class each pixel or segment belongs to. To evaluate the results a few objectives are presented. First of all, two cameras (RGB and multispectral) were used to examine the effect of different wavelengths bands on classification accuracy. Furthermore, the effects of spatial resolution, segmentation and integration of additional data were tested. To evaluate these different strategies a few classification examples were tested; two general classification cases, a 5-class classification and 11-class classification, and one specialized case where the high resolution of the UAV was used to classify a crop field consisting of two crop types. Both RGB and multispectral cameras performed well, reaching overall accuracies greater than 75% for all classification cases. Results from the general cases show little difference between RGB and multispectral cameras. However, in performing the specialized case classification, i.e., analyzing a field containing two spectrally similar classes, the multispectral camera outperformed the RGB. The pixel size has a big impact on resulting classification accuracy for both RGB and multispectral cameras (30% difference in accuracy ranging from 5 cm to 1 m pixel size), where higher accuracies are achieved at higher spatial resolutions. By integrating addition data sources in the pixel-by-pixel classification method, accuracies increase by a factor of >10%. The Mean \u2013 texture feature turns out to be the most important texture feature for both cameras. The highest accuracy, for both RGB and multispectral classification, was achieved by classifying groups of pixels into segments, reaching overall accuracy of >90%. Overall, UAV image classification works well for agricultural farm mapping and is a good monitoring tool due to its quick deployment, ease of data collection and accurate results.

In this paper, the performance of the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network for supervised incremental learning is compared to that of supervised batch learning. An experimental protocole is presented to assess this network's potential for incremental learning of new blocks of training data, in terms of generalization error and resource requirements, using several synthetic pattern recognition problems. The advantages and drawbacks of training fuzzy ARTMAP incrementally are assessed for different data block sizes and data set structures. Overall results indicate that error rate of fuzzy ARTMAP is significantly higher when it is trained through incremental learning than through batch learning. As the size of training blocs decreases, the error rate acheived through incremental learning grows, but provides a more compact network using fewer training epochs. In the cases where the class distributions overlap, incremental learning shows signs of over-training.

As evidenced by our experiments, this consistently outperforms attention-less structured representation learning and yields state-of-the-art results on standard scene recognition and fine-grained categorization benchmarks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1805.05389", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964317827,2804058931,2949158651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9496819", "206767722", "10381017", "206593051", "206595459", "14079854", "1836349", "10685040", "1532984", "6291314", "1346519", "1912782", "1525865", "6628106", "14342571", "8970727", "207763512", "591187", "30232702", "12529686", "1331231", "3807583", "130535382", "2118703", "8724974", "10402702", "7910040", "14100761", "207252215", "14124313", "14457153", "17338002", "9267207", "2897719", "14223587", "3730041", "4552417", "11710343", "6882979", "6789015"], "inbound_citations": ["51907442", "210695405", "57721239", "202558711", "198953254", "67788435"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21685761"}

By using Tomographic Reconstruction biological researchers can now obtain volumetric reconstructions for whole cells in near-native state using cryo-Soft X-ray Tomography or even smaller sub-cellular regions with cryo-Electron Tomography. These technologies allow for visualisation, exploration and analysis of very exciting biological samples, however, it doesn\u2019t come without its challenges. Poor signal-to-noise ratio, low contrast and other sample preparation and re-construction artefacts make these 3D datasets to be a great challenge for the image processing and computer vision community. Without previous available annotations due to the biological relevance of the datasets (which makes them not being publicly available) and the scarce previous research in the field, (semi-)automatic segmentation of these datasets tends to fail. ::: ::: ::: In order to bring state-of-the-art in computer vision closer to the biological community and overcome the difficulties previously mentioned, we are going to build towards a semi-automatic segmentation framework. To do so, we will first introduce superpixels, a group of adjacent pixels that share similar characteristics that reduce whole images to a few superpixels that still preserve important information of the image. Superpixels have been used in the recent literature to speed up object detection, tracking and scene parsing systems. The reduced representation of the image with a few regions allows for faster processing on the subsequent algorithms applied over them. Two novel superpixel algorithms will be presented, introducing with them what we call a Super-Region Hierarchy. A Super-Region Hierarchy is composed of similar regions agglomerated hierarchically. We will show that exploiting this hierarchy in both directions (bottom-up and top-down) helps improving the quality of the superpixels and generalizing them toimages of large dimensionality. ::: ::: ::: Then, superpixels are going to be extended to 3D (named supervoxels), resulting in a variation of two new algorithms ready to be applied to large biological volumes. We will show that representing biological volumes with supervoxels helps not only to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the analysis (as billions of voxels can be accurately represented with few thousand supervoxels), but also improve the accuracy of the analysis itself by reducing the local noisy neighbourhood of these datasets when grouping voxel features within supervoxels. These regions are only as powerful as the features that represent them, and thus, an in-depth discussion about biological features and grouping methods will lead the way to our first interactive segmentation model, by gathering contextual information from super-regions and hierarchical segmentation layers to allow for segmentation of large regions of the volume with few user input (in the form of annotations or scribbles). ::: ::: ::: Moving forward to improve the interactive segmentation model, a novel algorithm will be presented to extract the most representative (or relevant) sub-volumes from a 3D dataset, since the lack of training data is one of the deciding factors for automatic approaches to fail. We will show that by serving small sub-volumes to the user to be segmented and applying Active Learning to select the next best sub-volume, the number of user interactions needed to completely segment a 3D volume is dramatically reduced. A novel classifier based on Random Forests will be presented to better benefit from these regions of known shape. ::: ::: ::: To finish, SuRVoS will be introduced. A novel fully functional and publicly available workbench based on the work presented here. It is a software tool that comprises most of the ideas, problem formulations and algorithms into a single user interface.

We have then covered all the topics from data representation to segmentation of biological volumes, and provide with a software tool that hopefully will help closing the gap between biological imaging and computer vision, allowing to generate annotations (or ground truth as it is known in computer vision) much quicker with the aim of gathering a large biological segmentation database to be used in future large-scale completely automatic projects.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2802209142", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49325514"}

In this work, attempts have been taken to distinguish between normal, epileptic and non-epileptic EEG waves by use of Support Vector Machine (SVM). EEG signals from (healthy subject with eye open condition, healthy subject with eye close condition, signal from hippocampus region and signal from opposite to epileptogenic region and signal with seizure) were considered for the analysis. The signals were processed by using wavelet-chaos techniques. The nonlinear dynamics of the original EEGs are quantified in the form of the correlation dimension (CD, representing system complexity) and the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE, representing system chaoticity), Capacitive Dimension (CAD) which show the randomness nature of the signal.

Most of these deep hashing methods are supervised whose supervised information is given with triplet labels. For another common application scenario with pairwise labels, there have not existed methods for simultaneous feature learning and hash-code learning. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method, called deep pairwise-supervised hashing (DPSH), to perform simultaneous feature learning and hashcode learning for applications with pairwise labels.

Although specific composition and structure of cellular components suitable for the variety of extreme conditions has already been postulated, a systematic study describing such adaptations has not yet been performed. We therefore explored whether the environmental niche of a prokaryote could be deduced from the sequence of its proteome. Finally, we aimed at finding the precise differences between proteome sequences of prokaryotes from different environments.ResultsWe analyzed the proteomes of 192 prokaryotes from different habitats. We collected detailed information about the optimal growth conditions of each microorganism. Furthermore, we selected 42 physico-chemical properties of amino acids and computed their values for each proteome. Further, on the same set of features we applied two fundamentally different machine learning methods, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, to successfully classify between bacteria and archaea, halophiles and non-halophiles, as well as mesophiles, thermophiles and mesothermophiles. Finally, we performed feature selection by using Random Forests.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first time that three different classification cases (domain of life, halophilicity and thermophilicity) of proteome adaptation are successfully performed with the same set of 42 features.

Extensive developments of SVM ensure that support vector regression (SVR) is employed in many fields. In particular, in health applications, one of the most popular methods is survival data analysis. This paper describes the use of survival least square support vector machine (SURLS-SVM) applied to cervical cancer (CC) data with the benchmark Cox proportional hazards model (Cox PHM). The Cox PHM has assumptions that, unfortunately, cannot always be met in real cases. The SURLS-SVM overcomes this drawback.

This paper presents the application of connectionist methods to aid the process of heuristic selection, control and management for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with cash flows (RCPSPCF) which is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. Many heuristic procedures have been developed for the RCPSPCF, with differing performance characteristics in different problem environments. This makes the task of choosing the most appropriate heuristic or heuristic category for a given instance of the problem a complex task. We apply neural networks to induce the relationship between project parameters and heuristic performance to guide the selection under different project environments. We also compare the results of the neural network approach with those from traditional statistical procedures. An innovative feature of our approach is the integration of statistical and opti-mization methods with neural networks to address data preprocessing, thereby improving the performance of the neural network. We demonstrate that neural network methodology can be employed both to extract information about project conditions as well as to provide predictions for novel cases. Extensive experimentation with network topologies and learn-ing parameters indicate that this approach has significant promise in identifying categories of heuristics that are appropriate for any instance of the problem, rather than selecting a single best heuristic.

Thus, it is of great importance to diagnose the plant diseases at early stages so that appropriate and timely action can be taken by the farmers to avoid further losses. The project focuses on the approach based on image processing for detection of diseases of soybean plants. The soybean images are captured using mobile camera having resolution greater than 2 mega pixels. The purpose of the proposed project is to provide inputs for the Decision Support System (DSS), which is developed for providing advice to the farmers as and when require over mobile internet. Our proposed work classifies the images of soybean leaves as healthy and diseased using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The algorithm comprises of four major steps: image acquisition, extracting the leaf from complex background, statistical analysis and classification. The pre-processing step includes conversion from RGB to HSV (Hue Saturation Value) color space. For extracting the region of interest (ROI) from the original image, multi-thresholding is used. The color based and cluster based methods are used for segmentation. The algorithm uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) technique which automatically recognizes the plant species based on the leaf shape. The SVM classifier proves its ability in automatic and accurate classification of images.

The abundance of high-quality satellite images is salutary for many activities but raises also privacy and security concerns. Manually obfuscating areas subject to privacy issues by applying locally pixelization techniques leads to undesirable discontinuities in the visual appearance of the depicted scenes. Alternatively, automatically generated photorealistic fillers can be used to obfuscate sensitive information while preserving the original visual aspect of high-resolution aerial images. Recent advances in the field of Deep Learning (DL) enable to synthesize high-quality image data. Particularly, generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to produce images that can be perceived as photorealistic even by human examiners. Additionally, Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) allow control over the image generation process and results. These developments give the opportunity to generate photorealistic fillers for the purpose of privacy and security in image data used within city models while preserving the quality of the original data.

Our focus on temporal prediction is motivated by three key observations: i) Temporal information about an fMRI experiment is critical for either directly obtaining summary maps, or indirectly interpreting \u201cdata-driven\u201d results. ii) As recently demonstrated with CVA, classification of temporal scans can be used in model validation [3]. iii) The unique formulation of the SVM, which can find non-linear decision boundaries and handle high dimensional problems, makes it a promising technique for fMRI. We compare the classification accuracy of the SVM to that of canonical variates analysis (CVA) using cross-validation on data from a visually guided static force task. A key issue that needs to be addressed for the neuroscientific applicability of the SVM to fMRI is the physical meaning associated with a given support vector model. We begin to address this interpretation problem by looking at the SVM model of a simple bi-manual finger opposition task. THEORY Here we summarize only the salient concepts for SVM-based classification (see [3,4] for a description of CVA).

As a result Information Retrieval (IR) has become an increasingly important area of research. It promises to provide new and more effective ways for users to find information relevant to their search intentions. Document clustering is one of the many tools in the IR toolbox and is far from being perfected. It groups documents that share common features. This grouping allows a user to quickly identify relevant information. If these groups are misleading then valuable information can accidentally be ignored. There- fore, the study and analysis of the quality of document clustering is important. With more and more digital information available, the performance of these algorithms is also of interest. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(n2) can quickly become impractical when clustering a corpus containing millions of documents. Therefore, the investigation of algorithms and data structures to perform clustering in an efficient manner is vital to its success as an IR tool. Document classification is another tool frequently used in the IR field. It predicts categories of new documents based on an existing database of (doc- ument, category) pairs. Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been found to be effective when classifying text documents. As the algorithms for classifica- tion are both efficient and of high quality, the largest gains can be made from improvements to representation. Document representations are vital for both clustering and classification. Representations exploit the content and structure of documents. Dimensionality reduction can improve the effectiveness of existing representations in terms of quality and run-time performance. Research into these areas is another way to improve the efficiency and quality of clustering and classification results. Evaluating document clustering is a difficult task. Intrinsic measures of quality such as distortion only indicate how well an algorithm minimised a sim- ilarity function in a particular vector space. Intrinsic comparisons are inherently limited by the given representation and are not comparable between different representations. Extrinsic measures of quality compare a clustering solution to a \u201cground truth\u201d solution. This allows comparison between different approaches. As the \u201cground truth\u201d is created by humans it can suffer from the fact that not every human interprets a topic in the same manner.

Both simulated and real EMG are used. Results are evaluated for each contaminant: 1) power line interference; 2) motion artifact; 3) ECG interference; 4) quantization noise; 5) analog-to-digital converter clipping; and 6) amplifier saturation, as a function of the level of signal contamination. Results show that different ranges of contamination can be detected in the EMG depending on the type of contaminant. At high levels of contamination, the SVM classifies all EMG signals as contaminated, whereas at low levels of contamination, it classifies the majority of EMG signals as contaminant free. A transition point for each contaminant is identified, where the classification accuracy drops and variance in classification increases. In some cases, contamination can be detected with the SVM when it is not visually discernible.

To keep the energy grid cyber-secured, the attacker\u2019s behavior, resources and goals must be modeled properly. Then, the counter-measurement actions can be designed based on the attacker\u2019s model. In this paper, a new zero-sum game based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is presented. The attacker to energy smart grid pursues two objects. The first goal is to be undetected by the system defender, and the second goal is to make profit via its False Data Injection (FDI) into the system. On the defender hand, the ESO needs to detect FDI using fast and reliable models. Thus, each party tries to defeat the other part. GANs are deep layer networks which consist of two rivals networks: the generator and the discriminator.

By treating each video as one image set, set-based methods recently have made great success in the field of video-based face recognition. In the wild world, videos often contain extremely complex data variations and thus pose a big challenge of set modeling for set-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Euclidean-and-Riemannian Metric Learning (HERML) method to fuse multiple statistics of image set. Specifically, we represent each image set simultaneously by mean, covariance matrix and Gaussian distribution, which generally complement each other in the aspect of set modeling. However, it is not trivial to fuse them since mean, covariance matrix and Gaussian model typically lie in multiple heterogeneous spaces equipped with Euclidean or Riemannian metric. Therefore, we first implicitly map the original statistics into high dimensional Hilbert spaces by exploiting Euclidean and Riemannian kernels. With a LogDet divergence based objective function, the hybrid kernels are then fused by our hybrid metric learning framework, which can efficiently perform the fusing procedure on large-scale videos. The proposed method is evaluated on four public and challenging large-scale video face datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method has a clear superiority over the state-of-the-art set-based methods for large-scale video-based face recognition.

In particular, the O(n^3) computational complexity for solving a single model, and the overall computational complexity associated with tuning hyper parameters are still major problems. We address these problems by introducing an O(nlog n) approximate l-fold cross-validation method that uses a multi-level circulant matrix to approximate the kernel. In addition, we prove our algorithm's computational complexity and present empirical runtimes on data sets with approximately one million data points.

While com-putation and memory cost of the Gabor feature extraction process has been significantly reduced, our method has achieved the same accuracy as a Gabor feature and LDA based multi-class system. Keywords Gabor features, Support Vector Machine, Face identification. 1. Introduction Automatic recognition of human faces has been an active research area in recent years because it is user-friendly and unintrusive, and unlike fin-gerprint or iris recognition, it does not require ela-brated collaboration of the users. In addition to the importance of advancing research, it has a number of commercial and law-enforcement applications such as surveillance, security, telecommunications and human-computer intelligent interaction. Gabor wavelet based recognition algorithms have been shown to be advantageous over many other methods in the literature. For example, the Elastic Bunch Graph Matching (EBGM) algorithm has shown very competitive performance and was ranked the top performer in the FERET evaluation [1]. In a recent face verification competition (FVC2004), both above methods used Gabor wave-lets for feature extraction. The application of Gabor wavelets for face recognition was pioneered by Lades et al.\u2019s work since Dynamic Link Architec-ture (DLA) was proposed in 1993 [2]. In this system, faces are represented by a rectangular graph with local features extracted at the nodes using Gabor wavelets, referred to as Gabor jets. Wiskott et al [3] extended DLA to EBGM, where graph nodes are located at a number of facial landmarks. Since then, a large number of elastic graph based methods have been proposed [4-7]. Chung et al. [8] use the Gabor wavelet responses over a set of 12 fiducial points as input to a Principal Componet Analysis (PCA) algorithm, yielding a feature vector of 480 components. They claim to have improved the recognition rate up to 19% with this method compared to that by a raw PCA. All of these me-thods can be classified as analytic approaches since the local features extracted from selected points in faces are used for recognition. Recently, Gabor wavelets have also been applied in global form for face recognition [9, 10]. Liu et al. [9] vectorize the Gabor responses and then apply a downsampling by a factor of 64 to reduce the computation cost of the following subspace training. Their Gabor-based enhanced Fisher linear discriminant model outper-forms Gabor PCA and Gabor Fisherfaces. These holistic methods normally use the whole image after Gabor wavelets processing for feature representa-tion. A more detailed survey on Gabor wavelet based face recognition methods can be found in [11]. Despite the success of Gabor wavelets based face recognition systems, both the feature extraction process and the huge dimension of Gabor features extracted demands large computation and memory costs, which makes them impractical for real appli-cations [11]. For the same reason, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has also seldom been applied to face recognition using Gabor features.

In addition, optimal features for wetlands classification is still unclear. In this study, Landsat monthly composited time series were used to identify wetlands. Firstly, we generated the Landsat 30m land surface reflectance, NDVI, NDWI and TC-Wetness time series by compositing the Landsat7 ETM+ and Landsat8 OLI data. Then the extension of the Jeffries-Matusita Distance (J Bh ) and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm were used to select the optimal features for accurate wetlands classification. Finally, the optimal features were used for wetlands classification based on the RF algorithm. The results showed that: (1) the optimal features included NDVI in May and August, TC-Wetness in May and NDWI in June and August which can effectively separate seasonal and permanent marshes, rice fields, grass and drylands; (2) the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient calculated using the optimal features were 90.05% and 0.88 respectively which were similar to the wetlands classification result derived by the entire Landsat time series data.

In this context the literature has been specially rich in terms of ensemble techniques, which in their majority have focused on taking advantage of past information in the form of already trained predictive models and other alternatives alike. This manuscript elaborates on a rather different approach, which hinges on extracting the essential predictive information of past trained models and determining therefrom the best candidates (intelligent sample matchmaking) for training the predictive model of the current data batch. This novel perspective is of inherent utility for data streams characterized by short-length unbalanced data batches, situation where the so-called trade-off between plasticity and stability must be carefully met. The approach is evaluated on a synthetic data set that simulates a non-stationary environment with recurrently changing concept drift. The proposed approach is shown to perform competitively when adapting to a sudden and recurrent change with respect to the state of the art, but without storing all the past trained models and by lessening its computational complexity in terms of model evaluations.

Using a selection of personas we illustrate how app usage can be tied to personal information. Users would likely assume the confidentiality of personal information (including age, religion, sexuality and gender) when using an encrypted network. However, we demonstrate how encrypted traffic pattern analysis can allow a remote observer to infer potentially sensitive data passively and undetectably without any network credentials. Without the ability to read encrypted WiFi traffic directly, we process the limited side-channel data available (timings and frame sizes) to enable remote app detection. These side-channel data measurements are represented as histograms and used to construct a Random Forest classifier capable of accurately identifying mobile apps from the encrypted traffic they cause. The Random Forest algorithm was able to correctly identify apps with a mean accuracy of \u223c99% within the training set. The classifier was then adapted to form the core of a detection program that could monitor multiple devices in real-time. Tests in a closed-world scenario showed 84% accuracy and demonstrated the ability to overcome the data limitations imposed by WiFi encryption. Although accuracy suffers greatly (67%) when moving to an open-world scenario, a high recall rate of 86% demonstrates that apps can unwittingly broadcast personal information openly despite using encrypted WiFi. The open-world false positive rate (38% overall, or 72% for unseen activity alone) leaves much room for improvement but the experiment demonstrates a plausible threat nevertheless. Finally, avenues for improvement and the limitations of this approach are identified. We discuss potential applications, strategies to prevent these leaks, and consider the effort required for an observer to present a practical privacy threat to the everyday WiFi user.

In recent years, plant species recognition is carried out based on the shape, geometry and texture of various plant parts such as leaves, stem, flowers etc. Flower based plant species identification systems are widely used. While modern search engines provide methods to visually search for a query image that contains a flower, it lacks in robustness because of the intra-class variation among millions of flower species around the world. Hence in this proposed research work, a Deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used to recognize flower species with high accuracy. Images of the plant species are acquired using the built-in camera module of a mobile phone. Feature extraction of flower images is performed using a Transfer Learning approach (i.e. extraction of complex features from a pre-trained network). A machine learning classifier such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest is used on top of it to yield a higher accuracy rate. This approach helps in minimizing the hardware requirement needed to perform the computationally intensive task of training a CNN. It is observed that, CNN combined with Transfer Learning approach as feature extractor outperforms all the handcrafted feature extraction methods such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Color Channel Statistics, Color Histograms, Haralick Texture, Hu Moments and Zernike Moments.

This is especially important in heterogeneous environments, such as semi-arid savannahs, which are naturally comprised of a dynamic mix of tree, shrub, and grass components. The fractional coverage of woody vegetation is a key ecosystem attribute in savannahs, particularly given current concerns over the invasion of grasslands by shrub species (i.e. shrub encroachment), or the over-exploitation of woody biomass for fuelwood. Remote sensing has a clear role to play in monitoring semi-arid environments, and in recent years, the number of both spacebourne sensors and imagery acquired has increased dramatically allowing for data mining-based investigations. In this study, we investigated the potential of optical and radar-based remote sensing data for mapping woody canopy cover in sub-Saharan Africa savannahs, using the Limpopo Province of South Africa as a case study. A total of 92 variables were compiled, consisting of 90 Landsat spectral variability metrics and two PALSAR backscatter layers. These variables were used as input to a Random Forest-based work-flow that tested the impact of sensor combinations, seasonality, and scale on resulting predictions. Results showed that models at a 120 m scale produced considerably more accurate results than finer resolutions. PALSAR variables were consistently the most important predictors, but alone produced poor modelling accuracies. Using Landsat metrics, dry season data was the best predictor followed by annual, with wet season the worst performer. The bulk processing of the Landsat archive to generate spectral variability metrics provides a rapid method for mapping savannah woody cover.

Most techniques learn a global metric in the form of a n\u00d7 n symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) Mahalanobis distance matrix, which has O(n2) unknowns. The PSD constraint makes solving the metric learning problem even harder making it computationally intractable for high dimensions. In this work, we propose a flexible formulation that can employ different regularization functions, while implicitly maintaining the positive semidefiniteness constraint.

In this research work, new ensemble classification methods are proposed with homogeneous ensemble classifier using bagging and heterogeneous ensemble classifier using arcing and their performances are analyzed in terms of accuracy. A Classifier ensemble is designed using Radial Basis Function RBF and Support Vector Machine SVM as base classifiers. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approaches are demonstrated by the means of standard datasets of direct marketing. The main originality of the proposed approach is based on three main parts: preprocessing phase, classification phase and combining phase. A wide range of comparative experiments are conducted for standard datasets of direct marketing. The performance of the proposed homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble classifiers are compared to the performance of other standard homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble methods. The standard homogeneous ensemble methods include Error correcting output codes, dagging and heterogeneous ensemble methods include majority voting, stacking. The proposed ensemble methods provide significant improvement of accuracy compared to individual classifiers and the proposed bagged RBF and SVM performs significantly better than ECOC and Dagging and the proposed hybrid RBF-SVM performs significantly better than voting and stacking.

Inaccurate estimations may cause the client dissatisfaction and thereby, decrease the quality of the product. Considering the problem of software cost and effort prediction, it is conceivable to call attention to that the estimation procedure considers the qualities present in the data set, as well as the aspects of the environment in which the model is embedded. Existing literatures have the instances where machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) have been used to estimate the effort required to develop any software. Yet it is quite uncertain for any particular model to perform well with all the data sets. Most of the research is based on the dataset of any single organization. Consequently, the results obtained through these models cannot be generalized. So, the main objectives of this research are: i) to use different data preparation techniques such as selection, cleaning, and transformation to improve the quality of data set given to the model ii) to use other machine learning models such as Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to increase the performance of software effort estimation process iii) to use different optimization techniques to tune the parameters of machine learning models iv) to use ensemble methods to improve the accuracy of software effort estimation process. In this study, first, we found out the most influential attributes in the Desharnais data set, then, MLPNN has been applied on reduced data set with to improve the accuracy of software effort estimation. Then, the performance of the MLPNN model is compared with LR, SVM and KNN models in the literature to find the best model fitting this dataset.

Although many recent studies have solved this problem by trajectory complements, these methods still have drawbacks because only spatial and temporal features are considered. Activity trajectory, with the development of LBSN (Location-based Social Network), endows traditional trajectory data with additional semantic information. In this paper, we fuse the spatio-temporal characteristics with extra activity information of the activity trajectory to solve the shortcomings in the process of trajectory complement. Specifically, we utilize vectors containing these three kinds of semantic information as the input of deep learning model for acquiring final trajectory representation, which is not only robust to low sampling, but also can capture implicit features in the trajectory. What's more, for the purpose of meeting the actual situation of network training, we propose a novel loss function based on the attention mechanism in natural language processing to distinguish these three kinds of information.

Since, subcellular localization of a protein offers essential clues about its functioning, hence, availability of localization predictor would definitely aid and expedite the protein deciphering studies. However, robustness of a predictor is highly dependent on the superiority of dataset and extracted protein attributes; hence, it becomes imperative to improve the performance of presently available method using latest dataset and crucial input features.ResultsHere, we describe augmentation in the prediction performance obtained for our most popular ESLpred method using new crucial features as an input to Support Vector Machine (SVM). In addition, recently available, highly non-redundant dataset encompassing three kingdoms specific protein sequence sets; 1198 fungi sequences, 2597 from animal and 491 plant sequences were also included in the present study. First, using the evolutionary information in the form of profile composition along with whole and N-terminal sequence composition as an input feature vector of 440 dimensions, overall accuracies of 72.7, 75.8 and 74.5% were achieved respectively after five-fold cross-validation.

The capsule network represents the features by vectors, which can account for the direction of the features and the relative position between the features. Therefore, more detailed feature information can be extracted. ResNet protects the integrity of information by passing input information to the output directly, which can solve the problem of network degradation caused by information loss in the traditional CNN propagation process to a certain extent.

The principle of these non-parametric models is to learn hyperplanes that separate data belonging to different classes while maximizing their margins. However, SVMs constrain the learned hyperplanes to lie in the span of support vectors, fixed/taken from training data, and this reduces their representational power and may lead to limited generalization performances. In this paper, we relax this constraint and allow the support vectors to be learned (instead of being fixed/taken from training data) in order to better fit a given classification task.

However, if the disease is identified at an early age it would solve all the above mentioned problems through the application of appropriate treatment, or through the pruning of the diseased leaves to prevent further spread of the disease. To solve this problem image processing is the best option to detect and diagnose the disease. The main goal of this research is to develop an image processing system that can identify and classify the two most widespread tea leaf diseases in Bangladesh, namely brown blight disease and the algal leaf disease, from a healthy leaf. Disease identification is the first step; there are many methods that have been used for identifying the leaf disease. In this paper, Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) is used to recognize the diseases. Eleven features are analyzed during the classification. These features are then used to find the most suitable match for the disease (or normality) every time an image is uploaded into the SVM database. When a new picture is uploaded into the system the most suitable match is found and the disease is recognized. The approach is novel since the number of features compared by the SVM classifier is reduced by three features compared to previous researches, without adversely sacrificing the success rate of the classifier, which retains an accuracy of more than 90%. This also speeds up the identification process, with each leaf image taking 300ms less processing time compared to previous research using SVM, thus ensuring a greater number of leaves can be processed in a given time frame. The proposed solution increases in efficiency of the detection, identification, and classification process will enable the tea industry in Bangladesh to become more competitive globally, by reducing the losses suffered due to diseases of the leaf, and thus increasing the overall tea production rate.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/cspa.2018.8368703", "venue": "2018 IEEE 14th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications (CSPA)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 14th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications (CSPA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2807205902", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18998433", "108832344", "16102095", "21881684", "5645500", "28002345", "5543127", "12337546", "116454526", "3717004"], "inbound_citations": ["213177066", "211059283", "211057708", "174820803", "102523431"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44116745"}

UST classes are defined based on the occurrence within the study area and are delimited by block boundaries.

If a skeleton is available, we propose a rules based technique on the vertical velocity and the height to floor plane of the human center. Otherwise, we compute a motion map from a continuous gray-scale image sequence, represent it by an improved kernel descriptor then input to a linear Support Vector Machine. This combination speeds up the proposed system and avoid missing detection at an unmeasurable range of the Kinect sensor.

Data collected from Twitter is highly unstructured, and extracting useful information from tweets is a challenging task. Twitter has a huge number of Arabic users who mostly post and write their tweets using the Arabic language. While there has been a lot of research on sentiment analysis in English, the amount of researches and datasets in Arabic language is limited. This paper introduces an Arabic language dataset which is about opinions on health services and has been collected from Twitter. The paper will first detail the process of collecting the data from Twitter and also the process of filtering, pre-processing and annotating the Arabic text in order to build a big sentiment analysis dataset in Arabic.

Previous studies have established that RD is correlated with several protein properties, such as protein stability, residue conservation and amino acid types. Accurate prediction of RD has many potentially important applications in the field of structural bioinformatics, for example, facilitating the identification of functionally important residues, or residues in the folding nucleus, or enzyme active sites from sequence information. In this work, we introduce an efficient approach that uses support vector regression to quantify the relationship between RD and protein sequence. We systematically investigated eight different sequence encoding schemes including both local and global sequence characteristics and examined their respective prediction performances. For the objective evaluation of our approach, we used 5-fold cross-validation to assess the prediction accuracies and showed that the overall best performance could be achieved with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.71 between the observed and predicted RD values and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.74, after incorporating the relevant multiple sequence features. The results suggest that residue depth could be reliably predicted solely from protein primary sequences: local sequence environments are the major determinants, while global sequence features could influence the prediction performance marginally. We highlight two examples as a comparison in order to illustrate the applicability of this approach. We also discuss the potential implications of this new structural parameter in the field of protein structure prediction and homology modeling. This method might prove to be a powerful tool for sequence analysis.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2742725", "pubmed_id": "19759917", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0007072", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2087197916", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["37368820", "26408746", "213776332", "19285647", "22755373", "14037975", "19294490", "9140745", "4025084", "3145020", "17716035", "3828246", "410081", "14203483", "33229208", "2285222", "8871477", "19678285", "45665802", "18944700", "12046991", "10631851", "155502", "14523886", "5243735", "26557641", "7193705", "11437576", "11348405", "31392217", "193129", "29185760", "17605327", "8039938", "1289490", "14011584", "10509744", "2650450", "17815381", "24860100", "765861", "8333628", "205879976", "27123114", "12117361", "40589986", "6869184", "23514943", "28637672", "7138354", "16890099", "3225991", "5375533", "1583027", "5595917", "14342590", "267568", "9326944", "35392780", "1471236", "2483854", "1340978", "2944273", "614128", "14438715", "15489990", "18478554"], "inbound_citations": ["18760609", "15388749", "26111320", "4307131", "49183678", "17811800", "28460789", "36068945", "26190777", "48363240", "9383630", "2209140", "16463612", "215609800", "8625079", "10597511", "12492854", "1524120", "56481925", "19120430", "24035777", "576379", "2646075", "53035082"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1454790"}

To assess the discriminant potential of the texture measures a Random Forest classifier is used. Our analysis shows that the multi scale extension performs better than the standard local binary patterns and that radial density profiles in comparison is a rather poor virus texture discriminating measure. Furthermore, we show that the multi scale extension and the profiles in Fourier domain are both good texture measures and that they complement each other well, that is, they seem to detect different texture properties. Combining the two, hence, improves the discrimination between virus textures.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-25085-9_68", "venue": "CIARP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "12728872", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53554009", "8000988", "38323655", "36937013", "209536813", "35012000", "202577394", "1908950", "35836077", "1409317", "225217", "21982072", "9034030", "8991622", "58750402", "125673369"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36262199"}

In order to improve the performance of the SVR model, a kernel function iteration scheme is introduced further. Due to the excellent generalization performance and structural risk minimization principle, the SVR possesses the advantages of solving non-linear prediction problems with small samples. Thus, the proposed method is capable of computing the Sobol\u2019 indices with a relatively limited number of model evaluations. The proposed method is examined by several examples, and the sensitivity analysis results are compared with the sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), high dimensional model representation (HDMR) and Gaussian radial basis (RBF) SVR model.

In the process of classification by decision tree methods, the classification rules are easily obtained, moreover these rules are clear and easy to understand for astronomers.

Current methods for learning MLNs follow a two-step approach: first, perform a search through the space of possible clauses and then learn appropriate weights for these clauses. We propose to take a different approach, namely to learn both the weights and the structure of the MLN simultaneously. Our approach is based on functional gradient boosting where the problem of learning MLNs is turned into a series of relational functional approximation problems. We use two kinds of representations for the gradients: clause-based and tree-based.

Due to its cloud free capability, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an ideal source of information on forest dynamics in countries with near-constant cloud-cover. However, few studies have investigated the use of SAR for forest cover estimation in landscapes with highly sparse and fragmented forest cover. In this study, the potential use of L-band SAR for forest cover estimation in two regions (Longford and Sligo) in Ireland is investigated and compared to forest cover estimates derived from three national (Forestry2010, Prime2, National Forest Inventory), one pan-European (Forest Map 2006) and one global forest cover (Global Forest Change) product. Two machine-learning approaches (Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees) are evaluated. Both Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees classification accuracies were high (98.1-98.5%), with differences between the two classifiers being minimal (<0.5%). Increasing levels of post classification filtering led to a decrease in estimated forest area and an increase in overall accuracy of SAR-derived forest cover maps. All forest cover products were evaluated using an independent validation dataset. For the Longford region, the highest overall accuracy was recorded with the Forestry2010 dataset (97.42%) whereas in Sligo, highest overall accuracy was obtained for the Prime2 dataset (97.43%), although accuracies of SAR-derived forest maps were comparable. Our findings indicate that spaceborne radar could aid inventories in regions with low levels of forest cover in fragmented landscapes.

The M-SVM is formulated as a quadratic programming model. Its dual, also a quadratic programming model, is very elegant and is easier to solve than the primal. The discriminant functions can be directly constructed from the dual solution. By using inner product kernels, the M-SVM can be built and nonlinear discriminant functions can be constructed in high dimensional feature spaces without carrying out the mappings from the input space to the feature spaces. The size of the dual, measured by the number of variables and constraints, is independent of the dimension of the input space and stays the same whether the M-SVM is built in the input space or in a feature space.

{"paper_id": "228816", "title": "A re-analysis of the relationship between \u201cparasite stress\u201d and authoritarianism", "authors": [{"first": "Thomas", "middle": ["V."], "last": "Pollet", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This paper is a commentary on Murray et al. (2013) where, alongside other findings, data from two cross-cultural samples (nations and cultures), supporting a positive relationship between pathogen prevalence and authoritarianism are presented. This commentary is not a theoretical critique (see the comments on Fincher and Thornhill, 2012, for example, or an alternative: Hackman and Hruschka, 2013). Nor is it a methodological critique of work on pathogen stress (e.g., Currie and Mace, 2012; Pollet, 2013; Pollet et al., in press). The goal of this brief commentary is to re-analyze the data with an alternative technique to examine whether the original conclusions are upheld, specifically the claim that indices of pathogen prevalence are positively related to authoritarianism. To this end, I use a relatively novel technique from machine learning: \u201cConditional inference trees.\u201d ::: ::: Conditional inference trees are part of \u201cmachine learning,\u201d a set of algorithms commonly used for data mining (Hastie et al., 2009 for introduction to field). Researchers may be familiar with machine learning algorithms such as \u201cClassification And Regression Trees\u201d (CART; Breiman et al., 1984) and \u201cCHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection\u201d (CHAID; Kass, 1980; Biggs et al., 1991). These were originally developed to automatically, and \u201coptimally,\u201d detect interactions and non-linear patterns in data (reviews in Haughton and Oulabi, 1997; Hastie et al., 2009). Next to other limitations, it is known that these \u201colder\u201d algorithms tend to overfit (Hastie et al., 2009). To this end, researchers have recently developed conditional inference trees, which successfully overcome the limitations of these earlier algorithms (Hothorn et al., 2006, 2010; Strobl et al., 2009; Molnar, 2013). Note that these conditional inference trees can be further nested into \u201cRandom Forests\u201d (Breiman, 2001; Liaw and Wiener, 2002; Hothorn et al., 2010). Here I focus on, and limit myself to the \u201cctree\u201d algorithm. As described by Hothorn et al. (2010:8): \u201cRoughly, the algorithm works as follows: (1) Test the global null hypothesis of independence between any of the input variables and the response (which may be multivariate as well). Stop if this hypothesis cannot be rejected. Otherwise select the input variable with strongest association to the response. This association is measured by a p-value corresponding to a test for the partial null hypothesis of a single input variable and the response. (2) Implement a binary split in the selected input variable. (3) Recursively repeate steps (1) and (2).\u201d This algorithm does not overfit and no \u201cpruning\u201d is required (Hothorn et al., 2010). Moreover, it demonstrates good properties for regression and classification modeling. Statistical inference is based on permutation testing, which is non-parametric and relatively free of assumptions (Hothorn et al., 2010; Molnar, 2013). A p-value can be obtained by comparing the observed data, to the (fully) permuted (randomized) data. The \u201cctree\u201d algorithm has been extensively tested. It seems particularly useful where researchers are faced with a relatively large number of predictors, which could interact or have non-linear effects, and a relatively small sample, as is the case here. For a full description of the algorithm I refer to the papers cited above. ::: ::: I apply the \u201cctree\u201d algorithm from \u201cparty\u201d to the datasets provided by Murray et al. (2013). I expanded the first dataset containing countries to incorporate their geographical regions (United Nations, 2013) and their economic development classification (United Nations Development Programme, 2012). Note that this dataset also contained the Human Development index (HDI), which was included in the dataset, but does not seem to be part of the original analyses. The only key change made to second dataset, based on the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (Murdock and White, 1969), is reversing the sign of \u201cauthoritarianism.composite,\u201d which seemed to not have been reverse-coded. I used all possible predictors for the algorithm (n = 14 and n = 25 respectively) and the same outcome variables as Murray et al. (2013). Analyses were run in R version 3.0.1 (R Development Core Team, 2008) in duplicate with different starting seeds. A significance level of 0.05 (corrected for multiple testing) was used. The data used and script are in Supplementary Material. ::: ::: For the first sample (Figure \u200b(Figure1A),1A), the only variable selected was the HDI (p = 0.001). The algorithm partitions the data nearly equally, with those countries scoring low on the HDI having high authoritarianism. The pathogen stress variable was not selected by the algorithm as a significant predictor. For the second sample (Figure \u200b(Figure1B),1B), the algorithm selected Cashdan and Steele's (2013) pathogen prevalence variable (p = 0.002). It implemented a split whereby a cluster (n = 26) of countries with low levels of pathogen prevalence also have low authoritarianism. The majority of these cultures (n = 15) were North American. ::: ::: ::: ::: Figure 1 ::: ::: Results of two conditional inference tree models for Murray et al. (2013)'s data on authoritarianism. A higher score indicates more authoritarianism. (A= Sample 1: 31 Countries, B= Sample 2: 90 cultures from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample). ::: ::: ::: ::: The current analyses thus provide mixed support for a positive association between pathogen prevalence and authoritarianism. For the first sample, the conclusion is fundamentally different than that of Murray et al. (2013). Only the Human Development Index is found to be a significant predictor of authoritarianism. For the second sample, as in Murray et al. (2013) historical pathogen prevalence seems to be a key predictor. However, it seems that the pattern is non-linear. Rather than an overall linear positive effect of pathogen stress on authoritarianism, as argued by Murray et al. (2013), it appears that there is a cluster of cultures with very low pathogen stress and very low authoritarianism, consisting mainly of North American cultures. This cluster could account for the findings from their correlational and regression analyses. ::: ::: This alternative approach via conditional inference trees therefore questions the original findings. This alternative technique has some benefits [e.g., good performance with small sample size and multiple (correlated) predictors], but does not overcome some of the limitations inherent to cross-cultural data (e.g., measurement equivalency). Further research examining the effect of pathogen prevalence on politics remains necessary, both at an individual as well as at a cultural level, preferably using advanced statistical techniques. For now, it seems that the purported effects of pathogen stress on authoritarianism at the level of a nation or culture may well hinge upon the analytical strategy, such as correlations and/or ordinary least squares regressions, employed by researchers.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4066297", "pubmed_id": "25002855", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00638", "venue": "Front.

This paper compares machine learning techniques for detecting malicious webpages. The conventional method of detecting malicious webpages is going through the black list and checking whether the webpages are listed. Black list is a list of webpages which are classified as malicious from a user's point of view. These black lists are created by trusted organizations and volunteers. They are then used by modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. However, black list is ineffective because of the frequent-changing nature of webpages, growing numbers of webpages that pose scalability issues and the crawlers' inability to visit intranet webpages that require computer operators to log in as authenticated users. In this paper therefore alternative and novel approaches are used by applying machine learning algorithms to detect malicious webpages. In this paper three supervised machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Classifier, and two unsupervised machine learning techniques such as K-Means and Affinity Propagation are employed. Please note that K-Means and Affinity Propagation have not been applied to detection of malicious webpages by other researchers. All these machine learning techniques have been used to build predictive models to analyze large number of malicious and safe webpages. These webpages were downloaded by a concurrent crawler taking advantage of gevent. The webpages were parsed and various features such as content, URL and screenshot of webpages were extracted to feed into the machine learning models. Computer simulation results have produced an accuracy of up to 98% for the supervised techniques and silhouette coefficient of close to 0.96 for the unsupervised techniques.

Crowd events such as running, walking, merging, splitting, dispersion, and evacuation inform crowd management about the behavior of groups of people. For an effective crowd management, detection of crowd events provides an early sign of the behavior of the people. However, crowd event detection using videos is a highly challenging task because of several challenges such as non-rigid human body motions, occlusions, unavailability of distinguishing features due to occlusions, unpredictability in people movements, and other. In addition, the video itself is a high-dimensional data and analyzing to detect events becomes further complicated. One way of tackling the huge volume of video data is to represent a video using low-dimensional equivalent. However, reducing the video data size needs to consider the complex data structure and events embedded in a video. To this extent, we focus on detection of crowd events using the Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The ISOMAP is used to construct the low-dimensional representation of the feature vectors, and then an SVM is used for training and classification.

The proposed and developed hybrid SVR HSVR works by considering the initial SVR prediction as a feature extraction process and then employs the SVR output, which is the extracted feature, as its sole descriptor. The developed hybrid model is applied to the prediction of reservoir permeability and the predicted permeability is compared to core permeability which is regarded as standard in petroleum industry. The results show that the proposed hybrid scheme HSVR performed better than the existing SVR in both generalization and prediction ability. The outcome of this research will assist petroleum engineers to effectively predict permeability of carbonate reservoirs with higher degree of accuracy and will invariably lead to better reservoir.

Studies show that, without large-scale training data, it is hard for DNN-SER model with cross-entropy loss to learn discriminative features by mapping the speech segments to their category labels. In this study, we propose a deep metric learning based DNN-SER model to facilitate the discriminative feature learning by constraining the feature embeddings in the feature space. For the proof of the concept, we take a four-hidden layer DNN as our backbone for implementation simplicity. Specifically, an emotion identity matrix is formed using one-hot label vectors as supervision information while the emotion embedding matrix is formed using the embedding vectors generated by DNN. An affinity loss is designed based on the above two matrices to simultaneously maximize the inter-class separability and intra-class compactness of the embeddings. Moreover, to restrain the class imbalance problem, the focal loss is introduced to reduce the adverse effect of the majority well-classified samples and gain more focus on the minority misclassified ones. Our proposed DNN-SER model is jointly trained using affinity loss and focal loss. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two well-known emotional speech datasets, EMO-DB and IEMOCAP. Compared to DNN-SER baseline, the unweighted accuracy (UA) on EMO-DB and IEMOCAP increased relatively by 10.19% and 10% respectively. Besides, from the confusion matrix of the test results on Emo-DB, it is noted that the accuracy of the most confusing emotion category, \u2018Happiness\u2019, increased relatively by 33.17% and the accuracy of the emotion category with the fewest samples, \u2018Disgust\u2019, increased relatively by 13.62%. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposed DNN-SER model and give the evidence that affinity loss and focal loss help to learn better discriminative features.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-30490-4_17", "venue": "ICANN", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2972527032", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202402044"}

There have been a few methods proposed in the literature to learn an approximant that simultaneously uses values of a function as well as values of its derivatives or partial derivatives. These methods typically use Support Vector Regression (SVR) and solve a Quadratic Programming Problem (QPP) for the task, which results in a learning model that can estimate the function and derivative values. In this paper, we propose an alternative novel approach that focuses on introducing sparsity in such a learning model, that is based on minimizing the model complexity in the Empirical Feature Space (EFS). Sparsity in such a model is useful when it needs to be evaluated a large number of times as it entails lower computational cost compared to a dense model. The proposed approach, called the EFSRD (EFS Regression for Function and Derivative approximation), involves solving a Linear Programming Problem (LPP).

We evaluate different ways of characterizing the input noise for the model and perform model runs with the GAN parameterization at weather and climate timescales.

In the first case study, an S2 image was used to map six summer crop species in Lower Austria as well as winter crops/bare soil. Crop type maps are needed to account for crop-specific water use and for agricultural statistics. Crop type information is also useful to parametrize crop growth models for yield estimation, as well as for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables using radiative transfer models. The second case study aimed to map seven different deciduous and coniferous tree species in Germany. Detailed information about tree species distribution is important for forest management and to assess potential impacts of climate change. In our S2 data assessment, crop and tree species maps were produced at 10 m spatial resolution by combining the ten S2 spectral channels with 10 and 20 m pixel size. A supervised Random Forest classifier (RF) was deployed and trained with appropriate ground truth. In both case studies, S2 data confirmed its expected capabilities to produce reliable land cover maps. Cross-validated overall accuracies ranged between 65% (tree species) and 76% (crop types). The study confirmed the high value of the red-edge and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands for vegetation mapping. Also, the blue band was important in both study sites. The S2-bands in the near infrared were amongst the least important channels.

In previous studies, the construction cost are estimated by statistical methods. Among the statistical methods, support vector regression (SVR) has attracted a lot of attentions because of the generalization ability in the field of cost estimation. However, despite the simplicity of the parameter to be adjusted, it is not easy to find optimal parameters. Therefore, to build an effective SVR model, SVR\u2019s parameters must be set properly without additional data handling loads. So this study proposes a novel approach, known as genetic algorithm (GA), which searches SVR\u2019s optimal parameters, then adopt the parameters to the SVR model for estimating cost in the early stage of apartment housing projects. The aim of this study is to propose a GA-SVR model and examine the feasibility in cost estimation by comparing with multiple regression analysis (MRA).

However, workers generally performed different activities during the construction task in the workplace. Thereby, an additional process that can identify the worker's walking activity is necessary to utilize the proposed hazard identification approach in real world settings. In this context, this study investigated the feasibility of identifying walking activities during construction task using Wearable Inertial Measurement Units (WIMU) attached to the worker's ankle. This study simulated the indoor masonry work for data collection and investigated the classification performance with three different machine learning algorithms (i.e., Decision Tree, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine).

In this paper, we propose an image generation framework to generate photo-realistic, various, and balanced images of text. Specifically, we add the module for training unpaired images (U-module) and target selector to our framework, and the target selector uses text string to select images in the extended real images, which contain real images and the generated images by the U-module, in addition, global generator and local enhancer network are applied to improve the quality of the generated images. We demonstrate our method on the Chinese license plates, and the unbalance of the license plate data set is shown in the provincial category and the special license plates. The Inception Score and the FID Score are used as metrics to validate our method. The experimental results show that the Inception Score of the generated images is close to that of the real images, and our method achieves the lower FID Score than the state-of-the-art.

The challenge comes from many factors affecting the performance of a face recognition system: noisy input, training data collection, speed-accuracy trade-off, variations in expression, illumination, pose, or ageing. Although relatively successful attempts have been made for special cases, such as frontal faces, no satisfactory methods exist that work under completely unconstrained conditions. This thesis proposes solutions to three important problems: lack of training data, speed-accuracy requirement, and unconstrained environments. ::: ::: The problem of lacking training data has been solved in the worst case: single sample per person. Whitened Principal Component Analysis is proposed as a simple but effective solution. Whitened PCA performs consistently well on multiple face datasets. ::: ::: Speed-accuracy trade-off problem is the second focus of this thesis. Two solutions are proposed to tackle this problem. The first solution is a new feature extraction method called Compact Binary Patterns which is about three times faster than Local Binary Patterns. The second solution is a multi-patch classifier which performs much better than a single classifier without compromising speed. ::: ::: Two metric learning methods are introduced to solve the problem of unconstrained face recognition. The first method called Indirect Neighourhood Component Analysis combines the best ideas from Neighourhood Component Analysis and One-shot learning. The second method, Cosine Similarity Metric Learning, uses Cosine Similarity instead of the more popular Euclidean distance to form the objective function in the learning process. This Cosine Similarity Metric Learning method produces the best result in the literature on the state-of-the-art face dataset: the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset. ::: ::: Finally, a full face verification system based on our real experience taking part in ICPR 2010 Face Verification contest is described.

However, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a better textual representation technique as it maintains semantic information between the words. Hence, we used the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to extract textual features based on LSI. In our experiments, we conducted comparison between some of the well-known classification methods such as Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and classification tree. We used a corpus that contains 4,000 documents of ten topics (400 document for each topic). The corpus contains 2,127,197 words with about 139,168 unique words. The testing set contains 400 documents, 40 documents for each topics. As a weighing scheme, we used Term Frequency.Inverse Document Frequency (TF.IDF).

Meanwhile, it has been observed that many shallow models, such as linear models or tree-based models, are fairly interpretable though not accurate enough. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we investigate how to fully take advantage of the interpretability of shallow models in neural networks. To this end, we propose a novel interpretable neural model with Interactive Stepwise Influence (ISI) framework. Specifically, in each iteration of the learning process, ISI interactively trains a shallow model with soft labels computed from a neural network, and the learned shallow model is then used to influence the neural network to gain interpretability. Thus ISI could achieve interpretability in three aspects: importance of features, impact of feature value changes, and adaptability of feature weights in the neural network learning process. Experiments on both synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate that ISI could generate reliable interpretation with respect to the three aspects, as well as preserve prediction accuracy by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-16142-2_41", "venue": "PAKDD", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2935424497", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["215716659", "378410", "6747148", "7353077", "17718755", "9679378", "948039", "51893222", "4571983", "3334005", "3976789", "7200347", "988348", "14542261", "209099422", "63778507", "11715509", "16747630", "11283906", "15602827", "15696161"], "inbound_citations": ["212647488"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92998981"}

Hardware-AVs, in turn, present another drawback: the update of malicious definitions is essential for AVs working in constant changing scenarios, but challenging to be deployed in hardware. In this paper, we propose REHAB (REconfigurable, Hardware-Assisted Blocker for malware), a reconfigurable, hardware-based AV that eliminates the performance overhead imposed by standard AVs and streamlines malicious definitions updates. REHAB is based on low-level features (e.g., branch prediction and cache accesses rates) which are classified using machine-learning (ML) algorithms (SVM, Random Forest and MLP) implemented in FPGA to facilitate components integration. We show that REHAB is a practical, effective solution for malware detection that also addresses concept-drift caused by new malware trends, since we are able to adjust the weights of our hardware-modelled neural network through software updates, and we also support fine-grained settings, such as changing the entire ML classifier in runtime (e.g., from Random Forest to MLP).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ReCoSoC48741.2019.9034972", "venue": "2019 14th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)", "journal": "2019 14th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011884707", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15223845", "6330737", "4938419", "207165665", "89141", "59619041", "206787478", "28004197", "570653", "58453392", "19992265", "116865216", "18046216", "19437868", "13458398", "15390190", "20511466", "16154185", "11875496", "62328639", "207248035", "16036744", "1458036"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209380456"}

The prediction models are developed based on five years of observed data of five different parameters such as solar radiation, temperature, wind speed, humidity and weekday index. Weekday index is an important parameter introduced to differentiate between working and non-working days. First four years data is used for training the models and to obtain prediction data for fifth year. Finally, the predicted electricity consumption of all models is compared with actual consumption of fifth year.

Slump-flow, T 50 and V-funnel tests were carried out on fresh SCCs. The hardened properties of SCCs included compressive strength, flexural strength, tensile strength, water absorption and electrical resistivity were studied. Moreover, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was employed in order to investigate the microstructure of the cement matrix. Results revealed that NC had a significant influence on compressive strength, water absorption and electrical resistivity of SCCs. The replacement of cement with a combination of 3% NC and 0.3% PP fibre gave better mechanical and durability performances than the other samples. However, the compressive strength reduced slightly when PP fibres were added to the concrete. SEM images illustrated that NC refined the pores of cement matrix and thus resulting in low permeability. Also, it is evident from the SEM images that PP fibres would improve the properties of SCCs by bridging across the cracks. Apparently, the inclusion of 3% NC and 0.3% PP can be considered as an appropriate combination regarding the fresh and hardened properties of concrete. Furthermore, three support vector machine (SVM) approaches were used to predict the compressive strength based on the mix proportions. The results demonstrated that the Wavelet Weighted Least Square SVM (WWLSSVM) and Least Square SVM (LSSVM) models gave more accurate prediction than standard Support Vector Machine (SVM).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.03.124", "venue": null, "journal": "Construction and Building Materials", "mag_id": "2601120221", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["139721187", "115748757", "115996704", "189819495", "62788467", "208321436", "9230073", "104294991", "11705598", "209006339"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:136059291"}

Travel patterns are classified as direct, pacing, lapping, or random according to MS model. MS travel pattern is highly related with person's cognitive state, thus can be used to detect early stage of dementia. The dataset was collected by monitoring a cognitively normal elderly resident by wireless passive infrared sensors for 21 months. First, over 70000 travel episodes are extracted from the dataset and classified by MS travel pattern classifier algorithm for the ground truth. Later, 12000 episodes (3000 for each pattern) were randomly selected from the total episodes to compose training and testing dataset. Finally, DCNN performance was compared with three other classical machine-learning classifiers. The Random Forest and DCNN yielded the best classification accuracies of 94.48% and 97.84%, respectively.

We attempt to find a way to learn network representation while keeping the network structure and relations between nodes to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a Community Aware and Relational Attention (CARA) method to enhance network representation learning. In CARA, community aware random walks capture both the community and local context from a global perspective to enhance the structure embedding. And we design a two-layer attention mechanism to model the semantic relationships between nodes, which can learn different text embedding for different neighbors.

Our results indicate that TL can greatly accelerate DRL when transferring knowledge from similar tasks, and that the similarity between tasks plays a key role in the success or failure of knowledge transfer.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BRACIS.2016.027", "venue": "2016 5th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS)", "journal": "2016 5th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2585821313", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3074096", "61032464", "57464058", "6023746", "7018530", "205242740", "740063", "17216004", "21204149", "53142749", "208910339", "6921329", "8696662", "6208256", "16326763", "8577212", "13022595", "15788905", "10023228", "2838895", "8241258", "209841442", "6628106", "632032", "9681429"], "inbound_citations": ["29153890", "195818252", "57763180", "211532384", "195775435", "58008049", "208910815", "211832917", "51874019", "21717568", "195820607", "197463211"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16739506"}

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications.

A context-aware random forest is designed for the automatic multi-class segmentation of MS lesions, low grade and high grade gliomas in MR images. It uses multi-channel MRIs, prior knowledge on tissue classes, symmetrical and long-range spatial context to discriminate lesions from background. Then, we investigate the promising perspective of estimating the brain tumor cell density from MRIs. A generative-discriminative framework is presented to learn the latent and clinically unavailable tumor cell density from model-based estimations associated with synthetic MRIs. The generative model is a validated and publicly available biophysiological tumor growth simulator. The discriminative model builds on multi-variate regression random forests to estimate the voxel-wise distribution of tumor cell density from input MRIs.

Hence, in order to operate an EV in a reliable and desired manner, neurofuzzy controllers (NFCs) are proposed, implemented and examined. The latter can deal with uncertain environments, due to their capabilities in learning, adaptation and fault tolerance by incorporating a properly adapted expert knowledge. However, in the paper, the cumbersome task of proving stability of the NFC driven electromechanical system is provided by slightly modifying the adaptation dynamics needed for the learning procedure. This is the main theoretical contribution presented by this work, since it makes possible to ensure input-to-state stability for the entire system and convergence of the system states to the desired equilibrium.

This paper presents an Elitism-based Multi-objective Differential Evolution algorithm for FS and the novelty lies in the searching process which uses Minkowski Score (MS) and simultaneously optimises three objectives. The MS is considered as the third objective to keep track of the feature subset which is capable enough to produce a good classification result even if the average accuracy is poor.

Recently, deep learning becomes a research hotspot in many application areas, including the SHM domain. Their performance largely relies on the quality and quantity of the training data, obtained either experimentally or numerically. Due to the time and expense restraints, field or laboratory test data are normally limited by the variation of structural conditions, while the quality of numerical simulation data is subjective to experts' modelling skills. Therefore, the actual performance of deep learning algorithms with limited training data needs to be studied, and the alternative ways to generate more training data need to be developed. In this work, we develop a new one-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) for structural condition identification. A laboratory case study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. A steel Warren truss bridge structure is constructed and instrumented with accelerometers and impact hammer. The vibration tests under seven different scenarios are conducted, and each scenario has five repeated test data. The algorithm is trained with different quantities of training data (from one test data to four test data for each scenario). The results show that condition identification results become reliable with at least three repeated test data. To overcome the challenge of limited monitoring data, we propose the potential application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate more reliable training data.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1680/icsic.64669.421", "venue": "International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019 (ICSIC)", "journal": "International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019 (ICSIC)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962242947", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["117654304", "21206286", "206190760", "60745434", "207763512", "116824604", "515925", "62608418", "108586521"], "inbound_citations": ["202723058"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199006465"}

A two-fingered compliant, underactuated robot hand is controlled in an open-loop fashion to grasp objects with various shapes, sizes and stiffness.

Indeed, many of them directly compute feature maps. However, the kernel trick is employed when the number of features is very large or the individual vertices of graphs are annotated by real-valued attributes. ::: Can we still compute explicit feature maps efficiently under these circumstances?

This article proposes a hybrid approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and twin support vector regression (TSVR) for forecasting wind speed (PSO-TSVR). To enhance the forecasting accuracy, TSVR was utilized to forecast the wind speed, and the optimal settings of TSVR parameters were optimized by PSO carefully. Moreover, to estimate the performance of the suggested approach, three wind speed benchmark data of OpenEI were used as a case study.

Rather than reliance on heuristics, human oversight and expert training from images is incorporated into logistic regression models. The latter serve to estimate the prob- ability of tissue class assignment for each voxel as well as the probability of tissue boundary occurring between neighboring voxels given the multi-modal image intensities. The regression models provide parameters for a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework that defines an energy function with the regional and boundary probabilistic terms. Using this CRF, a max-flow/min-cut algorithm is used to segment other slices in the 3D image set automatically with options of addition user input. We apply this approach to segment visible tumors in multi-modal medical volumetric images. I. INTRODUCTION A key requirement in high-precision radiotherapy is the accurate spatial delineation of the tumor and the critical normal organs abutting it. For this purpose, it is crucial to use images from multiple modalities. Computed tomography (CT) images provide high resolution images of both soft tissues and bony structures. Relative to CT, magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) provides improved soft tissue contrast in many anatomical sites. Positron emission tomography (PET) reveals functional data, though with much poorer resolution than CT or MRI. Figure 1(a) shows images from these modalities for the same patient. The complementary information provided by these images is heavily relied upon by the radiation oncologists in defining the tumor volume and designing an optimized treatment plan. However, there are challenges in how to combine these images in treatment planning. For example, it is well known that large variability exists in target-delineation by different doctors using a single modality image (4). In addition, it has been reported (22) that significantly different tumor volumes can be delineated by the same observer on images from different modalities. Given the above, it would be desirable to develop a computer-aided multiple modality image segmentation tool that incorporates both expert-user- input and machine-learning capabilities.

The Skin-Similar space often contains many non-skin pixels due to the inevitable overlap in the color space between skin pixels and some non-skin pixels under the generic skin-model. The objective of the second step is to reduce the false-positive rate by analyzing the image under consideration. Specifically, in the second step, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), specific to the image under consideration and refined from its Skin-Similar space, is derived using the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We then use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify the skin Gaussian from the trained GMM by incorporating spatial and shape information of the skin pixels.

We show that Support Vector Regression (SVR) with a chiral graph kernel is useful for target property prediction by demonstrating its application to a set of human vitamin D receptor ligands currently under consideration for their potential anti-cancer effects.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21155020", "doi": "10.1142/S0219720010005117", "venue": "Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology", "journal": "Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2035366345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5070789", "28803371", "5943581", "18294831", "60781648", "201219547", "25816378", "108024507", "7205882", "5192724", "86018148", "7918725", "35730151"], "inbound_citations": ["8579891", "170559", "28609472", "18471159", "126090339", "17649027", "125349554", "3077601", "14232496", "24941478", "16249357", "19370206", "9485016"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6179235"}

This paper proposes a real-time hand motion estimation method using the EMG signals with the SVMs. This method consists of two phases for the hand motion estimation. The first phase is the hand motion classification of EMG signal patterns with the SVMs. In addition to amplitude features in the EMG signals, cepstrum coefficients are extracted as frequency features for robust classification. The second phase is the estimation of operator's joint angles. The joint angles are estimated from EMG signals based on simple linear models between the joint angles and the EMG signals. These two phases are designed so that they can be processed in real-time.

The problem of the existing mitigation approaches is that they are model-oriented in the sense that they focus on tuning the training algorithms to produce fair results, while overlooking the fact that the training data can itself be the main reason for biased outcomes. Technically speaking, two essential limitations can be found in such model-based approaches: 1) the mitigation cannot be achieved without degrading the accuracy of the machine learning models, and 2) when the data used for training are largely biased, the training time automatically increases so as to find suitable learning parameters that help produce fair results. To address these shortcomings, we propose in this work a new framework that can largely mitigate the biases and discriminations in machine learning systems while at the same time enhancing the prediction accuracy of these systems. The proposed framework is based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), which are used to generate new synthetic fair data with selective properties from the original data. We also propose a framework for analyzing data biases, which is important for understanding the amount and type of data that need to be synthetically sampled and labeled for each population group.

With the vast use of social media and internet applications such as e-commerce, e-tourism and e-government, numerous comments and opinions are broadcasted per day, thus an automatic way of analyzing them is of great importance. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis for Greek texts, obtained from Web 2.0 platforms. Greek is a language that lacks an in-depth availability of natural language processing tools in the sense that most of them are not publicly available. The novelty of the article is that instead of utilizing preprocessing tools such as Part-of-Speech taggers, text stemmers and polar-word lexica, it incorporates the translation of the Greek token as provided by the Google Translator\u00ae API. Since automatic translation of Greek sentences often results in poor translations where the meaning of the original sentence is severely deteriorated, the translation of each token individually is almost 100 % correct. However, taking the translation of every Greek token poses a significant issue to the outcome of the classification process for practically any classifier, therefore, we introduce the use of a powerful ensemble algorithm that is highly customizable to the particular needs of the application, such as being learned with respect to different loss functions and thus dealing with a large number of dimensions.

We define the vector\u2019s climatic niche and explore future projections under climate change scenarios. Vector occurrence records were compiled from the literature, museum collections and Brazilian Health Departments. Six bioclimatic variables were used as predictors in six ecological niche model algorithms (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MaxEnt, GARP, logistic regression and Random Forest). Projections for 2050 used 17 general circulation models in two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways: \u201cstabilization\u201d and \u201chigh increase\u201d. Ensemble models and consensus maps were produced by overlapping binary predictions. Final model outputs showed good performance and significance. The use of species absence data substantially improved model performance. Currently, L. flaviscutellata is widely distributed in the Amazon region, with records in the Atlantic Forest and savannah regions of Central Brazil. Future projections indicate expansion of the climatically suitable area for the vector in both scenarios, towards higher latitudes and elevations. L. flaviscutellata is likely to find increasingly suitable conditions for its expansion into areas where human population size and density are much larger than they are in its current locations.

A nonsubsampled contourlet transform is used to extract features before classification with its characteristics of multiscale, multidirection, and less dimension of feature vectors. An adaptive particle swam optimization (APSO) algorithm is developed to search the optimal parameters of penalty coefficient and kernel function of SVM and is helpful to escape from the local minimum by its strong ability of global search. A varied step-length pattern search algorithm is explored to optimize the global point in every iteration of the APSO algorithm by its good performance in local search. These two algorithms are combined with their relative merits to find the optimal parameters for building an adaptive SVM classifier. The results of case studies show that the proposed adaptive SVM-based classification system can achieve a relatively high classification accuracy in the field of workpiece surface classification.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIM.2015.2418684", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1577151368", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["126341951", "123124094", "41432397", "128322202", "11385847", "110016661", "109099530", "39256719", "137250388", "111283702", "120980092", "123105099", "110335757", "111269408", "2949601", "7467043", "42371871", "25846516", "11843386", "63011059", "7138354", "108687772", "34843031", "121458701", "14727192", "62602656", "110628338", "5543127", "18279779", "15790005", "5628229", "32483328", "22092340", "17401198", "9786963", "111227904", "63656432", "16708577", "28663487", "16806403", "12408024", "15711881", "206812063", "9791192", "10905054", "18232246", "28927607", "961425", "207738357", "206420153", "77139", "6644398", "4583977", "2161592", "59804194", "119830127"], "inbound_citations": ["199004865", "114715205", "153314383", "125280620", "3762981", "24269126", "51613286", "61020787"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26306199"}

Recently, GANs have been used to emulate complex physical systems such as turbulent flows. However, a critical question must be answered before GANs can be considered trusted emulators for physical systems: do GANs-generated samples conform to the various physical constraints? These include both deterministic constraints (e.g., conservation laws) and statistical constraints (e.g., energy spectrum in turbulent flows). The latter has been studied in a companion paper (Wu et al. 2019. Enforcing statistical constraints in generative adversarial networks for modeling chaotic dynamical systems. arXiv:1905.06841). In the present work, we enforce deterministic yet approximate constraints on GANs by incorporating them into the loss function of the generator. We evaluate the performance of physics-constrained GANs on two representative tasks with geometrical constraints (generating points on circles) and differential constraints (generating divergence-free flow velocity fields), respectively. In both cases, the constrained GANs produced samples that precisely conform to the underlying constraints, even though the constraints are only enforced approximately. More importantly, the imposed constraints significantly accelerate the convergence and improve the robustness in the training. These improvements are noteworthy, as the convergence and robustness are two well-known obstacles in the training of GANs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.06671", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Computational Physics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2986766880", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["207763512", "3074096", "60809283", "73687397", "119085443", "125898515", "71716086", "120582610", "123201180", "54509330", "1594001", "214988206", "54559221", "126213877", "59336404", "38319575", "57379996", "52111124", "73661448", "53368962", "60565534", "16948741", "11403417", "125400993", "199442114", "4084956", "22046807", "53248119", "11758569", "107645", "10894094", "155100272", "12803511", "3425282", "5707386", "16489696", "53013250", "117827243"], "inbound_citations": ["212657607"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208076762"}

However, the full generative power of cascade-correlation was not found to be a necessary component for successfully modelling the development of seriation abilities. Analysis of network weights indicates that improvements in seriation are due to continuous small changes instead of the radical restructuring suggested by Piaget. The model suggests that seriation skills are present early in development and increase in precision during later development.

Based on this condition, this research attempts to use the messages of twitter to review a movie by using opinion mining or sentiment analysis. Opinion mining refers to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text mining to identify or classify whether the movie is good or not based on message opinion. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is supervised learning methods that analyze data and recognize the patterns that are used for classification. This research concerns on binary classification which is classified into two classes. Those classes are positive and negative. The positive class shows good message opinion; otherwise the negative class shows the bad message opinion of certain movies. This justification is based on the accuracy level of SVM with the validation process uses 10-Fold cross validation and confusion matrix. The hybrid Partical Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to improve the election of best parameter in order to solve the dual optimization problem.

The hypothesis of this research is that drawing failure is not a random event but can be predicted using a suitable approach. Machine Learning classification and clustering algorithms have been implemented to predict the probability of failure during drawing and to optimize the manufacturing conditions to reduce the failure rate. The following algorithms have been employed for classification: K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks. The reduced value of the rejection rate implies that classification must be carried out on an imbalanced dataset. For this reason, resampling methods (undersampling, oversampling and SMOTE) and specific scores for imbalanced datasets were used. It was possible to obtain a qualified Random Forest classifier which provided satisfactory scores (ROC AUC of 0.824 and an average precision of 0.604 in the test dataset). This tool allows the heats with a higher probability of undergoing any breakage during drawing to be detected, thus improving the final quality of the product. K-means clustering (K = 4) has been successfully used in this study to identify those manufacturing conditions that minimize the number of breakages during drawing. The results of the clustering analysis show that the rate of heats undergoing failure may be reduced by a factor of 2.5.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942957", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2975951617", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["107013559", "111134201", "137975409", "136989826", "137640918", "137036223", "39683095", "117662343", "181915308", "137253692", "135550934", "139135826", "135839800", "135943575", "70105230", "19141643", "55766630", "110286362", "121518585", "131777930", "1250529", "53246261", "8501064", "60266817", "53224143", "207159665", "14972567", "3769315", "45718317", "211231768"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204092883"}

In this paper, we use binary generative adversarial networks (BGAN) to embed images to binary codes in an unsupervised way. By restricting the input noise variable of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to be binary and conditioned on the features of each input image, BGAN can simultaneously learn a binary representation per image, and generate an image plausibly similar to the original one. In the proposed framework, we address two main problems: 1) how to directly generate binary codes without relaxation? 2) how to equip the binary representation with the ability of accurate image retrieval? We resolve these problems by proposing new sign-activation strategy and a loss function steering the learning process, which consists of new models for adversarial loss, a content loss, and a neighborhood structure loss.

The main tasks tackled by this work include built-up area identification, settlement type classification and urban structure types pattern recognition. Besides commonly used accuracy assessments of the resulting map products, thorough performance evaluations are carried out under varying conditions to tune algorithm parameters and assess their applicability for the given tasks. As part of this, several research questions are being addressed. In particular the influence of the improved spatial and spectral resolution of Landsat-8 on the SVM performance to identify built-up areas and urban structure types are evaluated. Also the influence of an extended feature space including digital elevation model features is tested for mountainous regions. Moreover, the spatial distribution of classification uncertainties is analyzed and compared to the heterogeneity of the building stock within the computational unit of the segments. The study concludes that the information content of Landsat-8 images is sufficient for the tested classification tasks and even detailed urban structures could be extracted with satisfying accuracy. Freely available ancillary settlement point location data could further improve the built-up area classification. Digital elevation features and pan-sharpening could, however, not significantly improve the classification results. The study highlights the importance of dynamically tuned classifier parameters, and underlines the use of Shannon entropy computed from the soft answers of the SVM as a valid measure of the spatial distribution of classification uncertainties.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.06.010", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2474240800", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211210249", "51965476", "1416765"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123753835"}

Thus there are many variations to help HIP. Text-based CAPTCHA is the most common method, where each user is asked to discern the hidden characters in noisy-images. Many image-based HIP were recently proposed and tested to overcome the weakness of text-based HIP. Though the image-based HIP problem is harder to solve compared to a conventional text-based puzzle, some powerful machine learning tools, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), can easily break this problem. The authors have previously developed an image orientation-based CAPTCHA problem with polygonally cropped sub-images. In this paper, we address the more fundamental issue: what is the most important feature for a human to recognize the correct orientation of a partial image. We insist that the box-counting measure for an arbitrary polygon, which was already been devised to measure fractal objects, is a successful metric to measure the human perception of partial image orientation. This means that it is - easy for human to get the orientation of the high-box counted polygonal sub-image, but very hard for any machine learning tool due to the partialness of subject images. We also insist that a special polygon which has a high box-counting value, is a fractal shape, so an effective partial image for HIP is an empirically random fractal polygon.

In this paper we propound the TRIO algorithm for the online detection of signal drifts: the underlying idea is that a real signal may be categorized as correct or drifting by comparison with added sets of artificial signals known to be correct or drifted. More specifically, the TRIO algorithm is based on three performers, namely (i) a training set of artificial signals, (ii) the Text Categorization (TC) technique and (iii) the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. Initially, we construct an artificial training set constituted by one \u201ccorrect\u201d set of signals, embraced by two \u201csuspect\u201d sets of signals, the suspect-up and the suspect-down drifting signals. These signals are transformed in points within the signal space by the TC technique; then the SVM technique is applied for isolating the regions occupied by the suspect-up and by the suspect-down points. At this point the \u201cartificial context\u201d has been established and the real measurements come in. By resorting to the sliding window technique, at each epoch the actually measured data segment is analogously transformed into a point within the signal space and then declared correct or suspect (drifted) according to the region where it falls. In the latter case suitable actions must be taken by the plant operators.

Yet, modelling tick dynamics remains challenging because of the lack of data and knowledge on this complex phenomenon. Here we present an approach to model and map tick dynamics using volunteered data. This approach is illustrated with 9 years of data collected by a group of trained volunteers who sampled active questing ticks (AQT) on a monthly basis and for 15 locations in the Netherlands. We aimed at finding the main environmental drivers of AQT at multiple time-scales, and to devise daily AQT maps at the national level for 2014. ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: Tick dynamics is a complex ecological problem driven by biotic (e.g. pathogens, wildlife, humans) and abiotic (e.g. weather, landscape) factors. We enriched the volunteered AQT collection with six types of weather variables (aggregated at 11 temporal scales), three types of satellite-derived vegetation indices, land cover, and mast years. Then, we applied a feature engineering process to derive a set of 101 features to characterize the conditions that yielded a particular count of AQT on a date and location. To devise models predicting the AQT, we use a time-aware Random Forest regression method, which is suitable to find non-linear relationships in complex ecological problems, and provides an estimation of the most important features to predict the AQT. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We trained a model capable of fitting AQT with reduced statistical metrics. The multi-temporal study on the feature importance indicates that variables linked to water levels in the atmosphere (i.e. evapotranspiration, relative humidity) consistently showed a higher explanatory power than previous works using temperature. As a product of this study, we are able of mapping daily tick dynamics at the national level. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: This study paves the way towards the design of new applications in the fields of environmental research, nature management, and public health. It also illustrates how Citizen Science initiatives produce geospatial data collections that can support scientific analysis, thus enabling the monitoring of complex environmental phenomena.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5686904", "pubmed_id": "29137670", "doi": "10.1186/s12942-017-0114-8", "venue": "International Journal of Health Geographics", "journal": "International Journal of Health Geographics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768197086", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["78947391", "22345567", "87800", "19515263", "2903057", "89141", "207738357", "4796939", "215672506", "6296789", "23698030", "28912845", "23770733", "26465802", "205221807", "17390304", "30405656", "28038692", "206420153", "22176152", "12778239", "28205531", "18864341", "11259771", "21055630", "83306208", "117402277", "14025447", "24320120", "44934836", "19205511", "2226752", "25867534", "6336016", "206736480", "205999159", "53500578", "9064958", "44961283", "88316282", "22137354", "34887991", "54644220", "24396959"], "inbound_citations": ["209317235", "3647258", "85493794", "53015317", "147705353", "182941852"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6890650"}

Semantic maps augment metric-topological maps with meta-information, i.e. l semantic knowledge aimed at the planning and execution of high-level robotic tasks. Semantic knowledge typically encodes human-like concepts, like types of objects and rooms, which are connected to sensory data when symbolic representations of percepts from the robot workspace are grounded to those concepts. Such a symbol grounding is usually carried out by algorithms that individually categorize each symbol and provide a crispy outcome a symbol is either a member of a category or not. Such approach is valid for a variety of tasks, but it fails at: (i) dealing with the uncertainty inherent to the grounding process, and (ii) jointly exploiting the contextual relations among concepts (e.g. microwaves are usually in kitchens). This work provides a solution for probabilistic symbol grounding that overcomes these limitations. Concretely, we rely on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to model and exploit contextual relations, and to provide measurements about the uncertainty coming from the possible groundings in the form of beliefs (e.g. an object can be categorized (grounded) as a microwave or as a nightstand with beliefs 0.6 and 0.4, respectively). Our solution is integrated into a novel semantic map representation called Multiversal Semantic Map (MvSmap), which keeps the sets of different groundings, or universes, as instances of ontologies annotated with the obtained beliefs for their posterior exploitation.

This hybrid model presents an efficient and effective short term solar irradiation prediction approach using the historical solar irradiation data. The original non-stationary time series data is decomposed into various modes using VMD approach. The proposed VMD-RMWK (VMD based reduced Morlet Wavelet Kernel extreme learning machine) method is used to predict the solar irradiation of an experimental 1 MW solar power plant in Odisha, India. Different time intervals of 15 min, 1 h and 1 day ahead in different weather conditions are considered for forecasting purpose. The VMD technique decomposes the original nonlinear irradiation into a set of Variational Mode Functions (VMFs), and the extracted VMFs are used to train the kernel based robust ELM. Comparison with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based low rank kernel is also presented in this paper. As a new contribution to the previously performed literature survey this paper presents a more accurate solar irradiation prediction paradigm for distinctive weather conditions, and different time intervals varying from very short duration of 15 min to one day ahead. Also to improve the reliability of the KELM and to make it robust under noisy conditions and the presence of outliers in the data, a weight loss matrix has been derived using a non-parametric kernel density estimation method and incorporated in the new formulation (RKELM).

The techniques were used, for instance, in a connectionist system (Composit/SYLL) that implements Johnson-Laird's mental-model theory of human syllogistic reasoning. this theory was chosen as a case study for verifying the power of the techniques, because it was developed independently of the project, contains complex symbolic structures of various types, and requires complex sequences of operations. The resulting connectionist system is probably the most advanced, complex, and complete connectionist rule-based system in existence. It has a more complete scheme for binding rule-variables and for role binding than any other connectionist system. The representational techniques developed in the project were Relative-Position encoding (RPE) and Pattern-Similarity Association (PSA). Rpe allows structure to be encoded by the relative positioning of connectionist activation patterns within a subnetwork. PSA allows structure to be encoded by having different substructures include similar activation subpatterns. These techniques are similar to data structuring techniques used in computer memory (in particular, PSA is similar to associative addressing), but they had not previously been used in any non-trivial way in connectionism.

Accordingly, the use of active learning (AL) to reduce annotation costs has recently generated considerable interest. The intuition behind AL is that giving the learner the ability to control what data is labeled will yield higher-performing models with less annotation effort. ::: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a method for learning linear classifiers that have worked well for many applications since their introduction and are now in widespread use. Accordingly, AL with SVMs (AL-SVM) is an important area to investigate. In addition to interest in AL-SVM, there has also been considerable interest in dealing effectively with the class imbalance that exists for many applications of machine learning. Class imbalance in the case of binary classification where the target examples are a small proportion of the total number of examples is considered in this dissertation. It\u2019s known from the passive learning literature that SVMs are susceptible to underperforming when there is class imbalance and that methods for addressing class imbalance can signficantly improve performance. ::: However, addressing imbalance during AL has received relatively little attention. One part of this dissertation explores how to effectively address class imbalance during AL-SVM. A main theme is that the process of AL creates training data that has markedly different characteristics than training data created through passive annotation and that modifying the base inference procedure used during AL to take into account the different characteristics of the actively sampled data can lead to more successful active learning. This theme will be explored in detail for the important case of AL-SVM for imbalanced datasets. Experimental results across a range of Information Extraction, Text Classification, and Named Entity Classification tasks show that the new methods, which take into account the skewed data created by the AL scenario, outperform methods which do not take into account the data skew created by the AL scenario. ::: In order to realize the performance gains enabled by AL, an effective method for stopping the process is critical. Stopping too early results in a lower-performing model and stopping too late results in waste of annotation effort. The second part of this dissertation presents a new stopping method based on detecting model stabilization in terms of predictions on data that does not have to be labeled.

Detection and diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) is done noninvasively in the clinical environment through the evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECGs). Early research into automated methods for the detection of AFIB in ECG signals focused on traditional bio-medical signal analysis to extract important features for use in statistical classification models. Artificial intelligence models have more recently been used that employ convolutional and/or recurrent network architectures. In this work, significant time and frequency domain characteristics of the ECG signal are extracted by applying the short-time Fourier trans-form and then visually representing the information in a spectrogram. Two different classification approaches were investigated that utilized deep features in the spectrograms construct-ed from ECG segments. The first approach used a pretrained DenseNet model to extract features that were then classified using Support Vector Machines, and the second approach used the spectrograms as direct input into a convolutional network. Both approaches were evaluated against the MIT-BIH AFIB dataset, where the convolutional network approach achieved a classification accuracy of 93.16%.

In this paper, two-stage weighted regularized ELM is proposed to address the aforementioned issue. The original regularized ELM (RELM) was proposed to handle adverse effects of outliers but not target the imbalanced learning problem. So we proposed a new weighted regularized ELM (WRELM) for class imbalance learning (CIL) in the first stage. Different from the existing weighted ELM which only considers the class distribution of datasets, the proposed algorithm also puts more focus on hard, misclassified samples in the second stage. The focal loss function is adopted to update weight by decreasing the weight of well-classified samples to focus more attention on the error of difficult samples. The final decision target is determined by the winner-take-all method. We assess the proposed method on 25 binary datasets and 10 multiclass datasets by 5-folder cross validations.

To date, several computational methods for the prediction of protein interfaces have been developed, but the interface prediction problem is still not fully understood. Experimental evidence suggests that the location of binding sites is imprinted in the protein structure, but there are major differences among the interfaces of the various protein types: the characterising properties can vary a lot depending on the interaction type and function. The selection of an optimal set of features characterising the protein interface and the development of an effective method to represent and capture the complex protein recognition patterns are of paramount importance for this task.ResultsIn this work we investigate the potential of a novel local surface descriptor based on 3D Zernike moments for the interface prediction task. Descriptors invariant to roto-translations are extracted from circular patches of the protein surface enriched with physico-chemical properties from the HQI8 amino acid index set, and are used as samples for a binary classification problem. Support Vector Machines are used as a classifier to distinguish interface local surface patches from non-interface ones. The proposed method was validated on 16 classes of proteins extracted from the Protein\u2013Protein Docking Benchmark 5.0 and compared to other state-of-the-art protein interface predictors (SPPIDER, PrISE and NPS-HomPPI).ConclusionsThe 3D Zernike descriptors are able to capture the similarity among patterns of physico-chemical and biochemical properties mapped on the protein surface arising from the various spatial arrangements of the underlying residues, and their usage can be easily extended to other sets of amino acid properties. The results suggest that the choice of a proper set of features characterising the protein interface is crucial for the interface prediction task, and that optimality strongly depends on the class of proteins whose interface we want to characterise. We postulate that different protein classes should be treated separately and that it is necessary to identify an optimal set of features for each protein class.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5802066", "pubmed_id": "29409446", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-018-2043-3", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2791988510", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["18053393", "10640288", "8012797", "13795898", "3328752", "217320", "14036247", "1632524", "23775598", "28185107", "41590996", "3591446", "3394089", "4374874", "16419560", "3659720", "215448140", "13130510", "5697364", "5822023", "26641893", "14166525", "2113859", "20145406", "2616817", "205231018", "31975470", "8968443", "2648459", "20241499", "16645245", "18811954", "18529202", "25849315", "321231", "9040595", "38995127", "87507571", "16221397", "4702463", "84259583", "37989414", "40816547", "5375003", "6178216", "29736676", "14129101", "14056380", "611711", "18946808", "23234370", "4816280", "10038264", "2620990", "569209", "2000042", "18811693", "15448872", "14002504", "18234287", "40653294", "5411707", "12272299", "18861862", "5976513", "8096579", "53530198", "45259121", "14468931", "11459724", "29305902", "16947591", "15999565", "1193391", "12947945", "2581408", "352195", "17223227", "8307002", "18304930", "207165665", "52874011", "6636078", "10659969", "20311208", "14864309", "206340350", "1818957", "15700257", "207193045", "613485", "7133418", "10237910", "26404821", "5855716", "1957428", "43863133", "43032785", "17446481"], "inbound_citations": ["53245849", "210930055", "56479908", "58820653"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3317316"}

Potential errors are compiled in a hierarchical, versatile and parameter-izable taxonomy. This allows for the first time to disentangle fidelity and modeling errors, whatever the level of details of the modeled buildings. The quality of models is predicted using the geometric properties of buildings and, when available, image and depth data. A baseline of handcrafted, yet generic features, is fed to a Random Forest classifier. Both multi-class and multi-label cases are considered.

Various recommendation systems are developed to make recommendations by mining useful knowledge from massive data. The big data is often multi-source and heterogeneous, which challenges the recommendation seriously. Collaborative filtering is the widely used recommendation method, but the data sparseness is its major bottleneck. Transfer learning can overcome this problem by transferring the learned knowledge from the auxiliary data to the target data for cross-domain recommendation. Many traditional transfer learning models for cross-domain collaborative recommendation assume that multiple domains share a latent common rating pattern which may lead to the negative transfer, and only apply to the homogeneous feedbacks. To address such problems, we propose a new transfer learning model. We do the collective factorization to rating matrices of the target data and its auxiliary data to transfer the rating information among heterogeneous feedbacks, and get the initial latent factors of users and items, based on which we construct the similarity graphs. Further, we predict the missing ratings by the twin bridge transfer learning of latent factors and similarity graphs.

For that reason the feature selection step is crucial in high dimension data classification problem.

To create the viewport, 3D points on the sphere are projected to the 2D plane usually with a perspective projection. This process leads to geometric distortions in the viewport, such as objects that appear stretched or image structures that are bent. This paper proposes a content-dependent objective quality assessment procedure to evaluate line distortions that occur during the viewport creation process, to identify which projection center minimizes the subjective impact of these distortions. To achieve this objective, features that characterize the amount of line distortion in the viewport image are extracted and used by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to obtain the viewport quality. To train the classifier, a subjective evaluation of rendered viewport images was conducted to obtain the perceptual scores for different types of content and projection centers.

We present a novel workflow for a high-resolution derivation of LCZs using multi-temporal Sentinel 2 (S2) composites and supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We assume that CNNs, due to their potential invariance to size and illumination of objects, are best suited to predict the highly context-based LCZs on a large scale. As a first step, the proposed workflow includes a fully automated generation of cloud-free S2 composites. These composites serve as training data basis for the LCZ classifications carried out over eight German cities. Results show that by using a CNN, overall accuracies can be increased by an average of 16.5 and 4.8 percentage points when compared to a pixel-based and a texture-based Random Forest approach, respectively. If sufficient training data is available, CNN models proved to be robust in classifying unknown cities and achieved overall accuracies of up to 86.5 % .

Under a natural model of repeated transactions, the probability that two agents can successfully transact in a credit network (i.e. the liquidity between these two agents) is the same as the probability that they are connected to each other in a uniformly random forest of the network. ::: ::: Motivated by this connection, we define the RF-connectivity between a pair of nodes in a graph G as the probability that the two nodes belong to the same connected component in a uniformly random forest of G. Our first result is that for an arbitrary subset S of nodes in G, the average RF-connectivity between pairs of nodes in S is at least 1 \u2212 2/h(GS), where h(GS) is the edge expansion of the subgraph GS induced by S. Informally, this implies that a well-connected \"community\" of nodes S in a credit network will have high liquidity among themselves, regardless of the structure of the remaining network. We extend this result to show that in fact every node in S has good average RF-connectivity to other nodes in S whenever S has good edge expansion. We also show that our results are nearly tight by proving an upper bound on the liquidity of regular graphs. ::: ::: For our motivating application, it is important that we relate the average RF-connectivity in S to the expansion inside S and not merely to expansion of G since we would like to assert that a well-connected community has high liquidity even if the graph as a whole is not well-connected. This naturally leads to a monotonicity conjecture: the RF-connectivity of two nodes can not decrease when a new edge is added to G.

In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis\"$P = Q$\"is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level. As we will show, such Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ. The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST. First, we analyze their main theoretical properties. Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives.

FAEs have gained importance in biofuel, medicine and food industries due to their capability of acting on a large range of substrates for cleaving ester bonds and synthesizing high-added value molecules through esterification and transesterification reactions. During the past two decades extensive studies have been carried out on the production and partial characterization of FAEs from fungi, while much less is known about FAEs of bacterial or plant origin. Initial classification studies on FAEs were restricted on sequence similarity and substrate specificity on just four model substrates and considered only a handful of FAEs belonging to the fungal kingdom. This study centers on the descriptor-based classification and structural analysis of experimentally verified and putative FAEs; nevertheless, the framework presented here is applicable to every poorly characterized enzyme family. 365 FAE-related sequences of fungal, bacterial and plantae origin were collected and they were clustered using Self Organizing Maps followed by k-means clustering into distinct groups based on amino acid composition and physico-chemical composition descriptors derived from the respective amino acid sequence. A Support Vector Machine model was subsequently constructed for the classification of new FAEs into the pre-assigned clusters. The model successfully recognized 98.2% of the training sequences and all the sequences of the blind test.

However, climate factors can be unreliable and can lower the effectiveness of prediction when they are applied in locations where climate factors do not differ significantly. The purpose of this study was to improve a dengue surveillance system in areas with similar climate by exploiting the infection rate in the Aedes aegypti mosquito and using the support vector machine (SVM) technique for forecasting the dengue morbidity rate. ::: ::: ::: METHODS AND FINDINGS ::: Areas with high incidence of dengue outbreaks in central Thailand were studied. The proposed framework consisted of the following three major parts: 1) data integration, 2) model construction, and 3) model evaluation. We discovered that the Ae. aegypti female and larvae mosquito infection rates were significantly positively associated with the morbidity rate. Thus, the increasing infection rate of female mosquitoes and larvae led to a higher number of dengue cases, and the prediction performance increased when those predictors were integrated into a predictive model. In this research, we applied the SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to forecast the high morbidity rate and take precautions to prevent the development of pervasive dengue epidemics. The experimental results showed that the introduced parameters significantly increased the prediction accuracy to 88.37% when used on the test set data, and these parameters led to the highest performance compared to state-of-the-art forecasting models. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The infection rates of the Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes and larvae improved the morbidity rate forecasting efficiency better than the climate parameters used in classical frameworks. We demonstrated that the SVM-R-based model has high generalization performance and obtained the highest prediction performance compared to classical models as measured by the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and mean absolute error (MAE).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4427447", "pubmed_id": "25961289", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0125049", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "854922782", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5372736", "16709538", "19024384", "8319141", "5519303", "55940258", "1872549", "13063762", "10439159", "22022898", "22108882", "6559292", "16098589", "20922721", "154502530", "26592844", "38829917", "21087752", "38446053", "44618395", "8319141", "62889650", "2097256", "13247481", "14352314", "9295177", "17562088", "13924933", "7138354", "3177159", "13861754", "18315563", "32041328", "24657268"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13910044"}

Nearest neighbors are first chosen as adjacent nodes for each file node to construct kNN file relation graph. Three file relation graph features are proposed to sample the representative file samples for labeling. Then, Label Propagation algorithm, which propagates the label information from labeled file samples to unlabeled files, is applied to learn the probability that one unknown file is classified as malicious or benign. A batch mode active learning method is employed to reduce the labeling cost and improve the performance of Label Propagation. Comprehensive experiments on real and large scale dataset obtained from an anti-malware company are performed.

Although each view could individually be used, exploiting information from all views together could improve the cluster quality. In this paper a new model Multi-View Kernel Spectral Clustering (MVKSC) is proposed that performs clustering when two or more views are available. This model is formulated as a weighted kernel canonical correlation analysis in a primal-dual optimization setting typical of Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM). The primal model includes, in particular, a coupling term, which enforces the clustering scores corresponding to the different views to align. Because of the out-of-sample extension, this model is easily applied to large-scale datasets. The performance of the proposed model is shown on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as on some large-scale datasets. Experimental comparisons with a number of other methods show that using multiple views improves the clustering results and that the proposed method is competitive with other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy and runtime.

In this paper, we propose a novel Learning To Select framework that selectively applies an appropriate ranking function on a per-query basis. The approach employs a query feature to identify similar training queries for an unseen query. The ranking function which performs the best on this identified training query set is then chosen for the unseen query. In particular, we propose the use of divergence, which measures the extent that a document ranking function alters the scores of an initial ranking of documents for a given query, as a query feature.

EEE has recently been investigated in software development effort estimation (SDEE) in order to improve the estimation accuracy. The overall results suggested that the EEE yield better prediction accuracy than single techniques. On the other hand, feature selection (FS) methods have been used in the area of SDEE for the purpose of reducing the dimensionality of a dataset size by eliminating the irrelevant and redundant features. Thus, the SDEE techniques are trained on a dataset with relevant features which can lead to improving the accuracy of their estimations. This paper aims at investigating the impact of two Filter feature selection methods: Correlation based Feature Selection (CFS) and RReliefF on the estimation accuracy of Heterogeneous (HT) ensembles. Four machine learning techniques (K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Regression, Multilayer Perceptron and Decision Trees) were used as base techniques for the HT ensembles of this study. We evaluate the accuracy of these HT ensembles when their base techniques were trained on datasets preprocessed by the two feature selection methods. The HT ensembles use three combination rules: average, median, and inverse ranked weighted mean. The evaluation was carried out by means of eight unbiased accuracy measures through the leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV) technique over six datasets. The overall results suggest that all the attributes of most datasets used are relevant for building an accurate predictive technique since the ensembles constructed without features selection outperformed in general the ones using features selection.

These disturbances occur due to faults, natural causes, load switching, energizing transformer, starting large motor, as well as utilization of power electronic devices. The key issue is about maintaining the continuous supply of electricity to the end-users without any problem.

The former class of techniques require explicit knowledge of the measurement process which can be unrealistic, and rely on strong analytical regularizers to constrain the solution space, which often do not generalize well. The latter approaches have had remarkable success in part due to deep learning, but require a large collection of source-observation pairs, which can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised technique to solve inverse problems with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using a pre-trained GAN in the space of source signals, we show that one can reliably recover solutions to under determined problems in a `blind' fashion, i.e., without knowledge of the measurement process. We solve this by making successive estimates on the model and the solution in an iterative fashion.

Subjects underwent 3DT1-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor (DT)-MRI and RS-fMRI. CT measures and DT metrics from the main interhemispheric and long associative tracts were obtained. RS fMRI data were analyzed using a model free approach. A Random Forest (RF) approach was applied to explore the role of MRI data in classifying the two syndromes. ::: Results.Compared to controls, each patient group showed a widespread pattern of brain alterations. Compared to bvFTD, EOAD patients showed reduced CT in the bilateral posterior cingulate and inferior parietal gyri, WM damage of the splenium of the corpus callosum, and decreased functional connectivity of the posterior cingulum within the default mode network. Compared to EOAD, bvFTD patients showed reduced CT in the orbitofrontal cortices and temporal pole bilaterally, and WM damage of the corpus callosum, cingulum, superior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi bilaterally. RF analysis revealed that the best predictors of differential diagnosis among MRI measures were the CT values of the inferior/medial parietal cortices and right temporal poles. ::: Conclusions.Multimodal imaging can help understanding differences between early onset dementia phenotypes. The direct comparison among syndromes revealed that EOAD is characterized by a more severe thinning of the posterior brain regions, while WM damage was diffusely greater in bvFTD patients. RF analysis suggests that CT measures may represent a useful tool to distinguish EOAD from bvFTD at individual patient level in clinical practice. ::: Disclosure: Dr. Canu has nothing to disclose.

In this overarching context, breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with multiple underlying molecular etiologies and each subtype displaying diverse clinical outcomes. Disease stratification for breast cancer is, therefore, vital to its effective and individualized clinical care. The support vector machine (SVM) is a rising machine learning approach that offers robust classification of high-dimensional big data into small numbers of data points (support vectors), achieving differentiation of subgroups in a short amount of time. Considering the rapid timelines required for both diagnosis and treatment of most aggressive cancers, this new machine learning technique has important clinical and public applications and implications for high-throughput data analysis and contextualization.

Different faults occur with varied frequencies by continuous arrival in chemical plants, while this issue has been hardly addressed in developing a diagnosis model. A novel incremental imbalance modified deep neural network (incremental-IMDNN) is proposed to promote the fault diagnosis to the imbalanced data stream. The first step in designing the incremental-IMDNN is the employment of an imbalance modified method combined with active learning for the extraction and generation of the most valuable information keeping in view the model feedback. DNN is utilized as a basic diagnosis model to excavate potential information. Then for the continuous arrival of new fault modes, DNN is promoted in an incremental hierarchical way. Unlike the traditional model that trained on a static snapshot of data, this model inherits the existing knowledge and hierarchically expands the diagnosis model by the similarity of faults. Similar faults that are judged by fuzzy clustering merge into a superclass, and every submodel shares the same architecture that is prevalent in previous research, which can be trained in parallel.

Neuropsychological testing is a key element in the diagnostic procedures of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), but has presently a limited value in the prediction of progression to dementia. We advance the hypothesis that newer statistical classification methods derived from data mining and machine learning methods like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests can improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of predictions obtained from neuropsychological testing. Seven non parametric classifiers derived from data mining methods (Multilayer Perceptrons Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, CART, CHAID and QUEST Classification Trees and Random Forests) were compared to three traditional classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression) in terms of overall classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, Area under the ROC curve and Press'Q. Model predictors were 10 neuropsychological tests currently used in the diagnosis of dementia. Statistical distributions of classification parameters obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation were compared using the Friedman's nonparametric test.ResultsPress' Q test showed that all classifiers performed better than chance alone (p < 0.05). Support Vector Machines showed the larger overall classification accuracy (Median (Me) = 0.76) an area under the ROC (Me = 0.90). However this method showed high specificity (Me = 1.0) but low sensitivity (Me = 0.3). Random Forest ranked second in overall accuracy (Me = 0.73) with high area under the ROC (Me = 0.73) specificity (Me = 0.73) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). Linear Discriminant Analysis also showed acceptable overall accuracy (Me = 0.66), with acceptable area under the ROC (Me = 0.72) specificity (Me = 0.66) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). The remaining classifiers showed overall classification accuracy above a median value of 0.63, but for most sensitivity was around or even lower than a median value of 0.5.ConclusionsWhen taking into account sensitivity, specificity and overall classification accuracy Random Forests and Linear Discriminant analysis rank first among all the classifiers tested in prediction of dementia using several neuropsychological tests.

In this paper, we propose a common topic transfer learning graphical model\u2013the common-topic transfer learning model (CTLM)\u2013for crossing-city POI recommendations.

By doing so, the ill-matching problem between users and POIs from different cities can be well addressed by preventing the real interests of users from being influenced by the city-specific features. Furthermore, we incorporate the spatial influence into our proposed model by introducing the regions\u2019 accessibility. As a result, the co-occurrence patterns of users and POIs are modeled as the aggregated result from these factors.

To address this issue, we propose a new method for via relaxation and rounding, which obtains (e,\u03b4-approximate solution in O(n/e\u03b4) time with probability at least 1-\u03b4. Such regularization explicitly penalizes parameters different from zero with no further restrictions. We first show that learning sparse SVMs with l_0 norm can be reformulated as an exactly Boolean program by introducing Boolean variables to each parameter. With dual and Boolean relaxation, this Boolean problem can be relaxed as a convex programming. For the e-approximate solution of this convex programming, we get a feasible solution of the original problem without loss accuracy by a determined rounding.

If absence data are not available, another important consideration is pseudoabsence generation. Different strategies for pseudoabsence generation can produce varying spatial representation of species. ::: ::: ::: METHODOLOGY ::: We considered model outcomes from four different strategies for generating pseudoabsences. We generating pseudoabsences randomly by 1) selection from the entire study extent, 2) a two-step process of selection first from the entire study extent, followed by selection for pseudoabsences from areas with predicted probability <25%, 3) selection from plots surveyed without detection of species presence, 4) a two-step process of selection first for pseudoabsences from plots surveyed without detection of species presence, followed by selection for pseudoabsences from the areas with predicted probability <25%. We used Random Forests as our statistical method and sixteen predictor variables to model tree species with at least 150 records from Forest Inventory and Analysis surveys in the Laurentian Mixed Forest province of Minnesota. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Pseudoabsence generation strategy completely affected the area predicted as present for species distribution models and may be one of the most influential determinants of models. All the pseudoabsence strategies produced mean AUC values of at least 0.87. More importantly than accuracy metrics, the two-step strategies over-predicted species presence, due to too much environmental distance between the pseudoabsences and recorded presences, whereas models based on random pseudoabsences under-predicted species presence, due to too little environmental distance between the pseudoabsences and recorded presences. Models using pseudoabsences from surveyed plots produced a balance between areas with high and low predicted probabilities and the strongest relationship between density and area with predicted probabilities \u226575%.

We obtain experimental data from multiple breast phantoms with two possible tumor locations. In this work, we investigate a method for detecting the tumors within the breast but without the usual complexity inherent to image-generation methods, and conflrm its feasibility on experimental data. The proposed method uses machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to determine whether the current breast being scanned is tumor-free.

As to the problem that the construction of a signed distance function (SDF) is computationally expensive, a new generation method of the SDF, namely midline extending method is introduced. The SDF can be generated simply by scanning the image for a time. In the meantime it can take down a nearest point on an initial curve for each point, which supports for extending the curvature of the speed term. Focusing on the imaging characteristics of MR images, especially on that of the left ventricle MR images with tag lines, the authors introduce the method of block pixel variation and intensity comparability to improve the speed term of level set, so as to increase the segmentation precision.

In this we analyze the reason for their creation, their theoretical part, several of their topologies \u2013 architectural and finally the needs that were created from their advantages and disadvantages for better results. In the third chapter we are dealing with the Support Vector Machines, the reason of their popularity, the way of their implementation theoretically and geometrically, their accomplishments and their advantages and disadvantages. In the fourth chapter, via experimental results, we are trying to compare the Artificial Neural Networks to the Support Vector Machines with real aggregate data, patterns or instances, which indicators are those that will finally give us the classifier that is the best. And by saying the best do we imply the most accurate, the fastest or something in between? In the fifth chapter we explain what Regression is and we compare major algorithms from Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. In the sixth chapter we implemented an application into Java which performs classification and regression from arff files. It focuses only on classification and regression, while what differentiates it from Weka is Prediction on which we can give an instance and the application can make a prediction on/about it. Finally, we include the Conclusion/Epilogue, the appendices that cover basic theories which refer to previous chapters and UML diagrams of classes that are implemented on classification and Prediction in Weka, as well as some parts of the code in Java from the implementation of the program. ::: In the Dissertation there is the Bibliography on which we constantly refer to.

This study investigates the feature extraction and pattern recognition of surface electromyography (sEMG), with the purpose of determining the best features and classifiers of sEMG for daily living activities monitoring and fall detection. This is done by a serial of experiments. In the experiments, four channels of sEMG signal from wireless, wearable sensors located on lower limbs are recorded from three subjects while they perform seven activities of daily living (ADL). A simulated trip fall scenario is also considered with a custom-made device attached to the ankle. With this experimental setting, 15 feature extraction methods of sEMG, including time, frequency, time/frequency domain and entropy, are analyzed based on class separability and calculation complexity, and five classification methods, each with 15 features, are estimated with respect to the accuracy rate of recognition and calculation complexity for activity monitoring and fall detection. It is shown that a high accuracy rate of recognition and a minimal calculation time for daily activity monitoring and fall detection can be achieved in the current experimental setting. Specifically, the Wilson Amplitude (WAMP) feature performs the best, and the classifier Gaussian Kernel Support Vector Machine (GK-SVM) with Permutation Entropy (PE) or WAMP results in the highest accuracy for activity monitoring with recognition rates of 97.35% and 96.43%. For fall detection, the classifier Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network (FMMNN) has the best sensitivity and specificity at the cost of the longest calculation time, while the classifier Gaussian Kernel Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (GK-FDA) with the feature WAMP guarantees a high sensitivity (98.70%) and specificity (98.59%) with a short calculation time (65.586 ms), making it a possible choice for pre-impact fall detection.

Distance set representations enable compact acoustic models. The method of phonetic set indexing is a very fast method of pre-fetching word lists. At the word level, the concept of word sets allows for long distance relations between words to be captured, and gives rise to the concept of utterance and dialogue triggers which have been implemented in the context of the derived Trigger and Adaptive Boosting (TAB) algorithm. Voting with unified codebooks for speaker identification is also presented. Experiments have been performed in various speech domains including TIMIT, Trains-93, and Trains-95 corpus. ::: Set representations of speech have been utilized in two novel applications: multi-modal integration, and web browsing with speech.

Guo (fyguo@ucla.edu) UCLA, Department of Psychology, 405 Hilgard Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563, USA Keith J. Holyoak (holyoak@psych.ucla.edu) UCLA, Department of Psychology, 405 Hilgard Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563, USA Abstract Classical choice theories assume choice behavior is based on value maximization computed over the entire choice set. However, empirical evidence has revealed violations of axioms of rational choice that cannot be explained by value maximization. We argue that choice behavior can be reconceptualized as value maximization constrained by categorization processes, and describe a neural network model developed to account for key empirical findings. The model simulates two important phenomena that have been construed as irrational choice behavior, namely, the similarity effect and the attraction effect. We argue that there are important commonalities among choice behavior, categorization and perception. Introduction Many axiomatic theories of choice behavior are based on the assumption that decision making is based on a process of value maximization performed over all attributes (c. f., Tversky & Simonson, 1993). However, empirical evidence has demonstrated that axioms of rational decision making are often violated in choice behavior, and value maximization alone is unable to explain these violations. Recently, an alternative perspective that is concerned with the relations between similarity processes and decision processes has been proposed to conceptualize choice behavior and to understand violations of rational decision making (Medin, Goldstone, & Markman, 1995). That view has been embodied in a comprehensive computational model of choice behavior (Roe, Busemeyer, & Townsend, 2001). In the spirit of this alternative perspective, we have developed a connectionist model to account for two key violations of rational choice, namely, the similarity effect and the attraction effect. Both of these phenomena involve adding a third alternative (decoy) to a choice set of two options, thereby leading to inconsistency of choice. If the decoy is similar and competitive (two alternatives are competitive when their additive utilities are almost identical to each other) to one of the original options, then the addition of the decoy decreases the choice probability of that option. This phenomenon is called the similarity effect (Tversky, 1972). If the decoy is similar to and dominated by one of the two original alternatives but not the other, then the addition of the decoy increases the choice probability of the dominant option more than the other alternative. This phenomenon is referred to as the attraction effect (Huber, Payne, & Puto, 1982). Both phenomena can potentially lead to violations of rational choice. Few theories were able to provide an integrated explanation of both phenomena prior to the model proposed by Roe et al. (2001), which is a neural network instantiation of the decision field theory (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993). That model explains the two effects (in addition to several other important choice phenomena) by taking into consideration similarity relations among options and the dynamic nature of decision processes. The model described here is similar to that of Roe et al. in that it also takes into account similarity among alternatives; however, the manner in which similarity is represented and processed differs between the two models. We will briefly discuss the relationship between the two models after we present our proposal. Neural network models have been one of the major modeling tools in cognitive science (Rumelhart, McClelland, & PDP Research Group, 1986). However, such models have had only limited applications to decision behavior (Holyoak & Simon, 1999; Roe et al., 2001; Thagard & Millgram, 1995). The model we describe here, like that of Roe et al. (2001), uses a neural network approach to provide an account of the similarity and attraction effects. Operation of the Model Decision Scenario and Model Architecture The decision scenario used here is adapted from that used by Roe et al. (2001).

Regression analysis has been widely applied to AD research to relate clinical and biomarker data such as predicting cognitive outcomes from MRI measures. Recently, multi-task based feature learning (MTFL) methods with sparsity-inducing $ \\ell _{2,1} $ ::: -norm have been widely studied to select a discriminative feature subset from MRI features by incorporating inherent correlations among multiple clinical cognitive measures. However, existing MTFL assumes the correlation among all tasks is uniform, and the task relatedness is modeled by encouraging a common subset of features via sparsity-inducing regularizations that neglect the inherent structure of tasks and MRI features. To address this issue, we proposed a fused group lasso regularization to model the underlying structures, involving 1) a graph structure within tasks and 2) a group structure among the image features. To this end, we present a multi-task feature learning framework with a mixed norm of fused group lasso and $ \\ell _{2,1} $ ::: -norm to model these more flexible structures. For optimization, we employed the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the proposed non-smooth formulation. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method using the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that incorporating the two prior structures with fused group lasso norm into the multi-task feature learning can improve prediction performance over several competing methods, with estimated correlations of cognitive functions and identification of cognition-relevant imaging markers that are clinically and biologically meaningful.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30284672", "doi": "10.1007/s12021-018-9398-5", "venue": "Neuroinformatics", "journal": "Neuroinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2895198603", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6617228", "31493681", "2098528", "2807360", "39212171", "12420386", "954064", "9629554", "13921726", "205514740", "8431734", "8166914", "16727656", "39855832", "4873602", "1353506", "54432685", "7456037", "807912", "2995286", "45500369", "17948295", "551387", "807912", "7512176", "1296677", "31227259", "21919595", "715932", "41834140", "140205302", "1530991", "13895067", "6090506", "18237764", "18237764", "6418451", "2633057", "18553000", "448134"], "inbound_citations": ["214537328", "214537328", "211147230", "215460807"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52912683"}

The kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the online classifier to recognize the target human and updated using both the positive and negative examples. The experimental results on six RGB-D videos of a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher success rates compared to a 2D tracker and a 3D human detection method at a frame rate of 3.8 fps, and is capable of efficiently retrieving the target human following intermittent occlusion.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.imavis.2019.05.003", "venue": "Image Vis.

As the fourth largest democracy and the fifth largest twitter user in the world, twitter in Indonesia is very influential as a place for people to fight each other's arguments. Public talk about the election of two candidates for President and Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia for the 2019\u20132024 on Twitter, became an interesting topic for Twitter users with a variety of public sentiment both positive and negative. Therefore, there is a need for a method that helps to see public opinion effectively.

The proposed method relies on the combination of GP and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) techniques to detect a predefined number of informative regions that aim at maximising the between-class scatter and minimising the within-class scatter. Moreover, the proposed method uses only two instances of each class to evolve a classifier. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, four different texture data sets are used and the performance is compared against two other GP-based methods namely Conventional GP and Two-tier GP. The experiments revealed that the proposed method outperforms these two methods on all the data sets. Moreover, a better performance has been achieved by Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees (J48) methods when extracted features by the proposed method have been used compared to the use of domain-specific and Two-tier GP extracted features.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-03680-9_13", "venue": "Australasian Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1722688282", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["88485269", "6282735", "23480264", "52207390", "29839110"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30852213"}

The performance of the MCP techniques was analysed by means of coefficients of determination, together with the Mean Squared Error and the Mean Absolute Error of the residuals. Conclusions reached are that the results depend on the LiDAR measurement height and on the Measure-Correlate-Predict methodology used. Another conclusion drawn from the analysis is that although some regression methodologies show a better behaviour in correlating the candidate and reference site, they might show a different behaviour when used for prediction.

LB-GAN decomposes the challenging synthesis problem into two well constrained subtasks that correspond to a face normalizer and a face editor respectively. The normalizer first frontalizes an input image, and then the editor rotates the frontalized image to a desired pose guided by a remote code. In order to generate photo-realistic local details, the normalizer and the editor are trained in a two-stage manner and regulated by a conditional self-cycle loss and an attention based L2 loss.

In this thesis, we studied a range of machine-learning algorithms to predict demand (ridership) in a bike-sharing system, as part of an online competition. Predictions based on the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms produced results that ranked amongst the top 15 of more than 3,000 team submissions. We showed that the mandated use of logarithmic error as the evaluation metric overemphasizes errors made during off-peak hours. We systematically experimented with model refinements and feature engineering to improve predictions, with mixed results.

Firstly, a landslide inventory map with 430 landslide locations in the study area was constructed from various sources. Landslide locations were then randomly split into two parts (i) 70 % landslide locations being used for training models (ii) 30 % landslide locations being employed for validation process. Secondly, a total of eleven landslide conditioning factors including slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, curvature, lithology, soil, land cover, distance to roads, distance to lineaments, distance to rivers, and rainfall were used in the analysis to elucidate the spatial relationship between these factors and landslide occurrences. Feature selection of Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) algorithm was employed to assess the prediction capability of these conditioning factors on landslide models. Subsequently, the NB, MLP Neural Nets, and FT models were constructed using training dataset. Finally, success rate and predictive rate curves were employed to validate and compare the predictive capability of three used models. Overall, all the three models performed very well for landslide susceptibility assessment.

This study first utilizes the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) rule to analyze the distribution of enzymes in the Am-Pse-AAC feature space. This analysis indicates the distributions of multiple classes of enzymes are highly overlapped. To cope with the overlap problem, this study proposes an efficient non-parametric classifier for predicting enzyme subfamily class using an adaptive fuzzy r-nearest neighbor (AFK-NN) method, where k and a fuzzy strength parameter m are adaptively specified. The fuzzy membership values of a query sample Q are dynamically determined according to the position of Q and its weighted distances to the k nearest neighbors. Using the same enzymes of the oxidoreductases family for comparisons, the prediction accuracy of AFK-NN is 76.6%, which is better than those of Support Vector Machine (73.6%), the decision tree method C5.0 (75.4%) and the existing covariant-discriminate algorithm (70.6%) using a jackknife test. To evaluate the generalization ability of AFK-NN, the datasets for all six families of entirely sequenced enzymes are established from the newly updated SWISS-PROT and ENZYME database.

However it is typically not possible to directly measure resource demands at the abstraction they are needed, e.g., for a software service within an application server that is invoked by a URL. For such cases, linear regression techniques are often used to estimate resource demands. We evaluate the effectiveness of the Least Squares (LSQ) and Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) regression techniques, used extensively by others, as well as Support Vector Regression (SVR) for the purpose of demand estimation. To the best of our knowledge SVR has not yet been evaluated for computer resource demand estimation. We consider the predictive accuracy of these methods for three different real and simulated workloads. Our results demonstrate the importance of tuning the regression parameters of the techniques. We propose an on-line method named Mix Driven On-line Resource Demand Estimation (MODE) that automatically and quickly tunes the regression parameters for LSQ, LAD, and SVR to achieve their best results. The method is novel in that it relies on pre-defined workload mixes with known aggregate demand values to support the tuning exercise. We show that when employed in an on-line manner, tuning with respect to pre-defined mixes is significantly more accurate than the traditional approach of using only step by step data.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management", "journal": "2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1485420199", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6702073", "961425", "721847", "2443126", "2261459", "15382218", "1889567", "2785605", "207249768", "19426692", "9138242", "296504", "46475429", "15480929", "7798371", "119999370", "15063549", "5284967"], "inbound_citations": ["211296776", "3093480", "211551923", "14021075", "14759447", "16885567", "1600177", "53281707", "9817775", "9903598", "2493689", "52068174", "14711307", "14317693", "5822139", "20960989"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16461106"}

In this work, a new algorithm capable of generating technical rules to make investments with a given amount of leverage depending on the certainty of the prediction is presented. To forecast those predictions, a combination of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm \u2013 to identify and classify the market in three different stages \u2013, and a Dynamic Genetic Algorithm \u2013 to optimize trading rules in each type of market, is used. The optimization of the trading rules is based on several technical indicators. Forex data for the EUR/USD currency pair, in a timeframe between the years of 2003 and 2016, is used as training and test data. The proposed architecture for the machine learning system, as well as the implementation and study of the proposed system is described in detail. The use of an hybrid system, combining a SVM and a GA with dynamic approaches such as hyper-mutation and adaptability approaches by training three different GA\u2019s for each type of market, provide a new approach for FOREX trading, where it is possible to classify trends using price sequences and therefore using the same classification for optimizing investment strategies with the most appropriate GA.

In this work, combination of wavelet packet based features and Improved Binary Dragonfly Optimization based feature selection method was proposed to classify the different types of infant cry signals. Methods Cry signals from 2 different databases were utilized. First database contains 507 cry samples of normal (N), 340 cry samples of asphyxia (A), 879 cry samples of deaf (D), 350 cry samples of hungry (H) and 192 cry samples of pain (P). Second database contains 513 cry samples of jaundice (J), 531 samples of premature (Prem) and 45 samples of normal (N). Wavelet packet transform based energy and non-linear entropies (496 features), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) based cepstral features (56 features), Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted (16 features). The combined feature set consists of 568 features. To overcome the curse of dimensionality issue, improved binary dragonfly optimization algorithm (IBDFO) was proposed to select the most salient attributes or features. Finally, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) kernel classifier was used to classify the different types of infant cry signals using all the features and highly informative features as well. Results Several experiments of two-class and multi-class classification of cry signals were conducted. In binary or two-class experiments, maximum accuracy of 90.18% for H Vs P, 100% for A Vs N, 100% for D Vs N and 97.61% J Vs Prem was achieved using the features selected (only 204 features out of 568) by IBDFO. For the classification of multiple cry signals (multi-class problem), the selected features could differentiate between three classes (N, A & D) with the accuracy of 100% and seven classes with the accuracy of 97.62%.

However, the rare-class problem remains a critical challenge, because there is no natural way developed for handling imbalanced class distributions. This paper thus fills this crucial void by developing a method for Classification using lOcal clusterinG (COG). Specifically, for a data set with an imbalanced class distribution, we perform clustering within each large class and produce sub-classes with relatively balanced sizes.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a hybrid structure FBSN which consists of Fine-grained Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (FBi-LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to deal with the event trigger identification. The hybrid architecture makes the most of their advantages: FBi-LSTM is to mainly extract the higher level features by the fine-grained representations, and SVM is largely appropriate for small dataset for classifying the results of biomedical event trigger. After that, the popular dataset Multi Level Event Extraction (MLEE) is employed to verify our hybrid structure.

These feature sets are given as input to the classifier. Performance evaluation of Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Relevant Vector Machine (RVM) classifiers, in recognizing different wrist and elbow positions, is discussed. As per the results, the best overall accuracy of 93.3% was obtained from SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel, in classifying both the wrist and elbow positions. Although, RVM as a classifier yielded the same accuracy in recognizing wrist positions, it resulted in the lowest accuracy of 88.67% in recognizing elbow positions. Therefore, SVM-RBF fared better in identifying the arm movements.

In this paper, we propose a center-based feature transfer framework to augment the feature space of under-represented subjects from the regular subjects that have sufficiently diverse samples. A Gaussian prior of the variance is assumed across all subjects and the variance from regular ones are transferred to the under-represented ones. This encourages the under-represented distribution to be closer to the regular distribution. Further, an alternating training regimen is proposed to simultaneously achieve less biased classifiers and a more discriminative feature representation. We conduct ablative study to mimic the under-represented datasets by varying the portion of under-represented classes on the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. Advantageous results on LFW, IJB-A and MS-Celeb-1M demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature transfer and training strategy, compared to both general baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

As a result, the detail losing and contrast reduction are caused by these rules. In the paper, In order to use multiple features extracted from one image simultaneously to obtain an adaptive weight value for the image, we propose an exposure fusion method called (SVR_EF). It is based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) theory. Firstly, we construct input vector for SVR using contrast, saturation and exposedness features from the chosen representative blocks. The label of input is obtained by using a Gaussian function with exposure setting of the image served as a parameter. Thus, training model can be got. Secondly, the statistic values of these features about each tested image are calculated, it is used for deciding the weight value of corresponding image with the training model.

This is useful in areas such as fault detection, intrusion detection and in pre-processing before further analysis. There are many approaches already in use for outlier detection, typically adapting other existing data mining techniques such as cluster analysis, neural networks and classification methods such as Support Vector Machines. However, in many cases data from sources such as sensor networks can be better represented with an uncertain model. Detecting outliers with uncertain data involves far more computation as each data object is usually represented by a number of probability density functions (pdf s). ::: ::: In this paper, we demonstrate an implementation of outlier detection with uncertain objects based on an existing density sampling method that we have parallelized using the cross-platform OpenCL framework. While the density sampling method is a well understood and relatively straightforward outlier detection technique, its application to uncertain data results in a much higher computational workload. Our optimized implementation uses an inexpensive GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to greatly reduce the running time. This improvement in performance may be leveraged when attempting to detect outliers with uncertain data in time sensitive situations such as when responding to sensor failure or network intrusion.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-30220-6_15", "venue": "PAKDD", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "125439535", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17383629", "355163", "8208745", "15061246", "14278698"], "inbound_citations": ["5831753", "1995090", "8101928", "15340432", "18885933", "17892429", "52214027", "14938965"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31561892"}

We have introduced an improved version of Support Vector Clustering (SVC) technique with automatic parameter tuning in this paper. Using Gaussian RBF kernel, the data points are mapped into a higher dimensional feature space. The objective function becomes to find the minimal enclosing sphere for all data points in the kernel space. This sphere, when mapped back to the data space, separates into several components with irregular boundaries, enclosing separate clusters of points. There are two tuning parameters in SVC, soft margin penalty constant and width of the Gaussian kernel which are varied and used to attain smooth cluster boundaries. It is difficult to accurately select both of these parameters manually using k-fold Cross Validation. So, we have employed an optimization technique to find out RBF sigma parameter tuning which was originally proposed by Cheng Hsuan Li et.al for Support Vector Machines (SVM). The optimal kernel RBF sigma value for SVC is calculated which is more accurate and computationally efficient and accurate compared to k-fold cross validation method.

In this study, ECG signals were used to identify the wake (W), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of the sleep data from two different databases with 17,758 epochs of 28 subjects (21 healthy subjects and 7 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients) in total.

As a result of applying the methods separately, four different data sets were obtained. The four different datasets were given to the Wrapper Subset Evaluation system with the best-first search algorithm.

Box 24 University of Helsinki, 00014 Finland Abstract 1 evolutionary design: problem-solutions generated by genetic algorithms. By analyzing the nature of solutions that genetic algorithms offer to computational problems, we suggest that evolutionary designs are often hard to understand because they can exhibit non-modular functionality, and that this creates problems for strategies of mechanistic explanation. Accounts of mechanistic explanation require that complex cognitive phenomena can be decomposed into simpler subtasks. We provide a theory of explanation that rationalizes this requirement, and then we use a simple genetic algorithm exercise to demonstrate that evolution can produce designs that violate this functional modularity requirement. Keywords: mechanism; explanation; evolution; modularity; genetic algorithm Mechanistic Explanation in the Cognitive Sciences Introduction According to the proponents of the mechanistic approach to explanation (Bechtel 2008; Craver 2007; Piccinini & Craver 2011), a central goal of the cognitive sciences is to provide understanding of system-level properties of the cognitive system in terms of the properties of its physical component parts and their organization. The most developed philosophical account of strategies for reaching such mechanistic understanding is Bechtel and Richardson\u2019s (2010) study of the heuristics of decomposition and localization (DL). The DL procedure goes roughly as follows. First, the different phenomena that the system of interest exhibits are differentiated. Then the phenomenon of interest is functionally decomposed, i.e., analyzed into a set of possible component operations that would be sufficient to produce it. One can think of this step as the formulation of a preliminary set of simpler functions that, taken together, would constitute the more complex input-output relation (the system-level phenomenon). The system is also structurally decomposed into a set of component parts. The final step is to try to localize the component operations by mapping them onto appropriate structural component parts. If this cannot be done, the fault may lie with the functional and structural decompositions or with the very identification of the phenomenon, and these may then have to be rethought. The identification and decomposition procedures will in the beginning be guided by earlier theories and common sense, but empirical evidence can always suggest that a thorough reworking of the basic ontology and the form of the possible explananda may be in order. What the schema of Bechtel and Richardson lacks is an explicit theory of explanation providing an account of what makes such decomposition and localization exercises explanatory. Whereas cognitive theories of explanation (Churchland 1989; Thagard 2012; Waskan 2006) focus on the internal models and processes of the individuals engaged in explanation-related tasks, such conceptualization is Connectionism, dynamical systems theory, and new robotics have questioned whether the search for information- processing mechanisms provides a feasible approach to the study of biologically evolved cognitive systems such as the human mind. Whereas approaches that have their origins in classical AI tend to conceive of cognition as a set of computational operations to be mapped onto physiological parts according to functional decompositions inspired directly by the programmer\u2019s intuitions about possible efficient subroutines, the alternative research programs emphasize that biological evolution is likely to produce unintuitive designs of such complexity that renders heuristics based on decomposability and programming intuitions unusable. In this paper we analyze the problems that evolved solutions raise to the mechanistic understanding of cognitive phenomena. The problem of understanding non-intuitive designs produced by natural selection is well-known in philosophy of psychology (e.g., Clark 1997, Ch. 5), philosophy of biology (Wimsatt 2007), and now even in popular psychology (Marcus 2008), but it has proved to be difficult to articulate without a clear idea of what exactly it is that evolutionary tinkering is supposed to hinder. The main challenge for scientific understanding is often framed and explained by pointing to the path-dependent nature and the resulting unfamiliarity of the evolved design (Jacob 1977). We argue that this is not the whole story. The aim of this paper is to provide an explicit theory of mechanistic explanation and understanding that will move us beyond intuitions towards a more systematic analysis of the nature of these challenges. We also combine our theory of explanation with a computational application of The authors are listed in alphabetical order.

A Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager surface reflectance image covering the greater metropolitan area of Brussels is selected for mapping.

First the combined endmember library is resampled to match the spectral response of the Landsat sensor. The library is then optimized to avoid spectral redundancy and confusion. Subsequently the spectra of the endmember library are synthetically mixed to produce training data for unmixing. Mapping is carried out using Support Vector Regression models trained with spectra selected through stratified sampling of the mixed library.

According to the American Cancer Society, blacks have lower survival rate than whites. Many previous studies suggested that it is because blacks were more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage. Hence, it is crucial to determine factors that are associated with colon cancer stage at diagnosis. Objectives: The objectives of this study are twofold: 1)To compare logistic regression modeling to Random Forests classification with respect to variables selected and classification accuracy; and 2) To evaluate the factors related to colon cancer stage at diagnosis in a population based study. Many studies have comparedClassification and Regression Trees (CART) to logistic regression and found that they have very similar power with respect to the proportion correctly classified and the variables selected. This study extends previous methodological research by comparing the Random Forests classification techniques to logistic regression modeling using a relatively small and incomplete dataset. Methods and Materials: The data used in this research were from National Cancer Institute Black/White Cancer Survival Study which had 960 cases of invasive colon cancer. Stage at diagnosis was used as the dependent variable for fitting logistic regression models and Random Forests Classification to multiple potential explanatory variables, which included some missing data. Results: Odds ratio (blacks vs. whites) decreased from 1.628 (95%CI: 1.068-2.481) to 1.515 (95% CI: 0.920-2.493) after adjustment was made for patient delay in diagnosis, occupation, histology and grade of tumor. Race became no longer important after these variables were entered in the Random Forests. These four variables were identified as the most important variables associated with racial disparity in colon cancer stage at diagnosis in both logistic regression and Random Forests. The correctclassification rate was 47.9% using logistic regression and was 33.9% using Random Forests. Conclusion: 1). Logistic regression and Random Forests had very similar power in variable selection. 2). Logistic regression had higher classification accuracy than Random Forests with respect to overall correct classification rate.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "22754801", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33646739"}

The structural degrading process affects the dynamic behavior, leading to modifications in modal characteristics. In general, natural frequencies are sensitive indicators of structural integrity and tend to become slightly smaller in the presence of damage. Despite this, it is very difficult to state the relationship between decreasing values of natural frequencies and structural damage, since the dynamic properties are also influenced by uncertainty on experimental data and temperature variation. In order to contribute to improving the quality of natural frequency-based methods used for damage identification, this paper presents a simple and efficient strategy to detect structural changes in a set of experimental tests from a real structure using a computational intelligence method.

Various methods have been proposed to detect epileptic activity in EEG recordings. Because of the nonlinear and dynamic nature of EEG signals, the use of nonlinear Higher Order Spectra (HOS) features is a seemingly promising approach. This paper presents the methodology employed to extract HOS features (specifically, cumulants) from normal, preictal, and epileptic EEG segments and to use significant features in classifiers for the detection of these three classes. In this work, 300 sets of EEG data belonging to the three classes were used for feature extraction and classifier development and evaluation. The results show that the HOS based measures have unique ranges for the different classes with high confidence level (p-value < 0.0001).

Breast x-ray images acquired in Medio-Lateral-Oblique (MLO) view (n = 197) chosen from mini-MIAS database are preprocessed using median filter to remove noise and adaptive histogram equalization has been applied to improve image contrast.

Magnitude, phase information and statistical features such as energy, entropy, variance, kurtosis and skewness are computed for the obtained filter responses.

Further, absolute difference value of extracted features are computed and compared to choose the significant features.

In this study, multispectral data Sentinel-2A and ASTER were employed to discriminate lithological units in the unvegetated arid region. Several image enhancement algorithms, including Band Ratio (BR), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were applied to the data for lithological mapping. A specialized band ratio, (Sentinel-2A band 3+ASTER band 9)/(Sentinel-2A band 12+ASTER band 8), combining ASTER and Sentinel-2A data was designed to distinguish serpentine minerals in the ophiolite complex. Color composites of principal components (PCs) of ASTER and Sentinel-2A data were utilized to differentiate rock units within the ophiolite complex.

In this paper, we explore the use of consumer-grade armbands (Myo armband) which capture orientation information (via an inertial measurement unit) and muscle activity (via electromyography) to ultimately guide a robotic device during live performances. To compensate for the drop in information quality, our approach rely heavily on machine learning and leverage the multimodality of the sensors. In order to speed-up classification, dimensionality reduction was performed automatically via a method based on Random Forests (RF). Online classification results achieved 88% accuracy over nine movements created by a dancer during a live performance, demonstrating the viability of our approach. The nine movements are then grouped into three semanticallymeaningful moods by the dancer for the purpose of an artistic performance achieving 94% accuracy in real-time. We believe that our technique opens the door to aesthetically-pleasing sequences of body motions as gestural interface, instead of traditional static arm poses.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ROMAN.2017.8172430", "venue": "2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)", "journal": "2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2775357457", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["108058942", "207247732", "9524716", "17903134", "2857532", "14583144", "44893660", "18397179", "7337951", "23901347", "2607898", "109472627", "4935067", "4912804", "9096812", "6982918", "7261506", "1337124", "976637", "17056756", "10659969", "1117445", "2448917"], "inbound_citations": ["204803982", "3868975"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30353616"}

Considering that there are numerous interferences in real-world application scenario, it is impossible for us to collect them. With a prior knowledge that the target gases samples can be easily collected, a novel SeELM method is proposed to address this issue. The idea is represented as two aspects. First, the target gases being detected by an E-nose can be fixed as invariant information, which is utilized to construct a self-expression model.

Specifically, each noise vector, as input to the generator network, is explicitly split into several sub-vectors, each corresponding to, and is trained to learn, image representations at a particular scale. During training, we progressively de-freeze the sub-vectors, one at a time, as a new set of higher-resolution images is employed for training and more network layers are added. A consequence of such an explicit sub-vector designation is that we can directly manipulate and even combine latent (sub-vector) codes which model different feature scales.

Graph-level representations are critical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the properties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional graph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length representations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to hand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language models (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures (e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of unsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method called InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the mutual information between the graph-level representation and the representations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the data that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we further propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semisupervised scenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised graph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by existing supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from unlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the current supervised task. Experimental results on the tasks of graph classification and molecular property prediction show that InfoGraph is superior to state-of-the-art baselines and InfoGraph* can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art semi-supervised models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.01000", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2994710732,2965556524", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3827699", "3177797", "1550330", "961425", "17840600", "119413748", "189762014", "2617020", "11428387", "1690180", "70349949", "15445148", "10856944", "9665943", "207238980", "52055130", "7228830", "3364940", "5129873", "3380833", "6628106", "215716912", "3144218", "11276629", "846818", "72422", "13123084", "2407601", "5959482", "16447573", "17504174", "14992849", "9148490", "7218366", "197314", "1430801", "107645", "13748870", "15486265", "40027675", "11155896", "3051291", "16662585", "15367821", "597779", "1797579", "17557614", "8399404", "52877454", "1081340", "7735465", "13838309", "47018956", "207227372", "16454286", "49420315", "4770492", "1052837"], "inbound_citations": ["215191512", "212717830"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199441876"}

A computer-based screening of retinopathies can be highly cost-effective and efficient; however, most auto-screening software address only one eye disease, limiting their clinical utility and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, we propose a computer-based retinopathy screening system for detection of AMD and glaucoma by integrating information from retinal fundus images and clinical data. First, the retinal image analysis algorithms were developed using Transfer Learning approach to determine presence or absence of the eye disease. The clinical data was then utilized to improve disease detection performance where the image-analysis based algorithms provided sub-optimal classification. The results for binary detection (present/absent) of AMD and Glaucoma were compared with the ground truth provided by a certified retinal reader. We applied the proposed method to a dataset of 304 retinal images with AMD, 299 retinal images with Glaucoma, and 2,341 control retinal images. The algorithms demonstrated sensitivity/specificity of 100%/99.5% for detection of any AMD, 82%/70% for detection of referable AMD, and 75%/81% for detection of referable Glaucoma.

The first step is homomorphic filtering for enhancement, and the second is detection of the region of interests (ROIs) using a Local Seed Region Growing (LSRG) algorithm, which we developed. The third step incoporates Spherical Wavelet Transform (SWT) and feature extraction. Finally the fourth step is classification, which consists of two sequential components: the 1st classification distinguishes the ROIs as either mass or non-mass and the 2nd classification distinguishes the masses as either benign or malignant using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The mammograms used in this study were acquired from the hospital of Istanbul University (I.U.) in Turkey and the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS).

This thesis explores the use of cross-lingual transfer learning on neural networks as a way of solving the problem with the lack of resources. We propose several transfer learning approaches to reuse a model pretrained on a high-resource language pair. We pay particular attention to the simplicity of the techniques. We study two scenarios: (a) when we reuse the high-resource model without any prior modifications to its training process and (b) when we can prepare the first-stage high-resource model for transfer learning in advance. For the former scenario, we present a proof-of-concept method by reusing a model trained by other researchers. In the latter scenario, we present a method which reaches even larger improvements in translation performance. Apart from proposed techniques, we focus on an in-depth analysis of transfer learning techniques and try to shed some light on transfer learning improvements. We show how our techniques address specific problems of low-resource languages and are suitable even in high-resource transfer learning.

The task is to classify the twitter data into three polarity categories such as positive, negative and neutral. For training, twitter dataset under three languages were provided Hindi, Bengali and Tamil. In this shared task, ours is the only team who participated in all the three languages. Each dataset contained three separate categories of twitter data namely positive, negative and neutral. The proposed method used binary features, statistical features generated from SentiWordNet, and word presence binary feature. Due to the sparse nature of the generated features, the input features were mapped to a random Fourier feature space to get a separation and performed a linear classification using regularized least square method. The proposed method identified more negative tweets in the test data provided Hindi and Bengali language.

We introduce a novel approach for the generation of large-scale thematic maps, based on the use of multi-temporal data, acquired over short observation intervals (short-time-series). A larger interferometric coherence loss is expected with the increasing time difference between two interferometric acquisitions. This phenomenon is normally indicated as temporal decorrelation whose amount differs depending on the type of imaged target on ground. The basic idea is therefore to accurately model the evolution in time of the temporal decorrelation and use the estimated parameters, together with backscatter, as input features for the Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. The work has been carried out on the case study of land cover mapping over central Europe, considering Sentinel-1 C-band interferometric stacks, acquired over a time span of about one month. Three different land cover classes have been considered: artificial surfaces as e.g. urban areas, forests, and non-forested areas as the ensemble of low vegetation, bare soil, and agricultural areas.

Therefore, knowledge of these interactions provides invaluable insights into all cellular processes, functional mechanisms, and drug discovery. Protein-peptide interactions can be analyzed by studying the structures of protein-peptide complexes. However, only a small portion has known complex structures and experimental determination of protein-peptide interaction is costly and inefficient. Thus, predicting peptide-binding sites computationally will be useful to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness of experimental studies. Here, we established a machine learning method called SPRINT-Str (Structure-based prediction of protein-Peptide Residue-level Interaction) to use structural information for predicting protein-peptide binding residues. These predicted binding residues are then employed to infer the peptide-binding site by a clustering algorithm. Results:SPRINT-Str achieves robust and consistent results for prediction of protein-peptide binding regions in terms of residues and sites. Matthews' Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for 10-fold cross validation and independent test set are 0.27 and 0.293, respectively, as well as 0.775 and 0.782, respectively for area under the curve. The prediction outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including our previously developed sequence-based method. A further spatial neighbor clustering of predicted binding residues leads to prediction of binding sites at 20-116% higher coverage than the next best method at all precision levels in the test set. The application of SPRINT-Str to protein binding with DNA, RNA and carbohydrate confirms the method's capability of separating peptide-binding sites from other functional sites. More importantly, similar performance in prediction of binding residues and sites is obtained when experimentally determined structures are replaced by unbound structures or quality model structures built from homologs, indicating its wide applicability.

Connectionist Model of Bilingualism ::: ::: One of the main question regarding bilingualism is about the way languages are stored in the brains. There are two most discussed hypothesis. According to the first one, languages in the bilingual brain use a single system of memory representation and processing for all of them. Second theory claims that there are two separated language systems, one for each of the languages [1]. Effective solution for simulating bilingual features is creating models of this phenomenon. Most of the bilingual models, whether localist or distributed, cope with deficiencies of language tags, artificial and often unrealistic languages. This project was inspired by the SOMBIP model, which does not use the language tags, neither the artificial language. It was created by Li and Farkas. SOMBIP model is a self-organizing model of bilingual processing that has learning characteristics. It provides support to the first hypothesis described above, about single distributed lexicon in bilingual brain [2]. It was tested on Chinese and English pair of languages, which are very distinctive if considering phonological, syntactic or lexical structures. Combination of these two languages showed little integration of language representations in SOMBIP model. Comprehension was modeled as the activity map from phonology to semantics, opposite from production. Authors assumed that more similar pair of languages will provide output with more integrated phonological and semantic representations of the bilingual lexicon. Finding answer to this question was main goal of this project. Results point out whether similarity of language pair influenced integration of their representations. New bilingual corpus, of similar kind of languages, have been used. Meaning representations of the lexicon were generated from transcribed spoken language through a word co-occurrence detector, similar as with the original language pair. Next, this input data were processed by the neural network. Architecture of the model stayed original, so that we could compare results of this two simulations. Two self organized neural networks interconnected via associative pathways, trained by Hebbian learning have been used. Model has been created using DISLEX [3] - artificial neural network model of the mental lexicon. ::: ::: !! References ::: [1] J. F. Kroll, N.

SSVM is reformulation of standard Support Vector Machines (SVM). In SSVM, smoothing technique must be applied to convert constraint optimization to the unconstraint optimization problem since the objective function of this unconstraint optimization is not twice differentiable. The smooth function is used to replace the plus function to obtain a smooth support vector machine (SSVM). To get more accuracy performance, Multiple Knot Spline SSVM (MKS-SSVM) is proposed. MKS-SSVM is a new SSVM which used multiple knot spline function to approximate the plus function instead the integral sigmoid function in SSVM. To obtain optimal accuracy results, Uniform Design method is used to select parameter. The performance of the method is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation accuracy, confusion matrix, sensitivity and specificity. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, an experiment is carried out on four medical dataset, i.e. Pima Indian diabetes dataset, heart disease, breast cancer prognosis, and breast cancer diagnosis. The results of this study showed that MKS-SSVM was effective to diagnose medical dataset and this is promising results compared to the previously reported results. SSVM algorithms are developed for binary classification. However, in many real problems data points are discriminated into multiple categories. Hence, MKS-SSVM is extended for multiclass classification. Two popular multiclass classification methods One against All (OAA) and One against One (OAO)) were used to extend MKS-SSVM. Numerical experiments show that the classification accuracy of OAA and OAO method are competitive with each other and there is no clear superiority of one method over another. While the computation time, the OAO method is lower than the OAA method on three dataset. This indicated that the OAO method is usually more efficient than the OAA. In the final part, the reduced support vector machine (RSVM) was proposed to solve computational difficulties of SSVM in large dataset. To generate representative reduce set for RSVM, clustering reduced support vector machine (CRSVM) had been proposed. However, CRSVM is restricted to solve classification problems for large dataset with numeric attributes. In this research, an alternative algorithm, k-mode RSVM (KMo-RSVM) that combines RSVM and k-mode clustering technique to handle classification problems on categorical large dataset and k-prototype RSVM (KPro-RSVM) which combine k-prototype and RSVM to classify large dataset with mixed attributes were proposed. In our experiments, the effectiveness of KMo-RSVM is tested on four public available dataset. It turns out that KMo-RSVM can improve speed of running time significantly than SSVM and still obtained a high accuracy. Comparison with RSVM indicates that KMo-RSVM is faster, gets smaller reduced set and comparable testing accuracy than RSVM. From experiments on three public dataset also show that KPro- RSVM can tremendously reduces the computational time and can handling classification for large mixed dataset, when the SSVM method ran out of memory (in case: census dataset). The comparison with RSVM indicate that the computational time of KPro RSVM less than RSVM method, and obtained testing accuracy of KPro-RSVM a little decrease than RSVM.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2899676954", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69836699"}
