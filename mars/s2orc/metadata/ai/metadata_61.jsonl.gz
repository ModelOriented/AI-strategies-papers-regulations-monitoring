In this study, a new vibration-based machine learning was proposed for condition assessment and damage detection in SHM. Three vibration-based feature extraction methods, autoregressive, vector autoregressive and singular value decomposition methods, were used as damage sensitive features.

A benchmark with varying environment and operational conditions in the literature was selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Outliers or in other words, any abrupt change in values can be either due to a drastic change in environment (Event) or because of any malfunctioning of the sensor (Error). This paper introduces an IoT architecture to detect the occurrence of both Error and Event in a forest environment with the help of four statistical models, i.e., Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We take into account the spatial and temporal dependencies of the data as well. Simulation results show that the models can effectively detect both types of outliers with upto 100% accuracy for Error detection and upto 98.51% in case of Event detection. Also, the results provide evidence that using spatial and temporal parameters in event detection can have a positive influence on the prediction accuracy which was observed to increase from 81.68% to 96.53% using RF.

This paper deals with the design of an effective BCI system in which EEG signals are used as brain commands. Different types of brain activities can cause EEG signals to vary, affecting the classification performance. In this study, the signal is enhanced by employing the Multiscale Principle Component Analysis (MSPCA).

The extracted features are employed to study various classifiers' effectiveness in the classification of the EEG signals, recorded from five different subjects while intending to move their right foot and hand. The total classification accuracy is employed for comparing the obtained results.

This paper describes a method, developed for predicting interleukin-10 (IL-10) inducing peptides, a cytokine responsible for suppressing the immune system. All models were trained and tested on experimentally validated 394 IL-10 inducing and 848 non-inducing peptides. It was observed that certain types of residues and motifs are more frequent in IL-10 inducing peptides than in non-inducing peptides.

Landslide risk estimation as well as hydrological modelling requires physical soil data. Statistical models were adapted to predict the spatial distribution of soil texture from terrain parameters. For this purpose, 56 soil profiles were analysed horizon-wise by pipette and laser method. Results by pipette compared to laser method showed the expected shift to higher silt and lower clay contents. Linear regression equations were adapted. The performance of regression tree (RT) and Random Forest (RF) models was compared by hundredfold model runs on random Jackknife partitions. Digital soil maps of sand, silt and clay percentage mean and standard deviation indicate model variability and prediction uncertainty. RF models performed better than RT models. All terrain factors considered in the analysis influenced soil texture of the surface horizon, but altitude a.s.l. was assigned the highest variable importance during model construction. Shallow subsurface flow is considered responsible for increasing sand/clay ratios with increasing altitude, on steep slopes and with overland flow distance to the channel network by removing clay particles downslope. Deeper soil layers are not influenced by this process and therefore, did not show the same texture properties. However, the influence of parent material and landslides on the spatial distribution of soil texture cannot be neglected.

However, the barely visible impact damage (BVID) is difficult to be detected by visual methods. Ultrasonic thermography (UT) is an emerging nondestructive testing technique that visualizes damage in thermal images captured by an infrared (IR) camera when the material is stimulated by ultrasound. However, noise and blurry edges around the high-temperature areas may cause confusion and lead to unreliable results in the thermal images of UT test. In this paper, an impact damage inspection method is proposed based on manifold learning for the CFRP material. Low-power ultrasonic excitation is used for this UT. The IR image sequences are processed as datasets in high-dimensional space. These datasets are reduced to lower dimensions by manifold learning to find the intrinsic structure in the two-dimensional manifold. Each dimension of the embedding manifold correlates highly with one degree of freedom underlying the original pixel: steady and random components. The steady component, which reflects the temperature rise caused by damage, is used for VID and BVID detection. The experimental system was set up, and CFRP plate specimens with different impact damage were tested. All the impact damage could be detected and shown in reconstructed static image with little noise. The proposed method using image sequences could provide a visualized, reliable, and effective impact damage inspection and localization means for CFRP material during manufacturing and in service.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TII.2018.2866413", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2888413802", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41252824", "135887277", "54603833", "46820677", "122866959", "136602664", "137313659", "109634664", "117142862", "54451496", "24997427", "4711691", "49728122", "138938652", "122743678", "136910858", "135646190", "25196793", "33602621", "125788944", "137225754", "14512504", "55103997", "137715854", "40159749", "123231416", "100595874", "135768926", "40734001", "7542308", "54451595", "3885881", "54450969", "135901065", "139056278", "13776975", "136980762", "113844117", "54201906", "136622218", "139983878", "124055041", "121514254", "3422410", "137561628", "139125141", "4703130", "46928151", "67783697", "3517108", "115869991", "120209090", "120739375", "56053904", "1536455", "14879317", "207082617", "119033783", "119746641", "6888534", "120488905"], "inbound_citations": ["208092717", "203077884"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58016537"}

Among all the tracking technologies, RF-based technology is an emerging research field facing many challenges. Although we proposed the original idea, until now there is no method achieving scalability without sacrificing latency and accuracy. In this paper, we put forward a real-time tracking system RASS, which can achieve this goal and is promising in the applications like the safeguard system. Our basic idea is to divide the tracking field into different areas, with adjacent areas using different communication channels. So the interference among different areas can be prevented. For each area, three communicating nodes are deployed on the ceiling as a regular triangle to monitor this area. In each triangle area, we use a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to locate the object. This model simulates the relationship between the signal dynamics caused by the object and the object position. It not only considers the ideal case of signal dynamics caused by the object, but also utilizes their irregular information.

Among them, proximal support vector machine (PSVM) is a simple but effective SVM classifier. Its incremental version (ISVM) is also available for large-scale data. Nevertheless, the computational efficiency of the ISVM for high dimensional data still needs to be improved, mainly because it requires explicit matrix inversion for updating the decision model. To solve this problem, we propose, in this paper, an inverse matrix-free incremental PSVM (IMISVM) with the following two characteristics. Firstly, IMISVM avoids explicit matrix inversion and hence derives simple formulas for updating model parameters. Secondly, IMISVM achieves faster convergence speed than ISVM.

Moreover, nonlinearly transformed features are more effective for class discrimination in real analysis scenarios.

Moreover, conventional multiple-feature learning-based approaches deal with different features equally, which is not reasonable. This paper proposes an efficient multiple-feature learning-based model with adaptive weights for effectively classifying complex hyperspectral images with limited training samples. A new diversity kernel function is proposed first to simulate the vision perception and analysis procedure of human beings. It could simultaneously evaluate the contrast differences of global features and spatial coherence. Since existing multiple-kernel feature models are always time-consuming, we then design a new adaptive weighted multiple kernel learning method. It employs kernel projection, which could lower the dimensionalities and also learn kernel weights to further discriminate the classification boundaries. For combining both linear and nonlinear features, this paper also proposes a novel decision fusion strategy. The method combines linear and multiple kernel features to balance the classification results of different classifiers.

On the other hand, in academic settings, a major handicap is the scarcity of public SMS spam datasets, that are sorely needed for validation and comparison of different classifiers. Moreover, as SMS messages are fairly short, content-based spam filters may have their performance degraded.

This paper analyzes the influence of typical external distractions including material, color, distance, lighting, etc. on the depth error of ToF cameras. Our experiments indicated that factors such as lighting, color, material, and distance could cause different influences on the depth error of ToF cameras.

To further improve the measurement accuracy, this paper proposes an error correction method based on Particle Filter-Support Vector Machine (PF-SVM).

In the second stage, we shrink the borders of the remaining clusters by training a one-class SVM model on each cluster. To detected abnormal events in the test video, we analyze each test sample and consider its maximum normality score provided by the trained one-class SVM models, based on the intuition that a test sample can belong to only one cluster of normal motion.

They assist renewable and conventional energy engineers, electricity providers, end-users, and government entities in addressing energy sustainability challenges for the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia, including the expansion of distribution networks, energy pricing, and policy development. In this study, data-driven techniques for forecasting short-term (24-h) G-data are adopted using 0.5 h, 1.0 h, and 24 h forecasting horizons. These techniques are based on the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. This study is focused in Queensland, Australia\u2019s second largest state, where end-user demand for energy continues to increase. To determine the MARS and SVR model inputs, the partial autocorrelation function is applied to historical (area aggregated) G data in the training period to discriminate the significant (lagged) inputs. On the other hand, single input G data is used to develop the univariate ARIMA model. The predictors are based on statistically significant lagged inputs and partitioned into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to construct the forecasting models. The accuracy of the G forecasts, with respect to the measured G data, is assessed using statistical metrics such as the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation coefficient (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Normalized model assessment metrics based on RMSE and MAE relative to observed means (View the MathML source), Willmott\u2019s Index (WI ), Legates and McCabe Index (ELM), and Nash\u2013Sutcliffe coefficients (ENS) are also utilised to assess the models\u2019 preciseness. For the 0.5 h and 1.0 h short-term forecasting horizons, the MARS model outperforms the SVR and ARIMA models displaying the largest WI (0.993 and 0.990) and lowest MAE (45.363 and 86.502 MW), respectively. In contrast, the SVR model is superior to the MARS and ARIMA models for the daily (24 h) forecasting horizon demonstrating a greater WI (0.890) and MAE (162.363 MW). Therefore, the MARS and SVR models can be considered more suitable for short-term G forecasting in Queensland, Australia, when compared to the ARIMA model. Accordingly, they are useful scientific tools for further exploration of real-time electricity demand data forecasting.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aei.2017.11.002", "venue": "Adv.

Development of effective monitoring and fault diagnosis methods to prevent failures that could cause huge economic loss timely is necessary. Bearing faults with different degrees differ from each other in the aspects of signal amplitudes, impact intervals, etc. Besides, the whole life of the bearing is also a developing process for some sensitive features related to the fault trend. Most of the work in machine fault diagnosis focus on the decision of fault existence and thus ignore the developing process of the faults. Hence, to investigate the fault degree is of great meaning for timely maintenance action. In this paper, a novel intelligent method based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) to conduct rolling element bearing fault size quantitative recognition is proposed.

In this work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by meta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations useful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification performance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural network architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques.

An appropriate machine learning approach is Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which automatically generates comprehensible rules in addition to prediction. The development of ILP systems which can learn rules of the complexity required for studies on protein structure remains a challenge. In this work we use a new ILP system, ProGolem, and demonstrate its performance on learning features of hexose-protein interactions.ResultsThe rules induced by ProGolem detect interactions mediated by aromatics and by planar-polar residues, in addition to less common features such as the aromatic sandwich. The rules also reveal a previously unreported dependency for residues cys and leu. They also specify interactions involving aromatic and hydrogen bonding residues. This paper shows that Inductive Logic Programming implemented in ProGolem can derive rules giving structural features of protein/ligand interactions. Several of these rules are consistent with descriptions in the literature.ConclusionsIn addition to confirming literature results, ProGolem\u2019s model has a 10-fold cross-validated predictive accuracy that is superior, at the 95% confidence level, to another ILP system previously used to study protein/hexose interactions and is comparable with state-of-the-art statistical learners.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3458898", "pubmed_id": "22783946", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-13-162", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1979953412", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["12882786", "9338918", "17773386", "767913", "6716463", "6776101", "2471394", "32307664", "28853727", "13903504", "15982740", "7211503", "1268789", "5990841", "40589986", "10003402", "12182635", "10009856", "6304965", "15245447", "17924311", "192934", "28637672", "9627410", "10157891", "22975260", "81110403", "46072613", "3224792", "36600775"], "inbound_citations": ["4949311", "163916", "215585885", "14303682", "2876961", "15522810"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15724071"}

SVMs are consistent and robust for classification and regression purposes if based on a Lipschitz continuous loss and a bounded continuous kernel with a dense reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For regression, one of the conditions used is that the output variable Y has a finite first absolute moment. This assumption, however, excludes heavy-tailed distributions. Recently, the applicability of SVMs was enlarged to these distributions by considering shifted loss functions. In this review paper, we briefly describe the approach of SVMs based on shifted loss functions and list some properties of such SVMs. Then, we prove that SVMs based on a bounded continuous kernel and on a convex and Lipschitz continuous, but not necessarily differentiable, shifted loss function have a bounded Bouligand influence function for all distributions, even for heavy-tailed distributions including extreme value distributions and Cauchy distributions.

The proposal of hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) extends ELM from single hidden layer feedforward networks to multilayer perceptron, greatly strengthening the applicability of ELM. Generally speaking, during training H-ELM, large-scale datasets (DSTs) are needed. Therefore, how to make use of H-ELM framework in processing big data is worth further exploration. This paper proposes a parallel H-ELM algorithm based on Flink, which is one of the in-memory cluster computing platforms, and graphics processing units (GPUs). Several optimizations are adopted to improve the performance, such as cache-based scheme, reasonable partitioning strategy, memory mapping scheme for mapping specific Java virtual machine objects to buffers. Most importantly, our proposed framework for utilizing GPUs to accelerate Flink for big data is general. This framework can be utilized to accelerate many other variants of ELM and other machine learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first kind of library, which combines in-memory cluster computing with GPUs to parallelize H-ELM.

Recently there has been an increasing interest in developing weakly supervised approach to detector training where the object location is not manually annotated but automatically determined based on binary (weak) labels indicating if a training image contains the object. This is a challenging problem because each image can contain many candidate object locations which partially overlaps the object of interest. Existing approaches focus on how to best utilise the binary labels for object location annotation. In this paper we propose to solve this problem from a very different perspective by casting it as a transfer learning problem. Specifically, we formulate a novel transfer learning based on learning to rank, which effectively transfers a model for automatic annotation of object location from an auxiliary dataset to a target dataset with completely unrelated object categories.

Feature selection is a process of selecting the most wanted or dominating features set from the original features set in order to reduce the cost of data visualization and increasing classification efficiency and accuracy. The Region of Interest (ROI) is identified from the Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) images using DBSCAN clustering with morphological operators. Then the statistical texture features are extracted from the ROIs. Rough Set based Quick Reduct (QR) and Evolutionary based Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is studied.

Separating these conditions from each other, and from Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI), is important for clinical prognoses and treatment, socio-legal interventions, and family adjustments. With costly clinical investigations and an aging population comes a need for more cost-efficient differential diagnostics. METHODS: Using supervised machine learning, we investigated nine variables extracted from simple reaction time data with respect to their single and conjoined ability to discriminate both MCI/dementia, and SCI/MCI/dementia, compared to \u2013 and together with \u2013 established psychometric tests. One-hundred-twenty elderly patients (age range = 65-95 years) were recruited when referred to full neuropsychological assessment at a specialized memory clinic in urban Sweden. A freely available simple reaction time task served as index test and was administered and scored objectively by a computer before diagnosis of SCI (n = 17), MCI (n = 53), or dementia (n = 50). As reference standard, diagnosis was decided through the multidisciplinary memory clinic investigation. Bonferroni-Holm corrected p-values for constructed models against the null model are provided. RESULTS: Algorithmic feature selection for the two final multivariable models was performed through recursive feature elimination with 3x10-fold cross-validation resampling. For both models, this procedure selected seven predictors of which five were simple reaction time variables. When used as input for a soft-margin, radial-basis support vector machine model tuned via Bayesian optimization, the leave-one-out cross-validated accuracy of the final model for MCI/dementia classification was good (Accuracy = .806 [.716, .877], P < .001) and the final model for SCI/MCI/dementia classification held some merit (Accuracy = .650 [.558, .735], P < .001). These two models are implemented in a freely available application for research and educatory use. CONCLUSIONS: Simple reaction time variables hold some potential in conjunction with established psychometric tests for differentiating MCI/dementia, and SCI/MCI/dementia in these difficult-to-differentiate memory clinic patients. While external validation is needed, their implementation within diagnostic support systems is promising.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5972201", "pubmed_id": "29881341", "doi": "10.3389/fnagi.2018.00144", "venue": "Front.

It is also important to identify badly-predicted regions in a model so that some refinement measurements can be applied to. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We present a novel technique FragQA to accurately predict local quality of a sequence-structure (i.e., sequence-template) alignment generated by comparative modeling (i.e., homology modeling and threading). Different from previous local quality assessment methods, FragQA directly predicts cRMSD between a continuously aligned fragment determined by an alignment and the corresponding fragment in the native structure. FragQA uses an SVM (Support Vector Machines) regression method to perform prediction using information extracted from a single given alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that FragQA performs well on predicting local quality. More specifically, FragQA has prediction accuracy better than a top performer ProQres [18].

However, variations in MRI acquisition parameters and scanner manufacturing result in different appearances of prostate tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have shown to be successful in various medical image analysis tasks including segmentation are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging parameters. This sensitivity leads to poor segmentation performance of CNNs trained on a source cohort and tested on a target cohort from a different scanner and hence, it limits the applicability of CNNs for cross-cohort training and testing. Contouring prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWI images are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, it is important to enable CNNs pretrained on images of source domain, to segment images of target domain with minimum requirement for manual segmentation of images from the target domain. In this work, we propose a transfer learning method based on a modified U-net architecture and loss function, for segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWIs using a CNN pretrained on a source dataset and tested on the target dataset. We explore the effect of the size of subset of target dataset used for fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN on the overall segmentation accuracy. Our results show that with a fine-tuning data as few as 30 patients from the target domain, the proposed transfer learning-based algorithm can reach dice score coefficient of 0.80 for both prostate whole gland and transition zone segmentation.

A cross-modality metric is defined in a common subspace where samples of two different modalities are mapped and measured. The objective is to learn such metrics that satisfy the following two constraints. The first minimizes pairwise, intrapersonal cross-modality distances. The second forces a margin between subject specific intrapersonal and interpersonal cross-modality distances. This is achieved by defining a hinge loss on triplet-based distance constraints for efficient optimization. It allows the proposed method to focus more on optimizing distances of those subjects whose intrapersonal and interpersonal distances are hard to separate.

However, high-quality SAR images entail high costs due to the limitations of current SAR devices and their image processing resources. To improve the quality of SAR images and to reduce the costs of their generation, we propose a Dialectical Generative Adversarial Network (Dialectical GAN) to generate high-quality SAR images. This method is based on the analysis of hierarchical SAR information and the \"dialectical\" structure of GAN frameworks. As a demonstration, a typical example will be shown where a low-resolution SAR image (e.g., a Sentinel-1 image) with large ground coverage is translated into a high-resolution SAR image (e.g., a TerraSAR-X image). Three traditional algorithms are compared, and a new algorithm is proposed based on a network framework by combining conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network - Gradient Penalty) loss functions and Spatial Gram matrices under the rule of dialectics. Experimental results show that the SAR image translation works very well when we compare the results of our proposed method with the selected traditional methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.20944/preprints201807.0340.v1", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2883863016", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134342801"}

Practical algorithms that allow the identification of these local optima, such as Genetic Algorithms, have been demonstrated to work. Whilst it is useful to know where in parameter space multiple solutions exist, it is not every thing we would wish to know. At each local optimum we would like to know the range of uncertainty for each parameter and how the parameters are correlated. This will allow us to make more useful predictions, including better estimates of the uncertainty in those predictions. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a simple Estimation of Distribution Algorithm, Probability Based Incremental Learning, on a simple reservoir cross sectional model with three parameters which is known to have multiple high quality local optima. The probability distribution function, for each parameter, can be approximated by a histogram which is adjusted using the results of the search. The sampling of the parameter space is guided by the current pdfs. We show that this algorithm can evolve steady-state pdfs which would allow us to sample the parameter space more efficiently when estimating uncertainty.

A learning-based support vector machine (SVM) approach is adopted to predict the various merging behaviors. Considering four merging behaviors have different degrees of merging risk and effect on the mainline traffic flow, three SVM models are established. To overcome the potential over-fitting problem, variance analysis is used to extract the key variables in each model. The results show that the SVM models perform well. The highest prediction accuracy in the binary-classification models reaches up to nearly 90% followed by 80.10% in the multi-classification model. Besides, the results of SVM models are compared with several frequently used models, including discrete choice model, Bayesian network and classification and regression tree.

The major challenges to solving this problem are: variable brightness on cloudy days, the position of the sun at different times of the day, the difficulty in segmenting an image, seeing partially submerged people, and the position of the camera. For person detection, a common practice found in the literature is to use image descriptors in conjunction with a fast and accurate classifier for a real-time system.

Furthermore, a dimensionality reduction technique (PCA) is used for feature selection.

An automated system that can quickly categorize these materials is certainly needed for obtaining maximum classification while maintaining high throughput. In this paper, first of all, the photographs of the plastic bottles have been taken and several preprocessing steps were carried out. The first preprocessing step is to extract the plastic area of a bottle from the background. Then, the morphological image operations are implemented. These operations are edge detection, noise removal, hole removing, image enhancement, and image segmentation. These morphological operations can be generally defined in terms of the combinations of erosion and dilation. The effect of bottle color as well as label are eliminated using these operations. Secondly, the pixel-wise intensity values of the plastic bottle images have been used together with the most popular subspace and statistical feature extraction methods to construct the feature vectors in this study. Only three types of plastics are considered due to higher existence ratio of them than the other plastic types in the world. The decision mechanism consists of five different feature extraction methods including as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA (KPCA), Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEMAP) and uses a simple experimental setup with a camera and homogenous backlighting. Due to the giving global solution for a classification problem, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is selected to achieve the classification task and majority voting technique is used as the decision mechanism. This technique equally weights each classification result and assigns the given plastic object to the class that the most classification results agree on. The proposed classification scheme provides high accuracy rate, and also it is able to run in real-time applications. It can automatically classify the plastic bottle types with approximately 90% recognition accuracy. Besides this, the proposed methodology yields approximately 96% classification rate for the separation of PET or non-PET plastic types.

The newly formulated DBN-CRF model takes advantage of strength of the DBNs in learning a good representation and the ability of CRFs to model contextual (spatial) information in both observations and labels. Within a piecewise training framework, an efficient training method is proposed to train the whole DBN-CRF model end-to-end. This means that parameters in DBN and CRF can be jointly trained and thus the proposed method can fully use the strength of both DBN and CRF. Moreover, in the proposed training method, the end-to-end training can be implemented with a standard back-propagation algorithm, avoiding the repeated inference usually involved in CRF training and thus is computationally efficient.

Major challenges in proper diagnosis of AD using existing classification schemes are the availability of a smaller number of training samples and the larger number of possible feature representations. In this paper, we present and compare AD diagnosis approaches using structural magnetic resonance (sMR) images to discriminate AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control (HC) subjects using a support vector machine (SVM), an import vector machine (IVM), and a regularized extreme learning machine (RELM).

The samples of contaminated insulators are extracted from the transmission lines of high voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high voltage direct current transmission (HVDC).

Dale\u2020 (racdale@siu.edu) \u2020Department of Psychology \u2021Department of Linguistics Carbondale, IL 62901 USA Abstract Children acquire the syntactic structure of their native lan- guage with remarkable speed and reliability. Recent work in developmental psycholinguistics suggests that children may bootstrap grammatical categories and basic syntactic structure by exploiting distributional, phonological, and prosodic cues. However, these cues are probabilistic, and are individually unreliable. In this paper, we present a series of simulations exploring the integration of mul- tiple probabilistic cues in a connectionist model. The first simulation demonstrates that multiple-cue integra- tion promotes significantly better, faster, and more uni- form acquisition of syntax. In a second simulation, we show how this model can also accommodate recent data concerning the sensitivity of young children to prosody and grammatical function words. Our third simulation il- luminates the potential contribution of prenatal language experience to the acquisition of syntax through multiple- cue integration. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of the multiple-cue model in the face of potentially distract- ing cues, uncorrelated with grammatical structure. Introduction Before children can ride a bicycle or tie their shoes, they have learned a great deal about how words are combined to form complex sentences. This achievement is espe- cially impressive because children acquire most of this syntactic knowledge with little or no direct instruction. Nevertheless, mastering natural language syntax may be among the most difficult learning tasks that children face. In adulthood, syntactic knowledge can be characterized by constraints governing the relationship between gram- matical categories of words (such as noun and verb) in a sentence. But acquiring this knowledge presents the child with a \u201cchicken-and-egg\u201d problem: the syn- tactic constraints presuppose the grammatical categories in terms of which they are defined; and the validity of grammatical categories depends on how far they support syntactic constraints. A similar \u201cbootstrapping\u201d prob- lem faces a student learning an academic subject such as physics: understanding momentum or force presup- poses some understanding of the physical laws in which they figure, yet these laws presuppose these very con- cepts. But the bootstrapping problem solved by young children seems vastly more challenging, both because the constraints governing natural language are so intri- cate, and because young children do not have the in- tellectual capacity or explicit instruction available to the academic student. Determining how children accomplish the astonishing feat of language acquisition remains a key question in cognitive science. By 12 months, infants are attuned to the phonolog- ical and prosodic regularities of their native language (Jusczyk, 1997; Kuhl, 1999). This perceptual attunement may provide an essential scaffolding for later learning by biasing children toward aspects of the input that are par- ticularly informative for acquiring grammatical informa- tion. Specifically, we hypothesize that integrating multi- ple probabilistic cues (phonological, prosodic and distri- butional) by perceptually attuned general-purpose learn- ing mechanisms may hold the key to how children solve the bootstrapping problem. Multiple cues can provide re- liable evidence about linguistic structure that is unavail- able from any single source of information. In the remainder of this paper, we first review empir- ical evidence suggesting that infants may use a combi- nation of distributional, phonological and prosodic cues to bootstrap into language. We then report a series of simulations, demonstrating the efficacy of multiple-cue integration within a connectionist framework. Simula- tion 1 shows how multiple-cue integration results in bet- ter, faster and more uniform learning. Simulation 2 es- tablishes that the trained three-cue networks are able to mimic the effect of grammatical and prosodic manipula- tions in a sentence comprehension study with 2-year-olds (Shady & Gerken, 1999). Simulation 3 reveals how pre- natal exposure to gross-level phonological and prosodic input facilitates postnatal learning within the multiple- cue integration framework. Finally, Simulation 4 demon- strates that adding additional distracting cues, irrelevant to the syntactic acquisition task, does not hinder learning. Cues Available for Syntax Acquisition Although some kind of innate knowledge may play a role in language acquisition, it cannot solve the boot- strapping problem. Even with built-in abstract knowl- edge about grammatical categories and syntactic rules (e.g., Pinker, 1984), the bootstrapping problem remains formidable: children must map the right sound strings onto the right grammatical categories while determining the specific syntactic relations between these categories in their native language. Moreover, the item-specific na- ture of early syntactic productions challenges the use- fulness of hypothesized innate grammatical categories", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In J.D.

In order to speed up the process and avoid local minima\u2013which is met in most multilevel optimisation schemes- we replace the system constraints by a surrogate model. Last, a penalty term added in the \"element level\" objective allows us to force the equality of some design variables among all elements. The surrogate is incrementally built along system/element level loops from local optimisation results. For this reason, we choose to use Support Vector Regression methodology, which is more suitable to incremental training and data compression than more classical non-linear regression schemes such as neural networks are. The proposed multilevel strategy is tested on the classical ten bar truss problem; the benchmark structure is subject to several load cases and its weight is minimized under both mechanical and geometrical (equality in detailed variables) constraints. ::: We obtain good results in terms of objective value, convergence time and detailed variables continuity.

If they can be mined and fused sufficiently, performances of related video tasks can be significantly enhanced. However, due to the environmental interference or sensor fault, sometimes, only one modality exists while the other is abandoned or missing. By recovering the missing modality from the existing one based on the common information shared between them and the prior information of the specific modality, great bonus will be gained for various vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CMCGAN) to handle cross-modal visual-audio mutual generation. Specifically, CMCGAN is composed of four kinds of subnetworks: audio-to-visual, visual-to-audio, audio-to-audio and visual-to-visual subnetworks respectively, which are organized in a cycle architecture. CMCGAN has several remarkable advantages. Firstly, CMCGAN unifies visual-audio mutual generation into a common framework by a joint corresponding adversarial loss. Secondly, through introducing a latent vector with Gaussian distribution, CMCGAN can handle dimension and structure asymmetry over visual and audio modalities effectively. Thirdly, CMCGAN can be trained end-to-end to achieve better convenience. Benefiting from CMCGAN, we develop a dynamic multimodal classification network to handle the modality missing problem. Abundant experiments have been conducted and validate that CMCGAN obtains the state-of-the-art cross-modal visual-audio generation results.

Woman within the age of 40\u201369 have more risk of breast cancer. Though breast cancer leads to death, early detection of breast cancer can increase the survival rate. Clustered Microcalcification (MC) in mammograms is the major indication for early detection of breast cancer. MC is quiet tiny bits of calcium, and may show up in clusters or in patterns and is associated with extra cell activity in breast tissue. Usually, the extra cell growth is not cancerous, but sometimes tight clusters of microcalcification can indicate early breast cancer. Individual clusters are difficult to detect, hence an intelligent Computer Aided Detection (CAD) will help the radiologists in detecting the MC clusters in an easy and efficient way. In this paper, we present a new classification approach using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for detection of microcalcification clusters in digital mammograms. Classifying data is a common task in machine learning. SVM is a linear classifier which constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in an infinite dimensional space. The MC detection is formulated as a supervised learning problem and we apply SVM as a classifier to determine at each pixel location in the mammogram if the MC is present or not. To improve the classification rate Law's texture energy measures are taken from the image Region of interest (ROI). Once the features are computed for each ROI, they can be used as input to the SVM classifier. The method was applied to 322 digitized mammographic images from the MIAS database.

In a previously developed version of REALMS, the method interpolated 3D deformation parameters for any credible deformation in a deformation space using a single globally-trained Riemannian metric for each parameter. We propose a refinement of the method in which the metric is trained over a particular region of the deformation space, such that interpolation accuracy within that region is improved. We report on the application of the proposed algorithm to IGRT in abdominal disease sites, which is more challenging than in lung because of low intensity contrast and nonrespiratory deformation. We introduce a rigid translation vector to compensate for nonrespiratory deformation, and design a special region-of-interest around fiducial markers implanted near the tumor to produce a more reliable registration.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the power of UAV-based multimodal data fusion using RGB, multispectral and thermal sensors to estimate soybean (Glycine max) grain yield within the framework of Deep Neural Network (DNN). RGB, multispectral, and thermal images were collected using a low-cost multi-sensory UAV from a test site in Columbia, Missouri, USA.

The results can be summarized in three messages: (1) multimodal data fusion improves the yield prediction accuracy and is more adaptable to spatial variations; (2) DNN-based models improve yield prediction model accuracy: the highest accuracy was obtained by DNN-F2 with an R2 of 0.720 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of 15.9%; (3) DNN-based models were less prone to saturation effects, and exhibited more adaptive performance in predicting grain yields across the Dwight, Pana and AG3432 soybean genotypes in our study.

Methods: Forty-two children with BECTS (21 females, 21 males; mean age, 8.6 \u00b1 1.96 years) were classified into interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs; 11 females, 10 males) and non-IEDs (10 females, 11 males) substates depending on presence of central-temporal spikes or not. GCD was calculated on four metrics, including inflow, outflow, total-flow (inflow + outflow) and int-flow (inflow - outflow) connectivity. SVM classifier was applied to discriminate the two substates. Results: The Rolandic area, caudate, dorsal attention network, visual cortex, language networks, and cerebellum had discriminative effect on distinguishing the two substates. Relative to each of the four GCD metrics, using combinedmetrics could reach up the classification performance (best value; AUC, 0.928; accuracy rate, 90.83%; sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 95%), especially for the combinations with more than three metrics. Specially, combined the inflow, outflow and int-flow metric received the best classification performance with the highest AUC value, classification accuracy and specificity. Furthermore, the GCD-SVM model received good and stable classification performance across fourteen dimension reduced data sets. Conclusions: The GCD-SVM model could be used for BECTS substate classification, which might have the potential to provide a promising model for IEDs detection.

We focus on interpretability, noting that models often need to be constrained in size for them to be considered understandable, e.g., a decision tree of depth 5 is easier to interpret than one of depth 50. This suggests a trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. We propose a technique to minimize this tradeoff. Our strategy is to first learn a powerful, possibly black-box, probabilistic model on the data, which we refer to as the oracle. We use this to adaptively sample the training dataset to present data to our model of interest to learn from. Determining the sampling strategy is formulated as an optimization problem that, independent of the dimensionality of the data, uses only seven variables. We empirically show that this often significantly increases the accuracy of our model. Our technique is model agnostic - in that, both the interpretable model and the oracle might come from any model family. Results using multiple real world datasets, using Linear Probability Models and Decision Trees as interpretable models, and Gradient Boosted Model and Random Forest as oracles are presented.

Illegal logging is one of the ecological concerns related to the forest protection in Indonesia. In some cases, the illegal logging is almost impossible to be early identified by only physical inspection from the forestry staffs due to the field difficulty to reach the location. For this reason, the image processing by means Expert System using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method might be helpful to early identify the illegal logging activity. The sample image used in this research is taken from the Google Earth for one location of river basin area in Indonesia with the size area of 560m x 375m. The procedure of identification system is started by cropping the digital image and then classified for retrieving two-halves of the image in the form of forest and non-forest.

The simulation result shows that SVM method is able to early identify of illegal logging activity in protected forest areas with a level of accuracy of 80%.

Their accuracy and processing speed are further compared against a laptop computer using our cross-platform \u2018DataBench\u2019 software. Results show that smartphones not only deliver classification accuracy equal to that of more powerful computers when using the same algorithms, as expected, but also, as many as 75% of the 180 algorithm/dataset learning tasks tested were completed on smartphone hardware within three seconds. However, tests further show that the increased complexity of newer algorithms searching for ever greater classification accuracy is resulting in model-build times growing at an exponential rate. Additional testing identified that while a single algorithm execution can have negligible effect on battery life, power efficiency is affected by algorithm complexity, data size and attribute type. The increased processing demand of local model-learning on smartphones also results in increased power dissipation. Yet, even on a continuous-loop execution basis, mobile temperature gains over a 15-min period did not exceed 7 \u00b0C. Our conclusion is that smartphones are ready to form self-reliant mobile data-mining solutions able to efficiently execute a wide range of classification algorithms. This offers numerous advantages, including data security and privacy improvements, removal of reliance on network connectivity and delivery of personalised learning.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-6661-1_26", "venue": "AusDM", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2911749033", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["182952575"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67750287"}

The analysis of statistical data on sequential data points measured at regular time interval over a period of time is time series analysis. Time series analysis is used in predicting future occurrence of a time based event. One of the main areas where time series analysis is implied is in stock market prediction. The two important classification ways are Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes. SVM is a method used for the foreseeing of financial time based data sets. It uses a function called risk which contains a mistake and a term. The basic principle which is used to obtain this may be called as minimization of structural risk. Naive Bayes model assigns class labels for problem instances which can be denoted as vectors of feature measurements. For a given group variable, it takes into consideration that the numerical record of a specified feature is unique of others. Purpose of the present investigation is to develop an ensemble model namely AdaSVM and AdaNaive to analyse the stock data by comparing SVM and Naive Bayes methods. The performance evaluation measures such as accuracy and classification error were computed individually for the stock market data set.

The weakness of these solutions can have an adverse impact on the energy consumption and computation complexity of power-limited devices such as smartphones, and may provide coarse-grained results. In this paper, we present a new method to reduce both the energy consumption and the computation complexity, and improve the recognition accuracy of vehicle steering patterns using the following three improvements: 1) a MultiWave filter is designed to replace the fixed sliding window, which is used to identify vehicle steering events; 2) a set of eight statistical sensor features reflecting the vehicle steering modes are identified by extracting statistical features from different sensors and different axes; 3) different machine learning methods are compared based on this feature set in order to improve classifier training (Decision Tree and Random Forest). Evaluation results based on real vehicle datasets show that our improved classifiers have high real-time recognition accuracy of the five most common steering modes: left/right turns, left/right lane changes and U-turns.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) adopts a unique diagnostic method, namely 'bian zheng lun zhi' or syndrome differentiation, to diagnose the CF with a set of syndrome factors, which can be regarded as the Multi-Label Learning (MLL) problem in the machine learning literature. To obtain an effective and reliable diagnostic tool, we use Conformal Predictor (CP), Random Forest (RF) and Problem Transformation method (PT) for the syndrome differentiation of CF. ::: ::: ::: METHODS AND MATERIALS ::: In this work, using PT method, CP-RF is extended to handle MLL problem. CP-RF applies RF to measure the confidence level (p-value) of each label being the true label, and then selects multiple labels whose p-values are larger than the pre-defined significance level as the region prediction. In this paper, we compare the proposed CP-RF with typical CP-NBC(Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier), CP-KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) and ML-KNN on CF dataset, which consists of 736 cases. Specifically, 95 symptoms are used to identify CF, and four syndrome factors are employed in the syndrome differentiation, including 'spleen deficiency', 'heart deficiency', 'liver stagnation' and 'qi deficiency'. ::: ::: ::: THE RESULTS ::: CP-RF demonstrates an outstanding performance beyond CP-NBC, CP-KNN and ML-KNN under the general metrics of subset accuracy, hamming loss, one-error, coverage, ranking loss and average precision. Furthermore, the performance of CP-RF remains steady at the large scale of confidence levels from 80% to 100%, which indicates its robustness to the threshold determination. In addition, the confidence evaluation provided by CP is valid and well-calibrated. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: CP-RF not only offers outstanding performance but also provides valid confidence evaluation for the CF syndrome differentiation.

The accuracy of the prediction algorithms to detect seizure in real-world applications is largely limited because the brain signals are inherently uncertain and affected by various factors, such as environment, age, drug intake, etc., in addition to the internal artefacts that occur during the process of recording the brain signals. To deal with such ambiguity, researchers transitionally use active learning, which selects the ambiguous data to be annotated by an expert and updates the classification model dynamically. However, selecting the particular data from a pool of large ambiguous datasets to be labelled by an expert is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an active learning-based prediction framework that aims to improve the accuracy of the prediction with a minimum number of labelled data. The core technique of our framework is employing the Bernoulli-Gaussian Mixture model (BGMM) to determine the feature samples that have the most ambiguity to be annotated by an expert.

Transfer learning is a knowledge learning method that leverages knowledge learned from a source task to improve learning on a related but different target task.

The DCNN-TL model is then fine-tuned and re-trained to produce accurate capacity estimation on a target dataset (NASA data).

To effectively silence a target gene, it is desirable to select appropriate initiator siRNA molecules having satisfactory silencing capabilities. Computational prediction for silencing efficacy of siRNAs can assist this screening process before using them in biological experiments. String kernel functions, which operate directly on the string objects representing siRNAs and target mRNAs, have been applied to support vector regression for the prediction and improved accuracy over numerical kernels in multidimensional vector spaces constructed from descriptors of siRNA design rules. To fully utilize information provided by string and numerical data, we propose to unify the two in a kernel feature space by devising a multiple kernel regression framework where a linear combination of the kernels is used. We formulate the multiple kernel learning into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which although yields global optimal solution, is computationally demanding and requires a commercial solver package. We further propose three heuristics based on the principle of kernel-target alignment and predictive accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that multiple kernel regression can improve accuracy, decrease model complexity by reducing the number of support vectors, and speed up computational performance dramatically. In addition, multiple kernel regression evaluates the importance of constituent kernels, which for the siRNA efficacy prediction problem, compares the relative significance of the design rules.

Many classification techniques such as decision tree and neural networks proposed for an early detection of individual at risk for CHD are not able to continuously detect heart state based on sensor data stream. In this study, we propose an online three-layer neural network to recognize Heart Rate Variability (HRV) patterns related to CHD risk in consideration of daily activities. ECG sensor data is preprocessed using Poincare plot encoding. Incremental learning is utilized to train the network with new data without forgetting the previously learned patterns. The algorithm is named Poincare-based HRV patterns discovering Incremental Artificial neural Network (PHIAN). When a sample is presented, the nodes in the hidden layer of PHIAN compete for determining the node with the highest similarity to the input. Error variables associated with the neuron units are used as criteria for new node insertion in hopes of allowing the network to learn new patterns and reducing classification error. However, the node insertion has to be stopped in the overlapping decision areas. We suppose that the overlaps between classes have lower probability than the centric part of the classes. Therefore, after a period of learning we remove the nodes with no neighbor. Plus, the error probability density is taken into account instead of input probability density. Finally, the predictive capability of PHIAN is compared with three previous classification models, namely Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Growing Neural Gas (GNG), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in terms of classification error and network structure.

In this paper, we consider both the above two points and propose a novel approach. Specially, we select the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as our generative model. In order to improve the quality of synthesized samples, considering the internal relation of the semantic description in the semantic space as well as the fact that the seen and unseen visual information belong to different domains, we propose a bi-semantic reconstructing (BSR) component which contain two different semantic reconstructing regressors to lead the training of GAN. Since the semantic descriptions are available during the training stage, to further improve the ability of classifier, we combine the visual samples and semantic descriptions to train a classifier. At the recognition stage, we naturally utilize the BSR component to transfer the visual features and semantic descriptions, and concatenate them for classification.

Costs due to scaling and remedial actions that need to be taken afterward are generally high owing to low solubility of SrSO4 in aqueous solutions. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the SrSO4 thermodynamic behavior under various operating conditions is vital to predict or even avoid the overall damage caused by scaling. The primary aim of this work is to develop a model based on Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) referred to as CSA-LSSVM to predict strontium sulfate solubility as a function of pressure, temperature and ionic compositions. In this context, we have employed almost 1641 experimental data regarding strontium sulfate solubility to build a comprehensive model and to evaluate its reliability. The results show that the proposed model has a better performance in comparison with pre-existing empirical correlations used for predicting SrSO4 solubility and it is also in well accordance with experimental measurements. A comparison was also drawn between predictions of Pitzer ion interaction model with CSA-LSSVM model forecasts in terms of sensitivity analysis and single point solubility predictions.

A fall can lead to severe injuries, long term impairments or even death in some cases. In terms of machine learning, it presents a severely class imbalance problem with very few or no training data for falls owing to the fact that falls occur rarely. In this paper, we take an alternate philosophy to detect falls in the absence of their training data, by training the classifier on only the normal activities (that are available in abundance) and identifying a fall as an anomaly. To realize such a classifier, we use an adversarial learning framework, which comprises of a spatio-temporal autoencoder for reconstructing input video frames and a spatio-temporal convolution network to discriminate them against original video frames. 3D convolutions are used to learn spatial and temporal features from the input video frames. The adversarial learning of the spatio-temporal autoencoder will enable reconstructing the normal activities of daily living efficiently; thus, rendering detecting unseen falls plausible within this framework. We tested the performance of the proposed framework on camera sensing modalities that may preserve an individual's privacy (fully or partially), such as thermal and depth camera.

As pairwise rank is a position-independent algorithm, it does not consider Top-N ranking sufficiently. Recommendation task is position-dependent. Especially the Top-N item ranking accuracy is much more important than the ranking accuracy of the tail item. In this paper, we propose LambdaGAN for Top-N recommendation.

Nevertheless, a major drawback of these SVMs is the large number of hyperparameters if no simplifying assumptions are made, which prevents from using standard selection methods as grid or random searches. In particular, both the common kernel and the kernels associated to each one of the tasks have to be selected. In this paper, we propose an approach to choose these kernels based on Gaussian Processes (GPs), whose Bayesian perspective allows one to deal naturally with several parameters.

Autonomous vehicles can mitigate the losses by making appropriate emergency decision, and the crash injury severity prediction model is the basis for autonomous vehicles to make decisions in emergency situations.

The vehicle relative speed (REL_SPEED) and the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) are introduced into the impact indicators of the prediction models. Secondly, the ordered logit (OL) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models are established to validate the accuracy of the SVM models.

The contribution of our work is to show that good classification performance on big data, across different application domains, can be achieved without too much alteration to the original dataset. In order to demonstrate good classification performance with big data, we process four datasets, from different domains, generating several imbalanced variants. Five new imbalanced big datasets, with target positive classes of 10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001%, were created from each original full dataset to study information loss introduced in traditional random undersampling. Random undersampling is applied to balance the binary class in each of the created imbalance datasets generating 50:50 class ratios. All models were built using the Random Forest classifier, using the Spark and H2O machine learning libraries, and performance was recorded to find good ratios for undersampling big data without discarding too much of the majority class. We provide a comparison of all models created from the prepared datasets, generating 4,488 models. We conclude that, in terms of imbalanced data, from 0.1% to 1.0% of the minority class, adequate performance is obtained even when compared to 10% or even 100% of the full balanced data set.

However, even today, the relationships between lncRNAs and diseases remain unknown in most cases. Developing effective computational approaches to identify potential lncRNA-disease associations has become a hot topic. Existing network-based approaches are usually focused on the intrinsic features of lncRNAs and diseases but ignore the heterogeneous information of biological networks. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we propose LDAH2V, an efficient computational framework for predicting potential lncRNA-disease associations. LDAH2V uses the HIN2Vec to calculate the meta-path and feature vector for each lncRNA-disease pair in the heterogeneous information network (HIN), which consists of lncRNA similarity network, disease similarity network, miRNA similarity network, and the associations between them.

In this work, we argue that ensembles are a very general concept, and though they have been widely used, they can be applied in more situations than they have been to date. Rather than using them only to combine the output of an algorithm, we can apply them to decisions made inside the algorithm itself, during the learning step. We call this approach Inner Ensembles. The motivation to develop Inner Ensembles was the opportunity to produce models with the similar advantages as regular ensembles, accuracy and stability for example, plus additional advantages such as comprehensibility, simplicity, rapid classification and small memory footprint. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate how broadly this idea can be applied, and highlight its potential impact on all types of algorithms. To support our claim, we first provide a general guideline for applying Inner Ensembles to different algorithms. Then, using this framework, we apply them to two categories of learning methods: supervised and un-supervised. For the former we chose Bayesian network, and for the latter K-Means clustering.

Connectionist models of the development of alphabetic reading and spelling in normal and dyslexic children are described. The models learn to associate representations of word pronunciations with spellings. The models learn to read and spell regular words more quickly than irregular items. When the computational resources available to such models are restricted, the models learn more slowly and fail to learn some of the irregular items in their vocabularies. The restricted models behave analogously to developmental dyslexics, and, crucially, have selective deficits with non-word processing although they do not show reduced sound-to-spelling or spelling-to-sound regularity effects. This is consistent with the experimental literature. Experimental evidence is reported that shows that both normal and dyslexic children of various ages have difficulties with reading and spelling particular word types that are similar to the problems experienced by the models on the same words. The good fit between model and data is taken as evidence that, throughout much of the relevant developmental period, the task facing children can be usefully viewed as a statistical one. The level of difficulty posed by particular words in spelling is well predicted by the extent to which those words conform to the relevant regularities of the language.

In the present work, we develop a machine learning algorithm using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify subjects with Asperger\u2019s disorder from normal subjects in a more objective and automated manner. Methods Written informed consent as approved by the Emory University IRB was obtained for all subjects prior to enrollment in the study. Resting-state fMRI scan data was collected from 7 subjects with Asperger\u2019s disorder and 17 normal (healthy control) subjects on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner. Acquisition parameters : FOV 22cm, matrix size 64x64, in-plane resolution 3.4x3.4 mm, 10 contiguous 5-mm thick axial slices, TR 750ms, TE 35ms, flip angle 50 degree, total scan time 3.5 minutes, 280 volumes collected. For each patient, a correlation map was generated by computing the correlation between the time series of each voxel and that of a seed voxel taken from the posterior cingulate cortex (MNI: -2, -51, 17). The correlation values were normalized using Fisher z-transformation, and the resulting z-maps were transformed into MNI space using SPM [4]. Different combinations of preprocessing methods were then applied prior to performing SVM training: 1) taking absolute correlation values, 2) smoothing with a Gaussian kernel with FWHM of 6 voxels, 3) spatial masking of correlation values to include only regions in the default mode network. The processed correlation maps were then used to train an SVM model, using a linear kernel in libSVM [3] and 3dSVM in AFNI [5,6]. Leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOOCV) was then performed to estimate the classification performance for each combination of the preprocessing choices. Weight vector maps were generated in each case. Results The resultant classification accuracy values for each combination of the preprocessing methods are presented in Table 1, with the highest classification accuracy using all three preprocessing methods, with only one misclassification. Figure 1 shows an example of the weight vector map for one preprocessing combination (number 5). The top 10% of the positive weights are superimposed on normalized brain data as shown in the figure.

The solution of two modified unconstrained minimization problems reduces to solving just two systems of linear equations as opposed to solving two quadratic programming problems in TWSVM and TBSVM, which leads to extremely simple and fast algorithm.

Since the parameters of OCSVM directly affect the performance of the model, it is necessary to optimize the parameters of OCSVM in mineral prospectivity mapping. Trial and error method is usually used to determine the \u201coptimal\u201d parameters of OCSVM. However, it is difficult to find the globally optimal parameters by the trial and error method. By combining OCSVM with the bat algorithm, the intialization parameters of the OCSVM can be automatically optimized. The combined model is called bat-optimized OCSVM. In this model, the area under the curve (AUC) of OCSVM is taken as the fitness value of the objective function optimized by the bat algorithm, the value ranges of the initialization parameters of OCSVM are used to specify the search space of bat population, and the optimal parameters of OCSVM are automatically determined through the iterative search process of the bat algorithm. The bat-optimized OCSVMs were used to map mineral prospectivity of the Helong district, Jilin Province, China, and compared with the OCSVM initialized by the default parameters (i.e., common OCSVM) and the OCSVM optimized by trial and error. The results show that (a) the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the trial and error-optimized OCSVM is intersected with those of the bat-optimized OCSVMs and (b) the ROC curves of the optimized OCSVMs slightly dominate that of the common OCSVM in the ROC space. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the common and trial and error-optimized OCSVMs (0.8268 and 0.8566) are smaller than those of the bat-optimized ones (0.8649 and 0.8644). The optimal threshold for extracting mineral targets was determined by using the Youden index. The mineral targets predicted by the common and trial and error-optimized OCSVMs account for 29.61% and 18.66% of the study area respectively, and contain 93% and 86% of the known mineral deposits. The mineral targets predicted by the bat-optimized OCSVMs account for 19.84% and 14.22% of the study area respectively, and also contain 93% and 86% of the known mineral deposits.

Rapid expansion of ERC has major impacts on the species composition and forest structure within this region and suppresses previously dominant oak (Quercus) species. In Kansas, the growing-stock volume of ERC increased by 15,000% during 1965\u20132010. The overarching goal of this study was to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of ERC in the forest\u2013prairie ecotone of Kansas and understand its effects on deciduous forests. This was achieved through two specific objectives: i) characterize an effective image classification approach to map ERC expansion, and ii) assess ERC expansion between 1986 and 2017 in three study areas within the forest\u2013prairie ecotone of Kansas, and especially expansion into deciduous forests. The analysis was based on satellite imagery acquired by Landsat TM and OLI sensors during 1986\u20132017. The use of multi-seasonal layer-stacks with a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-supervised classification was found to be the most effective approach to classify ERC distribution with high accuracy. The overall accuracies for the change maps generated for the three study areas ranged between 0.95 (95 CI: \u00b10.02) and 0.96 (\u00b10.03). The total ERC cover increased in excess of 6000 acres in each study area during the 30-year period. The estimated percent increase of ERC cover was 139%, 539%, and 283% for the Tuttle Creek reservoir, Perry reservoir, and Bourbon County north study areas, respectively. This astounding rate of expansion had significant impacts on the deciduous forests where the conversion of deciduous woodlands to ERC, as a percentage of the total encroachment, were 48%, 56%, and 71%, for the Tuttle Creek reservoir, Perry reservoir, and Bourbon County north study areas, respectively.

Methods/Analysis : In this paper, we proposed a credit scoring model based on parallel Random Forest classifier and feature selection method to evaluate the credit risks of applicants. By integration of Random Forest into feature selection process, the importance of features can be accurately evaluated to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Findings: In this research, an algorithm to select best features was developed by using the best average and median scores and the lowest standard deviation as the rules of feature scoring. Consequently, the dimension of features can be reduced to the smallest possible number that allows of a remarkable runtime reduction. Thus the proposed model can perform feature selection and model parameters optimization at the same time to improve its efficiency. The performance of our proposed model was experimentally assessed using two public datasets which are Australian and German datasets. The obtained results showed that an improved accuracy of the proposed model compared to other commonly used feature selection methods. In particular, our method can attain the average accuracy of 76.2% with a significantly reduced running time of 72 minutes on German credit dataset and the highest average accuracy of 89.4% with the running time of only 50 minutes on Australian credit dataset.

However, it is difficult to design an effective feature representation to describe these data because they have multi-modal property (e.g., text, image, video, and audio) and multi-domain property (e.g., Flickr, Google, and YouTube).

First, it can process polysemous words in a better way than a vector representation. A network of a polysemous term is regarded as a combination of sub-networks that represent senses and the appropriate sub-network is identified by context before compared by the kernel. Second, the representation permits not only words but also senses or contexts to be represented directly from corresponding set of terms.

Early information on short-term inward bed demand from patients receiving care at the ED may reduce the overcrowding problem, and optimize the use of hospital resources. In this study, we use text mining methods to process data from early ED patient records using the SOAP framework, and predict future hospitalizations and discharges. Design We try different approaches for pre-processing of text records and to predict hospitalization. Sets-of-words are obtained via binary representation, term frequency, and term frequency-inverse document frequency. Unigrams, bigrams and trigrams are tested for feature formation. Feature selection is based on \u03c7 2 and F-score metrics. In the prediction module, eight text mining methods are tested: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Tree, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (Kernel linear) and Nu-Support Vector Machine (Kernel linear). Measurements Prediction performance is evaluated by F1-scores. Precision and Recall values are also informed for all text mining methods tested. Results Nu-Support Vector Machine was the text mining method with the best overall performance. Its average F1-score in predicting hospitalization was 77.70%, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.66%.

In this work we generate complete image-level MasterPrints known as DeepMasterPrints, whose attack accuracy is found to be much superior than that of previous methods. The proposed method, referred to as Latent Variable Evolution, is based on training a Generative Adversarial Network on a set of real fingerprint images. Stochastic search in the form of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy is then used to search for latent input variables to the generator network that can maximize the number of impostor matches as assessed by a fingerprint recognizer.

Riding position of upper body as well as leg motion is very important for cycling because it has a substantial impact on air resistance and physical fatigue (Burke & Pruitt, 2003). Although camera-based motion capture systems are the most popular solution to measure riders\u2019 position during cycling, they limit the range of motion and cannot be applied to actual outdoor cycling. In this study, we aim for developing a bike--mountable position estimation system. For this purpose, as a first step, we propose a method for estimation of handgrip position based on the force measurement during steady pedaling. Wattbike Trainer (Wattbike Ltd.) was used for our prototype system. A 6-- \u2010 axis force/torque Sensor (BFS067XS102EU6S, Leptrino) was installed at an ahead- \u2010 stem to measure the forces and torques loaded on the handlebar. According to the preliminary experiments, three parameters\u2013 \ud835\udc39 ! , \ud835\udc39 ! ,!\u2013were chosen for the estimation. The proposed system classifies the observed data into three classes corresponding to the positions of handgrip, such as drops, hoods, and tops (Fig. 1) based on the SVM (Support Vector Machine) (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995), which is one of the most powerful machine learning techniques Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Four amateur male cyclists (mean 45.5 years old) participated in the experiments. The experiments consist of two phases, such as a learning phase and a test phase. To construct an SVM classifier, 60 seconds learning data for each handgrip position was collected at 100Hz for each participant in the learning phase. In the test phase, participants changed their handgrip positions every 30 seconds and steadily pedaled 6 minutes in total. Based on the individually learned SVM classifier, the system estimated the handgrip position at each sampling time. In both phases, the pedaling load and cadence were set according to each participant\u2019s preference. Table 1 shows a confusion matrix of the experimental results. The proposed method achieves both high precision and recall. According to the experimental results, the proposed method can estimate the handgrip position with high reliability during steady pedaling.

Recent advancements in the field of Natural Language Understanding has made it possible to build conversational components that can be plugged inside an application, similar to other components. These components, called chatbots, can be created from scratch or with the help of commercially available platforms. These platforms make it easier to build and deploy chatbots, often without writing a single line of code. However, similar to any other software component, chatbots also have quality concerns. Despite significant contributions in the field, an architectural perspective of building chatbots with desired quality requirements is missing in the literature. In the current work, we highlight the impact of features provided by these platforms (along with their quality) on the application design process and overall quality attributes. We propose a methodological framework to evaluate support provided by a chatbot platform towards achieving quality in the application. The framework, called Hospitality Framework, is based on software architectural body of knowledge, especially architectural tactics. The framework produces a metric, called Hospitality Index, which has utilities for making various design decisions for the overall application. We present the use of our framework on a simple use case to highlight the phases of evaluation.

The space of possible policies, even under such structured representations, is huge and must be searched carefully to avoid computationally expensive policy simulations (rollouts). In our recent work, we proposed a method for directed exploration of policy space using support vector classifiers, whereby rollouts are directed to states around the boundaries between different action choices indicated by the separating hyperplanes in the represented policies. While effective, this method suffers from the growing number of support vectors in the underlying classifiers as the number of training examples increases. In this paper, we propose an alternative method for directed policy search based on relevance vector machines. Relevance vector machines are used both for classification (to represent a policy) and regression (to approximate the corresponding relative action advantage function). Classification is enhanced by anomaly detection for accurate policy representation. Exploiting the internal structure of the regressor, we guide the probing of the state space only to critical areas corresponding to changes of action dominance in the underlying policy.

Thus far, there has been little investigation into just how important these factors are. In this paper, we investigate the impact of target dataset size and source/target domain similarity on model performance through a series of experiments. We find that more data is always beneficial, and model performance improves linearly with the log of data size, until we are out of data. As source/target domains differ, more data is required and fine tuning will render better performance than feature extraction. When source/target domains are similar and data size is small, fine tuning and feature extraction renders equivalent performance.

To tackle this problem, name disambiguation task was proposed to correctly distinguish the papers, thus making papers contained in each part belongs to a unique researcher. Certain information sources can help disambiguate researchers, e.g., CoResearcher, affiliation, homepages and paper titles. However, such information sources may be costly to obtain or unavailable. Therefore, it is necessary to solve name disambiguation task under the condition of insufficient information sources. Another challenge is how to accomplish the task without knowing the number of distinct researchers. In this paper, we sufficiently use the relational network between papers.

Most of these types of cancer begin as abnormal growth of tissue called as polyp. Colonography uses low dose radiation Computed tomography (CT) scanning to obtain an interior view of the colon making use of special x-ray machine to view the large intestine for cancer and abnormal growths known as polyps. Radiologists examine these images to find polyp like structure using computer tools. As CT Colonography image contain noise such as lungs, small intestine, instruments during image capturing; segmenting colon from noise is the key task. Polyp occurrence can be detected mainly using shape feature; eliminating shapes similar to polyp is challenging. Hence, to tackle above issues, Image processing techniques are used by applying deep learning algorithm - Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the results are compared with classical machine learning algorithm. In proposed method, each image is pre-processed to filter air filled dark region that includes colon, lungs etc. Next, each pre-processed CT Image separated into fixed number of blocks. Using pre-trained CNN, each block of ROI is classified as Type 1 (Usually Ascending and descending colon), Type 2 (Usually Traversal and sigmoidal colon) and Type3 (Noise such as lungs, instruments) to segment colon blocks by eliminating noise. Classified Blocks is further diagnosed for polyp like structure using pre-trained CNN by classifying each colon block as normal or abnormal. The experiment is setup with classical machine learning algorithms - Random Forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) by extracting texture feature - Local binary pattern (LBP) and shape feature - Histogram oriented gradient (HOG) for comparison. The experiment results showed the accuracy of proposed method for colon segmentation using CNN (87%) outperforms RF (85%) and KNN (83%). In, addition, the polyp detection accuracy of CNN (88%) is better than Random forest (85%) and KNN (80%). Hence, in the proposed method, there is significant accuracy improvement using deep learning algorithm compared to classical machine learning algorithms.

The implemented training hardware is introduced as an accelerator intellectual property (IP), especially in the case of large number of training sets, such as neural seizure detection. Feature extraction and classification blocks are implemented to achieve the best trade-off between sensitivity and power consumption.

This training allows CGANs to generate samples from a sequence of distributions. We apply our method to paintings from a sequence of artistic movements, where each movement is considered to be its own distribution. Exploiting the temporal aspect of the data, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model is fitted to the means of the latent distributions that we learn, and used for one-step-ahead forecasting, to predict the latent distribution of a future art movement $f^{(K+1)}$. Realisations from this distribution can be used by the CGAN to generate \"future\" paintings. In experiments, this novel methodology generates accurate predictions of the evolution of art. The training set consists of a large dataset of past paintings.

This setting can be frequently found in practice, for example when movies or books are assessed on a one-to-five star rating in multiple categories. In this paper, we propose to reformulate the problem in terms of preferences between the labels and their scales, which can then be tackled by learning from pair wise comparisons. We present three different approaches which make use of this decomposition and show on three datasets that we are able to outperform baseline approaches. In particular, we show that our solution, which is able to model pair wise preferences across multiple scales, outperforms a straight-forward approach which considers the problem as a set of independent ordinal regression tasks.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2014.102", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2072707985", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["22998", "4758915", "38695940", "228753", "207211581", "12269265", "1478307"], "inbound_citations": ["204809530", "3299182", "3039526", "228753", "15570868"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:228753"}

We applied this method to the rs-fMRI data of 66 normal healthy subjects and 66 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) to identify potential biomarkers at both local circuit and global network level. Results suggest that the recurrent excitation and inhibition within the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) might be disrupted in MDD, consistent with the commonly accepted hypothetical model of MDD. In addition, recurrent excitation in the thalamus was found to be abnormally elevated, which may be responsible to abnormal thalamocortical oscillations often observed in MDD.

Many algorithms for bacteria classification are designed for the needs of analysis of large-scale microscopic image bacteria. However, the biologist interpretation is suffered from insufficient information and thus may lead to limited accuracy in the bacteria classification process. To handle this drawback, machine learning tools, and image analysis approaches tackled identification of different bacteria species for improving the clinical microbiology investigation. In the proposed study, 200 bacterial images for ten different bacteria species with 20 images for each specie are extracted from DIBaS (Digital Images of Bacteria Species dataset). This proposed framework is divided into image preprocessing phase which obtained by histogram equalization, feature extraction by Bag-of-words model and classification phase by Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main objective is to enhance the bacterial images and find the image feature descriptors from the enhanced images which allowing to classify the bacterial images. The experimental results provided an average accuracy of 97% with classifier speed for automated detection and classification of bacterial images which would greatly reduce the disease outbreaks in future researches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/cibec.2018.8641799", "venue": "2018 9th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference (CIBEC)", "journal": "2018 9th Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference (CIBEC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2912222853", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2407742", "7740409", "3640588", "26156737", "8359749", "45978983", "24085261", "18383835", "205287434", "62561950", "31121298", "461853", "1195235", "12997771", "113362445"], "inbound_citations": ["209695629", "209404992"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61810577"}

In this paper, we present a deep learning-based system that enhances the capability of search mechanisms by classifying algorithm-specific metadata, such as accuracy, precision and recall, and further details such as the datasets that they operate on and the time complexity - from full-text publications. Specifically, in contrast to traditional term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) based approach that uses frequent terms as in 'bag of words' models, we first generated a synopsis of the full-text document and then enriched it with sentences that classify as algorithm-specific metadata from full-text to improve algorithmic-specific searching capabilities. These sentences were classified from deep learning based bi-directional long short-term memory network (LSTM) model. Our bi-directional LSTM model outperformed Support Vector Machine (SVM) by 9.46 % with 0.81 F-measure in classifying 37,000 algorithm-specific metadata lines, annotated by four human experts. Finally, we present a case study on 21,940 full-text publications downloaded from the full-text repository of the ACL (https://aclweb.org/) to show the advantages of a deep learning-based advanced searching system over conventional TF-IDF-based (Lucene) text-retrieval systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00186", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2913933021", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4544334", "13798675", "43173151", "136955", "5437729", "16807126", "2338621", "23391739", "15568379", "6722508", "14923224", "7857660", "8518913", "4698432", "207242563", "32794637", "23786433", "4869985", "16092577", "15568379", "58960973"], "inbound_citations": ["66883666"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61811677"}

A critical short coming of \"smart pigs\" is the inability to monitor continuously and predict the onset of defects. The emergence of permanently installed long range ultrasonics transducers systems enable continuous monitoring to be achieved.

Our test attained a MAP score of over 30% in the official results. This note is not a self-contained paper, since our system was largely the same as used in BirdCLEF 2014 and described in detail elsewhere. The method uses raw audio without segmentation and without using any auxiliary metadata. and successfully classifies among 999 bird categories. The BirdCLEF 2015 challenge, as part of the LifeCLEF evaluation campaign [1], challenged researchers to build systems which could classify audio files across 999 bird species encountered in South America. For our participation we submitted a single run from our classifier based on unsupervised feature learning and random forest classifier. This was broadly as used in BirdCLEF 2014, and described in detail in [3]. We refer the reader to that paper for a full system description. We used a single instance of the twolayer unsupervised feature learning process. Figure 1 illustrates the main steps involved in processing. Differences from the 2014 system included: \u2013 in the downsampling step between the two feature-learning layers, we used L2 pooling rather than max-pooling, which gave a slight improvement; \u2013 we reduced the size of our random forest to 100 due to memory constraints. Our system is fully streaming except for the construction of the random forest; in future it would be interesting to use a streamed implementation such as [2]. Our unsupervised feature learning scales well with increasing data size: linearly, as described in the main paper. However, in our case, due to the compute resources available in the time leading up to the competition deadline we were not able to submit more than one run, nor to apply model averaging. Our own tests using a two-fold split of the training data confirmed an observation that we made in [3]: adding more layers gives a benefit up to a certain limit, which appears to be related to the size of the available data set. In our tests (Figure 2) the available data appeared insufficient to support a three-layer variant, hence we submitted a two-layer run.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CLEF", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2398806721", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["5857499"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4151107"}

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been studied recently for the detection of driver drowsiness. However, the detection reliability has been lower than anticipated, because the HRV signals of drivers were always regarded as stationary signals. The wavelet transform method is a method for analyzing non-stationary signals. The aim of this study is to classify alert and drowsy driving events using the wavelet transform of HRV signals over short time periods and to compare the classification performance of this method with the conventional method that uses fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based features. Based on the standard shortest duration for FFT-based short-term HRV evaluation, the wavelet decomposition is performed on 2-min HRV samples, as well as 1-min and 3-min samples for reference purposes. A receiver operation curve (ROC) analysis and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier are used for feature selection and classification, respectively. The ROC analysis results show that the wavelet-based method performs better than the FFT-based method regardless of the duration of the HRV sample that is used. Finally, based on the real-time requirements for driver drowsiness detection, the SVM classifier is trained using eighty FFT and wavelet-based features that are extracted from 1-min HRV signals from four subjects. The averaged leave-one-out (LOO) classification performance using wavelet-based feature is 95% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, and 95% specificity. This is better than the FFT-based results that have 68.8% accuracy, 62.5% sensitivity, and 75% specificity.

However, due to the nonstationarity of wind power series, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, leading to increased uncertainties and risks for system operation. This paper proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation. To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identified with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR), amongst many areas in pattern recognition could well benefit from this phenomenon. Conventional method applied in continuous speech recognition (CSR) uses frame-based statistical framework, namely the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Frame-based approach promises accurate segmentation of the sub-word units (eg: phoneme, syllable) which eventually contributes to the recognition accuracy. Despite these advantages, as each frame size is incredibly small, the system consumes valuable time to build-up or recognizes individual word from several frames. Although segment-based HMM overcomes this hindrance, complexity of the training procedure increases as well as being higher on computational load. Our solution is to extend the size of acoustic event that expands over several frames incrementally thus making the SVM dynamic. We refer the procedure as SVM-DSW (dynamic shifting window). Recognition is determined via voting the highest posterior probability score provided by SVM for a word segment. Artifacts collected from SVM-DSW are the word segmentation. Whereas, when the score deteriorates it signifies the start of a new word hence explaining the segmentation module.

In order to reduce the number of animal tests, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are strongly encouraged in the assessment of skin sensitization of chemicals. This paper has investigated the skin sensitization potential of 162 compounds with LLNA results and 92 compounds with GPMT results using a support vector machine. A particle swarm optimization algorithm was implemented for feature selection from a large number of molecular descriptors calculated by Dragon. For the LLNA data set, the classification accuracies are 95.37% and 88.89% for the training and the test sets, respectively. For the GPMT data set, the classification accuracies are 91.80% and 90.32% for the training and the test sets, respectively.

This concept is considered a research hotspot in the field of data stream mining. Data streams are characterized as having continuous data arrival, rapid speed, large scale, and cannot be completely stored in memory simultaneously. A summary is often formed in the memory to approximate the database query or data mining task. A sampling technique is a commonly used method for constructing data stream summaries. Traditional simple random sampling algorithms do not consider the conceptual drift of data distributions that change over time. Therefore, a challenging task is sampling the summary of the data distribution in multi-dimensional data streams of a concept drift. This study proposes a sampling algorithm that ensures the consistency of the data distribution with the data streams of the concept drift. First, probability statistics is used on the data stream cells in the reference window to obtain data distribution. A probability sampling is performed on the basis of this distribution. Second, the sliding window is used to continuously detect whether the data distribution has changed. If the data distribution does not change, then the original sampling data are maintained. Otherwise, the data distribution in the statistical window is restated to form a new sampling probability. The proposed algorithm ensures that the data distribution in the data profile is continually consistent with the population distribution. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real data sets.

Consequently, being able to predict the amount of solar radiation is important for making necessary decisions regarding the amount of energy that can be utilized at the sensor node. We demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used as an effective technique for predicting the amount of incoming solar radiation at these sensor nodes.

This study evaluated a Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approach to model the spatial distribution of stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), total carbon (Ctot), total nitrogen (Ntot) and total sulphur (Stot) for a data-sparse, semi-arid catchment in Inner Mongolia, Northern China. Random Forest (RF) was used as a new modeling tool for soil properties and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) as an additional method for the analysis of variable importance. At 120 locations soil profiles to 1 m depth were analyzed for soil texture, SOC, Ctot, Ntot, Stot, bulk density (BD) and pH. On the basis of a digital elevation model, the catchment was divided into pixels of 90 m \u00d7 90 m and for each cell, predictor variables were determined: land use unit, Reference Soil Group (RSG), geological unit and 12 topography-related variables. Prediction maps showed that the highest amounts of SOC, Ctot, Ntot and Stot stocks are stored under marshland, steppes and mountain meadows. River-like structures of very high elemental stocks in valleys within the steppes are partly responsible for the high amounts of SOC for grasslands (81\u201384% of total catchment stocks). Analysis of variable importance showed that land use, RSG and geology are the most important variables influencing SOC storage. Prediction accuracy of the RF modeling and the generated maps was acceptable and explained variances of 42 to 62% and 66 to 75%, respectively.

Our focus is on developing robust feature extraction algorithms that encode image regions as highdimensional feature vectors that support high accuracy object/non-object decisions. To test our feature sets we adopt a relatively simple learning framework that uses linear Support Vector Machines to classify each possible image region as an object or as a non-object. The approach is data-driven and purely bottom-up using low-level appearance and motion vectors to detect objects. As a test case we focus on person detection as people are one of the most challenging object classes with many applications, for example in film and video analysis, pedestrian detection for smart cars and video surveillance. Nevertheless we do not make any strong class specific assumptions and the resulting object detection framework also gives state-of-the-art performance for many other classes including cars, motorbikes, cows and sheep. This thesis makes four main contributions. Firstly, we introduce grids of locally normalised Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as descriptors for object detection in static images. The HOG descriptors are computed over dense and overlapping grids of spatial blocks, with image gradient orientation features extracted at fixed resolution and gathered into a highdimensional feature vector. They are designed to be robust to small changes in image contour locations and directions, and significant changes in image illumination and colour, while remaining highly discriminative for overall visual form. We show that unsmoothed gradients, fine orientation voting, moderately coarse spatial binning, strong normalisation and overlapping blocks are all needed for good performance. Secondly, to detect moving humans in videos, we propose descriptors based on oriented histograms of differential optical flow. These are similar to static HOG descriptors, but instead of image gradients, they are based on local differentials of dense optical flow. They encode the noisy optical flow estimates into robust feature vectors in a manner that is robust to the overall camera motion. Several variants are proposed, some capturing motion boundaries while others encode the relative motions of adjacent image regions. Thirdly, we propose a general method based on kernel density estimation for fusing multiple overlapping detections, that takes into account the number of detections, their confidence scores and the scales of the detections. Lastly, we present work in progress on a parts based approach to person detection that first detects local body parts like heads, torso, and legs and then fuses them to create a global overall person detector.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "396735907", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10251057", "46030830", "17814058", "15284674", "16789400", "15181911", "17071326", "18000078", "195572228", "214970869", "24225151", "14158675", "8478116", "206710395", "18241070", "6462900", "55878700", "4916960", "7211087", "16264182", "18787738", "56299243", "41902667", "14658728", "151640", "22279183", "1723366", "52479246", "20182445", "18962314", "111151182", "13198094", "18172578", "9604604", "57200182", "8962476", "8826404", "8356979", "8181261", "1192198", "29630209", "14083379", "14429512", "58670929", "62680162", "18983418", "15518115", "39206429", "3093787", "14564742", "26493812", "6944621", "29566306", "1515108", "11751088", "15579605", "201071191", "1446207", "67813157", "206764452", "18354971", "5162109", "15928770", "17641832", "15769497", "56718325", "15251915", "7583375", "28782998", "207628020", "1257524", "8914179", "8914179", "9797422", "164215702", "18804074", "7072151", "35573707", "4927117", "200843", "7817555", "18425736", "10566353", "3501339", "2820188", "62223828", "3521537", "10694130", "13066307", "7370064", "113427797", "15768808", "115442701", "849186", "18028128", "11164391", "59383579", "1134248", "6537510", "27006539", "17101888", "722272", "208880431", "16061754", "12106605", "37617776", "3041807", "15909692", "206764948", "21775790", "19004637", "205167353", "44006331", "46885433", "9024161", "45871423", "18104158", "20271461", "8284813", "8643019", "198185501", "1599703", "15163666", "2451341", "4622174", "17970538", "1496418", "211042246", "61247437", "15178364", "136826682", "14169623", "42673539", "1087188", "17447872", "3012821", "64238498", "62603433", "62603433", "119728367", "16952929", "14282259", "7312237", "18720005", "10276842", "9579807", "11130326", "17949201", "17366273", "13889748", "33023163", "57191570", "14202373", "49413396", "9472428", "11955211", "21360176", "43429634", "1454942", "11922706", "55083034", "67057051", "120480471", "20553539", "14579883", "1777736", "65251605", "42235242", "18292634", "14827923", "43416337", "36478708", "15961366", "18670009", "2475434", "35959678", "13239397", "9087762", "16775979", "32214928", "11304515", "12248502", "3980803", "38079181", "53485880", "15709951", "64983872", "184480488", "45705992", "6651120", "57598154"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37581938"}

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation among them. The work presented in this paper is related to attribute split measures and is a two step process: first theoretical study of the five selected split measures is done and a comparison matrix is generated to understand pros and cons of each measure. These theoretical results are verified by performing empirical analysis. For empirical analysis, random forest is generated using each of the five selected split measures, chosen one at a time. i.e. random forest using information gain, random forest using gain ratio, etc. The next step is, based on this theoretical and empirical analysis, a new approach of hybrid decision tree model for random forest classifier is proposed.

Many machine learning algorithms are originally designed for well-balanced datasets, therefore re-sampling has become an important step to pre-process imbalanced data. This aims to balance the datasets by increasing the samples of the smaller class or decreasing the samples of the larger class, which are known as over-sampling and under-sampling, respectively. In this paper, a sampling strategy that is based on both over-sampling and under-sampling is proposed, in which the new samples of the smaller class are created based on fuzzy logic. Improvement of the datasets is done by the evolutionary computational method of Cross-generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination and Cataclysmic mutation (CHC) that under-samples both the minority and majority samples. Consequently, a hybrid preprocessing method is proposed to re-sample imbalanced datasets. The evaluation is done by applying the Support Vector Machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree and nearest neighbor rule to train a classification model from the re-sampled training sets. From the experimental results, it can be seen that our proposed method improves both the F \u2212 m e a s u r e and AUC.

ESD is a form of skin disease. It generally causes redness of the skin and also may cause loss of skin. They are generally due to genetic or environmental factors. ESD comprises six classes of skin conditions namely, pityriasis rubra pilaris, lichen planus, chronic dermatitis, psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis and pityriasis rosea. The automated diagnosis of ESD can help doctors and dermatologists in reducing the efforts from their end and in taking faster decisions for treatment. The literature is replete with works that used conventional machine learning methods for the diagnosis of ESD. However, there isn't much instances of application of Deep learning for the diagnosis of ESD. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning approach i.e. Derm2Vec for the diagnosis of the ESD. Derm2Vec is a hybrid deep learning model that consists of both Autoencoders and Deep Neural Networks. We also apply a conventional Deep Neural Network (DNN) for the classification of ESD. We apply both Derm2Vec and DNN along with other traditional machine learning methods on a real world dermatology dataset. The Derm2Vec method is found to be the best performer (when taking the prediction accuracy into account) followed by DNN and Extreme Gradient Boosting.The mean CV score of Derm2Vec, DNN and Extreme Gradient Boosting are 96.92 percent, 96.65 percent and 95.80 percent respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.07587", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2973977114", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["54461322", "5795257", "10337347", "69991961", "206685945", "214844423", "214633022", "4513154", "54440392", "3078564", "12661448", "7260760", "62653358", "19842205", "18574938", "18504638", "11826003", "12485479", "113935982", "27461645", "62269509", "5767620", "120118103", "144124486", "62245742", "62179812", "15826629", "18386232", "65124053", "198989347", "67152871", "65080459", "33723086", "69353523", "3848644", "60993494", "89141", "5246200", "52874011", "58986402", "10659969", "6287870", "6844431"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202583540"}

Taking the Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) as an example, the use of at-home testing device (AHTD) enables remote, internet-based measurement of PD vocal symptoms. Translating AHTD measurement into a unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) through predictive analytics enables cost-effective, convenient, and close tracking of PD progression. Building a predictive model between AHTD measurement and UPDRS is not straightforward because PD patients are highly heterogeneous, which requires patient-specific models. Learning a patient-specific model faces the challenge of limited data. Transfer learning (TL) tackles this challenge by leveraging other patients\u2019 information to make up the data shortage when modeling a target patient. Among different TL methods, the category of parameter transfer methods is more appropriate for the telemonitoring application because it transfers patient-specific model parameters but not patients\u2019 data. However, existing parameter transfer methods fall short because not every other patient\u2019s information is helpful and blind transfer causes the problem of negative transfer. To tackle this limitation, we propose a positive TL (PTL) method. We provide an in-depth theoretical study on the risk and condition for negative transfer to happen, which further drive the development of novel PTL algorithms that are robust to negative transfer. We apply PTL to predict UPDRS of 42 PD patients using their AHTD vocal measurement. PTL achieves significantly better accuracy compared with single learning and one-model-fits-all approaches. Note to Practitioners \u2014This paper was motivated by the growing use of telemonitoring devices to facilitate remote, close tracking of disease progression. These devices are usually paired up with predictive analytics to translate the measurement signals into a clinical indicator of disease progression. This is a challenging task because the predictive model needs to be patient specific in order to account for patient heterogeneity. This paper proposes a TL method called PTL that can leverage other patients\u2019 information when building a predictive model for a target patient. The unique feature of PTL is that it can intelligently select which patients to transfer from, and thus preventing negative transfer. PTL is a just-in-time development for the emerging healthcare paradigm of telemonitoring and telemedicine by providing predictive analytics models and algorithms to address the unique challenges and contributing to the use of these remote devices to improve patient care.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TASE.2018.2874233", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2899542986", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["21113501", "24899619", "11888834", "28245118", "740063", "52308023", "43665409", "5984940", "8905975", "6742009", "52827789", "6617228", "15866435", "4974063", "40357556", "1157797", "60993494", "121570279", "4378807", "88514005", "7382779", "33507505", "29799121", "126196130", "1430472", "60993494", "7955044", "743542", "6229688", "948625", "840925"], "inbound_citations": ["174799168"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57755575"}

A coreset is a small, representative subset of the original data points such that a models trained on the coreset are provably competitive with those trained on the original data set. Since the size of the coreset is generally much smaller than the original set, our preprocess-then-train scheme has potential to lead to significant speedups when training SVM models. We prove lower and upper bounds on the size of the coreset required to obtain small data summaries for the SVM problem. As a corollary, we show that our algorithm can be used to extend the applicability of any off-the-shelf SVM solver to streaming, distributed, and dynamic data settings. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on real-world and synthetic data sets.

Precise air quality index (AQI) forecasts play an important role in both controlling air pollution and promoting the sustainable development of human society.

This paper introduces a time-varying inertia weighting (TVIW) strategy based on a combination of gravitation search algorithm (GSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) called the TVIW-PSO-GSA.

In this context, a significant number of using deep learning theory has been proposed for machine learning. Some works had a great development; however, most works deal with these problems need training a lot of parameters, so this process cost a lot of time and resources. This chapter proposes a hierarchical learning method, based on distributed Hadoop, to solve these problems. Initially, input images are extracted randomly in image blocks and reduced, in terms of redundant information, to maintain key information. Next, a regularization algorithm and noise processes are used on the image blocks between multiple image nodes in parallel. The following steps are to extract the dictionary of image classification by k-means algorithm. Finally, in order to select the feature mapping function in above dictionary, and mapped to a new image feature, it will be as a vector. The experimental results show that the algorithm is both reasonable and effective compared with the results of K-means.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-8944-2_126", "venue": "Recent Developments in Intelligent Computing, Communication and Devices", "journal": "Recent Developments in Intelligent Computing, Communication and Devices", "mag_id": "2888073109", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56608799"}

Jupiter Research estimates an e-mail user will on average receive more than 3,900 spam mails in 2007. This number is on average of 40 spam mails in 1999. This paper proposes uninterrupted detection approaches based on Incremental Support Vector Machine and Arti\u03d0icial Immune System for the spam of e-mail stream. These approaches use a window to hold several classi\u03d0iers, each one classi\u03d0ies the e-mail independently, and the e-mail is labeled according to a majority voting strategy. The exceeding margin update technique of support vector machine (SVM) is also used for the dynamic update of each classi\u03d0ier in the window. A sliding window is used to purge out-of-date knowledge. When a new batch of e-mail arrives, the classi\u03d0ier at rightmost in the window is removed from the window while the remaining classi\u03d0iers just slide a position to right and the classi\u03d0ier at leftmost is newly generated by the previous batch. These two techniques endow our algorithms with dynamic and adaptive properties as well as the ability to trace the changing content of e-mails and user's interests in an uninterrupted way. Eight methods, possibly regarded as different implementations of the uninterrupted detection of e-mail stream, including Hamming Distance (with and without mutation), Included Angle, SVM and Weighted Voting, are developed and elaborated in this paper. Experiments on two public benchmark corpora PU1 and Ling are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed methods. The eight methods are compared with current methods for accuracy, precision, recall, miss rate and speed of detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed uninterrupted detection approaches are promising way to contain spam.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2183311163", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["724926", "16430881", "961425", "15179175", "7371725", "743542", "14895712", "23623868", "10070718", "14515838", "14245235", "9654081", "1918231", "11019341", "5667586", "577580", "17938722", "40639308", "2235233", "2477926", "42518803", "7138354", "13092367", "17158044"], "inbound_citations": ["19401780", "23089648", "53783105", "5879243"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55764540"}

A recent study revealed that different diversity levels in an ensemble of learning machines are required in order to maintain high generalization on both old and new concepts. Inspired by this study and based on a further study of diversity with different strategies to deal with drifts, we propose a new online ensemble learning approach called Diversity for Dealing with Drifts (DDD).

The algorithm determines a feature to best separate the data into regions and identifies linear equations to predict the outcome variable in each region. A regularisation term is introduced to prevent overfitting problems and implicitly selects the most informative features. As OPLRAreg is based on mathematical programming, a flexible and transparent representation for optimisation problems, the algorithm also permits customised constraints to be easily added to the model.

First, three domains are constructed, corresponding to the distributions of occluded faces, clean faces and structured occlusions. The disentangling and fusing processes are formulated as the transformations between the three domains.

To address this problem, a novel medical image representation based on a trained decision forest named probabilistic edge map (PEM) is proposed in this paper. PEMs are generic and modality-independent. They generate similar anatomical representations from different imaging modalities and can thus guide a multi-modal image registration algorithm more robustly and accurately.

Then, a set of features has been extracted from each ROI, allowing to formulate the oil spill detection problem as a two-class classification task on the provided regions (i.e. using a supervised learning strategy). Since ROI classification is challenging, some desired characteristics for the classification algorithm are first identified, such as accuracy, robustness, etc. Then, a solution (called SVME) is provided: it is based on an ensemble of incremental/decremental cost-oriented Support Vector Machines, aggregated with the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) convex hull method in the ROC space. Such a solution addresses all the desired characteristics. Finally, the results obtained on the collected dataset are shown. The importance of this study is the devising of a powerful classification technique that may have an impact on optical oil spill detection from space, especially if fused with satellite synthetic aperture radar data.

Humans can flawlessly understand others' behaviour by combining different visual cues from activity to gestures and facial expressions. Empowering the computer vision systems to do so, however, is still an open problem due to its intrinsic challenges as well as extrinsic enforced difficulties like lack of publicly available data and unique environment conditions (wild). In this work, We emphasise on detecting the first and by far the most crucial cue in behaviour analysis; that is human activity detection in computer vision. To do so, we introduce a framework for integrating human pose and object motion to both temporally detect and classify the activities in a fine-grained manner (very short and similar activities). We incorporate partial human pose and interaction with the objects in a multi-stream neural network architecture to guide the spatiotemporal attention mechanism for more efficient activity recognition. To this end, in the absence of pose supervision, we propose to use the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate exact joint locations from noisy probability heat maps.

First, we transformed the images from an RGB (i.e., red, green, and blue) color space to a YCbCr color space to eliminate inferences from varying light conditions and skin colors. Second, a probability map, generated by a skin color Gaussian model, guided the pressure injury segmentation process using the Support Vector Machine classifier. Third, after segmentation, the reference ruler-included in each of the images-enabled perspective transformation and determination of pressure injury size. Finally, two nurses independently measured those 32 pressure injury images, and intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated. ::: ::: Results ::: An image processing algorithm was developed to automatically measure the size of pressure injuries. Both inter- and intra-rater analysis achieved good level reliability. ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Validation of the size measurement of the pressure injury (1) demonstrates that our image processing algorithm is a reliable approach to monitoring pressure injury progress through clinical pressure injury images and (2) offers new insight to pressure injury evaluation and documentation. ::: ::: This article is protected by copyright.

However, after recommendation, it is also of interest to consider whether a user will frequently visit a recommended POI, which may have significant implications regarding the user\u2019s daily mobility behavior or personal preferences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new POI classification problem in which the POIs recommended to a user are divided into four classes according to the user\u2019s predicted future check-in frequency: daily check-in POIs, weekly check-in POIs, monthly check-in POIs, and yearly check-in POIs. To solve this POI classification problem, we also propose a new POI classification model called POIC-ELM. In the POIC-ELM model, we first extract nine features related to three factors: each POI itself, the user\u2019s personality, and the user\u2019s social relationships. Then, we use these features to train a POI classifier based on an extreme learning machine (ELM), which is one of the most popular types of classifiers among state-of-the-art classification techniques.

To study this problem, we develop a notion of sub-optimality of a representation, defined in terms of expected reward of the optimal hierarchical policy using this representation. We derive expressions which bound the sub-optimality and show how these expressions can be translated to representation learning objectives which may be optimized in practice.

A key challenge for image processing with contrast enhanced CT is that phase discrepancies are latent in different tissues due to contrast protocols, vascular dynamics, and metabolism variance. Previous studies with deep learning frameworks have been proposed for classifying contrast enhancement with networks inspired by computer vision. Here, we revisit the challenge in the context of whole abdomen contrast enhanced CTs. To capture and compensate for the complex contrast changes, we propose a novel discriminator in the form of a multi-domain disentangled representation learning network. The goal of this network is to learn an intermediate representation that separates contrast enhancement from anatomy and enables classification of images with varying contrast time. Briefly, our unpaired contrast disentangling GAN(CD-GAN) Discriminator follows the ResNet architecture to classify a CT scan from different enhancement phases. To evaluate the approach, we trained the enhancement phase classifier on 21060 slices from two clinical cohorts of 230 subjects. Testing was performed on 9100 slices from 30 independent subjects who had been imaged with CT scans from all contrast phases. Performance was quantified in terms of the multi-class normalized confusion matrix. The proposed network significantly improved correspondence over baseline UNet, ResNet50 and StarGAN performance of accuracy scores 0.54. 0.55, 0.62 and 0.91, respectively.

We developped an innovative algorithm based on the Machine Learning (ML) allowing the tailoring of the prescription of PII. Results : Once verified on the independent testing set, J48 showed the better performances, with specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy rates in predicting relapsing patients of 86.4%, 50.0% and 83.1% respectively (vs 36.5%, 90.4% and 80.25%, respectively, for LR). Methods : We classified 194 anal cancer patients with Logistic Regression (LR) and other 3 ML techniques based on decision trees (J48, Random Tree and Random Forest), using a large set of clinical and therapeutic variables.

However, most of these individual metaheuristics algorithm are time and memory consuming when used to project the dataset into a lower subspace for subsequent classification. These drawbacks are reduced through a combination of two solution approaches whereby the strengths of two metaheuristics are brought together in a dual level algorithm. This research presents a dual level metaheuristic algorithm for feature dimensionality reduction using ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm at Level 1 and genetic algorithm (GA) at Level 2. The dimension of the features in a face dataset will be reduced by using ACO at Level 1 to extract the relevant facial features in the training dataset. The output obtained will be fed into GA at Level 2 to select the discriminant feature subset that becomes the optimized parameter used by support vector machine (SVM) for classification.

Hybrid architecture of DASH and eMBMS has attracted a great attention from the telecommunication industry and multimedia services. It is deployed in response to the immense demand in multimedia traffic. However, handover and limited available resources of the system affected on dropping segments of the adaptive video streaming in eMBMS and it creates an adverse impact on Quality of Experience (QoE), which is creating trouble for service providers and network providers towards delivering the service.

{"paper_id": "6711940", "title": "Representation and learning schemes for sentiment analysis.", "authors": [{"first": "Rahman", "middle": [], "last": "Mukras", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis identifies four novel techniques of improving the performance of sentiment analysis of text systems. Thes include feature extraction and selection, enrichment of the document representation and exploitation of the ordinal structure of rating classes. The techniques were evaluated on four sentiment-rich corpora, using two well-known classifiers: Support Vector Machines and Na\u00c2\u00a8A\u00b1ve Bayes. This thesis proposes the Part-of-Speech Pattern Selector (PPS), which is a novel technique for automatically selecting Part-of-Speech (PoS) patterns. The PPS selects its patterns from a background dataset by use of a number of measures including Document Frequency, Information Gain, and the Chi-Squared Score. Extensive empirical results show that these patterns perform just as well as the manually selected ones. This has important implications in terms of both the cost and the time spent in manual pattern construction. The position of a phrase within a document is shown to have an influence on its sentiment orientation, and that document classification performance can be improved by weighting phrases in this regard. It is, however, also shown to be necessary to sample the distribution of sentiment rich phrases within documents of a given domain prior to adopting a phrase weighting criteria. A key factor in choosing a classifier for an Ordinal Sentiment Classification (OSC) problem is its ability to address ordinal inter-class similarities. Two types of classifiers are investigated: Those that can inherently solve multi-class problems, and those that decompose a multi-class problem into a sequence of binary problems. Empirical results showed the former to be more effective with regard to both mean squared error and classification time performances. Important features in an OSC problem are shown to distribute themselves across similar classes. Most feature selection techniques are ignorant of inter-class similarities and hence easily overlook such features. The Ordinal Smoothing Procedure (OSP), which augments inter-class similarities into the feature selection process, is introduced in this thesis. Empirical results show the OSP to have a positive effect on mean squared error performance.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "822531626", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6711940"}

Few of these sequences have experimentally validated annotations, however, and computational predictions are becoming increasingly successful in producing such annotations. One key challenge remains the prediction of the amino acids in a given protein sequence that are involved in protein-protein interactions. Such predictions are typically based on machine learning methods that take advantage of the properties and sequence positions of amino acids that are known to be involved in interaction. In this paper, we evaluate the importance of various features using Random Forest (RF), and include as a novel feature backbone flexibility predicted from sequences to further optimise protein interface prediction. Results: We observe that there is no single sequence feature that enables pinpointing interacting sites in our Random Forest models. However, combining different properties does increase the performance of interface prediction. Our homomeric-trained RF interface predictor is able to distinguish interface from non-interface residues with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 in a homomeric test-set. The heteromeric-trained RF interface predictor performs better than existing predictors on a independent heteromeric test-set. We trained a more general predictor on the combined homomeric and heteromeric dataset, and show that in addition to predicting homomeric interfaces, it is also able to pinpoint interface residues in heterodimers. This suggests that our random forest model and the features included capture common properties of both homodimer and heterodimer interfaces.

A straightforward approach for event detection tasks is to train a detection network from a large-scale dataset in an end-to-end manner. However, in many applications such as building change detection on satellite images, few positive samples are available for the training. Moreover, an image pair of scenes contains many trivial events, such as in illumination changes or background motions. These many trivial events and the class imbalance problem lead to false alarms for rare event detection. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel method to learn disentangled representations from only low-cost negative samples. The proposed method disentangles the different aspects in a pair of observations: variant and invariant factors that represent trivial events and image contents, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the quantitative evaluations on four change detection datasets, and the qualitative analysis shows that the proposed method can acquire the representations that disentangle rare events from trivial ones.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1812.01285", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00955", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2902058571,2982321964", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3637421", "5941200", "783186", "1209557", "2127515", "3474523", "5002792", "3174691", "12589677", "13247138", "6399290", "6399290", "14020873", "6892094", "1099052", "16895865", "5634885", "5634885", "5024767", "12646079", "8195115", "13169253", "1395439", "21011865", "4711865", "13982294", "6913648", "5342684"], "inbound_citations": ["211506207", "203736514", "212675673"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54445285"}

Such sparse data sets present new challenges for classification learning methods. ::: Currently used algorithms include (a) dimensionality-reduction methods such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and (b) margin-based methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). Both approaches effectively attempt to control the model complexity, but in a different way. Even though SVM and LDA have been introduced as general-purpose methodologies, their performance varies greatly depending on the statistical characteristics of available data. To gain a better understanding of these techniques, we analyze the properties of SVM and LDA classifiers applied to HDLSS data. We show that tuning the regularization parameter in Regularized LDA (RLDA) can alleviate the data piling phenomenon, thus providing one explanation why regularization is useful to improve performance of LDA for HDLSS data. Then we propose a very efficient algorithm to tune the regularization parameter of RLDA. For SVM, we show that when the regularization parameter C is larger than a threshold (which can be computed explicitly), SVM classifiers will perform similarly for 1-1DLSS data regardless of C. This result provides guidelines for practical application of SVM on real HDLSS data. ::: Another principled approach is to consider new learning formulations when dealing with HDLSS data. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently been introduced to the machine learning literature. We propose a novel joint feature selection framework under MTL setting. We propose a framework that embeds the feature selection process into the multitask learning. The benefits of the proposed method are in two folds. On the one hand, it compensates for small sample size problem of the task at hand by using additional samples from related tasks, thus fully taking advantage of the benefits offered by multitask learning. On the other hand, the feature selection mechanism reduces the essential dimensionality of data which can also improve generalization performance.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2337540319", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52307989"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61478639"}

First, on-line com- prehension occurs incrementally and is closely time-locked with attention to the scene (Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard, & Sedivy, 1995). Second, attention to objects in a scene before they are mentioned in an utterance shows that anticipation plays a vital role in comprehension (Alt- mann & Kamide, 1999). Third, all available information sources\u2013linguistic and world knowledge, as well as scene information\u2013are rapidly and seamlessly integrated during on- line comprehension (Knoeferle, Crocker, Scheepers, & Pick- ering, 2005; Kamide, Scheepers, & Altmann, 2003; Sedivy, Tanenhaus, Chambers, & Carlson, 1999; Tanenhaus et al., 1995). Fourth, sentence comprehension is highly adaptive to the dynamic availability of information from these multiple sources. Fifth, these sources of information are coordinated: the interaction between language and visual scene process- ing is a two-way street. Comprehension of the unfolding ut- terance both rapidly guides attention to objects in the scene and, in turn, the attended region of the scene tightly con- strains and influences comprehension, a process Knoeferle and Crocker (in press) dub the coordinated interplay account (CIA). Furthermore, a full account of this interaction must address the issue of what happens when information sources conflict: which sources take precedence and why? Recent re- search on the interaction between world knowledge and infor- mation from a visual scene indicate that immediate depicted events are preferred over knowledge about stereotypical re- lationships when these conflict. Knoeferle and Crocker sug- gest that such a preference may have its basis in the role the immediate visual environment plays in child-directed speech during language acquisition (e.g., Snow, 1977). These characteristics of situated utterance comprehension pose an interesting challenge for modellers. The success- ful model should operate incrementally, anticipate upcoming referents, rapidly and seamlessly integrate information from multiple sources, adapt to available information, exhibit the observed attentional shift during utterance comprehension, and demonstrate the observed preference for the depicted information over world knowledge when these information sources conflict. Two recently proposed models feature several of these characteristics. The Fuse model by Roy and Mukherjee (2005) uses an attentional mechanism to constrain the num- ber of referents to improve speech recognition. The system does predict different ways a person might describe objects in a scene and biases how the words are recognized. The scene employed contains only objects, and is always assumed Abstract The interaction of utterance comprehension and information from a visual scene is characterized by the closely time-locked coordination of incremental comprehension and attention in the scene. Comprehension is also anticipatory, as revealed by attention to objects in a scene before they are mentioned. The interaction is further marked by the rapid and seamless inte- gration of, and adaptation to, diverse information sources in both the utterance and visual scene. These sources can inter- act dynamically, both complementarily and, at times, conflict- ingly. A recurrent sigma-pi neural network is presented that implements an attentional mechanism to model these behav- iors, directly instantiating the coordinated interplay account that suggests the utterance guides attention in the scene, which in turn rapidly provides information that influences compre- hension. A key aspect of the account is that the immediacy of depicted events in the scene takes precedence over stereotyp- ical knowledge when these two information sources conflict. Crucially, the model captures this behavior without being ex- plicitly trained to resolve the conflict, even when the relative frequency of the information sources differs greatly. Keywords: Connectionist modelling; situated utterance com- prehension; language-scene interaction; attention Introduction All human communication occurs in context. Indeed, even the so-called isolated phrase, coveted by linguists for its self- contained syntactic and semantic properties, is understood only within the context of human experience. In this way, the study of how language relates to its context provides insight into the very nature of language itself: how it means anything at all. Understanding the interaction of language and context, such as a visual environment, serves to identify and delineate the cognitive mechanisms involved in language comprehen- sion, and how resources such as linguistic and world knowl- edge, as well as information from the visual context, are uti- lized. This challenge is especially daunting because language is inherently dynamic, and the utilization of these various in- formation sources must be coordinated in real time. Fortunately, a growing body of psycholinguistic research in the visual worlds experimental paradigm, wherein sub- jects\u2019 eye movements over a visual scene are monitored as they listen to an utterance, has begun to yield tangible data on the nature of the on-line interaction of utterance comprehen- sion and context. Typically, that context is a visual scene that can establish referents and relations, together with the partic- ipants\u2019 own linguistic and world knowledge. The analysis of eye movements in a scene during utterance comprehension under the controlled manipulation of a variety of informa- tion sources has revealed five fundamental characteristics of", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "16806660", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["1660615", "2763403", "38074530", "13557197", "16826099", "62245742", "15008453", "140344256", "8679522"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1502478"}

The objective of this study was to analyze the performance of deep machine learning methods to annotate non-standardized text of drug order entries with their therapeutically active ingredients. Materials and methods The data consisted of drug orders entered 8/2009-4/2014 into the electronic health records of inpatients at a large tertiary care academic medical center. We manually annotated the most frequent order entry patterns with the active ingredient they contain (e.g. \u201cPrograf\u201d\u27f5\u201cTacrolimus\u201d). We heuristically included additional orders by means of character sequence comparisons to augment the training dataset.

The key insight of our interactive code search technique Alice is that user feedback can be actively incorporated to allow users to easily express and refine search queries. We design a query language to model the structure and semantics of code as logic facts. Given a code example with user annotations, Alice automatically extracts a logic query from code features that are tagged as important. Users can refine the search query by labeling one or more examples as desired (positive) or irrelevant (negative). Alice then infers a new logic query that separates positive examples from negative examples via active inductive logic programming. Our comprehensive simulation experiment shows that Alice removes a large number of false positives quickly by actively incorporating user feedback. Its search algorithm is also robust to user labeling mistakes. Our choice of leveraging both positive and negative examples and using nested program structure as an inductive bias is effective in refining search queries. Compared with an existing interactive code search technique, Alice does not require a user to manually construct a search pattern and yet achieves comparable precision and recall with much fewer search iterations. A case study with real developers shows that Alice is easy to use and helps express complex code patterns.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1812.05265", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSE.2019.00044", "venue": "2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2903696977,2956048495", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11049615", "95831", "12165627", "18145202", "17824743", "15110587", "9974267", "7881126", "11216724", "10217052", "16762143", "60577818", "14992676", "672594", "26736242", "5564943", "103639", "10560015", "2061156", "2907348", "13576432", "207319017", "34493673", "27598809", "9657803", "36454714", "1321182", "11339499", "9346895", "207178456", "4509026", "8558710", "3517", "14867364", "47021242", "5752985", "2406541", "14375487", "3828085", "743679", "2544635", "9046606", "14293984", "5374317", "16497968", "12529422", "196357", "6451826", "8882745", "990845", "10386335", "8869190", "7380410", "31827220", "10656182", "16356678", "6544598", "10743717", "2639925", "122024170", "3158641", "2374498"], "inbound_citations": ["212628749", "209853238", "212676020"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55449747"}

We extracted canonical set of feature vectors from biological images using a popular tool named Weighted Neighbor Distance using Compound Hierarchy of algorithms Representing Morphology (Wndchrm). We adopted a two step approach for the selection of features. The first step is to partition the canonical set of feature vectors into four distinct feature vector sets based on the methodology and algorithms for extraction of features. The second step is to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Score based selection of features from the partitioned set of feature vectors. The optimum set of feature vectors thus obtained is applied as training patterns to different classifier implementations such as Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifiers. We used IICBU-2008 benchmark dataset [5, 7] of biological images for our experiments. We also compared the results with the results available for the wndchrm classifier.

Fruit maturity is an important parameter to determine the harvest time. Typically, to obtain the maturity grade, a human expert visually associates the fruit color with a color present in the scale. In this paper, a computer-based method to create color scales is proposed. The proposed method performs a multidimensional regression based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) to generate color scales.

For any view of gait representations, GAN can restore it to the corresponding standard view, to learn view invariant gait features. To achieve this goal, TS-GAN has two streams : (1) the global-stream can learn global contexts, and (2) the part-stream can learn local details. We combine the two streams to learn final identities. Moreover, we add a pixel-wise loss along with the generators of GAN to restore the gait details in pixel-level. We evaluate the proposed method on two widely used gait databases: CASIA-B and OU-ISIR.

The downside of multishot MRI is that it is very sensitive to subject motion and even small levels of motion during the scan can produce artifacts in the final magnetic resonance (MR) image, which may result in a misdiagnosis. Numerous efforts have focused on addressing this issue; however, all of these proposals are limited in terms of how much motion they can correct and require excessive computational time. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based conjugate gradient SENSE (CG-SENSE) reconstruction framework for motion correction in multishot MRI. First CG-SENSE reconstruction is employed to reconstruct an image from the motion-corrupted k-space data and then the GAN-based proposed framework is applied to correct the motion artifacts. The proposed method has been rigorously evaluated on synthetically corrupted data on varying degrees of motion, numbers of shots, and encoding trajectories.

The task of attributing an APT to a specific nation-state or classifying it to the correct APT family is challenging for several reasons. First, each nation-state has more than a single cyber unit that develops such malware, rendering traditional authorship attribution algorithms useless. Furthermore, the dataset of such available APTs is still extremely small. Finally, those APTs use state-of-the-art evasion techniques, making feature extraction challenging. In this paper, we use a deep neural network (DNN) as a classifier for nation-state APT attribution.

An indexing scheme is designed to store the spatial description of components and to access them efficiently. Given a query text word (ascii/unicode format), the character pairs present in it are searched in the document. Next the retrieved character pairs are linked sequentially to form character string. Dynamic programming is applied to find different instances of query words. A string edit distance is used here to match the query word as the objective function. Recognition of multi-scale and multi-oriented character component is done using Support Vector Machine classifier. To consider multi-oriented character strings the features used in the SVM are invariant to character orientation.

However, the low intrinsic energy cost of switching spins is often compromised by the energy consumed in the overhead circuitry in creating the necessary switching fields. In fact, the two major challenges are size scalability \u2013 limited by the superparamagnetic limit, and the energy-delay-reliability cost, limited by spin stagnation in STT devices and defect pinning in SOT driven domain wall devices. We discuss two possible alternatives that attempt to bypass these limits. Skyrmions stabilized in thin magnetic films can bypass the super-paramagnetic limit and carry information bits with added protection accorded by size and topological barrier. We present candidate ferrimagnetic materials with low saturation magnetization and damping needed to enable ultrafast room temperature soliton like skyrmion propagation.

This letter proposes a novel infrared and visible image fusion method basing hybrid representation learning by combining dictionary-learning-based joint sparse representation (JSR) and nonnegative sparse representation (NNSR). In the proposed method, different fusion strategies are adopted, respectively, for the mean image, which represents the primary energy information, and for the deaveraged image, which contains important detail features. Since the deaveraged image contains a large amount of high-frequency details information of the source image, JSR is utilized to sparsely and accurately extract the common and innovation features of the deaveraged image, thus, accurately merging high-frequency details in the deaveraged image. Then, the mean image represents low-frequency and overview features of the source image, according to NNSR, mean image is classified well-directed to different feature regions and then fused, respectively. Such proposed method, on the one hand, can eliminate the impact on fusion result suffering from very different brightness causing by different imaging mechanism between infrared and visible image; on the other hand, it can improve the readability and accuracy of the result fusion image.

Artificial Neural Networks form the foundation of the research and their units, Artificial Neurons, are first compared with alternative models. This initial work is mainly in the spatial-domain and introduces a new neural model, termed a Taylor Series neuron. This is designed to be flexible enough to assume most mathematical functions. The unit is based on Power Series theory and a specifically implemented Taylor Series neuron is demonstrated. These neurons are of particular usefulness in evolutionary networks as they allow the complexity to increase without adding units. Training is achieved via various traditiona and derived methods based on the Delta Rule, Backpropagation, Genetic Algorithms and associated evolutionary techniques. This new neural unit has been presented as a controllable and more highly functional alternative to previous models. The work on the Taylor Series neuron moved into time-domain behaviour and through the investigation of neural oscillators led to an examination of single-celled intelligence from which the later work developed. Connectionist approaches to Artificial Intelligence are almost always based on Artificial Neural Networks. However, another route towards Parallel Distributed Processing was introduced. This was inspired by the intelligence displayed by single-celled creatures called Protoctists (Protists). A new system based on networks of interacting proteins was introduced. These networks were tested in pattern-recognition and control tasks in the time-domain and proved more flexible than most neuron models.

Online transfer learning concentrates on how to build a good classifier on the target domain when the training data arrive in an online/sequential manner. This paper focuses on online transfer learning problem based on a single source domain under homogeneous space. The existing algorithms HomOTL-I and HomOTL-II simply ensemble the classifiers on the source and target domains directly. When the distribution difference between the source domain and the target domain is large, it will not result in a good transfer effect. We are inspired by the idea of the boosting algorithm, that is we could form a strong classification model by a combination of multiple weak classifications. We train multiple classifiers on the source domain in an offline manner using AdaBoost algorithm, combine these classifiers on source domain with the classifier trained in an online manner on the target domain to form multiple weak combination in an ensemble manner. Based on the above ideas, we propose two algorithms AB-HomOTL-I and AB-HomOTLII, which have different ways to adjust the weights.

However, most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) focus on detail analysis of packet data, which results in late detection and a high system burden to cope with high-speed network traffic. Little or no integration exists between IDS and SNMP-based network management, in spite of the extensive monitoring and statistical information provided by SNMP agents implemented on network devices and systems. In this paper we propose a lightweight and fast detection mechanism for traffic flooding attacks. Firstly, we use SNMP MIB statistical data gathered from SNMP agents, instead of raw packet data from network links. The involved SNMP MIB variables are selected by an effective feature selection mechanism and gathered effectively by the MIB update time prediction mechanism. Secondly, we use a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for attack classification. Using MIB and SVM, we achieved fast detection with high accuracy, the minimization of the system burden, and extendibility for system deployment. The proposed mechanism is constructed in a hierarchical structure, which first distinguishes attack traffic from normal traffic and then determines the type of attacks in detail. Using MIB datasets collected from real experiments involving a DDoS attack, we validate the possibility of our approaches. It is shown that network attacks are detected with high efficiency, and classified with low false alarms.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comcom.2008.09.018", "venue": "Comput.

In this paper we classify the natural disaster-based tweets from the users using classification machine algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest and determine the best machine learning algorithm (based on metrics like accuracy, kappa etc.) that can be relied to ascertain the severity of the natural disaster at a desired area.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-24322-7_92", "venue": "Advances in Decision Sciences, Image Processing, Security and Computer Vision", "journal": "Advances in Decision Sciences, Image Processing, Security and Computer Vision", "mag_id": "2959624368", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199098427"}

In this paper we examine whether we could employ affective feedback as an implicit source of evidence, through the aggregation of information from various sensory channels. These channels range between facial expressions to neuro-physiological signals and are regarded as indicative of the user's affective states. The end-goal is to model user affective responses and predict with reasonable accuracy the topical relevance of information items without the help of explicit judgements. For modelling relevance we extract a set of features from the acquired signals and apply different classification techniques, such as Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbours.

Understanding the syllable's role in language structure and language function proves difficult due to the syllables multi-faceted nature. This dissertation explores syllable structure from three different perspectives in hopes of providing conceptual linkages between the different structural manifestations of the syllable. The introductory chapter, borrowing heavily from linguistic theory, establishes that syllable structure is not a unitary construct and explicates the difference between \"core\" and \"surface\" syllabic structure. Core syllabic structure refers to a property of representation. Surface syllabic structure is considered a property of the process of syllabification. Chapter 2 examines the interaction of syllabic structure with on-line processing of language and shows that syllabic structure contributes to lexical decisions. Importantly, we establish that surface syllabic structure serves as the locus of syllabic priming effects. This finding has important implications for theories of language recognition and the conception of syllabic lexical representation. Chapter 3 explores a more fundamental concern, the development of syllabic structure. Connectionist simulations of syllable based morpho-phonological reduplication demonstrate that syllable-like constraints can be instantiated from surface level factors. Importantly, no overt hierarchical syllabic representation is used in these simulations. Analysis of the network's performance suggested that segmental similarity structure may have been utilized in arriving at a solution to this problem. A consideration of reduplication in the language Mokilese also demonstrated interactions between segmental and syllabic content. The intermixing of traditionally separate levels of language structure find natural interpretation in a connectionist theory of syllable structure. A third simulation extended these findings and showed that syllable-like structure could be extracted using a phonetically coded natural language data base. The findings from these simulations force us to reconsider the relationship between core and surface syllabic structure. The dissertation concludes with a consideration of these findings in relation to theories of language structure and language function.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2517634756", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63253862"}

The resulting semi-supervised gcWGAN is assessed with the oracle over 100 novel folds not in the training set and found to generate more yields and cover 3.6 times more target folds compared to a competing data-driven method (cVAE). Assessed with structure predictor over representative novel folds (including one not even part of basis folds), gcWGAN designs are found to have comparable or better fold accuracy yet much more sequence diversity and novelty than cVAE. gcWGAN explores uncharted sequence space to design proteins by learning from current sequence-structure data.

This decision is aided with two, world-wide used, motility parameters that come available through computer assisted semen analysis (CASA). This decision process, however, still results in AI doses with variable and sometimes suboptimal fertility outcomes (e.g., small litter size). The hypothesis was that the decision which ejaculates to process into AI doses can be improved, by adding more data from CASA systems, and data from other sources, in combination with a data-driven model. Available data consisted of ejaculates that passed the initial decision, and thus, were processed into AI doses and used to inseminate sows. Data were divided into a training set (6,793 records) and a validation set (1,191 records) for model development, and an independent test set (1,434 records) for performance assessment. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) models were developed to predict four fertility phenotypes of interest (gestation length, total number born, number born alive, and number of stillborn piglets). Each fertility phenotype was considered as a numeric and as a binary outcome parameter, totaling to eight different fertility phenotypes. Data used to further improve the decision process originated from four sources: 1) CASA information, 2) boar ejaculate information, 3) breeding value estimations, and 4) weather information. These data were used to create seven prediction sets, where each new set added parameters to the ones included in the previous set. The GBM models predicted fertility phenotypes with low correlations (for numeric phenotypes) and area under the curve values (for binary phenotypes) on the test data. Hence, results demonstrated that a combination of more data and GBM did not enable further improvement of the AI dose quality checks, resulting in the rejection of our hypothesis. However, our study revealed parameters affecting boar ejaculate fertility which were not used in today\u2019s decision process. These parameters (listed in the top 10 in at least four GBM models) included one parameter associated with boar ejaculate information, two with breeding value estimations, five with CASA information, and one with weather information. These parameters, therefore, should be further investigated for their potential value when assessing the quality of boar ejaculates in daily routine AI doses processing.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31927416", "doi": "10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.12.017", "venue": "Theriogenology", "journal": "Theriogenology", "mag_id": "2997469483", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210167527"}

Researchers have developed machine learning models, learned from attributes extracted using static/dynamic approaches to identify malicious applications.

Hence, in this paper, a new feature selection mechanism known as selection of relevant attributes for improving locally extracted features using classical feature selectors (SAILS), is proposed. SAILS, targets on discovering prominent system calls from applications, and is built on the top of conventional feature selection methods, such as mutual information, distinguishing feature selector and Galavotti\u2013Sebastiani\u2013Simi. These classical attribute selection methods are used as local feature selectors. Besides, a novel global feature selection method known as, weighted feature selection is proposed. Comprehensive analysis of the proposed feature selectors, is conducted with the traditional methods.

As an initial effort, this paper focuses on evaluation of an unsupervised feature learning and image classification method i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect objects of interest (roofs, roofers, guardrails, and personal fall arrest systems) in a large number of unordered and cluttered construction site images. To isolate different objects, we initially segment each image using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and pass the resulting segments as input into CNN. This enhances the feature distinction between different objects and augments the inter-class variability. Then, we extract large feature sets in a hierarchical manner and classify images based on the acquired object features.

Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can apply standard learning algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new dimensionality reduction method to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space. The effectiveness of our approach to transfer learning is verified by experiments in two real world applications: indoor WiFi localization and binary text classification.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AAAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2107298017", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13650160", "16902615", "15978939", "13341746", "207752942", "8153773", "70831", "114924", "6692382", "16048365", "7716351", "9133542", "8585434", "1052837"], "inbound_citations": ["26260300", "201814398", "13985613", "131774949", "202729896", "214400079", "9479098", "13436399", "2223699", "209393377", "33765688", "239305", "5679070", "15650798", "28608580", "204246698", "3928689", "21475556", "10301285", "13138053", "4692354", "53095472", "1236130", "15735527", "3470168", "14196967", "36742099", "9728005", "775493", "52308023", "54442782", "11957012", "10209290", "2176522", "23759448", "3036406", "6227150", "69225717", "52972009", "186202575", "16290142", "21972261", "13709956", "9440223", "9891154", "14503085", "145862265", "3093738", "102354179", "199455505", "10256243", "222775", "24921529", "407822", "202559665", "49428582", "47588", "208248402", "14798268", "14350891", "31003569", "203605183", "3472451", "54823460", "57366016", "52972806", "206742596", "14085200", "54450445", "30920285", "6640409", "19123404", "10519854", "38805728", "52052736", "202577166", "195798707", "46073768", "57759374", "15288634", "203606044", "13246703", "10598373", "11512939", "195847412", "54464450", "52964829", "57157538", "147704146", "10309388", "203605281", "88480962", "11184557", "13888866", "19019298", "2899523", "204512545", "43938211", "11255126", "156056012", "14090180", "312886", "19869763", "58670939", "3694070", "16798889", "2637268", "207848029", "15198829", "181489364", "5262765", "14752254", "197485960", "4305692", "17383929", "30821596", "11309367", "198898096", "115201186", "207828774", "2434909", "5800401", "6578883", "57380045", "35185026", "117533201", "28425812", "11390573", "52948589", "3269385", "1990988", "51610043", "10900465", "17105302", "18523605", "23483527", "54066723", "203980452", "2328574", "740063", "10691883", "42138647", "7704614", "10517033", "88521653", "18191554", "92373433", "30468932", "6870304", "51875359", "107350", "196810372", "5968863", "15921357", "1221204", "125453005", "117729301", "199058794", "52165738", "12967715", "202637578", "12466820", "17906892", "52912665", "15980354", "140087611", "57189554", "30958061", "30958061", "854731", "15888893", "14514934", "62879432", "3497004", "44888160", "44821398", "8548594", "36662980", "404445", "18280856", "207847753", "13182142", "5726206", "5935856", "7317637", "85499473", "3412410", "127647328", "88485036", "29013405", "204767028", "55045449", "14990200", "14770299", "202785275", "91904814", "29192939", "55971779", "6021855", "54597752", "15533789", "2223228", "85499061", "11590103", "14312839", "13828880", "15102691", "2493954", "7745693", "53231188", "1252205", "14731529", "17558538", "1828893", "11870671", "203994601", "36028920", "208882989", "52158705", "16006280", "58007100", "13540071", "77374586", "6415663", "214793818", "18403458", "52071036", "195345946", "204800360", "3967931", "13636248", "10193228", "2491101", "211118610", "38594515", "9543238", "3761015", "13279232", "17865196", "42878057", "6164770", "17222577", "17014572", "46932755", "13784626", "10585610", "13349265", "14296583", "28233964", "19127636", "12281859", "14256825", "5740922", "50779418", "12283838", "562168", "16795507", "5028009", "69258499", "1010081", "17760987", "5921804", "49902207", "86724554", "201872601", "164297", "4665709", "32066297", "2117258", "16843457", "26188067", "14144023", "16081723", "14517994", "15464528", "55783016", "19538779", "15940935", "17912654", "14429589", "14609077", "18415735", "174797861", "14230784", "52005002", "211507001", "49564210", "148811592", "8887623", "133607138", "788838", "6408491", "2745878", "58588119", "197935501", "196182023", "54190528", "198131641", "4984287", "6763971", "589442", "11235176", "58013755", "4939466", "8597912", "4973666"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6953522"}

Auto-Encoders (AE) with regularized latent space provides an alternative framework for generative models, albeit their performance levels have not reached that of GANs. In this work, we identify one of the causes for the under-performance of AE-based models and propose a remedial measure. Specifically, we hypothesize that the dimensionality of the AE model's latent space has a critical effect on the quality of the generated data. Under the assumption that nature generates data by sampling from a \"true\" generative latent space followed by a deterministic non-linearity, we show that the optimal performance is obtained when the dimensionality of the latent space of the AE-model matches with that of the \"true\" generative latent space. Further, we propose an algorithm called the Latent Masked Generative Auto-Encoder (LMGAE), in which the dimensionality of the model's latent space is brought closer to that of the \"true\" generative latent space, via a novel procedure to mask the spurious latent dimensions. We demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and several real-world datasets that the proposed formulation yields generation quality that is better than the state-of-the-art AE-based generative models and is comparable to that of GANs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.04564", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996397324", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7201816", "18828233", "2057420", "53080148", "52889459", "4749887", "408872", "3638140", "76666188", "1033682", "32714539", "10894094", "326772", "46798026", "56657814", "152282812", "18268744", "85497090", "5667482", "60282629", "459456", "4053393", "5092785", "7645673", "12554042", "1687220", "9302801", "3833554", "3523097", "20282961", "702279", "34051459"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209140267"}

Our net is pruned from the VGG-16 model starting from the last convolutional (conv) layer where we find neuron activations are highly uncorrelated given the gender. Through Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we show that this high decorrelation makes it safe to discard directly last conv layer neurons with high within-class variance and low between-class variance.

However, the recent multitask trackers, which exploit the similarity between all candidates by imposing group sparsity on the candidate representations, have a limitation in robustness due to the diverse sampling of candidates. To deal with this issue, we propose a discriminative reverse sparse tracker via weighted multitask learning. Our positive and negative templates are retained from the target observations and the background, respectively. Here, the templates are reversely represented via the candidates, and the representation of each positive template is viewed as a single task. Compared with existing multitask trackers, the proposed algorithm has the following advantages. First, we regularize the target representations with the $\\ell _{2,1}$ -norm to exploit the similarity shared by the positive templates, which is reasonable because of the target appearance consistency in the tracking process.

It promises to overcome the challenges in the field of seismology related to automated detection and cataloging of earthquakes. EQShapelets are amplitude and phase-independent, i.e., their detection sensitivity is irrespective of the magnitude of the earthquake and the time of occurrence. They are also robust to noise and other spurious signals. The detection capability of EQShapelets is tested on one week of continuous seismic data provided by the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) obtained from a station in central California near the Calaveras Fault. EQShapelets combined with a Random Forest classifier, detected all of the cataloged earthquakes and 281 uncataloged events with lower false detection rate thus offering a better performance than autocorrelation and FAST algorithms. The primary advantage of EQShapelets over competing methods is the interpretability and insight it offers. Shape-based approaches are intuitive, visually meaningful and offers immediate insight into the problem domain that goes beyond their use in accurate detection. EQShapelets, if implemented at a large scale, can significantly reduce catalog completeness magnitudes and can serve as an effective tool for near real-time earthquake monitoring and cataloging.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.09086", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "2991233670", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208176180"}

To improve the detection system, more potential attack approaches should be researched. In this paper, a framework of the generative adversarial networks, IDSGAN, is proposed to generate the adversarial attacks, which can deceive and evade the intrusion detection system. Considering that the internal structure of the detection system is unknown to attackers, adversarial attack examples perform the black-box attacks against the detection system. IDSGAN leverages a generator to transform original malicious traffic into adversarial malicious traffic. A discriminator classifies traffic examples and simulates the black-box detection system. More significantly, we only modify part of the attacks' nonfunctional features to guarantee the validity of the intrusion. Based on the dataset NSL-KDD, the feasibility of the model is demonstrated to attack many detection systems with different attacks and the excellent results are achieved.

It helps us to understand the properties of the system that a complex network represents, and has significance to a wide range of real applications. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is currently the most popular community structure analysis algorithm due to its near linear time complexity. However, the performance of the LPA has proven to be unstable and the correctness of community assignment of nodes is unsatisfactory. In this paper a Self-Organizing Community Detection and Analytic Algorithm (SOCDA2) based on swarm intelligence is proposed. In the algorithm, a network is modeled as a swarm intelligence system, while each node within the network acts iteratively to join or leave communities based on a set of pre-defined node action rules, in order to improve the quality of the communities. When there is not a node changing its belonging community anymore, an optimal community structure will emerge as a result. A variety of experiments conducted on both synthesized and real-world networks have shown results which indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect community structures and the performance is better than that of the LPA.

But even if references do not constitute such a field, they can be useful as a preprocessing step in the automated extraction of other bibliographic data from articles, as well as in computer-assisted indexing of articles. Automation in data extraction and indexing to minimize human labor is key to the affordable creation and maintenance of large bibliographic databases. Extracting the components of references, such as author names, article title, journal name, publication date and other entities, is therefore a valuable and sometimes necessary task. This paper describes a two-step process using statistical machine learning algorithms, to first locate the references in HTML medical articles and then to parse them. Reference locating identifies the reference section in an article and then decomposes it into individual references. We formulate this step as a two-class classification problem based on text and geometric features. An evaluation conducted on 500 articles drawn from 100 medical journals achieves near-perfect precision and recall rates for locating references. Reference parsing identifies the components of each reference. For this second step, we implement and compare two algorithms. One relies on sequence statistics and trains a Conditional Random Field. The other focuses on local feature statistics and trains a Support Vector Machine to classify each individual word, followed by a search algorithm that systematically corrects low confidence labels if the label sequence violates a set of predefined rules.

It ensures that all possible actions receive some degree of attention, allowing an agent to converge to good policies. The same concept has been adopted by multiagent learning systems. However, there is a fundamentally different dynamic in multiagent learning: each agent operates in a non-stationary environment, as a direct result of the evolving policies of other agents in the system. As such, exploratory actions taken by agents bias the policies of other agents, forcing them to perform optimally in the presence of agent exploration. CLEAN rewards address this issue by privatizing exploration (agents take their best action, but internally compute rewards for counterfactual actions). However, CLEAN rewards require each agent to know the mathematical form of the system evaluation function, which is typically unavailable to agents. In this paper, we present an algorithm to approximate CLEAN rewards, eliminating exploratory action noise without the need for expert system knowledge. Results in both coordination and congestion domains demonstrate the approximated CLEAN rewards obtain up to 95% of the performance of directly computed CLEAN rewards, without the need for expert domain knowledge while utilizing 99% less system information.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AAMAS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2142043892", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2615060", "120018391", "7864232", "14312281", "1295373", "8798570", "12748383", "17600468", "61502579", "10149966", "17397590", "9166388", "9132232", "3260406"], "inbound_citations": ["3318551", "52179942", "209415090", "18812840", "58005448"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1379784"}

Subsequently, flood, landslides, and forest fire susceptibility maps prepared using a Random Forest (RF) model in the R statistical software. Results indicate that 42.83% of the study area are not susceptible to any hazards, while 2.67% of the area is at risk of all three hazards. The results of the multi-hazard map in Shiraz City indicate that 25% of Shiraz city is very susceptible to flooding, while 16% is very susceptible to landslide occurrences. For four strategic watersheds, it is notable that in the Dorodzan Watershed, landslides and floods are the most important hazards; whereas, flood occurrences cover the largest area of the Maharlou Watershed. In contrast, the Tashk-Bakhtegan Watershed is so sensible to floods and landslides, respectively. Finally, in the Ghareaghaj Watershed, forest fire ranks as the strongest hazard, followed by floods. The validation results indicate an AUC of 0.834, 0.939, and 0.943 for the flood, landslide, and forest fire susceptibility maps, respectively.

Based on image multi-feature fusion and support vector machine, a new method to identify flow regime in two-phase flow was presented. Firstly, gas-liquid two-phase flow images including bubbly flow, plug flow, slug flow, stratified flow, wavy flow, annular flow and mist flow were captured by digital high speed video systems in the horizontal tube. The image moment invariants and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture features were extracted using image processing techniques. To improve the performance of a multiple classifier system, the rough sets theory was used for reducing the inessential factors. Furthermore, the support vector machine was trained by using these eigenvectors to reduce the dimension as flow regime samples, and the flow regime intelligent identification was realized. The test results showed that image features which were reduced with the rough sets theory could excellently reflect the difference between seven typical flow regimes, and successful training the support vector machine could quickly and accurately identify seven typical flow regimes of gas-liquid two-phase flow in the horizontal tube. Image multi-feature fusion method provided a new way to identify the gas-liquid two-phase flow, and achieved higher identification ability than that of single characteristic.

We use a supervised machine learning method, resembling Classification Rule Mining, although classification is not our only goal. Important operational characteristics of expert systems, like explanation of conclusions and dynamic update of the knowledge base, are also taken into account. Our approach is implemented within an existing tool, initially developed by us to compare methods for combining uncertain conclusions about the same event, based on the uncertainty model of Certainty Factors. That tool could generate Expert Systems (in CLIPS language) that use the above methods. The main aim of this thesis is to do research mainly on the field of machine learning in order to enhance the above mentioned tool for generating Expert Systems in a more automatic, efficient and functional fashion. ::: More specifically, the architecture has been modified to support output variables classified in more than two classes (Multiclass Classification). An extension of the system made it possible to generate classification rules for additional variables (apart from the output variable), for which the final user of the expert system cannot provide values. This gives the ability to design more complex rule hierarchies, which are represented in an easy-to-understand tree form. Furthermore, the certainty factors model has been revised and an additional method of computing them is offered, following the definitions in MYCIN\u2019s model. Experimental results showed improved performance, especially for prediction of minority classes in imbalanced datasets. Feature ranking and subset selection techniques help to achieve the generation task in a more automatic and efficient way.

The same strategy used in the GRASP metaheuristic for generating random and adaptive solutions is used at each node of the trees. The source of diversity of the ensemble is the randomness of the solution generation method of GRASP. A further key feature of the tree construction method for GAR-Forest is a decreasing level of randomness during the process of constructing the tree: maximum randomness at the root and minimum randomness at the leaves. The method is therefore named \u201cGAR\u201d, GRASP with annealed randomness. The results conclusively demonstrate that G-Forest and GAR-Forest outperform Bagging, AdaBoost, MultiBoost, Random Forest and Random Subspaces. The results are even more convincing in the presence of noise, demonstrating the robustness of the method. The relationship between base classifier accuracy and their diversity is analysed by application of kappa-error diagrams and a variant of these called kappa-error relative movement diagrams.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.inffus.2014.01.009", "venue": "Inf.

However, measures used to quantify structure of forests are scale-variant, as they rely on bounded observations on either ecological or forest inventory observation units. The understanding of the influence of the scale of observation in mapping of forest structural heterogeneity is limited. Therefore, we researched into effects of plot size on quantifying forest structural heterogeneity, where we describe heterogeneity by three indices in stands under different management systems. In addition, we studied the performance of structural indices in separating different forest management systems across plot sizes, and created wall to wall maps of the indices using airborne LiDAR metrics describing the vertical distribution of canopy heights at different scales of observation. The studied indices are: Gini Coefficient (GC), Structural Complexity Index (SCI), and Enhanced Structural Complexity Index (ESCI). SCI and ESCI require fully mapped plots whereas GC has no information on individual tree locations. Inventory data from 95 one-hectare plots covering a range of management intensities from un-managed to age class forests were used. We quantified the three structural indices for 18 plot sizes ranging from 225 m2 to 10,000 m2. Linear fixed effects models were used to study the effects of plot sizes in different levels of structural heterogeneity and Random Forest (RF) models used to provide wall-to-wall maps at varying scales from airborne LiDAR data. The simulation showed that all indices were influenced by the scale of observation with larger effects for plots in forests with higher structural heterogeneity. For the data analyzed we found a threshold scale for enumerating stand structural heterogeneity between 900 m2 and 2500 m2. However, stable field and remote sensing predictions of stand structural heterogeneity required plots at least \u2a7e 2500 m2. Compared to GC, SCI and ESCI improved separation of forest structure in the three management systems and at all observed scales. A change of plot sizes affected bivariate relationships between structural indices and airborne LiDAR metrics as well as the resultant predictive models. Smaller plot sizes yielded weaker relationships and predictive models. All structure indices were predicted from airborne LiDAR with RMSE \u2a7d 22 % at scales equal or larger than the identified threshold plot size. These findings are relevant to optimize plot sizes for efficient inventory and mapping of forest structural heterogeneity, as well as for the design of natural resource inventories.

However, it took until the early 90s until positive definite kernels became a popular and viable means of estimation. Firstly this was due to the lack of sufficiently powerful hardware, since kernel methods require the computation of the socalled kernel matrix, which requires quadratic storage in the number of data points (a computer of at least a few megabytes of memory is required to deal with 1000+ points). Secondly, many of the previously mentioned techniques lay dormant or existed independently and only recently the (in hindsight obvious) connections were made to turn this into a practical estimation tool.

Software fault prediction in the early phases of software development can help and guide software practitioners to focus the available testing resources on the weaker areas during the software development. This paper analyses and compares the statistical and six machine learning methods for fault prediction. These methods (Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Cascade Correlation Network, Support Vector Machine, Group Method of Data Handling Method, and Gene Expression Programming) are empirically validated to find the relationship between the static code metrics and the fault proneness of a module. In order to assess and compare the models predicted using the regression and the machine learning methods we used two publicly available data sets AR1 and AR6. We compared the predictive capability of the models using the Area Under the Curve (measured from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis). The study confirms the predictive capability of the machine learning methods for software fault prediction. The results show that the Area Under the Curve of model predicted using the Decision Tree method is 0.8 and 0.9 (for AR1 and AR6 data sets, respectively) and is a better model than the model predicted using the logistic regression and other machine learning methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2014.03.032", "venue": "Appl.

One major cause of suicide is psychiatric stressors. The detection of psychiatric stressors in an at risk population will facilitate the early prevention of suicidal behaviors and suicide. In recent years, the widespread popularity and real-time information sharing flow of social media allow potential early intervention in a large-scale population. However, few automated approaches have been proposed to extract psychiatric stressors from Twitter. The goal of this study was to investigate techniques for recognizing suicide related psychiatric stressors from Twitter using deep learning based methods and transfer learning strategy which leverages an existing annotation dataset from clinical text. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: First, a dataset of suicide-related tweets was collected from Twitter streaming data with a multiple-step pipeline including keyword-based retrieving, filtering and further refining using an automated binary classifier. Specifically, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based algorithm was used to build the binary classifier. Next, psychiatric stressors were annotated in the suicide-related tweets. The stressor recognition problem is conceptualized as a typical named entity recognition (NER) task and tackled using recurrent neural networks (RNN) based methods. Moreover, to reduce the annotation cost and improve the performance, transfer learning strategy was adopted by leveraging existing annotation from clinical text. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS ::: To our best knowledge, this is the first effort to extract psychiatric stressors from Twitter data using deep learning based approaches. Comparison to traditional machine learning algorithms shows the superiority of deep learning based approaches. CNN is leading the performance at identifying suicide-related tweets with a precision of 78% and an F-1 measure of 83%, outperforming Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extra Trees (ET), etc. RNN based psychiatric stressors recognition obtains the best F-1 measure of 53.25% by exact match and 67.94% by inexact match, outperforming Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Moreover, transfer learning from clinical notes for the Twitter corpus outperforms the training with Twitter corpus only with an F-1 measure of 54.9% by exact match. The results indicate the advantages of deep learning based methods for the automated stressors recognition from social media.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6069295", "pubmed_id": "30066665", "doi": "10.1186/s12911-018-0632-8", "venue": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "journal": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2883944442", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["73358730", "34382616", "9778830", "4005487", "21081536", "9818217", "32695924", "2703754", "12626524", "16179465", "4984514", "15963089", "3737232", "29840822", "7460009", "215114420", "3995437", "4366860", "15874232", "65038030", "3764197", "3516426", "205715600", "17387371", "22625322"], "inbound_citations": ["77394197", "215369952", "210909135", "202789448", "53304025", "201654534", "214641181", "115159009", "198913306", "195893259", "202237432", "209415169", "86473962", "212702888"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51855448"}

A review of concept formation studies highlights the need for improving existing methodology in establish- ing the claim for implicit concept formation. Eight experiments are reported that address this aim. A review of theoretical issues highlights the need for computational modelling to elucidate the nature of implicit learning. Two chapters address the feasibility of different exemplar and Connectionist models in accounting for how subjects perform on tasks typically employed in the implicit learn- ing literature. The first five experiments use a concept formation task that involves classifying \"computer people\" as belonging to a particular town or income category. A number of manipulations are made of the underlying rule to be learned and of the cover task given subjects. In all cases, the knowledge underlying classification performance can be elicited both by free recall and by forced choice tasks. The final three experiments employ Reber's (e.g., 1989) grammar learning paradigm. More rigorous methods for eliciting the knowledge underlying classification performance are employed than have been used previously by Reber. The knowledge underlying clas- sification performance is not elicited by free recall, but is elicited by a forced-choice measure. The robustness of the learning in this paradigm is investigated by using a secondary task methodol- ogy. Concurrent random number generation interferes with all knowledge measures. A number of parameter-free Connectionist and exemplar models of artificial grammar learning are tested against the experimental data. The importance of different assumptions regarding the coding of features and the learning rule used is investigated by determin- ing the performance of the model with and without each assumption. Only one class of Connectionist model passes all the tests. Fur- ther, this class of model can simulate subject performance in a different task domain.

This is particularly true when the number of nodes is high or there are temporal changes in the network.

Despite the accumulated knowledge by pharmaceutical companies that continually improve the process of finding new drugs, a myriad of factors affect the activity of putative candidate molecules in vivo and the propensity for causing adverse and toxic effects is recognized as the major hurdle behind the current \"target-rich, lead-poor\" scenario. In this study we evaluate the use of several Machine Learning algorithms to find useful rules to the elucidation and prediction of toxicity using 1D and 2D molecular descriptors. The results indicate that: i) Machine Learning algorithms can effectively use 1D molecular descriptors to construct accurate and simple models; ii) extending the set of descriptors to include 2D descriptors improve the accuracy of the models.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-03223-3_11", "venue": "BSB", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1864375288", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17107296", "3023230", "10525465", "19975838", "197081562", "21518449", "121107672", "21873061", "85193230", "43550173", "16849183", "2302070", "60712643", "14487101", "140109802", "8635104", "98175915", "2641372", "62710933", "28844585", "6778485"], "inbound_citations": ["52058158", "1353950", "1635229", "201016534", "58566772"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27465961"}

This paper proposes a novel approach to extracts requirements dependencies utilizing natural-language processing (NLP) and weakly supervised learning (WSL) in two stages. In the first stage, binary dependencies (basic dependencies:dependent/independent) are identified, which are further analyzed to detect the type of the dependency in the second stage. An initial evaluation of this approach on the PURE data set - European Rail Traffic Management System - was carried out using three machine learners (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes), which were then compared and tested. Results showed that all the three learners exhibited similar accuracy measures, while SVM needed additional parameter tuning. The machine learners' accuracy was further improved by applying weakly supervised learning to generate pseudo annotations for unlabelled data.

We fit a bioclimatic model to presence-absence observations for each species using the Random Forests classification tree with ground plot data. The models are driven by normal climatic variables from 1961-1990, which represents the reference period for climate-induced vegetation changes. Climate data from an ensemble of 17 general circulation models were run through the classification tree to project current distributions under climates described by the RCP 6.0 watts/m2 scenario for the decades centered on years 2030, 2060 and 2090. The results suggest that, by 2060, the climate niche of each species will occur at elevations that are between 300 to 500 m higher than at present. By 2060, habitat loss could amount to 46 to 77%, mostly affecting the lower limits of distribution. The two species at the highest elevation, P. hartwegii and A. religiosa, would suffer the greatest losses while, at the lower elevations, P. oocarpa would gain the most niche space.

In SVRFMC, the CRFs model has the intrinsic ability of incorporating the contextual information in both the observation and labeling fields. Support vector machine (SVM) is set as the spectral term to get a more precise estimation of each pixel's probability of belonging to each possible class. To preserve the spatial details in the classification result, a Mahalanobis distance boundary constraint is considered as the spatial term to undertake appropriate spatial smoothing. By integrating SVM and a Mahalanobis distance boundary constraint, SVRFMC can not only avoid the explicit modeling of observed data, but can also undertake appropriate smoothing with the consideration of contextual information, thereby exhibiting more universality and validity in the application of HSR image classification, especially when the image has a complex land-cover class distribution and the training samples are limited. Three HSR images comprising QuickBird, IKONOS, and HYDICE imagery were utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to other image classification approaches: noncontextual multiclass SVM, a traditional object-oriented classifier (OOC), an object-oriented classification based on fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) segmentation (OO-FNEA), a simplified CRF model with boundary constraint (BC-CRF), and a recently proposed contextual classifier combining SVM and Markov random fields (Markovian support vector classifier).

The application of SVM model is tested on three unimpaired gages in the North Platte River Basin. Seasonal averages of oceanic\u2013atmospheric indices for the period of 1940\u20132007 are used to generate spring\u2013summer streamflow volumes with 3-, 6- and 9-month lead times. The results reveal a strong association between coupled indices compared to their individual effects. The best streamflow estimates are obtained at 6-month compared to 3-month and 9-month lead times.

SCAFoIs permits to predict and dynamically select the necessary link pairs to be checked online to improve the computation efficiency. For each of the several SCAFoIs, which corresponds to the related pairs of kinematic chains of the whole body, the status of the relative positional relationship is predicted.

We first cluster each patient\u2019s CT images into multiple categories, and then collect the images in the same categories across different patients to build an imageset for denoising. Each imageset is fed into a generative adversarial network that consists of a denoising network and a following classification network. The denoising network efficiently reuses feature maps from the lower layers for end-to-end learning with full-size images.

This method is based on quantitative matrix (QM) and machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This method has been trained and tested on non-redundant dataset of T cell epitopes and non-epitopes that includes 1137 experimentally proven MHC class I restricted T cell epitopes.

The performance of these methods has been evaluated through Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) at a cutoff score where sensitivity and specificity was nearly equal. Finally, both machine-learning methods were used for consensus and combined prediction of CTL epitopes. The performances of these methods were evaluated on blind dataset where machine learning-based methods perform better than QM-based method. We also demonstrated through subgroup analysis that our methods can discriminate between T-cell epitopes and MHC binders (non-epitopes).

The traditional intrusion detection systems look for unusual or suspicious activity, such as patterns of network traffic that are likely indicators of unauthorized activity. However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely \"attack signature\", resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature. Experimental result shows that our method allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack.

In contrast to existing sequence-based structural class predictors, which target four major classes and which are designed for high identity sequences, we predict seven classes from sequences that share twilight-zone identity with the training sequences.ResultsThe proposed MODular Approach to Structural class prediction (MODAS) method is unique as it allows for selection of any subset of the classes. MODAS is also the first to utilize a novel, custom-built feature-based sequence representation that combines evolutionary profiles and predicted secondary structure. The features quantify information relevant to the definition of the classes including conservation of residues and arrangement and number of helix/strand segments. Our comprehensive design considers 8 feature selection methods and 4 classifiers to develop Support Vector Machine-based classifiers that are tailored for each of the seven classes. Tests on 5 twilight-zone and 1 high-similarity benchmark datasets and comparison with over two dozens of modern competing predictors show that MODAS provides the best overall accuracy that ranges between 80% and 96.7% (83.5% for the twilight-zone datasets), depending on the dataset. This translates into 19% and 8% error rate reduction when compared against the best performing competing method on two largest datasets. The proposed predictor provides accurate predictions at 58% accuracy for membrane proteins class, which is not considered by majority of existing methods, in spite that this class accounts for only 2% of the data. Our predictive model is analyzed to demonstrate how and why the input features are associated with the corresponding classes.ConclusionsThe improved predictions stem from the novel features that express collocation of the secondary structure segments in the protein sequence and that combine evolutionary and secondary structure information. Our work demonstrates that conservation and arrangement of the secondary structure segments predicted along the protein chain can successfully predict structural classes which are defined based on the spatial arrangement of the secondary structures.

We dramatically shrink the amount of interactions with the environment necessary to learn well-behaved imitation policies, by up to several orders of magnitude. Our framework, operating in the model-free regime, exhibits a significant increase in sample-efficiency over previous methods by simultaneously a) learning a self-tuned adversarially-trained surrogate reward and b) leveraging an off-policy actor-critic architecture.

Dimension reduction is widely applied as a preprocessing step for classification; however the reduction of dimension using conventional methods may not always guarantee high classification rate. Principal component analysis (PCA) and its nonlinear version kernel PCA (KPCA) are known as traditional dimension reduction algorithms. In a previous work, a variant of KPCA, denoted as Adaptive KPCA (A-KPCA), is suggested to get robust unsupervised feature representation for HSI. The specified technique employs several KPCAs simultaneously to obtain better feature points from each applied KPCA which includes different candidate kernels. Nevertheless, A-KPCA neglects the influence of subkernels employing an unweighted combination. Furthermore, if there is at least one weak kernel in the set of kernels, the classification performance may be reduced significantly. To address these problems, in this paper we propose an Ensemble Learning (EL) based multiple kernel PCA (M-KPCA) strategy. M-KPCA constructs a weighted combination of kernels with high discriminative ability from a predetermined set of base kernels and then extracts features in an unsupervised fashion. The experiments on two different AVIRIS hyperspectral data sets show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory feature extraction performance on real data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2018/9632569", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2891189889", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["119824856", "123675652", "10707042", "17601973", "35023739", "12249130", "40020155", "17201479", "61610448", "61362796", "15401490", "6674407", "9573013", "5167965", "10705469", "22132610", "14607075", "17466014", "208981655", "17819245", "27389883", "61295445", "101324412", "14171756", "123754812", "17242145", "32812674", "10726702", "1854295", "122393974", "15226351", "490977", "16292818", "24224153", "59487936", "17142699", "18073501", "30784313", "29330737", "34833261", "13063575", "961425", "1885708", "15538672"], "inbound_citations": ["211689652", "214595105"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126274602"}

Low density airborne LiDAR with relatively low penetration over vegetation canopy under leaf-on condition further complicate the estimation of hydrodynamic roughness in tropical zone. This paper will present a detail investigation on the capability of airborne LiDAR data for hydrodynamic roughness estimation over tropical region in Air Keroh, Melaka, Malaysia. The study area is divided into four landcover classes i.e. building, forest, grassland and paved road. The airborne LiDAR data was obtained using the Optech ALTM 3100 in 2009 with a posting density of about 0.69 point per meter squared. The estimation of composite hydrodynamic roughness consists of four processing stages namely 1) landcover classification, 2) estimation of parameters as required by the hydrodynamic roughness, 3) estimation of hydrodynamic roughness of individual landcover class and 4) estimation of composite hydrodynamic roughness with different spatial resolutions. In the first stage, the landcover classification is performed by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the aerial photo of the study area obtained simultaneously with the airborne LiDAR. Estimation of hydrodynamic value for each landcover class requires different hydrodynamic models expressed by Manning's (n), Chezy (c), and Darcy (f) coefficients. The calculation of hydrodynamic roughness for each landcover class should be done separately, in which finally will be merged at specific spatial resolution to produce composite hydrodynamic roughness map represented by the Manning's n coefficient. In the stage of hydrodynamic roughness estimation building, forest, grassland and paved road require estimation of momentum absorption area, tree density, height of grass and area classified as road respectively. These parameters will be estimated by using airborne LiDAR data and aerial photograph. Estimation of tree density requires delineation of individual trees in forest area. Tree density and diameter at breast height (DBH) of individual tree is then estimated for each tree based on allometric equation. The overall accuracy for landcover classification is 96% with user and producer accuracies more than 80%. The results show that based on the airborne LiDAR data, the height of grass and tree DBH can be estimated with about 0.33m and 0.22m RMSE respectively. Finally, the composite hydrodynamic roughness is calculated based on the conventional averaging concept, which integrates different landcover types in a specific piece of land (spatial resolution).", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2544907764", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131980271"}

Using wearable devices for fall detection has a high cost and may cause inconvenience to the daily lives of the elderly. In this paper, we present an automated fall detection approach that requires only a low-cost depth camera. Our approach combines two computer vision techniques-shape-based fall characterization and a learning-based classifier to distinguish falls from other daily actions. Given a fall video clip, we extract curvature scale space (CSS) features of human silhouettes at each frame and represent the action by a bag of CSS words (BoCSS). Then, we utilize the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to identify the BoCSS representation of a fall from those of other actions. In order to eliminate the sensitivity of ELM to its hyperparameters, we present a variable-length particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the number of hidden neurons, corresponding input weights, and biases of ELM. Using a low-cost Kinect depth camera, we build an action dataset that consists of six types of actions (falling, bending, sitting, squatting, walking, and lying) from ten subjects.

Traditional statistical methods for precision medicine focus on subgroup discovery through identifying interactions between a few markers and treatment regimes.

Recently, novel approaches have emerged that seek to directly estimate individualized treatment rules (ITR) via maximizing the expected clinical reward by using, for example, support vector machines (SVM) or decision trees. The latter enjoys great popularity in clinical practice due to its interpretability. In this article, we propose a new reward function and a novel decision tree algorithm to directly maximize rewards.

The normal healthy group (group N) included one eye randomly selected from 736 patients with healthy corneas, the keratoconus group (group KC) included one eye randomly selected from 321 patients with keratoconus. The 113 nonoperated ectatic eyes from 125 patients with very asymmetric ectasia (group VAE-E), whose fellow eyes presented relatively normal topography (group VAE-NT), were also included. The parameters from corneal tomography and biomechanics were obtained using the Pentacam HR and Corvis ST (Oculus Optikger\u00e4te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The accuracies of the tested variables for distinguishing all cases (KC, VAE-E, and VAE-NT), for detecting clinical ectasia (KC + VAE-E) and for identifying abnormalities among the VAE-NT, were investigated. A comparison was performed considering the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC; DeLong's method). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Considering all cases (KC, VAE-E, and VAE-NT), the AUC of the tomographic-biomechanical parameter (TBI) was 0.992, which was statistically higher than all individual parameters (DeLong's; p < 0.05): PRFI- Pentacam Random Forest Index (0.982), BAD-D- Belin -Ambrosio D value (0.959), CBI -corneal biomechanical index (0.91), and IS Abs- Inferior-superior value (0.91). The AUC of the TBI for detecting clinical ectasia (KC + VAE-E) was 0.999, and this was again statistically higher than all parameters (DeLong's; p < 0.05): PRFI (0.996), BAD-D (0.995), CBI (0.949), and IS Abs (0.977). Considering the VAE-NT group, the AUC of the TBI was 0.966, which was also statistically higher than all parameters (DeLong's; p < 0.05): PRFI (0.934), BAD- D (0.834), CBI (0.774), and IS Abs (0.677). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Corneal biomechanical data enhances the evaluation of patients with corneal ectasia and meaningfully adds to the multimodal diagnostic armamentarium. The integration of biomechanical data and corneal tomography with artificial intelligence data augments the sensitivity and specificity for screening and enhancing early diagnosis. Besides, corneal biomechanics may be relevant for determining the prognosis and staging the disease.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7143615", "pubmed_id": "32209975", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph17062113", "venue": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "mag_id": "3012871011", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214643106"}

In this paper an attempt is made to develop an algorithm for teeth numbering and classification, which is a major section in Automated Dental Identification system. Individual identification using dental panoramic images is an issue addressed in the literature. Hence, this work makes use of panoramic images for emerging this algorithm. The dental radiographs are initially preprocessed and each tooth is isolated for further processing.

Using prior knowledge about interacting with the physical world, robots can learn state representations that are consistent with physics. We identify five robotic priors and explain how they can be used for representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a simulated slot car racing task and a simulated navigation task with distracting moving objects.

In the brain, spatio-temporal stimuli are converted into spike trains by sensory neurons and projected to the neurons in subcortial and cortical layers for further processing. Reservoir Computing (RC) is a neural computation paradigm that is inspired by cortical Neural Networks (NN). It is promising for real-time, on-line computation of spatio-temporal signals. An RC system incorporates a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called reservoir, the state of which is changed by a trajectory of perturbations caused by a spatio-temporal input sequence. A trained, nonrecurrent, linear readout-layer interprets the dynamics of the reservoir over time. Echo-State Network (ESN) [1] and Liquid-State Machine (LSM) [2] are two popular and canonical types of RC system. The former uses non-spiking analog sigmoidal neurons \u2013 and, more recently, Leaky Integrator (LI) neurons \u2013 and a normalized random connectivity matrix in the reservoir. Whereas, the reservoir in the latter is composed of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, distributed in a 3-D space, which are connected with dynamic synapses through a probability function. The major difference between analog neurons and spiking neurons is in their neuron model dynamics and their inter-neuron communication mechanism. However, RC systems share a mysterious common property: they exhibit the best performance when reservoir dynamics undergo a criticality [1\u20136] \u2013 governed by the reservoirs\u2019 connectivity parameters, |\u03bbmax| \u2248 1 in ESN, \u03bb \u2248 2 and w in LSM \u2013 which is referred to as the edge of chaos in [3\u20135].

After identifying gender specific information and removing undesired information of particular gender bandwidth of transmission can be utilized efficiently.

FB expansion is capable of extracting features (F0) from speech signals more accurately since it does not require filter to separate desired speech signal and hence is free from filter related problems.

Prasada & Pinker 1993, Marslen-Wilson et al. 1993, Baayen et al. 1995, among others). This issue is part of the more general controversy between symbolic and connectionist cognitive models, in which inflection is often used as a test case. One difference between these models concerns the question of whether processing regular inflectional forms involves computing symbolic rules, or whether it should be explained in terms of associative networks that do not involve linguistic rules. Berko\u2019s (1958) finding that children are able to productively generate inflected forms of novel words (e.g., one wug many wug-s) has lead many linguists and psychologists to believe that inflection involves the processing of mentally represented symbolic rules, such as \u2018Add -s\u2019 for noun plurals or \u2018Add -ed\u2019 for past tense formation in English. Connectionist approaches (cf.

Unlike traditional transfer learning, there can be severe differences in the data distributions, resulting from differences in sensing, sensory processing, or even representations, that each robot uses to learn. Furthermore, only some properties may overlap between the two robots. We show that in such cases, the abstraction of raw sensory data into an intermediate representation can be used not only to aid learning, but also the transfer of knowledge. Further, we utilize statistical metrics, learned during an interactive process where the robots jointly explore the environment, to determine which underlying properties are shared between the robots. We demonstrate results in a visual classification task where objects are represented via a combination of properties derived from different modalities: color, texture, shape, and size.

The first step is to implement the graph-based label propagation algorithm to propagate the label information from labeled samples to the neighboring unlabeled samples. This is then followed by the second step, which uses superpixel propagation to assign the same labels to all pixels within the superpixels that are generated by the image segmentation method, so that some labels wrongly labeled by the above step can be modified. As a result, so obtained pseudo-labeled samples could be used to improve the performance of the classifier. Subsequently, an effective feature extraction method, i.e., RGF is further used to remove the noise and the small texture structures to optimize the features of the initial hyperspectral image. Finally, these produced initial labeled samples and high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples are used as a training set for support vector machine (SVM).

It is normally used in combination with optimization algorithms for tuning its parameters to generate optimal objective values. This study proposed a state-of-the-art method using Simulated Annealing to improve Anfis performance. Malaria occurrences and spatial variation of environmental, socio-economic factors in Daknong province, Vietnam were selected for case study. For accuracy assessment, Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Cost curve were used and the predicted map was compared to several benchmark classifiers. The results showed that the S-Anfis (AUC = 0.912, RMSE =0.335) outperformed Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.902, RMSE =0.364), Multiple Layer Perceptron (AUC = 0.868, RMSE =0.430). Although, the performance of S-Anfis depended on proper selection of input factors and geographic variations of those, we concluded that this method could be an alternative in mapping susceptibility of malaria. ::: Keywords: Anfis, Simulated annealing, malaria. ::: References[1] WHO, World Malaria Report 2016, Geneva, 2016.[2] M.

The predictive modeling of such microbiota count data for the classification of human infection from parasitic worms, such as helminths, can help in the detection and management across global populations. Real-world datasets of microbiome experiments are typically sparse, containing hundreds of measurements for bacterial species, of which only a few are detected in the bio-specimens that are analyzed. This feature of microbiome data produces the challenge of needing more observations for accurate predictive modeling and has been dealt with previously, using different methods of feature reduction. To our knowledge, integrative methods, such as transfer learning, have not yet been explored in the microbiome domain as a way to deal with data sparsity by incorporating knowledge of different but related datasets. One way of incorporating this knowledge is by using a meaningful mapping among features of these datasets. In this paper, we claim that this mapping would exist among members of each individual cluster, grouped based on phylogenetic dependency among taxa and their association to the phenotype. We validate our claim by showing that models incorporating associations in such a grouped feature space result in no performance deterioration for the given classification task. In this paper, we test our hypothesis by using classification models that detect helminth infection in microbiota of human fecal samples obtained from Indonesia and Liberia countries. In our experiments, we first learn binary classifiers for helminth infection detection by using Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Random Forest methods. In the next step, we add taxonomic modeling by using the SMART-scan module to group the data, and learn classifiers using the same four methods, to test the validity of the achieved groupings. We observed a 6% to 23% and 7% to 26% performance improvement based on the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) and Balanced Accuracy (Bacc) measures, respectively, over 10 runs of 10-fold cross-validation. These results show that using phylogenetic dependency for grouping our microbiota data actually results in a noticeable improvement in classification performance for helminth infection detection. These promising results from this feasibility study demonstrate that methods such as SMART-scan can be utilized in the future for knowledge transfer from different but related microbiome datasets by phylogenetically-related functional mapping, to enable novel integrative biomarker discovery.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5325162", "pubmed_id": "28239609", "doi": "10.3390/data1030019", "venue": "Data", "journal": "Data", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2561337133", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["20460451", "15476942", "19505704", "2099459", "7918469", "14404887", "1123244", "7187403", "7844343", "16538498", "279065", "964964", "11433084", "12285670", "13493543", "373883", "878802", "17654166", "7384164", "215599844", "18683182", "14701241", "215669667", "61568722", "194951", "14837526", "89141", "13252401", "121861651", "13861754"], "inbound_citations": ["215037983", "201140676", "3548125", "51954762", "68178215", "195246500", "4551046"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15851791"}

However, one essential component in achieving high accuracy is the collection of high-quality fingerprints. The quality of fingerprints may vary due to uncontrollable factors such as environment noise, interference, and hardware instability. In our paper, we propose a method for collecting high-quality fingerprints for indoor positioning. First, we have developed a logistic regression classifier based on gradient descent to evaluate the quality of the collected channel frequency response (CFR) samples. We employ the classifier to sift out poor CFR samples and only retain good ones as input to the positioning system. We discover that our classifier can achieve high classification accuracy from over thousands of CFR samples. We then evaluate the positioning accuracy based on two techniques: Time-Reversal Resonating Strength (TRRS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We find that the sifted fingerprints always result in better positioning performance. For example, an average percentage improvement of 114% for TRRS and 22% for SVM compared to that of unsifted fingerprints of the same 40-MHz effective bandwidth.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3331052.3332475", "venue": "PERSIST-IoT '19", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2952518356", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:184483370"}

This paper proposes a method of performing prognostics on aircraft component based a binary classification Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification algorithm. The algorithm is used to classify each flight according to a fault pattern which the algorithm was trained to recognize. Flight data and maintenance logs were used to generate the training and testing datasets. In this case study, for each flight, a number of characteristics were extracted from parameters of the aircraft Air Management System. From the classification results a degradation index is created to serve as an aid to better plan the aircraft maintenance. An advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require a deep knowledge on the system. Furthermore, it does not need a large amount of input-output samples to be trained. The method should be easily extended to other aircraft systems as long as enough flight data and maintenance logs are available.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/AERO.2012.6187377", "venue": "2012 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "journal": "2012 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2022715465", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "60532258", "17534825", "12993242"], "inbound_citations": ["7585284", "4692658", "22285080", "4677741", "31331360", "44138430", "4681129", "4684859", "3398022", "209901066", "32034037", "22756912", "208635842", "202684144"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27381246"}

Most communities in this area suffer frequent incidence of debris flow, especially during monsoon seasons. Despite the loss of lives and properties recorded annually from debris flow, most studies in the region concentrate on landslides and flood susceptibilities. In this study, debris-flow susceptibility prediction was carried out using two data mining techniques; Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. The existing inventory of debris-flow events (640 points) were selected for training 70% (448) and validation 30% (192). Twelve conditioning factors namely; elevation, plan-curvature, slope angle, total curvature, slope aspect, Stream Transport Index (STI), profile curvature, roughness index, Stream Catchment Area (SCA), Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and Topographic Position Index (TPI) were selected from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Multi-collinearity was checked using Information Factor, Cramer\u2019s V, and Gini Index to identify the relative importance of conditioning factors. The susceptibility models were produced and categorized into five classes; not-susceptible, low, moderate, high and very-high classes. Models performances were evaluated using success and prediction rates where the area under the curve (AUC) showed a higher performance of MARS (93% and 83%) over SVR (76% and 72%).

The features comprise information from primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, predicted relative solvent accessibility, and position specific scoring matrix. The proposed method, called DBPPred, used Gaussian naive Bayes as the underlying classifier since it outperformed five other classifiers, including decision tree, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine with polynomial kernel, and support vector machine with radial basis function. As a result, the proposed DBPPred yields the highest average accuracy of 0.791 and average MCC of 0.583 according to the five-fold cross validation with ten runs on the training benchmark dataset PDB594. Subsequently, blind tests on the independent dataset PDB186 by the proposed model trained on the entire PDB594 dataset and by other five existing methods (including iDNA-Prot, DNA-Prot, DNAbinder, DNABIND and DBD-Threader) were performed, resulting in that the proposed DBPPred yielded the highest accuracy of 0.769, MCC of 0.538, and AUC of 0.790. The independent tests performed by the proposed DBPPred on completely a large non-DNA binding protein dataset and two RNA binding protein datasets also showed improved or comparable quality when compared with the relevant prediction methods. Moreover, we observed that majority of the selected features by the proposed method are statistically significantly different between the mean feature values of the DNA-binding and the non DNA-binding proteins. All of the experimental results indicate that the proposed DBPPred can be an alternative perspective predictor for large-scale determination of DNA-binding proteins.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3901691", "pubmed_id": "24475169", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0086703", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1992116297", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["37789742", "5985546", "12153238", "13091179", "13625015", "22775143", "12621673", "18751574", "13859890", "8218452", "7606205", "3678690", "206204431", "1714823", "1802664", "7956604", "17005639", "90462250", "13623877", "6058810", "41091428", "2944273", "8758400", "19073814", "32581669", "32755361", "21181609", "5270579", "40589986", "14294957", "207520490", "2181319", "1921091", "11617167", "42490319", "1068604", "14514863", "21972403", "3230695", "15531335", "3160846", "24116516", "24219045", "14206871", "3977587", "40287681", "6823830", "11114746", "7161110", "206341706", "14245485", "89141", "10659969", "8366878", "5822023", "11748720", "4675178"], "inbound_citations": ["28594850", "155613925", "6466844", "21668588", "16680577", "209603029", "30444761", "85527703", "1364334", "13299648", "52276868", "32090686", "9941166", "7326315", "19071918", "24965640", "14340163", "3162881", "215061268", "49406159", "208040126", "215707777", "49573055", "16018159", "211120004", "16047378", "27847417", "16036891", "9675332", "22034498", "51905224", "5861066", "214847365", "202700650", "4588673", "54436347", "9892736", "5574043", "215008507", "201661573", "56049306", "209336155", "38739602", "214778346", "67861059", "1395304", "32135584", "196633736", "958476", "215637225"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8320048"}

We tested two types of neural network: Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines, trained in supervised mode. The universe of data consisted of 2903 patterns extracted from records of the PVAQ station, of the seismography network of the Institute of Meteorology of Portugal. The spectral characteristics of the records and its variation in time were reflected in the input patterns, consisting in a set of values of power spectral density in selected frequencies, extracted from a spectrogram calculated over a segment of record of pre-determined duration. The universe of data was divided, with about 60% for the training and the remainder reserved for testing and validation. To ensure that all patterns in the universe of data were within the range of variation of the training set, we used an algorithm to separate the universe of data by hyper-convex polyhedrons, determining in this manner a set of patterns that have a mandatory part of the training set. Additionally, an active learning strategy was conducted, by iteratively incorporating poorly classified cases in the training set. The best results, in terms of sensitivity and selectivity in the whole data ranged between 98% and 100%.

Recently deep learning has been introduced into CS-MRI to further improve the image quality and shorten reconstruction time. In this paper, we propose an efficient structurally strengthened Generative Adversarial Network, termed ESSGAN, for reconstructing MR images from highly under-sampled k-space data. ESSGAN consists of a structurally strengthened generator (SG) and a discriminator. In SG, we introduce strengthened connections (SCs) to improve the utilization of the feature maps between the proposed strengthened convolutional autoencoders (SCAEs), where each SCAE is a variant of a typical convolutional autoencoder.

Moreover, it can give the encoder blocks and the decoder blocks richer texture features. To further reduce artifacts and preserve more image details, we introduce an enhanced structural loss to SG.

The main objective of the segmentation process is to modify and simplify the representation of an image into an easier form for efficient analysis. The performance of the image segmentation process reduces due to the occurrence of noise and disturbances in the image. Existing segmentation approaches suffer from the performance degradation in the segmentation accuracy owing to the quality of the acquired satellite image. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes an efficient image segmentation process for the clear view of the multi-temporal satellite image. Gaussian Filter (GF) is used for filtering the image to remove the noises present in the image. PSO-Affine based image registration is applied for the extraction of the pixel points and registration of the multi-temporal image. Removal of cloud from the image is performed to get a clear view of the image. Feature extraction is performed by using the Fast-Scale Invariant Feature Transform (F-SIFT) approach. The feature points of the image are extracted to form the cluster including six different classes such as building area, road area, vegetation area, tree area, water area and land area.

In distributed SSL problems, training data including labeled and unlabeled samples is separately stored on each node over the communication network and cannot be centrally processed. In order to solve these problems, we propose an algorithm combining the semi-supervised ELM (SS-ELM) algorithm with the zero-gradient-sum (ZGS) distributed optimization strategy. The SS-ELM algorithm, based on the manifold regularization (MR) framework, is used to approximate the mapping of samples on each node over the communication network. Then, the ZGS strategy is used to train the globally optimal coefficients of the single layer feed-forward neural network (SLFNN) corresponding to the SS-ELM algorithm. Thus, we denote the proposed algorithm as the distributed SS-ELM (DSS-ELM) algorithm. During the training process, all nodes over the communication network exchange updated coefficients rather than raw data with their neighboring nodes. It means that the DSS-ELM algorithm is a fully distributed and privacy-preserving algorithm. The convergence of the proposed DSS-ELM is guaranteed by the Lyapunov method.

One of the most prominent methods applies the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to data recorded from sEMG electrodes to extract coordinated motor patterns, the so-called muscle synergies, which theorize a modular control of the muscles by the CNS. Muscle Synergies can represent a major breakthrough in prosthetics control, since they require a low number of sEMG signals to express the degrees of freedom (DoF), while current prostheses need at least two muscles for every DoF. Starting from this hypothesis, we developed an FPGA-based, real-time NMF processor to extract muscle synergies from an 8-electrode sEMG recording and feed them to a Support Vector Machine classifier which recognizes the specific movement. The FPGA covers a fundamental role, since a classical microprocessor would be too slow to execute the NMF in real time, a CPU too power hungry, and an ASIC too costly to design and produce and without the reconfiguration capabilities of FPGA. Preliminary results show a fast reaction time, with a speed-up of 24.31x versus the on-board ARM processor for the NMF and 9.91x for the SVM, and an overall increase in power efficiency of 3.1x against a Desktop CPU (TDP 65W) and 6.56x on the ARM.

A. Doumas (adoumas@psych.ucla.edu) John E. Hummel (jhummel@psych.ucla.edu) Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles 405 Hilgard Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563 Abstract the symbols and their arrangement (i.e., role-filler bindings). For example, the expressions chase (Pat, Don) and chase (Don, Pat) mean different things, but Pat, Don, and chase mean the same things in both expressions. Formal symbol systems have this property by assumption: It is given in the definition of the system that symbols retain their meanings across different expressions, and that the meaning of an expression is a function of both its constituent symbols and their arrangement. Physical symbol systems (Newell, 1990)\u2014such as digital computers and human brains\u2014cannot simply \u201cassume\u201d these properties, but instead must actively work to ensure that both are satisfied. The claim that human mental representations are symbolic in this sense is controversial (e.g., Elman et al., 1996), however, relational generalization has proved unattainable for non-symbolic models of cognition, and there is reason to believe it is fundamentally unattainable for such models (see Doumas & Hummel, in press; Halford, Wilson, & Phillips, 1998; Hummel & Holyoak, 2003a; Marcus, 1998). Human mental representations are both structure-sensitive (i.e., symbolic) and semantically rich. Connectionist models have well-known limitations in capturing the structure- sensitivity of mental representations, while traditional symbolic models based on varieties of symbol-argument- argument notation (SAA) have difficulty capturing their semantic richness. We argue that this limitation of SAA is fundamental and cannot be alleviated in the notational format of SAA itself. Finally, we review an approach to human mental representation that captures both its structure- sensitivity and semantic richness. Relational reasoning\u2014reasoning constrained by the relational roles that objects play, rather than just the features of the objects themselves\u2014is ubiquitous in human mental life, and includes analogical inference, schema induction, and the application of explicit rules (Gentner, 1983; Holyoak & Thagard, 1995). In order to support human-like relational thinking, a representational system must meet two general requirements (Hummel & Holyoak, 1997): First, it must represent relations independently of their fillers and simultaneously specify how fillers are bound to relational roles (i.e., it must be a symbol system; Newell, 1990). Second, it must explicitly specify the semantic content of relational roles and their fillers. In this paper, we consider in detail the implications of the latter requirement, with an emphasis on symbol-argument-argument notation (SAA), which includes propositional notation, high-rank tensors, and many varieties of labeled graphs. Human Relational Representations Specify the Semantic Content of Objects and Relational Roles A second important property of human relational representations is that they explicitly specify the semantic content of objects and relational roles (e.g., the lover and beloved roles of love (x, y) or the killer and killed roles of murder (x, y)): We know what it means to be a lover or a killer, and that knowledge is part of our representation of the relation itself (as opposed to being specified in a lookup table, a set of inference rules, or some other external structure). As a result, it is easy to appreciate that the patient (i.e., killed) role of murder (x, y) is like the patient role of manslaughter (x, y), even though the agent roles differ (i.e., the act is intentional in the former case but not the latter); and the agent (i.e., killer) role of murder (x, y) is similar to the agent role of attempted-murder (x, y), even though the patient roles differ. More evidence that we represent the semantics of relational roles explicitly is that we can easily solve mappings that violate the \u201cn-ary\u201d restriction (Hummel & Holyoak, 1997). That is, we can map n-place predicates onto m-place predicates where n \u2260 m .

For example, the symbol \u201cloves\u201d suggests different relations in loves (Mary, John) vs. loves (Mary, Chocolate).

These techniques were evaluated on several tree species, and advantages and disadvantages of each method were noted. RF provides the best prediction maps of potential suitable habitat. Overall, a combination of RTA, BT, and RF may yield the best information and most interpretable maps of suitable habitat. Using these tools, we provide statistics on potential changes in suitable habitat for 135 tree species of eastern North America.A suitable habitat does not guarantee the presence of a species, as many barriers for the species still exist before it will be able to colonize that new suitable habitat. Dispersal ability, abundance of the colonizing species, and the nature of fragmented landscapes also influence migration and are modeled with our cellular automata model, SHIFT. For each cell outside a species' current boundary, SHIFT creates an estimate of the probability that each unoccupied cell will become colonized over 100 years. By evaluating the probability of colonization within the potential \u201cnew\u201d suitable habitat, we can estimate the proportion of new habitat that might be colonized within a century. This proportion is low (<15%) for five example species, suggesting that there is a serious lag between the potential movement of suitable habitat and the potential for the species to migrate into the new habitat.

We compare SVMs with several neural network models, such as the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the Elman recurrent network, finite/infinite impulse response networks, and neural network ARMAX approaches. In addition, we present a profile-dependent SVM (PD-SVM), which incorporates a priori knowledge in both tasks. Models are compared numerically, statistically, and in the presence of additive noise. Data from 57 renal allograft recipients were used to develop the models. Patients followed a standard triple therapy, and CyA trough concentration was the dependent variable. The best results for the CyA blood concentration prediction were obtained using the PD-SVM (mean error of 0.36 ng/mL and root-mean-square error of 52.01 ng/mL in the validation set) and appeared to be more robust in the presence of additive noise. The proposed PD-SVM improved results from the standard SVM and MLP, specially significant (both numerical and statistically) in the one-against-all scheme.

Among such learning models, semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) is a typical and prominent one.

In this paper, we put forward a method with the name of EnsembleS3VM which deals with the unknown distribution by ensemble learning. It builds a semi-supervised SVM model composed of base learners based on different disturbance factors, and raises an ensemble method based on clustering evaluation means. Meanwhile, it presents a combination of two multi-classification strategies in order to reduce the running time and enhance the classification accuracy simultaneously. The proposed method can deal with semi-supervised classification problems even with unknown distribution or unbalanced data.

To address this problem, this study presents a granular support vector regression(SVR) model based on dynamical granulation, namely DGSVR, by using the dynamical hierarchical granulation method. With DGSVR, the original data are mapped into the high-dimensional space by mercer kernel to reveal the distribution features implicit in original sample space, and the data are divided into some granules initially. Then, some granules are obtained with important regression information by measuring the distances of granules and regression hyperplane. By computing the radius and density of granules, the deep dynamical granulation process executes until there are no informational granules need to be granulated. Finally, those granules in different granulation levels are extracted and trained by SVR. The experimental results on benchmark function datasets and UCI regression datasets demonstrate that the DGSVR model can quickly finish the dynamical granulation process and is convergent.

Criteria based on our best understanding of naturally occurring nutrient concentrations would protect both water quality and aquatic biota. Previous approaches to predicting natural background nutrient concentrations have relied on some form of landscape categorization (e.g., nutrient ecoregions) to account for natural variability among water bodies. However, natural variation within these regions is so high that use of a single criterion can underprotect naturally occurring low-nutrient streams and overprotect naturally occurring high-nutrient steams. We developed Random Forest models to predict how baseflow concentrations of total P (TP) and total N (TN) vary among western USA streams in response to continuous spatial variation in nutrient sources, sinks, or other processes affecting nutrient concentrations. Both models were relatively accurate (root mean square errors ...", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1899/12-113.1", "venue": null, "journal": "Freshwater Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2116973951", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["4426307", "84432470", "26530", "45571775", "67753023", "89141", "60993494", "8386177", "94161916", "85197770", "1665955", "128613129", "5111261", "34775169", "3626971", "124239513", "83666878", "95761171", "129560582", "9906650", "26849528", "86197909", "19483274", "31843199", "130558983", "95056816", "129593637", "86072461", "34719665", "84928413", "129166754", "16932791", "86337305", "128943479", "23278008", "140551903", "94855778", "81202053", "13487426", "97491270", "84421607", "97539165", "18657841", "129169938", "98347112", "24882710", "127052391", "121347595", "28528", "129688268", "97956625", "84449650", "4377548", "8905177", "51842487", "94919957", "39927587", "94064817", "119693822", "98380350", "25312918", "35783130", "20454819", "128895473", "128486897", "25946503", "140560889", "128755169", "7885846", "84480635", "8397120", "73517121", "19626258", "53660774", "58887597", "16235805", "83754059", "129095406", "86326663", "140696959", "11843111", "106879574", "12667765"], "inbound_citations": ["53801431", "58921978", "90755591", "208879485", "3323345", "202899688", "202190026", "8459437", "4520234"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55181857"}

In this paper Text Classification (TC) has been taken as the IR task and the effect of linguistic capabilities of the underlying system have been studied. A novel model for TC, extending a well know statistical model (i.e. Rocchio's formula [Ittner et al., 1995]) and applied to linguistic features has been defined and experimented. The proposed model represents an effective feature selection methodology. All the experiments result in a significant improvement with respect to other purely statistical methods (e.g. [Yang, 1999]), thus stressing the relevance of the available linguistic information. Moreover, the derived classifier reachs the performance (about 85%) of the best known models (i.e. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K -Nearest Neighbour (KNN)) characterized by an higher computational complexity for training and processing.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IJCAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "206499635", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10826654", "59816896", "1797618", "5327274", "13889899", "3366452", "2427083", "5083193"], "inbound_citations": ["203594609", "17306222", "34365682", "15628571", "17556467", "18235179", "18640902", "14498663", "18318880", "17498671", "18292032", "41328579", "14451633", "1259740", "3037672", "554403"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9622961"}

Here we consider concentration of mRNA in a cell at step as depending on the concentration of mRNA and proteins at step (n \u2014 1) in that particular cell. Similarly the protein concentration in a cell at step n depends on the concentration of protein and mRNA at step (n \u2014 1) in that particular cell.
