Most data mining methods depend on a set of features that define the behavior of the learning algorithm and directly or indirectly influence the complexity of the resulting models. Hence, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of mining task on high dimensional data, the data must be preprocessed. Feature selection is a preprocessing step which aims to reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting the most informative features that influence the diagnosis of the disease. We propose a feature selection embedded Hybrid Prediction model that combines two different functionalities of data mining; the clustering and the classification. The F-score feature selection method and k-means clustering selects the optimal feature subsets of the medical datasets that enhances the performance of the Support Vector Machine classifier. The performance of the SVM classifier is empirically evaluated on the reduced feature subset of Diabetes, Breast Cancer and Heart disease data sets. The proposed model is validated using four parameters namely the Accuracy of the classifier, Area Under ROC Curve, Sensitivity and Specificity. The results prove that the proposed feature selection embedded hybrid prediction model indeed improve the predictive power of the classifier and reduce false positive and false negative rates.

However, in many real applications (i.e., abnormality detection), there is a lack of sufficient data to achieve a good deep learning model. Considering the fact that collecting massive labeled training data for a new task is often expensive and time-consuming, it is critical to transfer and reuse the knowledge of the labeled data or simulation data to the new task. To tackle this issue, we propose a deep transfer learning method in this paper. On one hand, we pre-train a basic deep learning model with the related training data. Then, we treat the learning model as a starting point for the current problem to train the new deep learning model.

Existing learning-based methods usually construct local regions from the point cloud and extract the corresponding features using shared Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and max pooling. However, most of these processes do not adequately take the spatial distribution of the point cloud into account, limiting the ability to perceive fine-grained patterns. We design a novel Local Spatial Attention (LSA) module to adaptively generate attention maps according to the spatial distribution of local regions. The feature learning process which integrates with these attention maps can effectively capture the local geometric structure. We further propose the Spatial Feature Extractor (SFE), which constructs a branch architecture, to aggregate the spatial information with associated features in each layer of the network better.The experiments show that our network, named LSANet, can achieve on par or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods when evaluating on the challenging benchmark datasets.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs), for example, have been found successful with a recursive procedure in selecting most important genes for cancer prediction. It is not well understood, however, how much the success depends on the choice of the classifier, and how much on the recursive procedure. We answer this question by examining multiple classifiers (SVM, ridge regression and Rocchio) with feature selection in recursive and non-recursive settings, on a DNA microarray dataset (AMLALL) and a text categorization benchmark (Reuters-21578). We found recursive ridge regression most effective: its best classification performance (zero error) on the AMLALL dataset was obtained when using only 3 genes (selected from over 7000), which is more impressive than the best published result on the same benchmark - zero error of recursive SVM using 8 genes. On Reuters-21578, recursive ridge regression also achieves the best result ever published (the improvement was verified in a significance test). An in-depth analysis of the experimental results shows that the choice of classifier heavily influences the recursive feature selection process: the ridge regression classifier tends to penalize redundant features to a much larger extent than the SVM does.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1066677.1066918", "venue": "SAC '05", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2161802321", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2914506", "207720429", "2427083", "1455429", "118361606", "12718468", "10142996", "7098682", "2860274", "10181318"], "inbound_citations": ["67869699", "14969588", "195710839", "125942602"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15260186"}

The study area is divided into different Physiographic Land Units (PLU) based on landform, landuse and slope. Random Forest model (RFM) was developed based on field survey data of 116 surface samples (0\u201330 cm) representing all major PLU units of the study area. RFM is neither sensitive to over fitting nor to noise features and has capacity to handle large datasets. High resolution satellite imagery (IRS LISS IV data- 3 bands), terrain attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, topographic position index, plan & profile curvature, Multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness and Multi-resolution ridge top flatness, Vegetation factors like NDVI, EVI and land use land cover (LULC) are used as covariates along with legacy soil data of 1:50,000 scale. The predicted organic carbon, pH and EC ranged from 0.24\u20131.03%, 6.9\u20139.0, 0.11\u20130.97 dsm\u2212 1 respectively. The model performance was evaluated based on Coefficient of determination (R2) and Lin's Concordance coefficient (CCC). The model performed well with R2 and CCC values of 0.23 and 0.38 for SOC, 0.30 and 0.37 for pH, and 0.62 and 0.70 for EC respectively. Variable importance ranking of RFM model showed that EVI and NDVI are the most important predictors for organic carbon whereas drainage and NDVI for EC and pH respectively.

The ensemble learning paradigm has proved to be relevant to solving most challenging industrial problems. Despite its successful application especially in the Bioinformatics, the petroleum industry has not benefited enough from the promises of this machine learning technology. The petroleum industry, with its persistent quest for high-performance predictive models, is in great need of this new learning methodology. A marginal improvement in the prediction indices of petroleum reservoir properties could have huge positive impact on the success of exploration, drilling and the overall reservoir management portfolio. Support vector machines (SVM) is one of the promising machine learning tools that have performed excellently well in most prediction problems. However, its performance is a function of the prudent choice of its tuning parameters most especially the regularization parameter, C. Reports have shown that this parameter has significant impact on the performance of SVM. Understandably, no specific value has been recommended for it. This paper proposes a stacked generalization ensemble model of SVM that incorporates different expert opinions on the optimal values of this parameter in the prediction of porosity and permeability of petroleum reservoirs using datasets from diverse geological formations. The performance of the proposed SVM ensemble was compared to that of conventional SVM technique, another SVM implemented with the bagging method, and Random Forest technique. The results showed that the proposed ensemble model, in most cases, outperformed the others with the highest correlation coefficient, and the lowest mean and absolute errors. The study indicated that there is a great potential for ensemble learning in petroleum reservoir characterization to improve the accuracy of reservoir properties predictions for more successful explorations and increased production of petroleum resources.

Weeds are one of the major restrictions to sustaining crop productivity.

This will help pinpoint maize fields to be prioritized for weed control. Satellite remote sensing offers incomparable opportunities for precision agriculture, ecological applications and vegetation characterisation, with vast socioeconomic benefits. This work compares and evaluates the strength of Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite with the constellation of Dove nanosatellites i.e. PlanetScope (PS) data in detecting and mapping Striga ( Striga hermonthica ) weed within intercropped maize fields in Rongo sub-county in western Kenya. We applied the S2 and PS derived spectral data and vegetation indices in mapping the Striga occurrence. Data analysis was implemented, using the Guided Regularised Random Forest (GRRF) classifier. Comparatively, Sentinel-2 demonstrated slightly lower Striga detection capacity than PlanetScope, with an overall accuracy of 88% and 92%, respectively. The results further showed that the VNIR (Blue, Green Red and NIR) and the Atmospheric resistance Vegetation Index (ARVI) were the most fundamental variables in detecting and mapping Striga presence in maize fields.

However, still we lack sufficient knowledge of core ecological features and processes, e.g., species distribution dynamics, environmental drivers, and their links. Although meaningful management requires knowledge of the spatial structure and variability of the systems, the traditional approach sees species handled together according to the concept of ecological communities. Consequently, the scientific \u201chandling\u201d of the linkage between environmental drivers and biota does neither consider nor test whether the targeted communities actually exist or are just artificial artifacts created by the classification process. Crisp classifications are used to identify and define \u201ccommunities\u201d adding the further limitation of correctly setting a community border that possibly does not exist. But how valid is this approach? This is the question we tackle here. ::: We analyse a large data set of about 1150 grab samples of benthic macrofauna collected in the German Bight. We applied fuzzy logic to provide an unsupervised classification of any degree of species association. Random Forest aided in mapping all degrees of species association and to shed light on their potential environmental drivers. Our approach overcomes the problem of crisp borders between communities. It classifies faunal associations in a continuous range from areas where one community can be well defined to areas where no community is distinguishable. One endpoint of this range is characterized by associations with highly structured interactions and dependency between species. The other endpoint is characterized by associations assembled by random processes. ::: The German Bight benthos displays the full range of association types.

Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

The portable (handheld) X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) is one such tool enabling onsite elemental analysis in a straightforward manner. However, in soil studies the use of XRF often remains cumbersome, following the poor performance of the method for low-Z elemental analysis and the complex nature of the soil matrix, introducing background noise. Here, we therefore evaluate how the potential use of a portable XRF for predicting potassium (K), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) can be improved through the analysis of XRF spectral data with the Random Forest (RF) machine learning method. A total of 105 soil samples from a wide range of soils collected from 10 different countries (D.R. Congo, Belgium, Ivory Coast, Italy, The Netherlands, Saudi-Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe) were scanned using an Oxford XMET8000 XRF spectrometer (Oxford Instruments, UK). Spectral data of the calibration set (n = 74) were pulled in one matrix alongside measured elemental concentrations and subjected to RF analysis. Resulting models were validated using an independent validation set (n = 31). The best RF prediction result was obtained for K followed successively by Ca, Mg and P with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.69, and 0.47, and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2283.8, 6818.7, 1511.8, and 538.08 mg kg\u22121, respectively. The RF modelling procedure provided improved prediction performance compared to the calibration models provided by the manufacturer (R2 = 0.65, 0.75, 0.65, and 0.22, for K, Ca, Mg and P, respectively). Our results suggest that portable XRF instruments coupled with spectral data analysis by RF allows for rapid and low-cost analysis of soil K and Ca with remarkable accuracy.

This paper proposes a personal TSI prediction method termed as the enhanced Predicted Thermal State (ePTS) method by sensing physiological parameters namely, hand skin temperature and pulse rate, along with the ambient air temperature. The ePTS method is developed through significant enhancements over our previous skin temperature based PTS model. First, we investigate pulse rate as a potential TSI predictor. Second, we propose a logic-gated normalization process to address the individual differences in pulse rate. Third, we develop a spectral analysis approach to formulate a new pulse rate feature. Consequently, six significant TSI predictive features are curated that map the TSI based on an optimized Support Vector Machine algorithm. The method is compared with 5 different input cases and 3 state-of-the-art methods. Pulse rate is revealed to be a significant TSI predictor subject to the occupant's gender and BMI. The ePTS method achieves the highest accuracy at over 97%, outperforming the PTS model (82%), and other physiology based methods (82%\u201394%). The study is substantiated with extensive real human experiments in regulated thermal environment.

Results of real decoupling experiments demonstrated that the proposed the PV-ELM decoupling algorithm outperforms linear decoupling algorithms for six-axis F/M sensors.

In this work, we improved the land cover classification accuracy by integrating free and public high-resolution Google Earth images (HR-GEI) with Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Our major innovation is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: (1) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier that extracts high-resolution features from Google Earth imagery; (2) traditional machine learning classifiers (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) that are based on spectral features extracted from 30-m Landsat data; and (3) an ensemble decision maker that takes all different features into account.

Moreover, our proposed method reduces misclassifications between certain vegetation types, and improves identification of the impervious type. Evaluation applied over an area of around 14,000 km2 confirms little improvement for land cover types (e.g., forest) of which the classification accuracies are already over 80% when using traditional machine learning approaches, yet improvements in accuracy of 7% for cropland and shrubland, 9% for grassland, 23% for impervious and 25% for wetlands were achieved when compared with traditional machine learning approaches.

In this model, contextual features are mapped into a shared latent space to semantically characterize them in the embedding layer. The contextual features with their higher-order interactions are captured through the interaction layer and the perception layers. Multi-tasks prediction is realized by stacking task-specific perception layers on the shared neural layers. Armed with these, DNM provides a powerful framework to integrate with various contextual features to realize multi-attributes QoS prediction. Experimental results from a large-scale QoS-specific dataset demonstrate that DNM achieves superior prediction accuracy in term of mean absolute error (MAE) compared with the state-of-the-art collaborative QoS prediction techniques. Additionally, the DNM model has a good robustness and extensibility on exploiting heterogeneous contextual features.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSC.2018.2859986", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Services Computing", "mag_id": "2884048157", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195749837", "208632045", "208103446", "58655425"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70333194"}

SVMs deliver state-of-the-art performance in real-world applications such as text categorisation, hand-written character recognition, image classification, biosequences analysis, etc., and are now established as one of the standard tools for machine learning and data mining. Students will find the book both stimulating and accessible, while practitioners will be guided smoothly through the material required for a good grasp of the theory and its applications. The concepts are introduced gradually in accessible and self-contained stages, while the presentation is rigorous and thorough. Pointers to relevant literature and web sites containing software ensure that it forms an ideal starting point for further study. Equally, the book and its associated web site will guide practitioners to updated literature, new applications, and on-line software.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null,

In recent years, several water management issues have been addressed by means of models derived from Artificial Intelligence research. When using machine learning based models, the main challenging aspects are represented by the choice of the best possible algorithm, the choice of adequately representative variables and the availability of appropriate data sets. Machine learning algorithms may be a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration, when a time series of few years is available. Starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision. Three different evapotranspiration models have been compared in this study. The models differ in the input variables. Four variants of each model were applied, varying the machine learning algorithm: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. The data refers to an experimental site in Central Florida, characterized by humid subtropical climate. The best outcomes have been provided by Model 1, whose input variables were net solar radiation, sensible-heat flux, moisture content of the soil, wind speed, mean relative humidity and mean temperature. Model 3, built from data only of mean temperature, mean relative humidity and net solar radiation, has provided still satisfactory results. Model 2, which adds the wind speed to the input variables of Model 3, has provided results that are absolutely comparable to those of Model 3 itself.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.agwat.2019.03.015", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural Water Management", "mag_id": "2920819147", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210293254", "197828769", "210260814", "211130406", "207794990"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159165022"}

The specific modules solve tasks like sentence boundary detection, tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, named entity recognition, generation of potential relations, generation of machine learning features for each relation, and finally, assignment of confidence scores and ranking of candidate relations.

We tackle this problem by combining tools from sequence prediction and generative adversarial networks: a recurrent sequence-to-sequence model observes motion histories and predicts future behavior, using a novel pooling mechanism to aggregate information across people. We predict socially plausible futures by training adversarially against a recurrent discriminator, and encourage diverse predictions with a novel variety loss.

Object-oriented image analysis has become one of the key-concepts to better exploit additional spatial, spectral and contextual information. The multitude of additional object attributes calls for the use of advanced data mining and machine learning tools to identify the most suitable features and handle the non-linear classification task. In this study we used the Random Forest algorithm for the selection of useful features and object classification in the context of landslide mapping. A workflow for image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification was developed and tested with multi-sensor optical imagery from four different test sites. Due to class imbalance and class overlap between landslide and non-landslide areas the classifier can be heavily biased towards over- and under-prediction of the affected areas. This is a common issue for many real-world applications and a procedure to estimate a well-adjusted class ratio from the training samples was designed and tested. A number of potentially useful object metrics was evaluated and it was demonstrated that topographically guided texture measures provide significant enhancements.

Today's smart phones are equipped with increasingly more sensors and accessible data types that enable the collection of literally dozens of signals regarding the phone, its user, and their environment. A great deal of research effort in academia and industry is put into mining this data for higher level sense-making, such as understanding user context, inferring social networks, learning individual features, and so on. In many cases this analysis work is the result of exploratory forays and trial-and-error.

In this work we investigate the properties of learning and inference of real world data collected via mobile phones over time. In particular, we analyze how the ability to predict individual parameters and social links is incrementally enhanced with the accumulation of additional data. To do so we use the \\emph{Friends and Family} dataset, containing rich data signals gathered from the smart phones of 140 adult members of an MIT based young-family residential community for over a year, and is one of the most comprehensive mobile phone datasets gathered in academia to date. We develop several models for predicting social and individual properties from sensed mobile phone data over time, including detection of life-partners, ethnicity, and whether a person is a student or not.

This process can be achieved by capacity estimation, which is a direct fading indicator for assessing the state of health of a battery. However, the capacity of a lithium-ion battery onboard is difficult to monitor. This paper presents a data-driven approach for online capacity estimation. First, six novel features are extracted from cyclic charge/discharge cycles and used as indirect health indicators. An adaptive multi-kernel relevance machine (MKRVM) based on accelerated particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to determine the optimal parameters of MKRVM and characterize the relationship between extracted features and battery capacity. The overall estimation process comprises offline and online stages.

The usual way to enhance the analysis accuracy is to improve the quality and consistency of the emission signal, such as by averaging the spectral signals or spectrum standardization over a number of laser shots. The proposed method focuses more on how to enhance the robustness of the quantitative analysis regression model. The proposed RLS-SVM regression model originates from the Weighted Least Squares Support Vector Machine (WLS-SVM) but has an improved segmented weighting function and residual error calculation according to the statistical distribution of measured spectral data. Through the improved segmented weighting function, the information on the spectral data in the normal distribution will be retained in the regression model while the information on the outliers will be restrained or removed. Copper elemental concentration analysis experiments of 16 certified standard brass samples were carried out. The average value of relative standard deviation obtained from the RLS-SVM model was 3.06% and the root mean square error was 1.537%. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved better prediction accuracy and better modeling robustness compared with the quantitative analysis methods based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and WLS-SVM.

In the proposed method, a GAN model is taken as a regressor to generate invariant gait images that is side view images with normal clothing and without carrying bags. A unique advantage of this approach is that the view angle and other variations are not needed before generating invariant gait images. The most important computational challenge, however, is to address how to retain useful identity information when generating the invariant gait images. To this end, our approach differs from the traditional GAN which has only one discriminator in that GaitGAN contains two discriminators. One is a fake/real discriminator which can make the generated gait images to be realistic. Another one is an identification discriminator which ensures that the the generated gait images contain human identification information.

This extrapolation can be done by using satellite imagery, which provides information in the infrared thermal band; however, this band is not available in most current operational remote sensors. Our work hypothesis is that it is possible to generate a spatially distributed estimation of $\\text{ET}_{d}$ without thermal band by using nonparametric models as regression random forest models (RRFM). Six Landsat-7 scenes were used to generate the RRFM. Results were evaluated by comparing the values of $\\text{ET}_{d}$ provided by RRFM with that obtained using the surface energy balance model. It has been shown that the results generated by RRFM present a good agreement with METRIC (mapping ET at high resolution using internalized calibration) results, both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially for agricultural vegetation and forest land covers. Moreover, it has been detected that the RRFM estimation quality depends on the meteorological conditions on the days previous to the satellite register.

One of the fundamental questions in a SNP-disease association study is to find an optimal subset of SNPs with predicting power for disease status. To find that subset while reducing study burden in terms of time and costs, one can potentially reconcile information redundancy from associations between SNP markers.ResultsWe have developed a feature selection method named Supervised Recursive Feature Addition (SRFA). This method combines supervised learning and statistical measures for the chosen candidate features/SNPs to reconcile the redundancy information and, in doing so, improve the classification performance in association studies. Additionally, we have proposed a Support Vector based Recursive Feature Addition (SVRFA) scheme in SNP-disease association analysis.ConclusionsWe have proposed using SRFA with different statistical learning classifiers and SVRFA for both SNP selection and disease classification and then applying them to two complex disease data sets. In general, our approaches outperform the well-known feature selection method of Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination and logic regression-based SNP selection for disease classification in genetic association studies.

This analysis is very valuable for cultural protection and heritage. However, few studies have focused on recognition of Flying Apsaras in the Dunhuang Grotto Murals, China, which record elements of Chinese culture in different Chinese dynasties. By introducing a set of feature descriptors for Flying Apsaras' streamers, this paper proposes a morphological streamer feature descriptor to describe the shape-based features (i.e., slenderness, posture ratio, area ratio, and intensity) of Flying Apsaras' streamers. Then, a Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM) is implemented to locate and recognize Flying Apsaras' streamers using the proposed feature descriptor. This machine is composed of two important parts: region segmentation of the images in the Dunhuang Grotto Murals, and KSVM-based feature selection for streamer recognition. The implemented KSVM approach incorporating the proposed morphological feature descriptor can classify streamer regions with 89.56% accuracy.

Although some interesting alternative methods have been proposed to enforce the 1-Lipschitz property, these existing approaches (e.g., weight clipping, gradient penalty (GP), and spectral normalization (SN)) are only partially successful. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which we refer to as spectral bounding (SB) to strictly enforce the 1-Lipschitz constraint. Our method adopts very cost-effective terms of both 1-norm and \u221e-norm, and yet allows us to efficiently approximate the upper bound of spectral norms. In this way, our method provide important insights to the relationship between an alternative of strictly satisfying the Lipschitz property and explainable training stability improvements of GAN. Our proposed method thus significantly enhances the stability of GAN training and the quality of generated images.

This paper proposes a novel method for insulator strings detection, and presents an appearance representation for insulator strings in infrared image based on Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK) and Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD).

A classification model based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is integrated into multi-scale sliding window framework for locating insulator string in infrared image. Then redundant regions are merged by non-maximum suppression and shape prior knowledge constraints. The classification accuracy of the proposed method is 89.1026% on our standard infrared insulator dataset, and insulator strings under various conditions can be successfully detected.

To improve the capability of interpreting the result of dissolved gas analysis, an artificial immune network classification algorithm (AINC), inspired by the natural immune system that is able to respond to an almost unlimited multitude of foreign pathogens, is proposed in this paper. The immune network system describes the complex interaction of antibodies and antigens in virtue of some immune mechanisms, such as immune learning, immune memory, etc. AINC mimics these adaptive learning and defense mechanisms to respond to fault samples of power transformers. Consequently, AINC can find a limited number of antibodies representing all fault samples distributing structures and features, which helps to realize dynamic classification. This proposed AINC algorithm has been tested by many real fault samples, and its results are compared with those of IEC ratio codes and artificial neural networks, which indicates that the proposed approach has remarkable diagnosis accuracy, and with it multiple incipient faults can be classified effectively", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TPWRD.2007.893182", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2039973395", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["38133575", "109973834", "6788417", "29796025", "64644180", "109911141", "108575616", "14372202", "108575319", "41574937", "110246925", "110300408", "497638", "111286669", "111576457", "82369620"], "inbound_citations": ["2648949", "4681794", "54014025", "13752409", "17957980", "163159570", "53999865", "115606375", "8633277", "21211000", "16185254", "22354350", "198929431", "3896779", "49556545", "41611596", "20637183", "11384055", "16992445", "202753156", "54093139", "43335221", "32532270", "111121387", "1364309", "10768909", "34375790", "14289073", "24912410", "115993838", "14006820", "1734001", "45270267", "40827580", "21584177", "37495725", "53437513", "108632135", "5328722", "12890721", "43113288", "3029521", "110306165", "23359103", "129926753", "15718878", "6108083", "13828395", "16851013", "35839541", "18789147", "43401059", "9338147", "16051053"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44054459"}

It provides a mean for automatic reporting of the different events that happen in inhabited areas. This remarkably promotes public safety and traffic management applications. After the wide adoption of convolutional neural networks methods, the accuracy of semantic segmentation algorithms could easily surpass 80% if a robust dataset is provided. Despite this success, the deployment of a pre-trained segmentation model to survey a new city that is not included in the training set significantly decreases the accuracy. This is due to the domain shift between the source dataset on which the model is trained and the new target domain of the new city images. In this paper, we address this issue and consider the challenge of domain adaptation in semantic segmentation of aerial images. We design an algorithm that reduces the domain shift impact using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In the experiments, we test the proposed methodology on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) semantic segmentation dataset and found that our method improves the overall accuracy from 35% to 52% when passing from Potsdam domain (considered as source domain) to Vaihingen domain (considered as target domain).

In addition, this region is chronically food insecure because inter-annual crop production strongly fluctuates mainly due to high variability of meteorological conditions and poor soil fertility. Early warning systems for food security require accurate and up-to-date locations of major crops to prevent hazards. Nevertheless mapping cropland remains challenging in that region especially because of the agricultural landscape fragmentation and the mosaic of cropland, fallow and grassland. Taking advantage of the hectometric resolution of the PROBA-V central camera, this research focuses on developing a new method for mapping the Sahelian and Sudanian cropland. A knowledge-based approach identifies relevant temporal features (min NDVI, max NDVI, increasing slope, decreasing slope and max red) for cropland discrimination and the PROBA-V reflectances are extracted at those specific moments. A labeling layer map is built from Globeland 30 with a specific contribution from ESA CCI Land cover. Training data are cleaned by an advanced trimming to discard unreliable pixels in the labeling layer. SVM classifier is applied first on all features and secondly on best selected features and bands computed by importance analysis based on Random Forest. No statistically significant differences were observed between accuracies of those two classifications, so all features were retained to facilitate the generic character of the method. The methodology is applied on a moving window of 1 x 3\u00b0 to take into account the latitudinal gradient. To mosaic smoothly the moving window results, five cropland classifications were compiled successively by majority voting to obtain regionally consistent cropland. Validation was performed using 2315 validation points collected on 2014 Google Earth images. This fully automated method offers the first cropland at 100 m using PROBA-V sensor with overall accuracy of 84% and FScore of 74%. The improvements compared to existing cropland products are related to the hectometric resolution, the methodology and the quality of the labeling layer. Errors are mainly explained by data availability and fragmentation of the area. Further improvements are expected with the upcoming enhanced cloud screening.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2460459846", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132107152"}

This species occupies an extremely wide ecological niche ranging from the semi-arid basins to the subalpine. Within this large niche, three widespread subspecies are recognized. Montane ecoregions are occupied by subspecies vaseyana, while subspecies wyomingensis and tridentata occupy basin ecoregions. In cases of wide-ranging species with multiple subspecies, it can be more practical from the scientific and management perspective to assess the climate profiles at the subspecies level. We focus bioclimatic model efforts on subspecies wyomingensis, which is the most widespread and abundant of the subspecies and critical habitat to wildlife including sage-grouse and pygmy rabbits. Using absence points from species with allopatric ranges to Wyoming big sagebrush (i.e., targeted groups absences) and randomly sampled points from specific ecoregions, we modeled the climatic envelope for subspecies wyomingensis using Random Forests multiple-regression tree for contemporary and future climates (decade 2050). Overall model error was low, at 4.5%, with the vast majority accounted for by errors in commission (>99.9%). Comparison of the contemporary and decade 2050 models shows a predicted 39% loss of suitable climate. Much of this loss will occur in the Great Basin where impacts from increasing fire frequency and encroaching weeds have been eroding the A. tridentata landscape dominance and ecological functions. Our goal of the A. tridentata subsp. wyomingensis bioclimatic model is to provide a management tool to promote successful restoration by predicting the geographic areas where climate is suitable for this subspecies.

This content drives the demand for new services, making audiovisual search one of the major challenges for organisations and businesses today. Digital data is the greatest value that many organisations possess, and the ability to use it, rather than just store it, will be one of the most important strategic aspects in the coming decade. In this scenario, several research efforts focused on studying advanced search architectures for enabling consumers, businesses, and organisations to unlock the values found in audiovisual content through innovative access paradigms. In particular, the focus of current researches is on managing and enabling access to information sources of all types, supporting advanced audiovisual processing and content handling that will enhance control, creation, and sharing of multimedia for all users in the value chain. Several research projects financed by the European Commission tackle this problem from different perspectives and provide diverse visions for the future. This will impact in the mid-long term on audiovisual industry, allowing companies to provide more effective and efficient access to contents thanks to innovative annotation techniques and search paradigms. The aim of this CBMI special session, organized with the support of the PHAROS project 1 , is to offer an overview of the research initiatives at European level that address the problems related to processing, annotation, indexing, and provisioning of contents within search applications. The session includes nine peer-reviewed contributions, reported in this volume, and an invited speech. The invited speech, given by professor Stefano Ceri, from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, will deliver a visionary discussion on the topic of Search Computing, a novel multi-disciplinary science which will provide the abstractions, foundations, methods, and tools required to answer cross-domain search queries, that cannot be addressed by 1 PHAROS (Platform for searcHing of Audiovisual Resources across Online Spaces) Integrated Project (IST-2005-2.6.3) financed by the EC IST 6th Framework. current search engines.

Since the overall human knowledge is innumerable that still grows explosively and changes frequently, knowledge construction and update inevitably involve automatic mechanisms with less human supervision, which usually bring in plenty of noises and conflicts to KGs. However, most conventional knowledge representation learning methods assume that all triple facts in existing KGs share the same significance without any noises. To address this problem, we propose a novel confidence-aware knowledge representation learning framework (CKRL), which detects possible noises in KGs while learning knowledge representations with confidence simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce the triple confidence to conventional translation-based methods for knowledge representation learning. To make triple confidence more flexible and universal, we only utilize the internal structural information in KGs, and propose three kinds of triple confidences considering both local and global structural information. In experiments, We evaluate our models on knowledge graph noise detection, knowledge graph completion and triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our confidence-aware models achieve significant and consistent improvements on all tasks, which confirms the capability of CKRL modeling confidence with structural information in both KG noise detection and knowledge representation learning.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1705.03202", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AAAI-2018", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2953320797,2964262329,2613723241", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207167677", "1743664"], "inbound_citations": ["211204838", "208268975", "211298752", "201070837", "62841637", "204542505", "52881141", "57190986", "69295759", "52822609"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3333648"}

In this paper, a sparse spatial-spectral conditional random field (CRF) target detection framework for airborne hyperspectral data, namely S3CRF, is proposed to address these problems, in which the unary and pairwise potential functions are designed accordingly. To model the spatial information in a larger neighborhood while solving the spectral variability problem, an object-oriented strategy is introduced to modify the residual map obtained by sparse representation. For the pairwise potential function, the adaptive local eight-neighborhood structure is constructed considering the neighboring spatial correlations.

The parameter proposed in this paper is evaluated through Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Our algorithm proposes firstly the decomposition of the acceleration vibration signals into a finite number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and then the evaluation of the energy for each one of these. Data are acquired both for a healthy bearing and for one with a 450 \u03bcm large indentation on a rolling element. Three different speeds and three radial loads are monitored for both cases, so nine conditions can be evaluated for each type of bearing overall. The parameters obtained, namely energy evaluated for a certain number of IMFs, are then used to train a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). Healthy data belonging to the nine different conditions are taken into account and OCSVM is trained while other acquisitions are given to the classifier as test object. Since the real class membership is known, we consider how many errors the labelling produces. We compare these results with those obtained by considering a wavelet decomposition.

By leveraging this new KD method, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large teacher BERT can be well transferred to a small student TinyBERT. Moreover, we introduce a new two-stage learning framework for TinyBERT, which performs transformer distillation at both the pre-training and task-specific learning stages. This framework ensures that TinyBERT can capture both the general-domain and task-specific knowledge of the teacher BERT.TinyBERT is empirically effective and achieves more than 96% the performance of teacher BERTBASE on GLUE benchmark while being 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference. TinyBERT is also significantly better than state-of-the-art baselines on BERT distillation, with only about 28% parameters and about 31% inference time of them.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.10351", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2974875810", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["858065", "4421747", "184486746", "52967399", "153312687", "16639476", "6251653", "2134321", "2238772", "7200347", "52077283", "198229624", "8451212", "198953378", "1957433", "11816014", "2723173", "990233", "201670719", "85543565", "13756489", "5034059", "44072099", "3432876"], "inbound_citations": ["208229926", "213152193", "209370603", "214802887", "215416219", "212747830", "210164970", "211044096", "207852805", "215415863", "209444688", "211132971", "204852217", "212725577", "209492770", "211572557", "211532403"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202719327"}

We evaluate two different encoding schemes based on sequence profile and position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) as computed with the PSIBLAST program and we show that when the evolutionary information is encoded with PSSM all the methods perform better than with sequence profile. Among the different methods it appears that GRHCRFs perform slightly better than the others achieving a per protein accuracy of 87% with a Matthews correlation coefficient (C) of 0.73. Finally, we investigate the difference between disulfide bonding state predictions in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes. Our analysis shows that the per-protein accuracy in Prokaryotic proteins is higher than that in Eukaryotes (0.88 vs 0.83).

This work proposes a connectionist architecture, DRAMA, for dynamic control and learning of autonomous robots. DRAMA stands for dynamical recurrent associative memory architecture. It is a time-delay recurrent neural network, using Hebbian update rules. It allows learning of spatio-temporal regularities and time series in discrete sequences of inputs, in the face of an important amount of noise. The first part of this paper gives the mathematical description of the architecture and analyses theoretically and through numerical simulations its performance. The second part of this paper reports on the implementation of DRAMA in simulated and physical robotic experiments. Training and rehearsal of the DRAMA architecture is computationally fast and inexpensive, which makes the model particularly suitable for controlling ecomputationally-challengedi robots. In the experiments, we use a basic hardware system with very limited computational capability and show that our robot can carry out real time computation and on-line learning of relatively complex cognitive tasks. In these experiments, two autonomous robots wander randomly in a fixed environment, collecting information about its elements. By mutually associating information of their sensors and actuators, they learn about physical regularities underlying their experience of varying stimuli.

Firstly, the learned features are disentangled into common parts and specific parts. The common parts represent the transferrable features, which are suitable for domain adaptation with less negative transfer. Conversely, the specific parts characterize the unique style of each individual domain. Based on this, the new concept of feature exchange across domains, which can not only enhance the transferability of common features but also be useful for image style transfer, is introduced.

This technique essentially bootstraps the calibration process, enabling the creation of models which predict high fidelity simulations or experiments with minimal computational cost. We apply this technique to a database of ICF simulations and experiments carried out at the Omega laser facility.

One important aspect of graph matching is the construction of two matching graphs. However, the matching graphs we feed to existing graph convolutional matching networks are generally fixed and independent of graph matching, which thus are not guaranteed to be optimal for the graph matching task. Also, existing GCN matching method employs several general smoothing-based graph convolutional layers to generate graph node embeddings, in which extensive smoothing convolution operation may dilute the desired discriminatory information of graph nodes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Graph Learning-Matching Network (GLMNet) for graph matching problem. GLMNet has three main aspects.

(2) It further employs a Laplacian sharpening convolutional module to generate more discriminative node embeddings for graph matching.

Based on the fact that adversaries rely on network linkmap to discover weakness of the network, in this paper, we propose an active LFA mitigation mechanism, called Linkbait, that actively and preventively mitigates LFA by providing a fake linkmap to adversaries. Inspired by Moving Target Defense (MTD), we propose a link obfuscation algorithm in Linkbait that selectively reroutes probing flows to hide target links from adversaries and mislead them to consider some bait links as target links. By providing the faked linkmap to adversaries, Linkbait can actively mitigate LFA even without identifying bots and does not affect flows from legitimate hosts. In order to further reduce the junk traffic generated by adversaries from entering the network, we propose a bot detection algorithm in Linkbait that extracts unique traffic patterns from LFA and leverages Support Vector Machine to accurately distinguish bots from legitimate hosts.

The last is computed through a fuzzy membership function and output values are interpreted as a reliability measure for the Boolean decision rule. As many real-world pattern recognition applications, the starting feature space is structured and the custom based dissimilarity measure adopted leads to a non-Euclidean dissimilarity matrix. Hence, a comparison of the classification performances between the proposed two-class classifier system and the well-known Support Vector Machine, on the data set at hands, is performed using a suitable kernel designed for the non-Euclidean case.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.swevo.2017.10.007", "venue": "Swarm Evol.

In this study, a large number of small molecule structures, obtained from publicly available databases, was used to generate a set of molecular descriptors that can be used with machine learning to predict drug activity. The descriptors were for the most part simple graph strings representing chains of connected atoms. Atom counts averaging seventy, using a dataset of just over one million molecules, resulted in a very large set of simple graph strings of lengths two to twelve atoms. Elimination of duplicates, reverse strings and feature reduction techniques were applied to reduce the path count to about three thousand which was viable for machine learning. Training data from twenty six data sets was used to build a decision tree classifier using J48 and Random Forest.

In this context, the objective of this study is to evaluate the contribution of multispectral satellite imagery (optical and radar) to land use and land cover classification. Object-oriented supervised classifications, based on a Random Forest algorithm, and majority zoning post-processing are used. This study emerges from the experiment on multi-sensor crop monitoring (MCM'10, Baup et al., 2012) conducted in 2010 on a mixed farming area in the southwest of France, near Toulouse. This experiment enabled the regular and quasi-synchronous collection of multi-sensor satellite data and in situ observations, which are used in this study. 211 plots with contrasting characteristics (different slopes, soil types, aspects, farming practices, shapes and surface areas) were monitored to represent the variability of the study area. They can be grouped into four classes of land cover: 39 grassland areas, 100 plots of wheat, 13 plots of barley, 20 plots of rapeseed, and 2 classes of bare soil: 23 plots of small roughness and 16 plots of medium roughness. Satellite radar images in the X-, C- and L-bands (HH polarization) were acquired between 14 and 18 April 2010. Optical images delivered by Formosat-2 and corresponding field data were acquired on 14 April 2010. The results show that combining images acquired in the L-band (Alos) and the optical range (Formosat-2) improves the classification performance (overall accuracy = 0.85, kappa = 0.81) compared to the use of radar or optical data alone. The results obtained for the various types of land cover show performance levels and confusions related to the phenological stage of the species studied, with the geometry of the cover, the roughness states of the surfaces, etc. Performance is also related to the wavelength and penetration depth of the signal providing the images. Thus, the results show that the quality of the classification often increases with increasing wavelength of the images used.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2019.101972", "venue": "Int.

In this paper we present a hybrid approach to regular grammatical inference based on neural learning and hierarchical clustering. The important new feature in the proposed method is the use of symbolic representation (unbiased FSA) and processing (merge operation) along with the clustering performed after neural learning, which allows to guarantee the extraction of a consistent deterministic FSA with the \u201dminimal\u201d size (with respect to the consistent FSA extractable by hierarchical clustering).

These procedures provide limited and subjective information with unguaranteed consistency. Land survey could map accurately crop types but it's too time, high cost and labor-intensive which limits its use as a periodic process to monitor crop changes. Remote sensing imagery is shown to be a cost-effective crop mapping approach which can be regularly used to produce an accurate and up-to-date crop map at the different temporal and spatial resolution. In this paper, a phenology based-time series-multiple classifier combination approach is developed instead of a classical one-image-one classifier approach to map crop types. The whole process is performed mainly on four steps. First, all images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected and the specific ETM+ gap had been resolved. Then, a phonological metrics are extracted from annual Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) profiles. In the third step, two classical supervised learning algorithms: Decision Tree (DT), K Near Neighborhood (KNN) and four advanced ones: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bagging, Random Forest (RF) and Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra Trees) are used in ascending experimental protocol of 3 levels of crossed validation to (1) adjust classifiers' parameters, (2) select the best three classifiers to combine and (3) find the best linear combination from five ones tested. All these three optimization operations are done according to the best error rate computed based on f-measure of omission and commission errors. In the last, the final pixels' prediction is deducted thanks to average decision given by (SVM, RF and Extra Trees) which outperforms the best individual classifier score and all other tested combiners.

Conventional learning to rank methods are usually designed for 'local ranking', in the sense that the ranking model is defined on a single object, for example, a document in information retrieval. For many applications, this is a very loose approximation. Relations always exist between objects and it is better to define the ranking model as a function on all the objects to be ranked (i.e., the relations are also included). This paper refers to the problem as global ranking and proposes employing a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for conducting the learning task. The Continuous CRF model is defined as a conditional probability distribution over ranking scores of objects conditioned on the objects. It can naturally represent the content information of objects as well as the relation information between objects, necessary for global ranking.

While feature selection and classification methods have been comprehensively explored in the context of gene expression data, relatively little is known as to how best to perform feature selection or classification in the context of Illumina Infinium methylation data. Given the rising importance of epigenomics in cancer and other complex genetic diseases, and in view of the upcoming epigenome wide association studies, it is critical to identify the statistical methods that offer improved inference in this novel context.ResultsUsing a total of 7 large Illumina Infinium 27k Methylation data sets, encompassing over 1,000 samples from a wide range of tissues, we here provide an evaluation of popular feature selection, dimensional reduction and classification methods on DNA methylation data. Specifically, we evaluate the effects of variance filtering, supervised principal components (SPCA) and the choice of DNA methylation quantification measure on downstream statistical inference. We show that for relatively large sample sizes feature selection using test statistics is similar for M and \u03b2-values, but that in the limit of small sample sizes, M-values allow more reliable identification of true positives. We also show that the effect of variance filtering on feature selection is study-specific and dependent on the phenotype of interest and tissue type profiled. Specifically, we find that variance filtering improves the detection of true positives in studies with large effect sizes, but that it may lead to worse performance in studies with smaller yet significant effect sizes. In contrast, supervised principal components improves the statistical power, especially in studies with small effect sizes. We also demonstrate that classification using the Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine (SVM) clearly outperforms competing methods like LASSO and SPCA. Finally, in unsupervised modelling of cancer diagnosis, we find that non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) clearly outperforms principal components analysis.ConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of tailoring the feature selection and classification methodology to the sample size and biological context of the DNA methylation study. The Elastic Net emerges as a powerful classification algorithm for large-scale DNA methylation studies, while NMF does well in the unsupervised context.

Model performance was evaluated by verifying if the empirical data fell within the 95% confidence intervals of ABM outputs of cell quantities at Day 7, Week 2 and Week 4. For Day 7, all empirical data were within the ABM output ranges. The trends of ABM-simulated cell populations were also qualitatively comparable to those of the empirical data beyond Day 7. Exact values, however, fell outside of the 95% statistical confidence intervals.

In the majority of these applications, multi-layer per- ceptrons (MLPs) that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm are used. This can be attributed to the fact that MLPs trained with back-propagation have a high capability of data mapping. However, one short- coming of this type of ANN is that knowledge acquired during training is stored in the connection weights in a complex manner that is often difficult to interpret. Consequently, the rules governing the relationships be- tween the network input/output variables are difficult to quantify, and thus ANNs are often criticized for be- ing black boxes. One way to overcome this problem is to use neurofuzzy networks. Neurofuzzy networks combine the explicit knowledge representation of fuzzy systems with the potential power of ANN learning algorithms. Neurofuzzy networks can be trained by processing data samples to perform input/output map- pings, similar to the way MLPs do, with the additional benefit of being able to translate the acquired knowl- edge into a set of transparent fuzzy rules that clearly describe the model input/output relationships. A review of the literature indicates that neurofuzzy networks are new tools in the field of geotechnical engineering. In this paper, the feasibility of using neurofuzzy networks in the field of geotechnical engineering is investigated for a case study of predicting settlement of shallow foundations on granular soils. The type of neurofuzzy network that is used in this work is a B-spline network, which uses the adaptive spline modeling of observa- tion data (ASMOD) algorithm to automatically optimize the model structure and the number of model inputs. The results indicate that neurofuzzy networks are a useful technique that are: (i) capable of accurately pre- dicting the settlement of shallow foundations on granular soils, and (ii) able to provide a transparent under- standing of the relationship between settlement and the factors affecting it.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "132172596", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55429035", "14526778", "4190830", "4254760", "10002843", "14497967"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108221879"}

Record deduplication is used to identify records in a data repository that refer to the same real world entity or object in spite of misspelling words, typos, different writing styles or even different schema representations or data types. Existing system aims at providing Unsupervised Duplication Detection method which can be used to identify and remove the duplicate records from different data sources. UDD, which for a given query, can effectively identify duplicates from the query result records of multiple web databases. After removal of the same source duplicates, the \u201cpresumed\u201d non duplicate records from the same source can be used as training examples alleviating the burden of users having to manually label training examples. Starting from the non duplicate set, the two cooperating classifiers, a Weighted Component Similarity Summing Classifier (WCSS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to iteratively identify the duplicate records from the non duplicate record and present a genetic programming (GP) approach to record deduplication. Their approach combines several different pieces of evidence extracted from the data content to produce a deduplication function that is able to identify whether two or more entries in a repository are replicas or not. Since record deduplication is a time consuming task even for small repositories, their aim is to foster a method that finds a proper combination of the best pieces of evidence, thus yielding a deduplication function that maximizes performance using a small representative portion of the corresponding data for training purposes; but the optimization of process is less. Our proposed system has a new technique modified bat algorithm for record duplication. The motivation behind is to create a resilient and effective method that uses Data Mining algorithms. The system shares many similarities with evolutionary computation techniques such as Genetic programming approach. The system is initialized with a population of random solutions and searches for optima by updating bat generations. However, unlike G.P. modified bat has no evolution operators such as crossover and mutation. We also compare the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms, including GP.

The function of many proteins depends on their interaction with small molecules or ligands. ATP is one such important ligand that plays critical role as a coenzyme in the functionality of many proteins. There is a need to develop method for identifying ATP interacting residues in a ATP binding proteins (ABPs), in order to understand mechanism of protein-ligands interaction.ResultsWe have compared the amino acid composition of ATP interacting and non-interacting regions of proteins and observed that certain residues are preferred for interaction with ATP. This study describes few models that have been developed for identifying ATP interacting residues in a protein. All these models were trained and tested on 168 non-redundant ABPs chains. First we have developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model using primary sequence of proteins and obtained maximum MCC 0.33 with accuracy of 66.25%. Secondly, another SVM based model was developed using position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) generated by PSI-BLAST. The performance of this model was improved significantly (MCC 0.5) from the previous one, where only the primary sequence of the proteins were used.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that it is possible to predict 'ATP interacting residues' in a protein with moderate accuracy using its sequence. The evolutionary information is important for the identification of 'ATP interacting residues', as it provides more information compared to the primary sequence. This method will be useful for researchers studying ATP-binding proteins.

The system takes a sequence of sign images or a video stream as input, and localize head and hands using IHLS color space and random forest classifier. A feature vector is extracted from the segmented images using local binary pattern on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) algorithm which jointly extracts the appearance and motion features of gestures.

Since communication is much more expensive than computation is WSNs, therefore STA-QS-SVM is unsuitable for energy constrained WSNs. This work presents three partially online novel approaches based on STA-QS-SVM, which lead to a significant (upto 95%) reduction in the communication overheads. Most appropriate scheme of the three can be selected depending on the application. The results indicate that the proposed schemes give a performance comparable to that of STA-QS-SVM, with an added advantage of a significant reduction in communication cost.

Common to much work on land-cover classification in multispectral imagery is the use of single satellite images for training the classifiers for the different land types. Unfortunately, more often than not, decision boundaries derived in this manner do not extrapolate well from one image to another. This happens for several reasons, most having to do with the fact that different satellite images correspond to different view angles on the earth's surface, different sun angles, different seasons, and so on.In this paper, we get around these limitations of the current state-of-the-art by first proposing a new integrated representation for all of the images, overlapping and non-overlapping, that cover a large geographic ROI (Region of Interest). In addition to helping understand the data variability in the images, this representation also makes it possible to create the ground truth that can be used for ROI-based wide-area learning of the classifiers. We use this integrated representation in a new Bayesian framework for data classification that is characterized by: (1) learning of the decision boundaries from a sampling of all the satellite data available for an entire geographic ROI; (2) probabilistic modeling of within-class and between-class variations, as opposed to the more traditional probabilistic modeling of the \"feature vectors\" extracted from the measurement data; and (3) using variance-based ML (maximum-likelihood) and MAP (maximum a posteriori) classifiers whose decision boundary calculations incorporate all of the multi-view data for a geographic point if that point is selected for learning and testing.We show results with the new classification framework for an ROI in Chile whose size is roughly 10,000 square kilometers. This ROI is covered by 189 satellite images with varying degrees of overlap. We compare the classification performance of the proposed ROI-based framework with the results obtained by extrapolating the decision boundaries learned from a single image to the entire ROI. Using a 10-fold cross-validation test, we demonstrate significant increases in the classification accuracy for five of the six land-cover classes. In addition, we show that our variance based Bayesian classifier outperforms a traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach to classification for four out of six classes.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cviu.2016.04.001", "venue": "Comput.

The spatial resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST product was downscaled by MTVRF from 990 to 90 m. A comparison with two other downscaling methods, such as the basic RF model and the thermal sharpening algorithm, was also made.

In order to proper design of a weir, determining its discharge coefficient is very important. In this study, the discharge coefficient of sharp-crested weirs located on circular channels is modeled using the self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning algorithm (SaE-ELM). Also, the Monte Carlo simulations (MCs) are used for studying the compatibilities of the SaE-ELM models. However, the k-fold cross validation method (k=5) is used to investigate the abilities of the used numerical models. According to the input parameters, four models of SaE-ELM are introduced. Analyzing the numerical results shows that the superior model simulates the discharge coefficient as a function of the Froude number ( Fr ) and the ratio of the circular channel diameter to the weir crest height ( D/P ) and a relationship is provided for the superior model. The values of mean absolute relative error ( MARE ), root mean square error ( RMSE ) and correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) for the superior model are calculated 0.184, 0.002 and 0.997, respectively. However, the maximum error value for this model is less than 3%.

The scoring functions that attempt such computational prediction are essential for analysing the outputs of molecular docking, which in turn is an important technique for drug discovery, chemical biology and structural biology. Each scoring function assumes a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that characterize the complex, which also include parameters fitted to experimental or simulation data and its predicted binding affinity. The inherent problem of this rigid approach is that it leads to poor predictivity for those complexes that do not conform to the modelling assumptions. Moreover, resampling strategies, such as cross-validation or bootstrapping, are still not systematically used to guard against the overfitting of calibration data in parameter estimation for scoring functions. ::: ::: Results: We propose a novel scoring function (RF-Score) that circumvents the need for problematic modelling assumptions via non-parametric machine learning. In particular, Random Forest was used to implicitly capture binding effects that are hard to model explicitly. RF-Score is compared with the state of the art on the demanding PDBbind benchmark. Results show that RF-Score is a very competitive scoring function. Importantly, RF-Score's performance was shown to improve dramatically with training set size and hence the future availability of more high-quality structural and interaction data is expected to lead to improved versions of RF-Score. ::: ::: Contact:pedro.ballester@ebi.ac.uk; jbom@st-andrews.ac.uk ::: ::: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3524828", "pubmed_id": "20236947", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btq112", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2148512505", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["35515684", "40589986", "7474036", "60993494", "991468", "197391025", "6967631", "28001654", "898741", "21555200", "6369255", "11375118", "25855201", "10309609", "26260725", "12245279", "31244372", "1069493", "94584451", "33219485", "197387976", "196709784", "41163751", "30938690", "1539708", "22967985", "98647069", "97922657", "20601137", "3163419", "2640322", "1002941", "23288959", "23369575", "15944768", "9712957", "27264614", "44520336", "4377713"], "inbound_citations": ["2811065", "202745035", "9798994", "8995099", "47019996", "4473291", "824696", "2331599", "11300765", "8834437", "213769071", "215474740", "215297695", "54453442", "18889044", "56090204", "4658664", "14243311", "205649654", "91830433", "202583859", "208224073", "53038306", "208130757", "215670461", "215446381", "164217837", "209175055", "116556712", "13224164", "9084724", "18556381", "1367820", "215315334", "214725910", "20030119", "215600919", "215502342", "3596896", "2156731", "14827454", "645788", "53983439", "199466788", "78091459", "15096609", "9907796", "215503109", "174803176", "215525171", "1627288", "47005580", "4995459", "196665480", "3757489", "160012476", "17464362", "115211649", "215318055", "11824353", "202710712", "212732177", "215448289", "210118699", "195822839", "51614149", "214894447", "60834786", "20023644", "1040424", "42489437", "209140224", "16753318", "21536576", "1511306", "85542400", "210839197", "2831427", "215292984", "215429201", "211044803", "91925109", "208020202", "19794092", "6548164", "213775151", "214724834", "12890540", "52335401", "215269286", "85505011", "35971899", "210921662", "16809858", "8280449", "27357901", "5633756", "215622466", "17824702", "29731192", "20081239", "54036380", "56517363", "64981462", "214998023", "17440348", "9622720", "168169714", "56063338", "13634131", "209140467", "52806589", "202757758", "1163504", "145831432", "92451162", "11064971", "58675317", "209163867", "17403178", "12140952", "212549570", "19134165", "16095478", "4583022", "207990667", "201846217"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1833890"}

How can a machine learning representation characterizing a cyber attack on one network be used to detect similar attacks on other enterprise networks if each networks has wildly different distributions of benign and malicious traffic? We address this issue by comparing the results of naively transferring a model across network domains and using CORrelation ALignment, to our novel adversarial Siamese neural network. Our proposed model learns attack representations that are more invariant to each network's particularities via an adversarial approach. It uses a simple ranking loss that prioritizes the labeling of the most egregious malicious events correctly over average accuracy. This is appropriate for driving an alert triage workflow wherein an analyst only has time to inspect the top few events ranked highest by the model.

ILP provides comprehensibility to learning results and capability to handle more complex data consisting of their relations. Nevertheless, the bottleneck for learning first-order theory is enormous hypothesis search space which causes inefficient performance by the existing learning approaches compared to the propositional approaches. We introduces an improved ILP approach capable of handling more efficiently a kind of data called multiple-part data, i.e., one instance of data consists of several parts as well as relations among parts. The approach tries to find hypothesis describing class of each training example by using both individual and relational characteristics of its part which is similar to finding common substructures among the complex relational instances. Chemical compound data is multiple-part data. Each compound is composed of atoms as parts, and various kinds of bond as relations among atoms.

For these reasons, the calibration process has become very expensive and time consuming. To cope with these drawbacks, calibration transfer between systems constitutes a satisfactory alternative. Among them, direct standardization shows good efficiency for calibration transfer. In this paper, we propose to improve this method by using kernel SPXY (sample set partitioning based on joint x-y distances) for data selection and support vector machine regression to match between electronic noses.

Unfortunately, data and methods to monitor abandoned agriculture accurately over large areas are lacking. Remote sensing methods may be able to fill this gap though, especially with the frequent observations provided by coarser-resolution sensors and new classification techniques. Past efforts to map abandoned agriculture relied mainly on Landsat data, making it hard to map large regions, and precluding the use of phenology information to identify abandoned agriculture. Our objective here was to test methods to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales with coarse-resolution satellite imagery and phenology data. We classified abandoned agriculture for one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) tile in Eastern Europe (~ 1,236,000 km 2 ) where abandoned agriculture was widespread. Input data included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance bands (NASA Global MODIS Terra and Aqua 16-Day Vegetation Indices for the years 2003 through 2008, ~ 250-m resolution), as well as phenology metrics calculated with TIMESAT. The data were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Training data were derived from several Landsat classifications of agricultural abandonment in the study area. A validation was conducted based on independently collected data. Our results showed that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture for large areas from MODIS data with an overall classification accuracy of 65%. Abandoned agriculture was widespread in our study area (15.1% of the total area, compared to 29.6% agriculture). We found strong differences in the MODIS data quality for different years, with data from 2005 resulting in the highest classification accuracy for the abandoned agriculture class (42.8% producer's accuracy). Classifications of MODIS NDVI data were almost as accurate as classifications based on a combination of both red and near-infrared reflectance data. MODIS NDVI data only from the growing-season resulted in similar classification accuracy as data for the full year. Using multiple years of MODIS data did not increase classification accuracy. Six phenology metrics derived with TIMESAT from the NDVI time series (2003\u20132008) alone were insufficient to detect abandoned agriculture, but phenology metrics improved classification accuracies when used in conjunction with NDVI time series by more than 8% over the use of NDVI data alone.

To overcome this problem, we propose a deep model for the soft multilabel learning for unsupervised RE-ID. The idea is to learn a soft multilabel (real-valued label likelihood vector) for each unlabeled person by comparing the unlabeled person with a set of known reference persons from an auxiliary domain. We propose the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining to learn a discriminative embedding for the unlabeled target domain by exploring the similarity consistency of the visual features and the soft multilabels of unlabeled target pairs. Since most target pairs are cross-view pairs, we develop the cross-view consistent soft multilabel learning to achieve the learning goal that the soft multilabels are consistently good across different camera views. To enable effecient soft multilabel learning, we introduce the reference agent learning to represent each reference person by a reference agent in a joint embedding.

In India Especially Cricket. Cricket and now others sports are contributing to the Indian Economy in a high scale. This paper aims in constructing an application that can extract, process and analyse the data and then give the output to other people who plan on setting up any sports events at a given time. The data is collected from sources that supply with climatic data. We shall further analyse the data using R programming to do a comparison of central tendencies by the fitting efficiency in the analysis on the mean and variance of the data (Temperature data). Choosing the right place to conduct a sports event is the most critical assignments for any game especially for cricket in India. We can\u2019t have a situation where cricket fans from around the country travel for a special event only to end up watching a rain soaked ground with their favourite players sitting in the stands. Another point to consider is that the climate though it\u2019s not really raining will have an impact on the game. For example, taking a bowler who swings a lot, extra wind can help him in swinging ball to greater lengths, as for a batsman a bright day can help him in connecting the ball perfectly but on a shady day that\u2019s reduced. So this paper endeavours to anticipate the most appropriate place to choose for a cricket match or any other outdoor sports events which can be manipulated by the weather conditions. A number of algorithms such as Random forest, Naive Bayes, SVM and decision tree classifier and clustering mechanisms are used to predict the expected results. The final decision was supported by the Random Forest. This is the first attempt on predicting the rain interruption which could affect the cricket match and may impact financial losses both for the organizers and the sponsers.

Comparing with single-media retrieval such as image retrieval and text retrieval, cross-media retrieval is better because it provides the retrieval results with all kinds of media at the same time. In this paper, we focus on how to learn cross-media features for different media types, which is a key challenge for cross-media retrieval. Existing methods either model different media types separately or only exploit the labeled multimedia data. Actually, the data from different media types with the same semantic category are complementary to each other, and jointly modeling them is able to improve the accuracy of cross-media retrieval. In addition, although the labeled data are accurate, they require a lot of human labor and thus are very scarce. To address the above problems, we propose a semi-supervised cross-media feature learning algorithm with unified patch graph regularization (S $^{\\rm 2}$ UPG). Our motivation and contribution mainly lie in the following three aspects. First, existing methods only model different media types in different graphs, while we employ one joint graph to simultaneously model all the media types. The joint graph is able to fully exploit the semantic correlations among various media types, which are complementary to provide the rich hint for cross-media correlation. Second, existing methods only consider the original media instances (such as images, videos, texts, audios, and 3-D models) but ignore their patches, while we make full use of both the media instances and their patches in one graph. Cross-media patches could emphasize the important parts and make cross-media correlations more precise. Third, traditional semi-supervised learning methods only exploit single-media unlabeled instances, while our approach fully exploits cross-media unlabeled instances and their patches, which can increase the diversity of training data and boost the accuracy of cross-media retrieval. Comparing with the current state-of-the-art methods on three datasets, including the challenging XMedia dataset with five media types, the comprehensive experimental results show that our proposed approach performs better.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2400779", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2052727801", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14303727", "706801", "207799171", "767218", "207197892", "16233995", "24917812", "7291515", "9880982", "6387482", "5964689", "6783548", "5942627", "14634330", "6483070", "17092688", "3461361", "17718684", "11002418", "1536679", "16306710", "122166830", "4616218", "8769194", "12562860", "6419669", "395534", "735750", "1302147", "14304960", "1145503"], "inbound_citations": ["54446206", "19171343", "27971663", "25162465", "47017202", "54602241", "3818874", "5026281", "57376631", "46792196", "206491718", "54441093", "197928073", "210134949", "24785763", "181869608", "69802249", "88483018", "209525460", "27307562", "209059110", "203640026", "208298271", "23526678", "58007424", "215722470", "15514398", "49537115", "3319279", "53039874", "88497262", "86488524", "53036349", "210972034", "146120889", "18064867"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11177824"}

The study first focuses on the evolution of these models towards grey-box models, which can benefit at the same time from the universal approximation capacity of black-box models and from prior knowledge. In particular, the thesis proposes a general framework for the incorporation of a wide variety of prior knowledge in SVMs for regression, which leads to a learning algorithm written as a convex optimization program. The last part of the thesis proposes to extend SVMs to the identification of hybrid systems, that switch between different dynamics. In this context, the classification and regression problems are intrinsically mixed together and cannot be considered separately.

Considering that each complex action is composed of a sequence of simple actions which can be easily obtained from existing data sets, this paper presents a simple to complex action transfer learning model (SCA-TLM) for complex human action recognition. SCA-TLM improves the performance of complex action recognition by leveraging the abundant labeled simple actions. In particular, it optimizes the weight parameters, enabling the complex actions to be learned to be reconstructed by simple actions. The optimal reconstruct coefficients are acquired by minimizing the objective function, and the target weight parameters are then represented as a combination of source weight parameters. The main advantage of the proposed SCA-TLM compared with existing approaches is that we exploit simple actions to recognize complex actions instead of only using complex actions as training samples. To validate the proposed SCA-TLM, we conduct extensive experiments on two well-known complex action data sets: 1) Olympic Sports data set and 2) UCF50 data set.

The CHAP characterizes the marginal local distribution of attribute filter responses to model the texture information of each sample with a small number of image features. This is achieved based on a three steps algorithm. The first step is devoted to provide a complete characterization of spatial properties of objects in a scene. To this end, the attribute profile (AP) is initially built by the sequential application of attribute filters to the considered image. Then, to capture complete spatial characteristics of the structures in the scene a local histogram is calculated for each sample of each image in the AP. The local histograms of the same pixel location can contain redundant information since: i) adjacent histogram bins can provide similar information; and ii) the attributes obtained with similar attribute filter threshold values lead to redundant features. In the second step, to point out the redundancies the local histograms of the same pixel locations in the AP are organized into a 2D matrix representation, where columns are associated to the local histograms and rows represents a specific bin in all histograms of the considered sequence of filtered attributes in the profile. This representation results in the characterization of the texture information of each sample through a 2D texture descriptor. In the final step, a novel compression approach based on a uniform 2D quantization strategy is applied to remove the redundancy of the 2D texture descriptors. Finally the CHAP is classified by a Support Vector Machine classifier with histogram intersection kernel that is very effective for high dimensional histogram-based feature representations.

In Twitter, the information may be categorized as important or un-important. Whatever information spreads through re-tweets becomes important or popular. As popular messages contain vital information for the users, one has to study the characteristics of such messages since it is related to breaking news identification, viral marketing and other similar tasks. In this research, we investigate the prediction of the popularity of messages by the number of re-tweets. We transform this task into a classification problem and existing Similarity Learning Algorithm (SiLA) is applied. SiLA, an extension of voted perceptron algorithm, learns the similarity matrix for kNN classification before classifying tweets as either popular or un-popular based on the content features. We classify tweets in binary as well as multi-class classification. For the former case, we consider that either the tweet has been re-tweeted (meaning popular) or not (unpopular). However, in the case of multi-class classification, SiLA uses different popular bands, defined by the number of re-tweet count The binary classification algorithm achieved 85% accuracy and the multi-class classification achieved 73% accuracy.

However, it is well known that even human annotators do not agree on selecting most summary sentences. In this paper, we take a probabilistic view of the summarization ground-truth and assume that more frequently selected sentences by annotators are of higher importance. Using a large summary data-set obtained through crowdsourcing, we empirically show that sentence selection frequency is inversely related to its summarization rank. Consequently, we model the relative importance between sentences using a rank-based classifier.

Also, the appearance of soft computing techniques has made many traditional methods antiquated. Thus, the main effort of this study was to evaluate the capability of several learning methods for appraising the HL and CL of a residential building. To this end, a proper dataset consisting of eight influential factors was provided. To simplify the problem, we executed feature validity by using a correlation-based feature subset selection (CfsSubsetEval) technique. The results of this process showed that wall area, overall height, orientation and glazing area have the most significant impact on the HL and CL simulation. After preparing the suitable dataset, sixteen learning methods namely, elastic net (EN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), least median of squares regression (LMSR), multiple linear regression (MLR), multi-layer perceptron regression (MPR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function regression (RBFR), sequential minimal optimization regression (SMOR), functions XNV, lazy K-star, lazy LWL, rules decision table (RDT), M5Rules, alternating model tree (AMT), directional path consistency (DPC), and Random Forest (RF) were developed in Weka environment to forecast the HL and CL variables. Referring to the results, it was concluded that RF, lazy K-star, RDT and AMT outperform other predictive models. Also, comparing the results with the results of the previous studies showed that the applied feature reduction not only did not disturb the learning process but also has enhanced the performance of models.

Therefore, it is necessary to classify the properties of underground targets. In this paper, sensitivity analysis was performed on the spheroid model and the approximate forward model at first, and the influence of the target properties on the model output is obtained. Secondly, we utilized the fitting algorithm to obtain the model parameters of the simulation data (model response of targets with varying shapes and materials), and analyzed the influence of the fitting algorithm on the classification results at different SNR. Finally, eight machine learning algorithms: support vector machine(SVM), neural network(NN), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Gaussian process (GP), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and AdaBoost were used in this study to compare the obtained results. From the above analysis, we found that the shape (radius) have a greater influence on the model than the material (permeability) in the spheroid model. According to the approximate forward model, we found that it is not feasible to classify targets when the orientation is unknown. The influence of the fitting algorithm on the classification performances is related to the noise level. The obtained results using neural network demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed in material-based classification and shape-based classification.

Objective: On public comments there are emoticons and sarcasm which have an influence on the process of sentiment analysis. Emoticons are considered to make it easier for someone to express their feelings but not a few are also other opinion researchers, namely by ignoring emoticons, the reason being that it can interfere with the sentiment analysis process, while sarcasm is considered to be produced from the results of the sarcasm sentiment analysis in it. Methods: The emoticon and no emoticon categories will be tested with the same testing data using classification method are Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine. Sarcasm data will be proposed using the Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine method. Results: The use of emoticon with sarcasm detection can increase the accuracy value in the sentiment analysis process using Naive Bayes Classifier method.

In this paper, an anti-swing manoeuvre controller for a rotorcraft unmanned aerial system with an attached suspended load (slung-load) is proposed. The presented architecture is powered by Echo State Networks (ESN) that enables simple modeling of the controller and outperforms linear techniques in terms of robustness to unmodelled dynamics and disturbances. The external load behaves like a pendulum; this can change the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the low frequency modes of the RUAS. The technique chosen to solve the problem is to achieve both robust performance and computational efficiency. Reservoir Computing (RC) is an alternative to gradient descent methods for training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which represent a very powerful generic tool, integrating both large dynamical memory and highly adaptable computational capabilities. ESN is a type of reservoir computing; the advantage lies in the ability to overcome the difficulties in RNN training, it is conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive.

These species are ecologically very important and are also threatened by climate-driven insect outbreaks and an exotic pathogen. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play central roles in the environmental adaptation of plants and in their defense against insects and pathogens. For example, the VOCs emitted by some high-elevation five-needle pine species attract female, tree-killing mountain pine beetles (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) in the pioneering phase whereas VOCs from other species strongly repel this foremost herbivore, but the mechanism is unknown. We collected and compared headspace VOCs from foliage of eight species of high-elevation five-needle pines in Europe and North America. Overall, VOCs differed quantitatively among species with few qualitative differences. Despite species emitting essentially the same compounds, Random Forest analysis correctly classified 117 of the 126 trees sampled by using VOCs and identified the most important compounds for species classification and for separating species resistant from those susceptible to MPB or white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). These VOC \u2018fingerprints\u2019 resulted largely from species emitting distinctive ratios of compounds, rather than through presence of species-specific compounds. Importantly, these Pinus species vary greatly in resistance to the main herbivore (MPB) and pathogen (white pine blister rust) causing tree mortality. Thus, these findings provide insights and should guide research into understanding resistance and in developing tools to manage these important trees.

In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of a combined $\\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control and iterative learning control (ILC) framework to achieve high-precision trajectory tracking in the presence of unknown and changing disturbances. The $\\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller makes the system behave close to a reference model; however, it does not guarantee that perfect trajectory tracking is achieved, while ILC improves trajectory tracking performance based on previous iterations. The combined framework in this paper uses $\\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control as an underlying controller that achieves a robust and repeatable behavior, while the ILC acts as a high-level adaptation scheme that mainly compensates for systematic tracking errors. We illustrate that this framework enables transfer learning between dynamically different systems, where learned experience of one system can be shown to be beneficial for another different system. Experimental results with two different quadrotors show the superior performance of the combined $\\mathcal{L}_1$-ILC framework compared with approaches using ILC with an underlying proportional-derivative controller or proportional-integral-derivative controller. Results highlight that our $\\mathcal{L}_1$-ILC framework can achieve high-precision trajectory tracking when unknown and changing disturbances are present and can achieve transfer of learned experience between dynamically different systems.

This is motivated by the need of a more sophisticated algorithm for classification in discrete attribute spaces. Classification in discrete attribute spaces is reduced to the problem of learning Boolean functions from examples of its input/output behavior. Since any Boolean function can be written in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), it can be represented as a weighted linear sum of all possible conjunctions of Boolean literals. This paper presents a particular kernel function called the DNF kernel which enables SVMs to efficiently learn such linear functions in the high-dimensional space whose coordinates correspond to all possible conjunctions. For a limited form of DNF consisting of positive Boolean literals, the monotone DNF kernel is also presented. SVMs employing these kernel functions can perform the learning in a high-dimensional feature space whose features are derived from given basic attributes. In addition, it is expected that SVMs' well-founded capacity control alleviates overfitting. In fact, an empirical study on learning of randomly generated Boolean functions shows that the resulting algorithm outperforms C4.5. Furthermore, in comparison with SVMs employing the Gaussian kernel, it is shown that DNF kernel produces accuracy comparable to best adjusted Gaussian kernels.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-45583-3_10", "venue": "In Proc. of the 12th International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1555944313", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["122024170", "9552416", "195951538", "60486887", "2381120", "1053873", "132080", "206468070", "18940285", "5262555", "59712", "7138354", "28637672"], "inbound_citations": ["70116031", "1721938", "3786371", "86557", "11908336", "4035022", "40656227", "56483203", "132080", "196094295", "18791099", "15434222", "116230835", "2629118", "3219195", "195803366", "16592403", "12948887", "203627337", "121310973", "2920259", "15431836", "52013243", "53237071", "15439197", "180864", "2702272", "18446430"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17295042"}

In particular, in certain cases it has been observed that ML algorithms can provide different decisions based on sensitive attributes such as gender or race and therefore can lead to discrimination. Although, several fairness-aware ML approaches have been proposed, their focus has been largely on preserving the overall classification accuracy while improving fairness in predictions for both protected and non-protected groups (defined based on the sensitive attribute(s)). The overall accuracy however is not a good indicator of performance in case of class imbalance, as it is biased towards the majority class. As we will see in our experiments, many of the fairness-related datasets suffer from class imbalance and therefore, tackling fairness requires also tackling the imbalance problem. To this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware classifier based on AdaBoost that further updates the weights of the instances in each boosting round taking into account a cumulative notion of fairness based upon all current ensemble members, while explicitly tackling class-imbalance by optimizing the number of ensemble members for balanced classification error.

Such spacecraft can use image analysis to autonomously select clear scenes for prioritized downlink. More agile spacecraft can also benefit from cloud screening by retargeting observations to cloud-free areas. This could significantly improve the science yield of instruments such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 mission.

Few years ago, the European Union (EU) started an ambitious program, Copernicus, that includes the launch of a new family of earth observation satellites known as Sentinel. Each Sentinel mission is based on a constellation of two satellites to fulfill specific requirements of coverage and revisit time. Among them are the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Sentinel-1 carries a Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) that operates on the C-band. This platform offers SAR data day-and-night and in all-weather conditions.

Traditional discriminative object tracking methods usually train a binary classifier via a support vector machine (SVM) scheme to distinguish the target from its background. Despite demonstrated success, the performance of the SVM-based trackers is limited because the classification is carried out only depending on support vectors (SVs) but the target\u2019s dynamic appearance may look similar to the training samples that have not been selected as SVs, especially when the training samples are not linearly classifiable. In such cases, the tracker may drift to the background and fail to track the target eventually. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose to integrate the point-to-set/ image-to-imageSet distance metric learning (DML) into visual tracking tasks and take full advantage of all the training samples when determining the best target candidate. The point-to-set DML is conducted on convolutional neural network features of the training data extracted from the starting frames. When a new frame comes, target candidates are first projected to the common subspace using the learned mapping functions, and then the candidate having the minimal distance to the target template sets is selected as the tracking result.

The combination of heterogeneous NGS genomic data is an open challenge: the analysis of data from different experiments is a fundamental practice for the study of diseases. In this work, we propose to combine DNA methylation and RNA sequencing NGS experiments at gene level for supervised knowledge extraction in cancer.MethodsWe retrieve DNA methylation and RNA sequencing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), focusing on the Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), the Thyroid Carcinoma (THCA), and the Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma (KIRP). We combine the RNA sequencing gene expression values with the gene methylation quantity, as a new measure that we define for representing the methylation quantity associated to a gene. Additionally, we propose to analyze the combined data through tree- and rule-based classification algorithms (C4.5, Random Forest, RIPPER, and CAMUR).ResultsWe extract more than 15,000 classification models (composed of gene sets), which allow to distinguish the tumoral samples from the normal ones with an average accuracy of 95%. From the integrated experiments we obtain about 5000 classification models that consider both the gene measures related to the RNA sequencing and the DNA methylation experiments.ConclusionsWe compare the sets of genes obtained from the classifications on RNA sequencing and DNA methylation data with the genes obtained from the integration of the two experiments.

First, VMD is employed to decompose the MPQDs into several intrinsic mode functions and the standard energy differences of each mode are extracted as features that form the input vectors of the classifier. Second, a novel multilabel classifier called RDPEML is constructed by combining a random discriminative projection multiclass extreme learning machine (ELM) and a thresholding learning method-based kernel ELM.

We discuss fundamental limitations and inherent difficulties when using neural networks for the processing of high noise, small sample size signals. We introduce a new intelligent signal processing method which addresses the difficulties. The method proposed uses conversion into a symbolic representation with a self-organizing map, and grammatical inference with recurrent neural networks. We apply the method to the prediction of daily foreign exchange rates, addressing difficulties with non-stationarity, overfitting, and unequal a priori class probabilities, and we find significant predictability in comprehensive experiments covering 5 different foreign exchange rates. The method correctly predicts the direction of change for the next day with an error rate of 47.1%. The error rate reduces to around 40% when rejecting examples where the system has low confidence in its prediction.

Typically, action localization or recognition is performed in an offline manner where all the frames in the video are processed together and action labels are not predicted for the future. This disallows timely localization of actions - an important consideration for surveillance tasks. In our approach, given a batch of frames from the immediate past in a video, we estimate pose and oversegment the current frame into superpixels. Next, we discriminatively train an actor foreground model on the superpixels using the pose bounding boxes. A Conditional Random Field with superpixels as nodes, and edges connecting spatio-temporal neighbors is used to obtain action segments. The action confidence is predicted using dynamic programming on SVM scores obtained on short segments of the video, thereby capturing sequential information of the actions. The issue of visual drift is handled by updating the appearance model and pose refinement in an online manner. Lastly, we introduce a new measure to quantify the performance of action prediction (i.e. online action localization), which analyzes how the prediction accuracy varies as a function of observed portion of the video.

Our system consists of a piezoresistive fabric material as the sensor to emulate skin, an interface that produces spike patterns to mimic neural signals from mechanoreceptors, and an extreme learning machine (ELM) chip to analyze spiking activity. Benefiting from intrinsic advantages of biologically inspired event-driven systems and massively parallel and energy-efficient processing capabilities of the ELM chip, the proposed architecture offers a fast and energy-efficient alternative for processing tactile information. Moreover, it provides the opportunity for the development of low-cost tactile modules for large-area applications by integration of sensors and processing circuits. We demonstrate the recognition capability of our system in a texture discrimination task, where it achieves a classification accuracy of 92% for categorization of ten graded textures. Our results confirm that there exists a tradeoff between response time and classification accuracy (and information transfer rate). A faster decision can be achieved at early time steps or by using a shorter time window. This, however, results in deterioration of the classification accuracy and information transfer rate. We further observe that there exists a tradeoff between the classification accuracy and the input spike rate (and thus energy consumption).

Transferring function-related protein annotations based on homology-based methods is relatively straightforward for proteins that have sequence identity of more than 40%. However, there are many proteins in the \"twilight zone\" where sequence similarity with any other protein is very weak, while being structurally similar to several. Such cases require methods that are capable of using and exploiting both sequence and structural similarity. To understand ways of how such methods can and should be designed is the focus of this study. In this thesis, models that use both sequence and structure features are applied on two protein prediction problems that are particularly challenging when relying on sequence alone. Enzyme classification benefits from both kinds of features because on one hand, enzymes can have identical function with limited sequence similarity while on the other hand, proteins with similar fold may have disparate enzyme class annotation. This thesis shows that the full integration of protein sequence and structure-related features (via the use of kernels) automatically places proteins with similar biological properties closer together, leading to superior classification accuracy using Support Vector Machines. Disulfide-bonds link residues in a protein structure, but may appear distant in sequence. Sequence similarity reflecting such structural properties is thus very hard to detect. It is sufficient for the structure to be similar for accurate prediction of disulfide-bonds, but such information is very scarce and predictors that rely on protein structure are not nearly as useful as those operating on sequence alone. This thesis proposes a novel approach based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis that uses structural features during training only. It does so by finding sequence representations that correlate with structural features that are essential for a disulfide bond. The resulting representations enable high prediction accuracy for a range of disulfide-bond problems. The proposed model thus taps the advantage of structural features without requiring protein structure to be available in the prediction process. The merits of this approach should apply to a number of open protein structure prediction problems.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "76317090", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:81011923"}

While, most existing algorithms assume that data samples are drawn from a stationary distribution, several complex environments deal with data streams that are subject to change over time. Taking this aspect into consideration is an important step towards building truly aware and intelligent systems. In this paper, we propose GNG-A, an adaptive method for incremental unsupervised learning from evolving data streams experiencing various types of change. The proposed method maintains a continuously updated network (graph) of neurons by extending the Growing Neural Gas algorithm with three complementary mechanisms, allowing it to closely track both gradual and sudden changes in the data distribution. First, an adaptation mechanism handles local changes where the distribution is only non-stationary in some regions of the feature space. Second, an adaptive forgetting mechanism identifies and removes neurons that become irrelevant due to the evolving nature of the stream. Finally, a probabilistic evolution mechanism creates new neurons when there is a need to represent data in new regions of the feature space. The proposed method is demonstrated for anomaly and novelty detection in non-stationary environments. Results show that the method handles different data distributions and efficiently reacts to various types of change.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10618-018-0571-0", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "journal": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2801389497", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1310623", "36273331", "2279539", "1878427", "13985407", "6786471", "43836334", "46173281", "14419395", "15192294", "9136731", "36997073", "6889011", "59849738", "206576", "13401601", "7317620", "8254240", "207208264", "2606652", "5767782", "44878371", "121121745", "2790328", "35534356", "19277476", "52800392", "62155475", "207011971", "61773115", "6505449", "5264312", "13994635", "1100139", "51373", "8667260", "7206775", "28542768", "53283538", "10659969", "7199118", "41517545", "14834078", "2198181", "7470633", "19198944", "11868540", "2940589", "7365802", "2342435", "3918777"], "inbound_citations": ["212725770", "215722984"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:374685"}

Overall, t-AMLs respond less well to treatment than their de novo counterparts. It has also been shown that the karyotype of the leukemic blasts is an independent prognostic parameter in t-AML. Here we assessed the gene expression profiles of 53 t-AML cases compared to a matched patient cohort of 53 de novo AML patients using Affymetrix DNA-oligonucleotide microarrays (HG-U133 chip design). The following cohort was analyzed (de novo and t-AML each): 2 t(15;17), 3 inv(16), 4 t(8;21), 4 normal karyotypes, 5 other intermediate karyotypes, 2 t(8;16), 5 inv(3), 20 t(11q23)/MLL, and 8 complex aberrant karyotypes. First, we aimed at mining for specific patterns separating de novo from t-AML. Both unsupervised, i.e. hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis, and supervised data analysis algorithms could not identify a signature that robustly separated de novo from therapy-related cases. Then the algorithm was changed to analyze both patient cohorts stratified according to favorable cytogenetics, i.e. t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16), intermediate cytogenetics, i.e. inv(3), and unfavorable cytogenetics, i.e. t(11q23)/MLL and complex aberrant karyotypes. This resulted in gene expression signatures where de novo and t-AML patients were closely related to each other but separated within genetic subgroups. Particularly in t(11q23)/MLL, complex aberrant karyotypes and t(8;21) samples, de novo cases intercalated with therapy-related cases. When a supervised classification algorithm (Support Vector Machine) was trained to predict the subtype for both de novo and t-AML samples misclassifications were observed. However, these misclassifications mainly occurred within cytogenetic subgroups, e.g. therapy-related AML with complex aberrant karyotype was classified as de novo AML with complex aberrant karyotype, or de novo t(11q23)/MLL as therapy-related t(11q23)/MLL and vice versa. In contrast, an analysis only focusing on cytogenetic subtypes and grouping de novo and t-AML cases together clearly identified signatures related to the biologically distinct AML subtypes. Taken together, we were not able to define a specific expression profile globally associated with therapy-related AML. Instead, t-AML cases of distinct cytogenetic subgroups were demonstrated to be similar to their de novo counterpart. Despite known differences in the genetic events leading to the malignant transformation, i.e. leukemogenic exposures in t-AML through alkylating agents, topoisomerase II inhibitors, or radiation both de novo and t-AML can be considered as biologically identical diseases. Thus, given the underlying biology in AML one should separate patients in clinical trials according to cytogenetics and their history as t-AML or de novo as suggested by the WHO classification. However, differences in prognosis may not be explainable by the respective gene expression profiles in both groups.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.v104.11.193.193", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2559372414", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:89602724"}

Among existing intelligent identification methods, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) have shown a distinctive advantage in identifying epileptic EEG signals because of their strong learning abilities and interpretability. Like many conventional intelligent methods for recognizing EEG signals, in the training of FLS, it is assumed that the training dataset and test dataset are drawn from data that are identically distributed. However, this assumption is not necessarily valid in practice as it is not uncommon for the two datasets to have different distributions. To overcome this problem, a strategy is presented in this paper to construct a Takagi\u2013Sugeno\u2013Kang (TSK) FLS based on transductive transfer learning for identifying epileptic EEG signals. Two novel objective functions, achieved by integrating the transductive transfer learning mechanism, are proposed for the training of the TSK FLS.

The acoustic analysis is an objective, effective, and noninvasive tool used in clinical practice to perform a quantitative evaluation of voice quality. ::: ::: ::: Materials and Methods ::: A clinical study was carried out in collaboration with medical staff of the University of Naples Federico II. 208 volunteers were recruited (mean age, 44.2 \u00b1 13.9 years), 58 healthy subjects (mean age, 36.7 \u00b1 13.3 years) and 150 pathological ones (mean age, 47 \u00b1 13.1 years). The evaluation of Vox4Health was made in terms of classification performance, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, by using a rule-based algorithm that considers the most characteristic acoustic parameters to classify if the voice is healthy or pathological. The performance has been compared with that achieved by using Praat, one of the most commonly used tools in clinical practice. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: Using a rule-based algorithm, the best accuracy in the detection of voice disorders, 72.6%, was obtained by using the jitter or shimmer value. Moreover, the best sensitivity is about 96% and it was always obtained by using jitter. Finally, the best specificity was achieved by using the Fundamental Frequency and it is equal to 56.9%. Additionally, in order to improve the classification accuracy of the next version of the Vox4Health app, an evaluation by using machine learning techniques was conducted. We performed some preliminary tests adopting different machine learning techniques able to classify the voice as healthy or pathological. The best accuracy (77.4%) was obtained by the Logistic Model Tree algorithm, while the best sensitivity (99.3%) was achieved using the Support Vector Machine. Finally, Instance-based Learning performed the best specificity (36.2%). ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Considering the achieved accuracy, Vox4Health has been considered by the medical experts as a \"good screening tool\" for the detection of voice disorders in its current version.

Figure 1 Location Map of Study Area 3 THE DATA MINING APPLICATIONS Data mining can be described as the science of computer modeling heuristic learning processes. The process extracts patterns from data sets which are then used to gain insight into relational aspects of the phenomena being studied and to predict outcomes to aid decision making. (Flentje, Stirling, Palamara and Chowdhury, 2007). In this study the phenomena being assessed is the natural geohazard of landslides and the desired outcome is the identification of areas (or pixels in a raster based approach) with characteristics matching those of known landslides. In this way it is hoped that landslide susceptibility maps can be produced which can be used to aid local government decision making. This study draws on the data mining approach for landslide susceptibility pioneered by Dr P Flentje and D. Stirling at the University of Wollongong. A range of data mining techniques including Random Forests and decision trees implemented in the WEKA package (developed by the University of Waikato, New Zealand) were applied to the data. Early results generated by these methods demonstrated the need for more sophisticated methods of pre-processing and selecting training data. Further discussion is also included on the various techniques used to analyse statistical accuracy of each method and their applicability to the prediction of landslide susceptibility through the production of susceptibility maps. 3.1 Weka Data Mining Toolkit and See5/C5 A range of methods implemented in the WEKA data-mining toolkit (Witten and Frank, 2005) were used in the initial stages of this research, to identify the methods most suitable for further, more intensive exploration. In addition the See5/C5 data-mining software (Rulequest, 2010) was also used to address some limitations of WEKA observed during this preliminary phase of the investigation.

The overall vote of the trees generates the output class of the input. \u2022 RBF: is the Radial Basis Function classifier which is a neural network classification system. \u2022 SVM: is the Support Vector Machines classifier which consists of a set of classification methods that construct separating hyperplanes for each pair of datasets. \u2022 See5: proprietary software for forming decision trees, which extends the capabilities of the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "597273802", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["134295416", "130043256", "128851612", "52846366", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52855349"}

Fish as an aquaculture product has high nutrients and low-fat content. So, people have consumed it as a safe and high-value foodstuff in their daily diet. Investigation of fish freshness is proposed as a significant issue in the aquaculture industry since fish spoils rapidly. The applied system of this study is comprised of the following steps: First, images of samples were captured and the pre-processing operation was done on the images. Then, particular channels including R, G, B, H, S, I, L*, a*, and b* were computed. Next, feature extraction was performed to obtain 6 types of texture features from each channel. Afterward, the hybrid Artificial Bee Colony-Artificial Neural Network (ABC-ANN) algorithm was applied to select the best features. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms as the most common methods were used to classify fish images. The best performance of the K-NN classifier was calculated in the k = 8 neighborhood size with the accuracy of 90.48. The best kernel function for the SVM algorithm was polynomial with C, sigma, and accuracy of 1, 2 and 91.52 percent, respectively. In this system, the input layer has consisted of 22 neurons based on the feature selection operation and 4 classes including most fresh, fresh, fairly fresh and spoiled have been used as the number of output layer. At the end, the best results of the MLP networks were achieved by LM learning algorithm and 6 neurons in the hidden layer with the 22\u201310\u20134 topology and accuracy of 93.01 percent. The achieved results demonstrate the high performance of the ANN classifier for evaluation of common carp freshness during ice storage as a rapid, accurate, non-destructive, real-time and automated method. It shows the potential of computer vision method in combination with artificial neural networks as an intelligent technique for evaluation of fish freshness.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2019.02.023", "venue": "Comput.

Detection of cyber-based attacks on computer networks continues to be a relevant and challenging area of research. Daily reports of incidents appear in public media including major ex-filtrations of data for the purposes of stealing identities, credit card numbers, and intellectual property as well as to take control of network resources. Methods used by attackers constantly change in order to defeat techniques employed by information technology (IT) teams intended to discover or block intrusions. \"Zero Day\" attacks whose \"signatures\" are not yet in IT databases are continually being uncovered. Machine learning approaches have been widely used to increase the effectiveness of intrusion detection platforms. While some machine learning techniques are effective at detecting certain types of attacks, there are no known methods that can be applied universally and achieve consistent results for multiple attack types. The focus of our research is the development of a framework that combines the outputs of multiple learners in order to improve the efficacy of network intrusion on data that contains instances of multiple classes of attacks. We have chosen the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the core learning algorithm due to recent research that suggests that ELMs are straightforward to implement, computationally efficient and have excellent learning performance characteristics on par with the Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the most widely used and best performing machine learning platforms (Liu, Gao, & Li, 2012). We introduce the novel Multiple Adaptive Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MARK-ELM) which combines Multiple Kernel Boosting (Xia & Hoi, 2013) with the Multiple Classification Reduced Kernel ELM (Deng, Zheng, & Zhang, 2013). We tested this approach on several machine learning datasets as well as the KDD Cup 99 (Hettich & Bay, 1999) intrusion detection dataset. Our results indicate that MARK-ELM works well for the majority of University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository small datasets and is scalable for larger datasets.

We propose a method for visual tracking-by-detection based on online feature learning. Our learning framework performs feature encoding with respect to an over-complete dictionary, followed by spatial pyramid pooling. We then learn a linear classifier based on the resulting feature encoding. Unlike previous work, we learn the dictionary online and update it to help capture the appearance of the tracked target as well as the background. In more detail, given a test image window, we extract local image patches from it and each local patch is encoded with respect to the dictionary. The encoded features are then pooled over a spatial pyramid to form an aggregated feature vector. Finally, a simple linear classifier is trained on these features.Our experiments show that the proposed powerful-albeit simple-tracker, outperforms all the state-of-the-art tracking methods that we have tested. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of different dictionary learning and feature encoding methods in the proposed tracking framework, and analyze the impact of each component in the tracking scenario. In particular, we show that a small dictionary, learned and updated online is as effective and more efficient than a huge dictionary learned offline. We further demonstrate the flexibility of feature learning by showing how it can be used within a structured learning tracking framework.

Depth faces can be recognised using almost all two dimensional feature based methods like Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and others. Since we are more concerned about detecting the variation of the shape of images, modified versions of the LBP are used here. But these modifications come at the cost of adding some extra bits to the extracted features. Some of these modified versions of LBP are Depth Local Binary Pattern (DLBP), Depth Local Quantised Pattern (DLQP) etc. DLBP introduces a variable threshold along with LBP bit whereas DLQP perform quantification of the depth difference.

Observers typically correct for this systematic in science data by deriving an instrumental noise model simultaneously with the astrophysical light curve and removing the noise model. Such techniques for self-calibrating Spitzer photometric datasets have been extremely successful, and in many cases enabled near-photon-limited precision on exoplanet transit and eclipse depths. Self-calibration, however, can suffer from certain limitations: (1) temporal astrophysical signals can become aliased as part of the instrument model; (2) for some techniques adequate model estimation often requires a high degree of intra-pixel positional redundancy (multiple samples with nearby centroids) over long time spans; (3) many techniques do not account for sporadic high frequency telescope vibrations that smear out the point spread function. We have begun to build independent general-purpose intra-pixel systematics removal algorithms using three machine learning techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (with kernel regression), Random Decision Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks. These methods remove many of the limitations of self-calibration: (1) they operate on a dedicated calibration database of approximately one million measurements per IRAC waveband (3.6 and 4.5 microns) of non-variable stars, and thus are independent of the time series science data to be corrected; (2) the database covers a large area of the \"Sweet Spot, so the methods do not require positional redundancy in the science data; (3) machine learning techniques in general allow for flexibility in training with multiple, sometimes unorthodox, variables, including those that trace PSF smear.

Classification of High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) datasets is a challenging task in supervised learning. Such datasets are prevalent in various areas including biomedical applications and business analytics. In this paper, a new embedded feature selection method for HDLSS datasets is introduced by incorporating sparsity in Proximal Support Vector Machines (PSVMs). Our method, called Sparse Proximal Support Vector Machines (sPSVMs), learns a sparse representation of PSVMs by first casting it as an equivalent least squares problem and then introducing the l1-norm for sparsity. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization techniques is proposed. sPSVMs remove more than 98% of features in many high dimensional datasets without compromising on generalization performance. Stability in the feature selection process of sPSVMs is also studied and compared with other univariate filter techniques. Additionally, sPSVMs offer the advantage of interpreting the selected features in the context of the classes by inducing class-specific local sparsity instead of global sparsity like other embedded methods. sPSVMs appear to be robust with respect to data dimensionality. Moreover, sPSVMs are able to perform feature selection and classification in one step, eliminating the need for dimensionality reduction on the data.

After the complete human genome sequence was published by Human Genome Project and Celera in 2001, there has been an explosion of research, shifting the NLU focus from domains like news articles to the domain of molecular biology and medical literature. BioNLU is needed, since there are almost 2000 new articles published and indexed every day, and the biologists need to know about existing knowledge regarding their own research. So far, BioNLU results are not as good as in other NLU domains, so more research is needed to solve the challenges of creating useful NLU applications for the biologists.The work in this PhD thesis is a \u201cproof of concept\u201d. It is the first to show that an existing Question Answering (QA) system can be successfully applied in the hard BioNLU domain, after the essential challenge of unknown entities is solved. The core contribution is a system that discovers and classifies unknown entities and relations between them automatically. The World Wide Web (through Google) is used as the main resource, and the performance is almost as good as other named entity extraction systems, but the advantage of this approach is that it is much simpler and requires less manual labor than any of the other comparable systems.The first paper in this collection gives an overview of the field of NLU and shows how the Information Extraction (IE) problem can be formulated with Local Grammars. The second paper uses Machine Learning to automatically recognize protein name based on features from the GSearch Engine. In the third paper, GSearch is substituted with Google, and the task in this paper is to extract all unknown names belonging to one of 273 biomedical entity classes, like genes, proteins, processes etc. After getting promising results with Google, the fourth paper shows that this approach can also be used to retrieve interactions or relationships between the named entities. The fifth paper describes an online implementation of the system, and shows that the method scales well to a larger set of entities.The final paper concludes the \u201cproof of concept\u201d research, and shows that the performance of the original GeneTUC NLU system has increased from handling 10% of the sentences in a large collection of abstracts in 2001, to 50% in 2006. This is still not good enough to create a commercial system, but it is believed that another 40% performance gain can be achieved by importing more verb templates into GeneTUC, just like nouns were imported during this work.

Ross, Ph.D., Chair A significant portion of the process of detecting pulsars from radio sky surveys remains a largely manual task. The visual inspection of data in order to detect and validate potential pulsar candidates is by far the most time consuming portion of the overall process. Coupled with the fact that well over a Petabyte of pulsar survey data has been archived, the task of identifying these valuable phenomena is tedious and time consuming. Using data from a survey performed with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory\u2019s (NRAO\u2019s) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in 2007, this thesis explores the application of machine learning techniques to mitigate the manual efforts involved in pulsar candidate detection. The performance of three different classifiers is explored Naive Bayes, C4.5 (J48) Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. Preprocessing and feature extraction methods are described and a framework for applying the classifiers to the survey data is presented. Multiple features were extracted from the survey data and used to train the classifiers. Cross-validation results of the various feature sets and classifiers are documented.

The symbol to be written is determined by detecting the P300 signal, which is generated when the subject counts number of times the given symbol is intensified. Traditionally, evoked activity is extracted using binary classification with a long feature vector consisting of individual electrodes, and averaging over several repetitions. What we have done here is a novel feature extraction method for rapid classification of P300. The method does averaging not only over trials but also electrodes. The underlying assumption is as follows; every electrode in frontocentral and centroparietal region has different background EEG activity but almost similar evoked activity with some little time shift called latency. Since the latency between electrodes is at most roughly 30 ms and background EEG activities have different patterns, averaging both over repetitions and electrodes increases P300 signal to background EEG noise ratio faster using less trials than traditional approach. Traditional and proposed feature extraction methods are tested on BCI Competition III P300-speller dataset by using Support Vector Machines.

In order to obtain acceptable classification results, these techniques require there to be sufficient training data available for every particular image. Obtaining training samples is challenging, particularly for near real-time applications. Therefore, past knowledge must be utilized to overcome the lack of training data in the current regime. This challenge is known as domain adaptation (DA), and one of the common approaches to this problem is based on finding invariant representations for both the training and test data, which are often assumed to come from different \u201cdomains.\u201d In this study, we consider two deep learning techniques for learning domain-invariant representations: Denoising autoencoders (DAE) and domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN). While the DAE is a typical two-stage DA technique (unsupervised invariant representation learning followed by supervised classification), DANN is an end-to-end approach where invariant representation learning and classification are considered jointly during training. The proposed techniques are applied to both hyperspectral and multispectral images under different DA scenarios.

Given that Random Forests (RF) use Bagging as one of two fundamental techniques to create diversity in the ensemble, it could be expected that HD is also effective for this ensemble method. The main aim of this article is to carry out an extensive investigation on important aspects about the use of HD in RF, including handling of multi-class problems, hyper-parameter optimization, metrics comparison, probability estimation, and metrics combination. In particular, HD is compared to other commonly used splitting metrics (Gini and Gain Ratio) in several contexts: balanced/imbalanced and two-class/multi-class. Two aspects related to classification problems are assessed: classification itself and probability estimation. HD is defined for two-class problems, but there are several ways in which it can be extended to deal with multi-class and this article studies the performance of the available options. Finally, even though HD can be used as an alternative to other splitting metrics, there is no reason to limit RF to use just one of them. Therefore, the final study of this article is to determine whether selecting the splitting metric using cross-validation on the training data can improve results further. Results show HD to be a robust measure for RF, with some weakness for balanced multi-class datasets (especially for probability estimation). Combination of metrics is able to result in a more robust performance.

While the content repositories created through CQA sites have been used widely to support general purpose tasks, using them as online digital libraries that support educational needs is an emerging practice. Horizontal CQA services, such as Yahoo! Answers, and vertical CQA services, such as Brainly, are aiming to help students improve their learning process by answering their educational questions. In these services, receiving high quality answer(s) to a question is a critical factor not only for user satisfaction, but also for supporting learning. However, the questions are not necessarily answered by experts, and the askers may not have enough knowledge and skill to evaluate the quality of the answers they receive. This could be problematic when students build their own knowledge base by applying inaccurate information or knowledge acquired from online sources. Using moderators could alleviate this problem. However, a moderator's evaluation of answer quality may be inconsistent because it is based on their subjective assessments. Employing human assessors may also be insufficient due to the large amount of content available on a CQA site. To address these issues, we propose a framework for automatically assessing the quality of answers. This is achieved by integrating different groups of features - personal, community-based, textual, and contextual - to build a classification model and determine what constitutes answer quality. To test this evaluation framework, we collected more than 10 million educational answers posted by more than 3 million users on Brainly's United States and Poland sites. The experiments conducted on these datasets show that the model using Random Forest (RF) achieves more than 83% accuracy in identifying high quality of answers. In addition, the findings indicate that personal and community-based features have more prediction power in assessing answer quality. Our approach also achieves high values on other key metrics such as F1-score and Area under ROC curve.

{"paper_id": "7472935", "title": "Rotation Forest and Random Oracles: Two Classifier Ensemble Methods", "authors": [{"first": "J.J.", "middle": [], "last": "Rodriguez", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Classification methods are widely used in computer-based medical systems. Often, the accuracy of a classifier can be improved using a classifier ensemble, the combination of several classifiers. Two classifiers ensembles and their results on several medical data sets will be presented: Rotation Forest (Rodriguez, Kuncheva and Alonso) and Random Oracles (Kuncheva and Rodriguez). Rotation Forest is a method for generating classifier ensembles based on feature extraction. To create the training data for a base classifier, the feature set is randomly split into K subsets (K is a parameter of the algorithm) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to each subset. All principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information in the data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes, hence the name \"forest.\" Accuracy is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base classifier. Comparisons with various standard ensemble methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random Forest) will be reported. Diversity-error diagrams reveal that Rotation Forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and Random Forest and more diverse than these in Bagging, sometimes more accurate as well. A random oracle classifier is a mini-ensemble formed by a pair of classifiers and a fixed, randomly created oracle that selects between them. The random oracle can be thought of as a random discriminant function which splits the data into two subsets with no regard of any class labels or cluster structure. Two random oracles has been considered: linear and spherical. A random oracle classifier can be used as the base classifier of any ensemble method. It is argued that this approach encourages extra diversity in the ensemble while allowing for high accuracy of the individual ensemble members. Experiments with several data sets from UCI and 11 ensemble models will be reported. Each ensemble model will be examined with and without the oracle. The results will show that all ensemble methods benefited from the new approach, most markedly so random subspace and bagging. A further experiment with seven real medical data sets will demonstrate the validity of these findings outside the UCI data collection. When using Naive Bayes Classifiers as base classifiers, the experiments show that ensembles based solely upon the spherical oracle (and no other ensemble heuristic) outrank Bagging, Wagging, Random Subspaces, AdaBoost.Ml, MultiBoost and Decorate. Moreover, all these ensemble methods are better with any of the two random oracles than their standard versions without the oracles.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CBMS.2007.94", "venue": "Twentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS'07)", "journal": "Twentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS'07)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2127884445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7472935"}

This limitation is often aroused when applying non-linear kernels (e.g. RBF Kernel) which are usually required to obtain better separation for linearly inseparable data sets. In this thesis, we study an approach that aims to speed-up the training time by combining both the better performance of RBF kernels and fast training by a linear solver, LIBLINEAR. The approach uses an RBF kernel with a sparse matrix which is factorized using Cholesky decomposition. The method is tested on large artificial and real data sets and compared to the standard RBF and linear kernels where both the accuracy and training time are reported.

However, the well-known content-based image classification methods do not overcome the so-called semantic gap problem in which low-level visual features cannot represent the high-level semantic content of images. Image classification using visual and textual information often performs poorly since the extracted textual features are often too limited to accurately represent the images. In this paper, we propose a semantic image classification approach using multi-context analysis. For a given image, we model the relevant textual information as its multi-modal context, and regard the related images connected by hyperlinks as its link context. Two kinds of context analysis models, i.e., cross-modal correlation analysis and link-based correlation model, are used to capture the correlation among different modals of features and the topical dependency among images induced by the link structure. We propose a new collective classification model called relational support vector classifier (RSVC) based on the well-known Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the link-based correlation model.

In this paper, we unify them in a general pair-based weighting loss function, where the minimizing objective loss is just the distances weighting of informative pairs. The general pair-based weighting loss includes two main aspects, (1) samples mining and (2) pairs weighting. Samples mining aims at selecting the informative positive and negative pair sets to exploit the structured relationship of samples in a mini-batch and also reduce the number of non-trivial pairs.

Within this increasing complexity, developers, maintainers, and users cannot keep track of the interactions between all the various configuration options. Finding the optimally performing configuration of a software system for a given setting is challenging. Recent approaches address this challenge by learning performance models based on a sample set of configurations. However, collecting enough data on enough sample configurations can be very expensive since each such sample requires configuring, compiling and executing the entire system against a complex test suite. The central insight of this paper is that choosing a suitable source (a.k.a. \"bellwether\") to learn from, plus a simple transfer learning scheme will often outperform much more complex transfer learning methods. Using this insight, this paper proposes BEETLE, a novel bellwether based transfer learning scheme, which can identify a suitable source and use it to find near-optimal configurations of a software system. BEETLE significantly reduces the cost (in terms of the number of measurements of sample configuration) to build performance models. We evaluate our approach with 61 scenarios based on 5 software systems and demonstrate that BEETLE is beneficial in all cases. This approach offers a new highwater mark in configuring software systems. Specifically, BEETLE can find configurations that are as good or better as those found by anything else while requiring only 1/7th of the evaluations needed by the state-of-the-art.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.03900", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2791436944", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29192939", "14462525", "13967968", "7055940", "14343793", "207738357", "44621520", "5818634", "6089057", "14770655", "1119864", "3686513", "2472445", "16059634", "24324165", "5844313", "1679837", "15287603", "10806430", "6126098", "556999", "43112561", "20524606", "16253010", "15019466", "16072686", "13670979", "2977459", "784510", "11067362", "5740922", "23879882", "13074764", "13559191", "597779", "5738823", "14223436", "6817584", "2230060", "3113891", "207247842", "8635810", "120137017", "1738167", "13945218", "362467"], "inbound_citations": ["54444635", "84178090"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3898347"}

Because of the limitations for experimental self-interaction proteins identification, developing an effective computational method based on protein sequence to detect SIPs is much important. In the study, we proposed a novel computational approach called RVMBIGP that combines the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model and Bi-gram probability (BIGP) to predict SIPs based on protein sequence. The proposed prediction model includes as following steps: (1) an effective feature extraction method named BIGP is used to represent protein sequences on Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM); (2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is employed for integrating the useful information and reducing the influence of noise; (3) the robust classifier Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is used to carry out classification.

This diagnostic barrier delays identification and treatment by years, resulting in prolonged pain and disease progression. Development of a non-invasive diagnostic test could significantly improve timely disease detection. We tested the feasibility of serum microRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers of endometriosis in women with gynecologic disease symptoms. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: To validate the use of a microRNA panel as a non-invasive diagnostic method for detecting endometriosis. ::: ::: ::: STUDY DESIGN ::: This was a prospective study evaluating subjects with a clinical indication for gynecologic surgery in an academic medical center. Serum samples were collected prior to surgery from 100 subjects. Women were selected based on the presence of symptoms and laparoscopy was performed to determine the presence or absence of endometriosis. The control group was categorized based on absence of visual disease at the time of surgery. Circulating miRNAs miR-125b-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-342-3p, miR-451a, miR-3613-5p and let-7b were measured in serum by qRT-PCR in a blinded fashion, without knowledge of disease status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed on individual miRNAs, as well as combinations of miRNAs. An algorithm combining the expression values of these miRNAs, built using machine learning with a Random Forest classifier, was generated to predict the presence or absence of endometriosis on operative findings. This algorithm was then tested in an independent dataset of 48 previously identified subjects not included in the training set (24 endometriosis and 24 controls) to validate its diagnostic performance. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The mean age of women in the study population was 34.1 and 36.9 for the endometriosis and control groups, respectively. Control group subjects displayed varying pathologies, with leiomyoma occurring the most often (n=39). Subjects with endometriosis had significantly higher expression levels of four serum miRNAs: miR-125b-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-342-3p, and miR-451a. Two serum miRNAs showed significantly lower levels in the endometriosis group: miR-3613-5p and let-7b. Individual miRNAs had ROC areas under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.68 to 0.92. A classifier combining these miRNAs yielded an AUC of 0.94 when validated in the independent set of subjects not included in the training set. Analysis of the expression levels of each miRNA based on rASRM staging revealed that all miRNAs could distinguish Stage I/II from control, and Stage III/IV from control, but that the difference between Stage I/II and Stage III/IV was not significant. Subgroup analysis revealed that neither phase of menstrual cycle or use of hormonal medication significantly impacted expression levels in the miRNAs used in our algorithm. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: This is the first report showing that miRNA biomarkers can reliably differentiate between endometriosis and other gynecologic pathologies with an AUC > 0.9 across two independent studies. We validated the performance of an algorithm based on previously identified miRNA biomarkers, demonstrating their potential to detect endometriosis in a clinical setting, allowing earlier identification and treatment. The ability to diagnose endometriosis non-invasively could reduce the time to diagnosis, surgical risk, years of discomfort, disease progression, associated co-morbidities and healthcare costs.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32165186", "doi": "10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.050", "venue": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "journal": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "mag_id": "3011037712", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212691662"}

It has been facilitated by several remote sensing data and classification techniques. In the present study, an object-based semiautomatic classification methodology was tested to classify sugarcane based on analysis of time series of 7 images (2013-2014 cultural cycle) from Landsat-8 OLI sensors. The study area is located in Piracicaba microregion in the Sao Paulo State, which is the principal producer state of sugarcane in Brazil. The Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to differentiate the sugarcane crop from other uses, like water, natural vegetation, pasture, urban areas, and other agricultural areas. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were calculated from reflectance images of OLI sensors. These vegetation indices, together with the surface reflectance images from bands 2 to 7 (blue to far infrared light) were used as input variables of Random Forest classifier. Samples from representative areas of sugarcane and other uses, selected from maps done in the CANASAT project, were used to calibrate the RF classifier. After the calibration step, the classifier was applied in all temporal series of a segmented image. This segmentation was done under SPRING software and allowed to segment the image in more than 35x103 objects (polygones) of similar spectral aspect. The RF classifier attributes a single class for each of these polygons, thus resulting in a map of the available sugarcane areas to harvest from April. The sugarcane class in the study area, represented 32.1% of total area which corresponds to 253000 hectares of sugarcane available to harvest in April. Sugarcane map from CANASAT project was used to validate the results. The maps were compared through a confusion matrix and Kappa statistics. The results indicated that the semiautomatic classification achieved an overall accuracy of 83% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.61, which is reasonable taking into account that some uncertainty exist on CANASAT map. Random Forest classifier, applied to time series of OLI sensors images was adequate to identify sugarcane crop from other uses and land cover. However, additional analyses are necessary to better select the input variables and parameters of RF classifier to discriminate the crop.

If the kernel matrix is not a low-rank matrix, it can be approximated by a low-rank positive semi-definite matrix, which in turn will be fed into the optimizer. In this paper we present two SOCP formulations for each SVM classification and regression problem. There are several search direction methods for implementing SOCPs. Our main goal is to find a better search direction for implementing the SOCP formulations of the SVM problems. Two popular search direction methods: HKM and AHO are tested analytically for the SVM problems, and efficiently implemented. The computational costs of each iteration of the HKM and AHO search direction methods are shown to be the same for the SVM problems. Thus, the training time depends on the number of IPM iterations. Our experimental results show that the HKM method converges faster than the AHO method. We also compare our results with the method proposed in Fine and Scheinberg (2001) that also exploits the low-rank of the kernel matrix, the state-of-the-art SVM optimization softwares SVMTorch and SVMlight.

High throughput experiments to identify RNA-protein interactions are beginning to provide valuable information about the complexity of RNA-protein interaction networks, but are expensive and time consuming. Hence, there is a need for reliable computational methods for predicting RNA-protein interactions.ResultsWe propose RPISeq, a family of classifiers for predicting R NA-p rotein i nteractions using only seq uence information. Given the sequences of an RNA and a protein as input, RPIseq predicts whether or not the RNA-protein pair interact. The RNA sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its ribonucleotide 4-mer composition, and the protein sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its 3-mer composition, based on a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation. Two variants of RPISeq are presented: RPISeq-SVM, which uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and RPISeq-RF, which uses a Random Forest classifier. On two non-redundant benchmark datasets extracted from the Protein-RNA Interface Database (PRIDB), RPISeq achieved an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) of 0.96 and 0.92. On a third dataset containing only mRNA-protein interactions, the performance of RPISeq was competitive with that of a published method that requires information regarding many different features (e.g., mRNA half-life, GO annotations) of the putative RNA and protein partners. In addition, RPISeq classifiers trained using the PRIDB data correctly predicted the majority (57-99%) of non-coding RNA-protein interactions in NPInter-derived networks from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and H. sapiens.ConclusionsOur experiments with RPISeq demonstrate that RNA-protein interactions can be reliably predicted using only sequence-derived information. RPISeq offers an inexpensive method for computational construction of RNA-protein interaction networks, and should provide useful insights into the function of non-coding RNAs.

The proposed system is composed of two parts: the first is a mobile application to take a picture of the car license plate, and the second is the recognition system using ELM. The recognition system entails two parts: the first is to preprocess and extract features using the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). The second part is to classify each number and each of the Thai alphabet letters that appear on the car license plates. Also, the system will classify provinces of each plate.

Windowing consists in selecting a sample of the available training examples (the window) to induce a decision tree with an usual algorithm, e.g., J48; finding instances not covered by this tree (counter examples) in the remaining training examples, adding them to the window to induce a new tree; and repeating until a termination criterion is met. In this way, the number of training examples required to induce the tree is reduced considerably, while maintaining the expected accuracy levels; which is paid in terms of time performance. Our proposed enhancements solve this by searching for counter examples on GPUs and further reducing their number in the window. The resulting strategy is implemented in JaCa-DDM, our agents & artifacts tool for Distributed Data Mining, keeping the benefits of Windowing, while distributing the process and being faster than the traditional centralized approach, even performing similarly to Bagging and Random Forests in some cases. Experiments in data mining tasks are addressed, including a case study on pixel-based segmentation for the detection of precancerous cervical lesions on medical images.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2016.11.006", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.

In this paper, we study relation extraction in a special weakly-supervised setting when we have only a few seed instances of the target relation type we want to extract but we also have a large amount of labeled instances of other relation types. Observing that different relation types can share certain common structures, we propose to use a multi-task learning method coupled with human guidance to address this weakly-supervised relation extraction problem. The proposed framework models the commonality among different relation types through a shared weight vector, enables knowledge learned from the auxiliary relation types to be transferred to the target relation type, and allows easy control of the tradeoff between precision and recall.

Each lesion was examined with B-mode US, Color/Power Doppler US and elastography (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse\u2013ARFI). Different quantitative parameters were recorded for each technique, including pulsatility (PI) and resistive Index (RI) for Doppler US and lesion maximum, intermediate, and minimum shear wave velocity (SWVmax, SWVinterm, and SWVmin) as well as lesion-to-fat SWV ratio for ARFI. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each quantitative parameter. Classification analysis was performed using the exhaustive chi-squared automatic interaction detection method. Results include the probability for malignancy for every descriptor combination in the classification algorithm.ResultsSixty-five lesions were malignant and 59 benign. Out of all quantitative indices, maximum SWV (SWVmax), and RI were included in the classification algorithm, which showed a depth of three ramifications (SWVmax \u2264 or > 3.16; if SWVmax \u2264 3.16 then RI \u2264 0.66, 0.66\u20130.77 or > 0.77; if RI \u2264 0.66 then SWVmax \u2264 or > 2.71).

By applying the proposed algorithm, a false-positive biopsy could have been avoided in 61 % of the cases.ConclusionsA simple classification algorithm incorporating two quantitative US parameters (SWVmax and RI) shows a high diagnostic performance, being able to accurately differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions and lower the number of unnecessary breast biopsies in up to 60 % of all cases, avoiding any subjective interpretation bias.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6244531", "pubmed_id": "29633108", "doi": "10.1007/s11307-018-1187-x", "venue": "Molecular Imaging and Biology", "journal": "Molecular Imaging and Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2797720849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["17797413", "33044216", "72237080", "24010567", "1244545", "31826506", "2366127", "32062752", "23059842", "31289877", "4353947", "44855723", "16041797", "25487595", "39273822", "22232029", "20409536", "205535833", "41925796", "28063616", "1309037", "205537718", "61329067", "14797843", "8729037", "54013589", "22891967", "30327011", "42981664", "36346164", "25492355", "39485654", "6178155"], "inbound_citations": ["215464058", "201803155"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4707102"}

Firstly the parallelism feature of the airport runway is extracted based on the prior knowledge of airport, and then regions of interest (ROI) is obtained according to the improved graph based visual saliency (GBVS). The airport is then located through the saliency fusion of parallel lines and regions of interest. Finally airport detection is achieved by transfer learning.

We aim to assess the risk of falling as easy, accurate and inexpensive as possible to be able to identify those persons at high risk of functional decline and trigger appropriate clinical interventions. A new method are functional assessments with inertial sensors like the actibelt\u00ae. We analyzed the predictive value of the data recorded with this device in 171 community-dwelling female seniors with a mean age of 68 years included in the EU-Project VPHOP. ::: Results showed that acceleration-based parameters provide an improvement in risk prediction over classical features. We could prove 18 variables retrieved by the inertial sensor to be valid or plausible. To identify variables with predictive power, we applied the following feature selection and dimension reduction techniques: sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS), Elastic Nets (EN) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We found that PCA is useless for this kind of data, whereas EN are most applicable according to our results. From a range of different classification methods, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) showed the best performance. LR presented a higher specificity in the classification of fallers/non-fallers with a True Positive Rate (TPR), or rate of correctly classified fallers, equal to 0.30 and a True Negative Rate (TNR), or rate of correctly classified non-fallers, equal to 0.92. The results of SVM were more sensitive with TPR=0.60 and TNR=0.85. The latter results are more suitable because the consequences of incorrectly classifying a non-faller are less harmful than vice versa.

This paper proposes an automated approach to classify breast tissue types in digital mammogram. The main objective of the proposed Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is to investigate various feature extraction methods and classifiers to improve the diagnostic accuracy in mammogram density classification. Texture analysis methods are used to extract the features from the mammogram. Texture features are extracted by using histogram, Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Gray Level Difference Matrix (GLDM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Entropy, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), Gabor transform and trace transform. These extracted features are selected using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The features selected by ANOVA are fed into the classifiers to characterize the mammogram into two-class (fatty/dense) and three-class (fatty/glandular/dense) breast density classification. This work has been carried out by using the mini-Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database. Five classifiers are employed namely, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results show that ANN provides better performance than LDA, NB, KNN and SVM classifiers.

Therefore we address relevance and its role in intelligent behavior in animals and machines. Animals avoid exhaustive enumeration of possibilities by focusing on relevant aspects of the environment, which emerge into the (cognitive) foreground, while suppressing irrelevant aspects, which submerge into the background. Nevertheless, the background is not invisible, and aspects of it can pop into the foreground if background processing deems them potentially relevant. Essential to these ideas are questions of how contexts are switched, which defines cognitive/behavioral episodes, and how new contexts are created, which allows the efficiency of foreground/background processing to be extended to new behaviors and cognitive domains. Next we consider mathematical characterizations of the foreground/background distinction, which we treat as a dynamic separation of the concrete space into (approximately) orthogonal subspaces, which are processed differently. Background processing is characterized by large receptive fields which project into a space of relatively low dimension to accomplish rough categorization of a novel stimulus and its approximate location. Such background processing is partly innate and partly learned, and we discuss possible correlational (Hebbian) learning mechanisms. Foreground processing is characterized by small receptive fields which project into a space of comparatively high dimension to accomplish precise categorization and localization of the stimuli relevant to the context. We also consider mathematical models of valences and affordances, which are an aspect of the foreground. Cells processing foregound information have no fixed meaning (i.e., their meaning is contextual), so it is necessary to explain how the processing accomplished by foreground neurons can be made relative to the context. Thus we consider the properties of several simple mathematical models of how the contextual representation controls foreground processing. We show how simple correlational processes accomplish the contextual separation of foreground from background on the basis of differential reinforcement. That is, these processes account for the contextual separation of the concrete space into disjoint subspaces corresponding to the foreground and background. Since an episode may comprise the activation of several contexts (at varying levels of activity) we consider models, suggested by quantum mechanics, of foreground processing in superposition. That is, the contextual state may be a weighted superposition of several pure contexts, with a corresponding superposition of the foreground representations and the processes operating on them. This leads us to a consideration of the nature and origin of contexts. Although some contexts are innate, many are learned. We discuss a mathematical model of contexts which allows a context to split into several contexts, agglutinate from several contexts, or to constellate out of relatively acontextual processing. Finally, we consider the acontextual processing which occurs when the current context is no longer relevant, and may trigger the switch to another context or the formation of a new context.

Applied to modern big data, these methods often require a large number of sub-learners, where the complexity of each learner typically grows with the size of the dataset. This phenomenon results in an increasing demand for storage space, which may be very costly. This problem mostly manifests in a subscriber-based environment, where a user-specific ensemble needs to be stored on a personal device with strict storage limitations (such as a cellular device). In this work we introduce a novel method for lossless compression of tree-based ensemble methods, focusing on random forests. Our suggested method is based on probabilistic modeling of the ensemble\u2019s trees, followed by model clustering via Bregman divergence. This allows us to find a minimal set of models that provides an accurate description of the trees, and at the same time is small enough to store and maintain. Our compression scheme demonstrates high compression rates on a variety of modern datasets. Importantly, our scheme enables predictions from the compressed format and a perfect reconstruction of the original ensemble.

Three types of wavelets have been used which are Haar, Daubechies and Coiflets wavelets and the quality of reduced hyperspectral data has been assessed by determining the accuracy of classification of reduced data using Support Vector Machines classifier. The hyperspectral data has been reduced upto four decomposition levels. Among the wavelets used for feature extraction Daubechies wavelet gives consistently better accuracy than that produced from Coiflets wavelet.

They provide analysts computational tools to aid predictive modelling and the interpretation of interactions between data and the phenomena under investigation. The analysis of large volumes of disparate multivariate geospatial data using machine learning algorithms therefore offers great promise to industry and research in the geosciences. Geoscience data are frequently characterised by a restriction in the number and distribution of direct observations, irreducible noise in these data and a high degree of intraclass variability and interclass similarity. The choice of machine learning algorithm, or algorithms and the details of how algorithms are applied must therefore be appropriate to the context of geoscience data. With this knowledge, I aim to employ machine learning as a means of understanding the spatial distribution of complex geological phenomena. ::: I conduct a rigorous and comprehensive comparison of machine learning algorithms, representing the five general machine learning strategies, for supervised lithology classification applications. I also develop and test a novel method for obtaining robust estimates of the uncertainty associated with machine learning algorithm categorical predictions. The insights gained from these experiments leads to the further development and comparison of new methods for the incorporation of spatial-contextual information into machine learning supervised classifiers. ::: In using machine learning algorithms for geoscience applications, I have developed bestpractice methodologies that address the challenges facing geoscientists for geospatial supervised classification. Guidelines are established that detail the preparation and integration of disparate spatial data, the optimisation of trained classifiers for a given application and the robust statistical and spatial evaluation of outputs. I demonstrate, through a case study in a region that is prospective for economic mineralisation, the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for the critical appraisal of pre-existing geological maps and formulation of meaningful interpretations of geological phenomena. ::: The experiments conducted as part of my research confirm the efficacy of machine learning algorithms to generate accurate geological maps representing a variety of terranes. I identify and explore key aspects of the spatial and statistical istributions of geoscience data that affect machine learning algorithm performance. My research clearly identifies Random Forests\u2122 as a good first-choice algorithm for the prediction of classes representing lithologies using commonly available multivariate geological and geophysical data. Furthermore, Random Forests prediction uncertainty is shown to be closely related to ambiguous and/or erroneous classifications and, thus provides a practical means of indicating variable levels of confidence. Spatial-contextual information is best incorporated into machine learning supervised classifiers via the pre-processing of input variables and/or the post-regularisation of classifications. My findings indicate that a trade-off between optimal predictive models and interpretable explanatory models exists, whereby, intuitively interpretable models are not necessarily the most accurate. ::: The practical application of machine learning algorithms requires the implementation of three key stages: (1) data pre-processing; (2) algorithm training; and (3) prediction evaluation. This methodology provides the foundation for generating accurate and geologically meaningful predictions with minimal user intervention and assists in the formulation of robust interpretations of complex geological phenomena. For example, classifications obtained by Random Forests are useful for critically appraising interpreted geological maps. Clusters produced by Self-Organising Maps indicate the presence of discrete, spatially contiguous and geologically significant sub-classes within individual lithological units, which represent regions of contrasting primary composition and alteration styles. My results may be widely applied to a broad range of practical geoscience challenges such as ore deposit targeting, geo-hazard risk assessment, engineering and construction projects, hydrological and environmental modelling and ecological studies.

A key solution to these QA systems is to retrieve from a QA knowledge base the most similar question of a given question, which can be reformulated as a paraphrase identification (PI) or a natural language inference (NLI) problem. However, most existing models for PI and NLI have at least two problems: They rely on a large amount of labeled data, which is not always available in real scenarios, and they may not be efficient for industrial applications. In this paper, we study transfer learning for the PI and NLI problems, aiming to propose a general framework, which can effectively and efficiently adapt the shared knowledge learned from a resource-rich source domain to a resource-poor target domain. Specifically, since most existing transfer learning methods only focus on learning a shared feature space across domains while ignoring the relationship between the source and target domains, we propose to simultaneously learn shared representations and domain relationships in a unified framework. Furthermore, we propose an efficient and effective hybrid model by combining a sentence encoding-based method and a sentence interaction-based method as our base model. Extensive experiments on both paraphrase identification and natural language inference demonstrate that our base model is efficient and has promising performance compared to the competing models, and our transfer learning method can help to significantly boost the performance. Further analysis shows that the inter-domain and intra-domain relationship captured by our model are insightful. Last but not least, we deploy our transfer learning model for PI into our online chatbot system, which can bring in significant improvements over our existing system.

However, despite the high density, and quality, of the data itself, the data acquired contains no direct intelligence necessary for further modeling and analysis - merely the 3D geometry (XYZ), 3-component color (RGB), and laser return signal strength (I) for each point. One common task for LIDAR data processing is the selection of an appropriate methodology for the extraction of geometric features from the irregularly distributed point clouds. Such recognition schemes must accomplish both segmentation and classification. Planar (or other geometrically primitive) feature extraction is a common method for point cloud segmentation, however, current algorithms are computationally expensive and often do not utilize color or intensity information. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm, that takes advantage of both colorimetric and geometric data as input and consists of three principal steps to accomplish a more flexible form of feature extraction. First, we employ a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) super pixel algorithm for clustering and dividing the colorimetric data. Second, we use a plane-fitting technique on each significantly smaller cluster to produce a set of normal vectors corresponding to each super pixel. Last, we utilize a Least Squares Multi-class Support Vector Machine (LSMSVM) to classify each cluster as either \"ground\", \"wall\", or \"natural feature\".

As matching data features in Hamming space is computationally cheaper than in Euclidean space, learning to hash and binary representations are generally appreciated in modern retrieval models. Recent research seeks solutions in deep learning to formulate the hash functions, showing great potential in retrieval performance. In this thesis, we gradually extend our research topics and contributions from unsupervised single-modal deep hashing to supervised cross-modal hashing _nally zero-shot hashing problems, addressing the following challenges in deep hashing. ::: ::: First of all, existing unsupervised deep hashing works are still not attaining leading retrieval performance compared with the shallow ones. To improve this, a novel unsupervised single-modal hashing model is proposed in this thesis, named Deep Variational Binaries (DVB). We introduce the popular conditional variational auto-encoders to formulate the encoding function. By minimizing the reconstruction error of the latent variables, the proposed model produces compact binary codes without training supervision. Experiments on benchmarked datasets show that our model outperform existing unsupervised hashing methods. The second problem is that current cross-modal hashing methods only consider holistic image representations and fail to model descriptive sentences, which is inappropriate to handle the rich semantics of informative cross-modal data for quality textual-visual search tasks. To handle this problem, we propose a supervised deep cross-modal hashing model called Textual-Visual Deep Binaries (TVDB). Region-based neural networks and recurrent neural networks are involved in the image encoding network in order to make e_ective use of visual information, while the text encoder is built using a convolutional neural network. We additionally introduce an e_cient in-batch optimization routine to train the network parameters. The proposed mode successfully outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets. ::: ::: Finally, existing hashing models fail when the categories of query data have never been seen during training. This scenario is further extended into a novel zero-shot cross-modal hashing task in this thesis, and a Zero-shot Sketch-Image Hashing (ZSIH) scheme is then proposed with graph convolution and stochastic neurons. Experiments show that the proposed ZSIH model signi_cantly outperforms existing hashing algorithms in the zero-shot retrieval task. Experiments suggest our proposed and novel hashing methods outperform state-of-the-art researches in single-modal and cross-modal data retrieval.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2883216965", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70171968"}

In this paper, we argue that for naive Bayes attribute weighting should instead be used to alleviate the conditional independence assumption. Based on this premise, we propose a weighted naive Bayes algorithm, called WANBIA, that selects weights to minimize either the negative conditional log likelihood or the mean squared error objective functions.

In the sequential mining pattern phase, Mix & Test algorithm is developed based on Grammatical Inference, which is used as a training phase. Mix & Test algorithm minimizes I/O costs by one database scan, discovers subsequence combinations directly from sequences in memory without searching the whole sequence file, has no database projection, handles gaps, and works with variant length sequences without having to align them. In addition, a parallelized version of Mix & Test algorithm is applied to speed up Mix & Test algorithm performance. In the fold recognition phase, unknown protein folds are predicted via a proposed testing function.

We apply intensive topographic surveys, multi-temporal LiDAR, and Random Forest modeling to quantify snow volume and characterize associated errors across seven land cover types in a semi-arid mountainous catchment at a 1 and 4 m spatial resolution. The LiDAR-based estimates of both snow-off surface topology and snow depths were validated against ground-based measurements across the catchment. LiDAR-derived snow depths estimates were most accurate in areas of low lying vegetation such as meadow and shrub vegetation (RMSE = 0.14 m) as compared to areas consisting of tree cover (RMSE = 0.20\u20130.35 m). The highest errors were found along the edge of conifer forests (RMSE = 0.35 m), however a second conifer transect outside the catchment had much lower errors (RMSE = 0.21 m). This difference is attributed to the wind exposure of the first site that led to highly variable snow depths at short spatial distances. The Random Forest modeled errors deviated from the field measured errors with a RMSE of 0.09\u20130.34 m across the different cover types. The modeling was used to calculate a theoretical lower and upper bound of catchment snow volume error of 21\u201330%. Results show that snow drifts, which are important for maintaining spring and summer stream flows and establishing and sustaining water-limited plant species, contained 30 \u00b1 5\u20136% of the snow volume while only occupying 10% of the catchment area similar to findings by prior physically-based modeling approaches.

However, state-of-the-art predictive algorithms are typically \u201cblack-boxes,\u201d learning statistical interactions that are difficult to translate into testable hypotheses. The iterative Random Forest (iRF) algorithm took a step towards bridging this gap by providing a computationally tractable procedure to identify the stable, high-order feature interactions that drive the predictive accuracy of Random Forests (RF). Here we refine the interactions identified by iRF to explicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our method, signed iRF (s-iRF), describes \u201csubsets\u201d of rules that frequently occur on RF decision paths. We refer to these \u201crule subsets\u201d as signed interactions. Signed interactions share not only the same set of interacting features but also exhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent functional relationship between interacting features and responses. We describe stable and predictive importance metrics (SPIMs) to rank signed interactions in terms of their stability, predictive accuracy, and strength of interaction. For each SPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize its expected behavior under known structure. We evaluate our proposed approach in biologically inspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and spatial gene expression patterns. In the case of enhancer activity, s-iRF recovers one of the few experimentally validated high-order interactions and suggests novel enhancer elements where this interaction may be active.

It solves a quadratic programming (QP) problem by optimizing a set of coefficients whose size is the number of training examples. However, its execution time may be quite long due to its computational complexity: the algorithm executes many calculations per iteration as well as many iterations until a stop criterion is satisfied. Due to its importance, many improvements have been proposed in order to obtain faster solutions. These improvements keep unchanged the SMO basic characteristic: the optimization is always performed on one pair of coefficients per iteration. This paper presents the Multiple Pairs SMO (MP-SMO), a new solution for the SMO algorithm that consists of optimizing more than one pair of coefficients per iteration. We show that this algorithm improves the performance results obtained by other known SMO solutions. Our algorithm presents the following characteristics: a) it uses the previously adopted analytical solution; b) its working set selection heuristic has been adapted from known solutions in order to deal with multiple pairs; c) the monotonic convergence of the algorithm has been demonstrated. We applied our MP-SMO algorithm to a set of known benchmarks. We tested the algorithm optimizing two, three and four pairs per iteration.

To address this issue, we model abstractive summarization using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), aiming to minimize the gap between generated summaries and the ground-truth ones.

Reinforcement learning (RL) strategy is used to guarantee the co-training of generator and discriminator.

In comparison we handle all challenges within a single framework. Our framework uses a soft label Random Forest [5] to learn discriminative shape features of an object and use them to classify both its location and pose. We propose a novel iterative training scheme for forests which maximizes the margin between classes to improve recognition accuracy, as compared to a conventional training procedure. The learnt forest outperforms template matching, DPM [7] in presence of similar looking distractors. Using occlusion information, computed from the depth data, the forest learns to emphasize the shape features from the visible regions thus making it robust to occlusion. We benchmark our system with the state-of-the-art recognition systems [9,7] in challenging scenes drawn from the largest publicly available dataset.

Automatic classifier tuning seems to be an essential component in real-time BCI systems which makes the interface more reliable and easy to use and may offer the optimum configuration of classifier. This paper investigates the robustness of Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) to classify multi-class self-paced motor imagery (MI) temporal features while tuning the hyperparameters automatically. MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were preprocessed and segmented into non-overlapped distinctive time slots. Five different temporal features were extracted to characterize various properties of three Mis. An extended version of LS-SVM was employed for feature classification while the kernel model parameters were tuned by means of two optimization techniques, Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) followed by Simplex. LS-SVM parameters were evaluated and selected through leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) cost function. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated and compared to three widely used classifiers. The results indicated the high potential of LS-SVM to classify different Mis by obtaining the average classification accuracy 89.88\u00b18.00 when using Sign Slop Changes (SSC) features. However, this LS-SVM performed slowly due to its additional steps for automatic model parameter tuning.

HOST has been optimised by regressing HOST class proportions against the Base Flow Index (BFI) and has been used to estimate catchment hydrological response and as input to land and environmental risk mapping. In this study, we performed spatial disaggregation of HOST class map unit polygons at a 1:250,000 scale in Scotland using the Random Forests (RF) classifier and selected environmental covariates to downscale HOST class mapping to 100 m grid resolution. Training datasets were developed using an area-weighted sampling scheme and by extracting HOST class information simultaneously by both single-class and multiple-class (complex) polygons by using the estimated within-polygon HOST class proportions as weights. The most-probable HOST-RF class maps along with surfaces of HOST class probability of occurrence were generated using 100 realisations from respective RF model runs each using a new training dataset. The performance of the disaggregated HOST-RF class maps for predicting catchment hydrological response was assessed by comparing BFI calculated using RF-predicted HOST class proportions with BFI calculated using flow data from gauges in 90 selected catchments. Results show that in this study using a larger number of training samples increases the risk of overfitting the RF model whereas lower sampling densities of 1 point per km2 were found to be sufficient and capable of promoting effective disaggregation of both single-class and complex polygons. Hydrological response predictions for the study catchments made with the disaggregated HOST-RF classes improved when class proportions were weighted using the generated probability surfaces and were very similar with the ones made with the original HOST class polygons, with small prediction improvements observed in the more low-lying and more slowly-responsive catchments when the HOST-RF classes were used. Overall, validation results indicate that the RF classifier was successful in predicting the spatial distribution of HOST classes in the study area, with the exception of HOST classes found within complex polygons areas dominated by soils with organic horizons of variable depth due to the difficulty of the algorithm to identify clear distinctions based on available covariate values.

Typically, these systems uncover not only oil spills, but also a high number of look-alikes. The feature extraction is a critical and computationally intensive phase where each detected dark spot is independently examined. Traditionally, detection systems use an arbitrary set of features to discriminate between oil spills and look-alikes phenomena. However, Feature Selection (FS) methods based on Machine Learning (ML) have proved to be very useful in real domains for enhancing the generalization capabilities of the classifiers, while discarding the existing irrelevant features. In this work, we present a generic and systematic approach, based on FS methods, for choosing a concise and relevant set of features to improve the oil spill detection systems. We have compared five FS methods: Correlation-based feature selection (CFS), Consistency-based filter, Information Gain, ReliefF and Recursive Feature Elimination for Support Vector Machine (SVM-RFE). They were applied on a 141-input vector composed of features from a collection of outstanding studies. Selected features were validated via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and the results were compared with previous works. Test experiments revealed that the classifier trained with the 6-input feature vector proposed by SVM-RFE achieved the best accuracy and Cohen's kappa coefficient (87.1% and 74.06% respectively). This is a smaller feature combination with similar or even better classification accuracy than previous works. The presented finding allows to speed up the feature extraction phase without reducing the classifier accuracy. Experiments also confirmed the significance of the geometrical features since 75.0% of the different features selected by the applied FS methods as well as 66.67% of the proposed 6-input feature vector belong to this category.

One-shot recognition is a visual classification task, where only one training sample is available for each object category in the target test domain, with the help of prior-knowledge data from the source domain. In this paper, we tackle this challenging one-shot recognition problem under a more exciting setting by using only unlabeled images as prior knowledge, which requires less labeling effort than previous works which adopt fully labeled data and/or a sophisticated attribute table designed by human experts. We propose a novel unsupervised hierarchical feature learning framework to learn a feature pyramid from the prior-knowledge domain.

However, each bag has only one label limits the application scope seriously. In this paper, we propose weakly supervised multi-label clustering, which allows to label a bag of data multiple labels. The key technique is a weakly supervised random forest which can calculate the model parameters with a deterministic annealing strategy to optimize the non-convex objective function.

First, a sum of 312 time series features were computed on consecutive segments of preictal EEG (simple statistical measures, linear and nonlinear measures), where some of them regard different method specific parameters. The efficiency of three methods for feature selection was assessed, i.e., the Forward Sequential Selection (FSS), Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) and a MI filter. The classification was applied first to 1000 realizations of simulated data from the Mackey\u2013Glass system at different high dimensional chaotic regimes, and next to 12 scalp early and late preictal EEG recordings of different epileptic patients (about 3 h and half an hour before the seizure onset, respectively). The optimal feature subsets selected by the three feature selection strategies for the same classification problems were found very often to have common features. Based on these feature subsets, classification with k-means partitioning as well as SVM was assessed on test sets of EEG from the same recordings. Feature subsets for each channel and episode or only episode did not classify on the test set as well as a global feature subset of a sufficiently large number of the most frequent features over all channels and episodes.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs), which capture brain neural activity, can detect epilepsy. Traditional methods for analyzing an EEG signal for epileptic seizure detection are time-consuming. Recently, several automated seizure detection frameworks using machine learning technique have been proposed to replace these traditional methods. The two basic steps involved in machine learning are feature extraction and classification. Feature extraction reduces the input pattern space by keeping informative features and the classifier assigns the appropriate class label. In this paper, we propose two effective approaches involving subpattern based PCA (SpPCA) and cross-subpattern correlation-based PCA (SubXPCA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for automated seizure detection in EEG signals. Feature extraction was performed using SpPCA and SubXPCA. Both techniques explore the subpattern correlation of EEG signals, which helps in decision-making process. SVM is used for classification of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals. The SVM was trained with radial basis kernel. All the experiments have been carried out on the benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset. The entire dataset consists of 500 EEG signals recorded under different scenarios. Seven different experimental cases for classification have been conducted.

Domains that facilitate the oligomerization process are diverse and widespread in nature across all kingdoms of life. One such domain is the Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain, which is functionally well-studied in the animal kingdom. However, beyond animals, neither the origin nor the evolutionary patterns of PB1-containing proteins are understood. While PB1 domain proteins have been found in other kingdoms including plants, it is unclear how these relate to animal PB1 proteins. To address this question, we utilized large transcriptome datasets along with the proteomes of a broad range of species. We discovered eight PB1 domain-containing protein families in plants, along with four each in Protozoa and Fungi and three families in Chromista. Studying the deep evolutionary history of PB1 domains throughout eukaryotes revealed the presence of at least two, but likely three, ancestral PB1 copies in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA). These three ancestral copies gave rise to multiple orthologues later in evolution. Analyzing the sequence and secondary structure properties of plant PB1 domains from all the eight families showed their common ubiquitin \u03b2-grasp fold, despite poor sequence identity. Tertiary structural models of these plant PB1 families, combined with Random Forest based classification, indicated family-specific differences attributed to the length of PB1 domain and the proportion of \u03b2-sheets. Thus, this study not only identifies novel PB1 families, but also provides an evolutionary basis to understand their diverse functional interactions.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7051960", "pubmed_id": "32123237", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-60733-9", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3009772693", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["45811478", "3258149", "87276494", "31215537", "10285605", "9486271", "30351947", "21814738", "18091581", "19241040", "12947741", "10111304", "24384987", "1846924", "27139234", "24206552", "25008877", "9155520", "340195", "205251975", "15076913", "30429208", "4784407", "71145896", "32353980", "25057715", "173992566", "12675229", "11849468", "37842256", "205283323", "89141", "20676402", "17447653", "16028272", "9185158", "543807", "14590473", "16191489", "10913424", "1592249", "1617323", "1669220", "3093707", "17312187"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211574188"}

In aquaculture, fish feeding behavior under culture conditions holds important information for the aquaculturist. In this study, near-infrared imaging was used to observe feeding processes of fish as a novel method for quantifying variations in fish feeding behavior. First, images of the fish feeding activity were collected using a near-infrared industrial camera installed at the top of the tank. A binary image of the fish was obtained following a series of steps such as image enhancement, background subtraction, and target extraction. Moreover, to eliminate the effects of splash and reflection on the result, a reflective frame classification and removal method based on the Support Vector Machine and Gray-Level Gradient Co-occurrence Matrix was proposed. Second, the centroid of the fish was calculated by the order moment, and then, the centroids were used as a vertex in Delaunay Triangulation. Finally, the flocking index of fish feeding behavior (FIFFB) was calculated to quantify the feeding behavior of a fish shoal according to the results of the Delaunay Triangulation, and the FIFFB values of the removed reflective frames were fitted by the Least Squares Polynomial Fitting method. The results show that variations in fish feeding behaviors can be accurately quantified and analyzed using the FIFFB values, for which the linear correlation coefficient versus expert manual scoring reached 0.945.

This technique has been proven to be effective against various code obfuscation techniques and newly released (\"zero-day\") malware. However, existing works typically only consider the API name while ignoring the arguments, or require complex feature engineering operations and expert knowledge to process the arguments. In this paper, we propose a novel and low-cost feature extraction approach, and an effective deep neural network architecture for accurate and fast malware detection. Specifically, the feature representation approach utilizes a feature hashing trick to encode the API call arguments associated with the API name. The deep neural network architecture applies multiple Gated-CNNs (convolutional neural networks) to transform the extracted features of each API call.

We present a new method for 3D SSM segmentation based on 3D Random Forest Regression Voting.

Landmark search is then conducted omni-directionally within 3D search spaces, where voxelwise forest predictions on landmark position contribute to a common voting map which reflects the overall position estimate. Segmentation experiments were conducted on a set of 45 CT volumes of the human liver, of which 40 images were randomly chosen for training and 5 for testing.

WSI images are created using a computerized system that scans, stitches and stores pathology specimen glass slides into digital images, which provide a multi-resolution pyramid construction of a huge gigabyte size due to the need for containing a high amount of tissue details. Therefore, digital WSI brings major challenges in data storage, image analysis and transmission (e.g. telepathology and interoperability). In this paper, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to detect cancer anomalies in breast lymph node WSI images under low-resolution (LR) and noise conditions. In particular, we investigate a transfer-learning approach to find the scale mappings between WSI levels using partial least-square (PLS) regression. The learned scale mappings can be used to detect anomalies in LR images and hence reduce the computational cost of anomaly detection. Then, we explore the effect of different levels of noise on detection performance. We simulated different scenarios where WSI images are contaminated with Gaussian noise and several de-noising algorithms were applied, namely de-noising with PLS, Block Matching $3D (BM3D)$ and the combination of PLS and BM3D. We show that these de-noising algorithms can help reduce the noise severity on anomaly detection. For example, for noisy images with 0.8 noise standard deviation, these three algorithms improved the LR detection accuracy from 63.50% to 93.81%, 92.73%, and 97.51%, respectively.

We assume that changes in an object's state cause a typical and reproducible change in the characteristics of the acquired sensor signal. In such cases we can train pattern recognizers basing on Hidden-Markov-Models or Support Vector Machines with data recordings of different object states and use these classifiers to assess the state of identical or similar objects.

However, Classification Data Mining (DM) Techniques can be a very useful tool in detecting and identifying e-banking phishing websites. This paper proposes two algorithms to overcome the difficulty and complexity in detecting and predicting e-banking phishing website . First approach known as Multiclass Classification based on Association Rule (MCAR) based on using association and classification Data Mining algorithms. The algorithms used to characterize and identify all the factors and rules in order to classify the phishing website and the relationship that correlate them with each other. Another approach called Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) is also a powerful classifier in which final classification is based on vote of weak classifiers. This paper proposes the modification to original MCAR algorithms with redundant rule pruning technique to reduce number of rules generated in final classifier and minimizes redundancy, hence improves the accuracy. In this paper Adaboost classifier is first time applied to detect phishing website. Results are compared with respect to time, accuracy of MCAR and Adaboost.

However, most of them put sensors on the human body and did not show experiments integrated with exoskeletons. Since the physical interaction between the exoskeleton and human body, the recognition method might be different when wearing a real exoskeleton.To deal with these problems, in this study we proposed a recognition method about STS based on the multi-sensor fusion information of interior sensors of a light-weight bionic knee exoskeleton (BioKEX). A simple classifier based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used considering the computational cost of the processing unit in exoskeleton.Copyright \u00a9 2017 by ASME", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DMD2017-3425", "venue": "2017 Design of Medical Devices Conference", "journal": "2017 Design of Medical Devices Conference", "mag_id": "2765930882", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["115204500"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196044557"}

Thus, making it essential to use automated strategies like fault based testing that can test the continuously advancing web. Fault based testing uses fault classification as a baseline to make testing cost-effective and efficient, hence making fault classification necessary. Fault classification in Web Applications is a course of action of developing models to segregate the various kinds of faults for real world fault based testing.

It focuses on detecting the decline of service quality and finding out the cause of network anomalies and repairing it with high automation. Diagnosis is a particularly important task which identifies the fault cause of problematic cells or regions. To perform the diagnosis, this paper presents two modified ensemble classifiers by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels, i.e., SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel (RBFSVM in short) and SVM with the linear kernel (LSVM in short), as component classifier in Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and we call the two ensemble classifiers as Adaptive Boosting based on RBFSVM (AdaBoostRBFSVM in short) and Adaptive Boosting based on linear kernel (AdaBoostLSVM in short). Different with previous AdaBoostSVM classifiers using weak component classifiers, in this paper, the performance of the classifiers is adaptively improved by using moderately accurate SVM classifiers (the training error is less than 50%). To solve the accuracy/diversity dilemma in AdaBoost and get good classification performance, the training error threshold is regulated to adjust the diversity of classifier, and the parameters of SVM (regularization parameter C and Gaussian width \u03c3) are changed to control the accuracy of classifier. The accuracy and diversity will be well balanced through reasonable parameter adjustment strategy. Results show that the proposed approaches outperform individual SVM approaches and show good generalization performance. The AdaBoostLSVM classifier has higher accuracy and stability than LSVM classifier. Compared with RBFSVM, the undetected rate and diagnosis error rate of AdaBoostRBFSVM decrease slightly, but the false positive rate does reduce a lot. It means that the AdaBoostRBFSVM classifier is indeed available and can greatly reduce the number of normal class samples that have been wrongly classified. Therefore, the two ensemble classifiers based on the SVM component classifier can improve the generalization performance by reasonably adjusting the parameters. To set the parameter values of component classifiers in a more reasonable and effective way, genetic algorithm is introduced to find the set of parameter values for the best classification accuracy of AdaBoostSVM, and the new ensemble classifier is called AdaboostSVM based on genetic algorithm (GA-AdaboostSVM in short) (including AdaboostLSVM based on genetic algorithm and AdaboostRBFSVM based on genetic algorithm).

Use of a dedicated positioning device incurs additional cost and reduces battery life; therefore, a range-free localization scheme is promising as a cost-effective approach. However, the main limitation of this approach is that the estimation precision can be affected by factors such as node density, sensing coverage, and topology diversity. Thus, this study investigates and proposes a method for improving a traditional range-free-based localization method (centroid) that uses soft computing approaches in a hybrid model. This model integrates a fuzzy logic system into centroid and uses an extreme learning machine (ELM) optimization technique to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches: the former is properly used with low node density and short coverage, while the latter is used for the opposite\u2014to achieve a robust location estimation scheme. The ratios of known nodes within the sensing coverage range to the total known nodes and of the sensing coverage range to the maximum coverage range are used as adaptive weights for this hybrid model. To further improve the efficiency, especially in heterogeneous topologies, the concept of resultant force vectors is applied to this hybrid model over particle swarm optimization to mitigate the effects of irregular deployments. The performance of the proposed method is extensively evaluated via simulations that demonstrate its effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art soft-computing-based range-free localization schemes (i.e., centroid, a fuzzy logic system, and a support vector machine with a traditional ELM).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2018.01.004", "venue": "Appl.

It is clear that MCI patients who exhibit subtle deficits in daily living behavior (in this study, micro-errors (MEs)) have declining cognitive function associated with cognitive impairment. Virtual reality (VR) technology has been actively utilized in rehabilitation and therapy, and here we use an application known as Virtual Kitchen (VK). In this work, we analyze how ME happens. We use finger movement data and subtask information from VK. Our methodology proposes a combination of inductive logic programming (ILP) and the sliding window algorithm. Because ILP can extract expressive rules but is susceptible to noise and memory hog, it is difficult to use sensor data directly for learning. Sliding window is used as its ability to reduce the amount of data while holding the shape of original time series data. From preliminary experiments, we obtained some rules of ME occurrence that are related to differences in speed, time interval, and subtask. We obtained results that explain how ME occurrence is generally related to subtask and finger speed.

The intelligent fault identification model of RF is established, and the fault characteristic sample set of HVDC transmission lines is constructed by using multi-scale S transform fluctuation index and multi-scale S-transform energy sum ratio.

Such degradation of performance can compromise the support of the strict quality of service requirements of the IIoT over 5G networks. Novel techniques for scheduling the elephant flows can alleviate this problem. Recently, several approaches have incorporated machine learning techniques at the controller-side in software-defined data center networks (SDDCNs) to detect elephant flows.

Various methods have been proposed for solving such problems. This paper aims in developing a methodology for acquiring the desired worm gear design configuration by altering the optimum set of worm gear design parameters which are suitable for the required performance by associating it with SVM (Support Vector Machine). An evolutionary technique like Genetic algorithm (GA) is also used along with it for optimizing the worm and worm wheel with multi objectives, the main object is to attain high wear capacity by considering module, power, velocity ratio, and speed as design parameters. Center distance and strength of worm gear are the constraints taken into consideration. Worm gears are used for transmitting power between two non-parallel, non-intersecting shafts and in applications where the speed reduction ratio is between 3:1 and 100:1 and in situations where accurate rotary indexing is required. High gear ratios of 200:1 can also be obtained. In the evaluation of worm and worm gear designs, certain basic gear design performance metrics such as tooth bending stress, contact stress, surface fatigue strength, allowable surface fatigue stress, tooth surface strength of gear and pinion etc. are to be carefully considered. The effectiveness of the gear design can be improved only when all these metrics are controlled properly. Despite attempts by several gear designers to improve the efficiency of the gears, the control of all these metrics and achieving a desired performance is a very complicated task. In this paper, an attempt is made to develop a prediction model based on SVM that maps the gear design parameters such as module, velocity ratio, power, speed, etc. with gear design performance metrics. The benefit of such prediction model is a significant reduction in processing time as well as enhanced flexibility in the development of worm gear designs. Yet another problem is however faced by the designer in terms of arriving at the right combination of design parameters in order to achieve a required performance metrics. Currently, this task is highly dependent upon designer expertise.

A pure learning approach addresses this issue by including texture patterns at all scales in the training dataset. This approach makes the construction of an expert system quite costly and unrealistic given the large variations in real-world texture scales and patterns. We propose a transfer learning approach where the full range of texture scales is available only for a small subset of the texture classes. Such a subset is used to learn the scaling map through partial least-square regression or coupled dictionary learning. Experimental results on classifiers equipped with the learned maps show promising reduction in training data scale variability with little degradation in classification accuracy compared to the data-intensive pure learning approach.

It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.05.031", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "2953121833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209542272"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197577094"}

However, it is difficult to make instance-based learning noise tolerant and noise reduction still plays an important role in k-nearest neighbour classification. There are also other motivations for noise reduction, for instance the elimination of noise may result in simpler models or data cleansing may be an end in itself. In this paper we present a novel approach to noise reduction based on local Support Vector Machines (LSVM) which brings the benefits of maximal margin classifiers to bear on noise reduction. This provides a more robust alternative to the majority rule on which almost all the existing noise reduction techniques are based. Roughly speaking, for each training example an SVM is trained on its neighbourhood and if the SVM classification for the central example disagrees with its actual class there is evidence in favour of removing it from the training set. We provide an empirical evaluation on 15 real datasets showing improved classification accuracy when using training data edited with our method as well as specific experiments regarding the spam filtering application domain. We present a further evaluation on two artificial datasets where we analyse two different types of noise (Gaussian feature noise and mislabelling noise) and the influence of different class densities.

This learning setting is more computationally challenging than attribute-value learning and a natural fit for important application areas of machine learning such as classification of molecules and image classification. One approach to solve multi-instance learning problems is to apply propositionalisation, where bags of data are converted into vectors of attribute-value pairs so that a standard propositional (i.e. attribute-value) learning algorithm can be applied. This approach is attractive because of the large number of propositional learning algorithms that have been developed and can thus be applied to the propositionalised data. In this paper, we empirically investigate a variant of an existing propositionalisation method called TLC. TLC uses a single decision tree to obtain propositionalised data. Our variant applies a random forest instead and is motivated by the potential increase in robustness that this may yield.

We carefully design the scale-aware network to predict pedestrians of particular scales using most appropriate feature maps, by matching their receptive field with the target sizes. The human parsing network generates a fine-grained attentional map which helps guide the detector to focus on the visible parts of occluded pedestrians and small-size instances.

However, existing models can only be capable of transferring the low-level information (e.g. color or texture changes), but fail to edit high-level semantic meanings (e.g., geometric structure or content) of objects. On the other hand, while some researches can synthesize compelling real-world images given a class label or caption, they cannot condition on arbitrary shapes or structures, which largely limits their application scenarios and interpretive capability of model results. In this work, we focus on a more challenging semantic manipulation task, which aims to modify the semantic meaning of an object while preserving its own characteristics (e.g. viewpoints and shapes), such as cow$\\rightarrow$sheep, motor$\\rightarrow$ bicycle, cat$\\rightarrow$dog. To tackle such large semantic changes, we introduce a contrasting GAN (contrast-GAN) with a novel adversarial contrasting objective. Instead of directly making the synthesized samples close to target data as previous GANs did, our adversarial contrasting objective optimizes over the distance comparisons between samples, that is, enforcing the manipulated data be semantically closer to the real data with target category than the input data.

Second, computes scalar measures of the registration's deformation field. Third, performs across volume statistical group analysis of these scalar measures to detect effects. In this paper we use the scalar deformation measures for Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for AD. Specifically this paper deals with feature extraction methods over five such scalar measures. We evaluate three supervised feature selection methods based on voxel site significance measures given by Pearson correlation, Bhattacharyya distance and Welch's t-test, respectively.

Machine learning techniques are dependent on large amount of data in order to predict outcomes. However, underutilised crops are, by definition, not cultivated on a large commercial scale causes the scarcity of training data for this application. In this proposed framework, SVM is implemented in conjunction with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and associated fitness functions to generate training data for the SVM from approximate models developed for normal cash crops. Approximate models are used in Genetic Algorithm as fitness function to generate synthetic data. Synthetic data generated is used to train Support Vector Machine. Experiments are designed to compare synthetic data from actual models and data generated from approximate models. Model and real data from World Bank is also used to validate the proposed framework. Finally, synthetic data generated from approximate farm income models for crop are tested against the real village data obtained from Crops For the Future Research Centre. The result shows that good classification is attainable in spite of the inaccuracy that existed in the training data from an approximate model and artificially generated through Genetic Algorithm which includes constraints that reflect physical conditions found in rural villages.

However, the solution of unified ELM is dense, and thus, usually plenty of storage space and testing time are required for large-scale applications. In this paper, a sparse ELM is proposed as an alternative solution for classification, reducing storage space and testing time. In addition, unified ELM obtains the solution by matrix inversion, whose computational complexity is between quadratic and cubic with respect to the training size. It still requires plenty of training time for large-scale problems, even though it is much faster than many other traditional methods. In this paper, an efficient training algorithm is specifically developed for sparse ELM. The quadratic programming problem involved in sparse ELM is divided into a series of smallest possible sub-problems, each of which are solved analytically.

In this study, we propose a piecewise EVI time-series smoothing method to fit irregular time profiles, especially for crop rotation situations. Global EVI time-series were divided into several temporal segments, from which phenological metrics could be derived. This method was applied to Lixian, where crop rotation was the common practice of growing different types of crops, in the same plot, in sequenced seasons. After collection of phenological features and multi-temporal spectral information, Random Forest (RF) was performed to classify crop types, and the overall accuracy was 93.27%. Moreover, an analysis of feature significance showed that phenological features were of greater importance for distinguishing agricultural land cover compared to temporal spectral information.

Prediction of disordered regions in proteins can provide useful information for understanding protein function and for high-throughput determination of protein structures.ResultsIn this paper, algorithms are presented to predict long and short disordered regions in proteins, namely the long disordered region prediction algorithm DRaai-L and the short disordered region prediction algorithm DRaai-S. These algorithms are developed based on the Random Forest machine learning model and the profiles of amino acid indices representing various physiochemical and biochemical properties of the 20 amino acids.ConclusionExperiments on DisProt3.6 and CASP7 demonstrate that some sets of the amino acid indices have strong association with the ordered and disordered status of residues. Our algorithms based on the profiles of these amino acid indices as input features to predict disordered regions in proteins outperform that based on amino acid composition and reduced amino acid composition, and also outperform many existing algorithms.

To this end, we train Generative Adversarial Networks at the largest scale yet attempted, and study the instabilities specific to such scale. We find that applying orthogonal regularization to the generator renders it amenable to a simple \"truncation trick,\" allowing fine control over the trade-off between sample fidelity and variety by reducing the variance of the Generator's input. Our modifications lead to models which set the new state of the art in class-conditional image synthesis. When trained on ImageNet at 128x128 resolution, our models (BigGANs) achieve an Inception Score (IS) of 166.5 and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.4, improving over the previous best IS of 52.52

Although they have many attractive features interpretation of their solutions is quite difficult, the use of a single kernel type may not be appropriate in all areas of the input space, convergence problems for some kernels are not uncommon, the standard quadratic programming solution has O(m3) time and O(m2) space complexity for m training patterns. Kernel methods work because they implicitly provide new, useful features.

Currently most available glioma datasets are relatively moderate in size, and often accompanied with incomplete MRIs in different modalities. To tackle the commonly encountered problems of insufficiently large brain tumor datasets and incomplete modality of image for deep learning, we propose to add augmented brain MR images to enlarge the training dataset by employing a pairwise Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The pairwise GAN is able to generate synthetic MRIs across different modalities. To achieve the patient-level diagnostic result, we propose a post-processing strategy to combine the slice-level glioma subtype classification results by majority voting. A two-stage course-to-fine training strategy is proposed to learn the glioma feature using GAN-augmented MRIs followed by real MRIs. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, experiments have been conducted on a brain tumor dataset for classifying glioma molecular subtypes: isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation and IDH1 wild-type.

This system can recognize hand gestures at any position on the steering wheel by utilizing 120 infrared (IR) sensors embedded in it. The sensors are lined up in an array surrounding the whole wheel.

Accordingly, trends to collect, access, and deliver information have changed over the Web. Such changes raised the problems of information retrieval. Search engines retrieve requested information based on the provided keywords which is not an efficient way for rich information retrieval. Consequently, the fetching of the required information is difficult without understanding the syntax and semantics of the content. The multiple existing approaches to resolve this problem by exploiting linked data and semantic Web techniques. Such approaches serialize the content leveraging the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and process the queries using SPARQL to resolve the problem. However, an exact match between RDF content and query structure is required. Although it improves the keyword-based search, it does not provide probabilistic reasoning to find the relationship accuracy between the query and results. In this perspective, this paper proposes a machine learning (random forest) based approach to predict the fetching status of RDF by treating RDFs\u2019 requests as a classification problem. First, we preprocess the RDF to convert them into N-Triples format. Then, a feature vector is constructed for each RDF using the preprocessed RDF. After that, a random forest classifier is trained for the prediction of the fetching status of RDFs. The proposed approach is evaluated on an open-source DBpedia dataset.

One simple example could be how people today buy a mobile phone. If in the past, shopping involved moving from one store to the other, these days one cares more about the opinions expressed by people in product reviews rather. There is an increasing tendency to leave one's opinion(s) on a product, service or any entity on the web thus opening doors for an interesting yet challenging field of Sentiment Analysis. Much work has been done in the last decade on Sentiment Analysis not surprisingly for English because of the availability of a large number of resources but other languages are also gradually taking pace, some of them already in advanced stages and already developing competing resources and applications compared to English. Nepali opinionated content is also increasing rapidly in the last few years. Nepal fares as one of the countries with the highest number of Facebook subscribers. Online presence and voicing one's opinion in the Internet through different social media platforms has become a norm both for individuals or businesses. Nepali is a morphologically rich, under-resourced and a free word order language. Although some works related to the language and technology have been done in the past by institutions like Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya1 and Language Technology Kendra2, Nepali still remains an under-resourced language as it has very few tools and annotated corpus available for the language. This makes it challenging and difficult to do any linguistic computational works in the language including Sentiment Analysis. In this work, we look into applying three Machine Learning classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for developing a model to classify book and movie reviews written in Nepali into \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cNegative\u201d.

In this work, we propose a novel terrain classification framework leveraging an unsupervised proprioceptive classifier that learns from vehicle-terrain interaction sounds to self-supervise an exteroceptive classifier for pixel-wise semantic segmentation of images. To this end, we first learn a discriminative embedding space for vehicle-terrain interaction sounds from triplets of audio clips formed using visual features of the corresponding terrain patches and cluster the resulting embeddings.

It analyzes the particular properties of learning with text data and identifies why SVMs are appropriate for this task. Empirical results support the theoretical findings. SVMs achieve substantial improvements over the currently best performing methods and behave robustly over a variety of different learning tasks. Furthermore they are fully automatic, eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning.", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi":

The best features have been used to perform the classification of dark patches by means of two-class and one-class approaches. A number of one-class and two-class classification techniques have been considered: Linear discriminants, 1-Nearest Neighbour, Mixture of Gaussians, Parzen Windows and the Support Vector Machines. Better results have been achieved using the one-class methods. The dataset has been extracted from a set of SAR images acquired by an airborne X band SAR system mounted on board of a Laerjet 35A, during the Galitia Mission in January-February 2003 (TELAER Consortium), after the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker. 1 INTRODUCTION Oil spill detection by means of SAR images is possible because of the damping effect of the short wind waves caused by the presence of oil on the sea surface [1-2]. As a consequence, an oil spill is physically a dark patch in SAR images [1-2]. The sea radar image is a representation of the backscatter return, and the intensity of the pixel is proportional to the surface roughness at the scale of radar wavelength (Bragg scattering) [3]. The radar backscatter coefficient is a function of the viewing geometry of the SAR [3]. The b with the increase of the ackscatter coefficient decreasesincidence angle, and the scattering properties of a material depend on the polarization of the incoming radar signal [3]. The contrast between an oil spill and its surroundings depends on a number of parameters as the height of the waves, the amount of oil that has been released, the speed of the wind, etc [1-2]. The shape of the oil spill depends on a number of factors as whether the oil was released from a stationary object or from a moving ship, the amount of oil involved, the speed of the wind, and the current history in the time interval between the oil release and the acquisition of the image [4]. Unfortunately, several natural and atmospheric phenomena produce dark areas in SAR images similar to oil spills. These dark areas are usually referred to as look-alikes, whose presence makes the detection of oil spills a challenging task [1-2]. Oil spills may include all oil-related surface films caused by oil spills from oilrigs, leaking pipelines, passing vessels, while look-alikes include natural films, grease ice, threshold wind speed areas (<3 m/s), rain cells, etc. Oil spills are only man-made slicks due to crude petroleum and its products [1-2].

To fully decipher the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination-related biological processes, an initial but crucial step is the recognition of ubiquitylated substrates and the corresponding ubiquitination sites. Here, a new bioinformatics tool named CKSAAP_UbSite was developed to predict ubiquitination sites from protein sequences. With the assistance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), the highlight of CKSAAP_UbSite is to employ the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs surrounding a query site (i.e. any lysine in a query sequence) as input. When trained and tested in the dataset of yeast ubiquitination sites (Radivojac et al, Proteins, 2010, 78: 365\u2013380), a 100-fold cross-validation on a 1\u22361 ratio of positive and negative samples revealed that the accuracy and MCC of CKSAAP_UbSite reached 73.40% and 0.4694, respectively. The proposed CKSAAP_UbSite has also been intensively benchmarked to exhibit better performance than some existing predictors, suggesting that it can be served as a useful tool to the community.

Mostly, fusion techniques have used feature-level information extracted from spatial or transform domain. In contrast, we have proposed a random forest (RF)-based novel scheme that has incorporated feature and decision levels information. In the proposed scheme, useful features are extracted from both spatial and transform domains. These features are used to train randomly generated trees of RF algorithm. The predicted information of trees is aggregated to construct more accurate decision map for fusion.

As people become educated as to which domains Expert Systems technology can be appropriately utilized and to what extent this capability can be made useful, they will want to extend this ability to encompass greater responsibilities of their everyday routines. Knowledge Acquisition is one of the most time-consuming phases of an Expert System development process. One must extract the essential knowledge from a source by whatever means, and transform this knowledge into a representation that can be demonstrated. Rule Induction is one technique that can be applied to the knowledge acquisition process for certain example-based problems. Spread Sheets and Data Bases for example, may contain columns of information (criteria) to be used in some sort of decision making policy. These criteria could automatically be converted (represented) into production rules that output an appropriate decision dependent upon a given set of criteria. To generalize this concept, we could state that Rule Induction is the process of generating a Knowledge Base from a given set of examples.

On the other hand, LoLiMoT almost always leads to acceptable output error, but it often needs more rules. ::: In this paper, to exploit the complimentary performance of both algorithms piecewise linear model tree (PiLiMoT) learning algorithm is introduced. In essence, PiLiMoT is a combination of LoLiMoT and PLN learning. The initially proposed algorithm is improved by adding the ability to merge previously divided local linear models, and utilizing a simulated annealing stochastic decision process to select a local model for splitting. Comparing to LoLiMoT and PLN learning, our proposed improved learning algorithm shows the ability to construct models with less number of rules at comparable modeling errors.

There is also a very active research community working on the symbolic (logical) characterisation of abduction, which typically treats it as a form of hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In this paper we start to bridge the gap between the symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches to abduction. We are interested in benefiting from developments made by each community. In particular, we are interested in the ability of non-symbolic systems (neural networks) to learn from experience using efficient algorithms and to perform massively parallel computations of alternative abductive explanations. At the same time, we would like to benefit from the rigour and semantic clarity of symbolic logic. We present two approaches to dealing with abduction in neural networks. One of them uses Connectionist Modal Logic and a translation of Horn clauses into modal clauses to come up with a neural network ensemble that computes abductive explanations in a top-down fashion. The other combines neural-symbolic systems and abductive logic programming and proposes a neural architecture which performs a more systematic, bottom-up computation of alternative abductive explanations. Both approaches employ standard neural network architectures which are already known to be highly effective in practical learning applications. Differently from previous work in the area, our aim is to promote the integration of reasoning and learning in a way that the neural network provides the machinery for cognitive computation, inductive learning and hypothetical reasoning, while logic provides the rigour and explanation capability to the systems, facilitating the interaction with the outside world. Although it is left as future work to determine whether the structure of one of the proposed approaches is more amenable to learning than the other, we hope to have contributed to the development of the area by approaching it from the perspective of symbolic and sub-symbolic integration.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11245-006-9005-5", "venue": null, "journal": "Topoi", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1973144381", "mag_field_of_study": ["Philosophy"], "outbound_citations": ["27333603", "2424981", "12827877", "212974", "3043299", "1572948", "35126618", "1553638", "23725491", "18462824", "62245742", "209396626", "14897453", "15506290", "58270995", "2489891", "45629089"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18729429"}

To address this, this paper presents a new graph learning-based multi-view clustering approach, which for the first time, to our knowledge, simultaneously and explicitly formulates the multi-view consistency and the multi-view inconsistency in a unified optimization model. To solve this model, a new alternating optimization scheme is designed, where the consistent and inconsistent parts of each single-view graph as well as the unified graph that fuses the consistent parts of all views can be iteratively learned. It is noteworthy that our multi-view graph learning model is applicable to both similarity graphs and dissimilarity graphs, leading to two graph fusion-based variants, namely, distance (dissimilarity) graph fusion and similarity graph fusion.

In addition to labelled data, co-regularisation includes information from unlabelled examples by ensuring that models trained on different views make similar predictions. Ligand affinity prediction is an important real-world problem that fits into this scenario. The characterisation of the strength of protein-ligand bonds is a crucial step in the process of drug discovery and design.

To address this problem, we proposed a predictor called iPPBS-PseAAC, in which each amino acid residue site of the proteins concerned was treated as a 15-tuple peptide segment generated by sliding a window along the protein chains with its center aligned with the target residue. The working peptide segment is further formulated by a general form of pseudo amino acid composition via the following procedures: (1) it is converted into a numerical series via the physicochemical properties of amino acids; (2) the numerical series is subsequently converted into a 20-D feature vector by means of the stationary wavelet transform technique. Formed by many individual \"Random Forest\" classifiers, the operation engine to run prediction is a two-layer ensemble classifier, with the 1st-layer voting out the best training data-set from many bootstrap systems and the 2nd-layer voting out the most relevant one from seven physicochemical properties. Cross-validation tests indicate that the new predictor is very promising, meaning that many important key features, which are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences, can be extracted via the wavelets transform approach, quite consistent with the facts that many important biological functions of proteins can be elucidated with their low-frequency internal motions.

NVSE is also an unsupervised learning method, but it is based on the Variational Autoencoder framework. Evaluations with human annotators show that NVSE can facilitate better search and recommendation of information gathered from noisy, automatic annotation of unstructured natural language corpora.

Therefore, the multi temporal SAR images owning a lot of phenology information of land cover are the potential ideal data source for land cover mapping, in particular in the urban area. In this article, the authors present a new approach to the classification of land cover by using multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data. The experience data are single-pole (VV) in Interferometric Wide Swath mode (IW) collected from December 2014 to October 2015 along descending orbit over Hanoi, Vietnam. Decision tree method is applied base on analyzing threshold of standard deviation, mean backscatter value of land cover patterns, and combining double-crop rice classification image. The double-crop rice image is classified by rice phenology using multi-temporal Sentinel-1A images. The threshold in decision tree method is analyzed by field surveying data. The resulting classified image has been assessed using the test points in high-resolution images of Google Earth and field data. The accuracy of proposed method achieved 84.7%. References Abdalla M.

This is a challenging problem due to a limited number of pixels on target, which makes it more difficult to distinguish objects from background clutter, and results in much larger search space. We propose a method for constraining the search based on a number of geometric constraints obtained from the metadata. Specifically, we obtain the orientation of ground plane normal, the orientation of shadows cast by out of plane objects in the scene, and the relationship between object heights and the size of their corresponding shadows. We use the aforementioned information in a geometry-based shadow, and ground-plane normal blob detector, which provides an initial estimation for locations of shadow casting out of plane (SCOOP) objects in the scene. These SCOOP candidate locations are then classified as either human or clutter using a combination of wavelet features and a Support Vector Machine. To detect vehicles, we similarly find potential vehicle candidates by combining SCOOP and inverted-SCOOP candidates and then classify them using wavelet features and SVM. Our method works on a single frame, and unlike motion detection based methods, it bypasses the entire pipeline of registration, motion detection, and tracking. This method allows for detection of stationary and slowly moving humans and vehicles while avoiding the search across the entire image, allowing accurate and fast localization.

Utilizing these species responses in multi-disciplinary climate-avian-forest modeling can improve climate adaptive management. We propose a framework for integrating and evaluating climate-avian-forest models by linking two ACN niche models with a forest landscape model (FLM), LANDIS-II. The framework facilitates the selection of available ACN models for integration, evaluation of model transferability, and evaluation of successful integration of ACN models with a FLM. We found selecting a model for integration depended on its transferability to the study area (Northern Rockies Ecoregion of Idaho in the United States), which limited the species and model types available for transfer. However, transfer evaluation of the tested ACN models indicated a good fit for the study area. Several niche model variables (canopy cover, snag density, and forest cover type) were not directly informed by the LANDIS-II model, which required secondary modeling (Random Forest) to derive values from the FLM outputs. In instances where the Random Forest models performed with a moderate classification accuracy, the overall effect on niche predictions was negligible. Predictions based on LANDIS-II simulations performed similarly to predictions based on the niche model\u2019s original training input types. This supported the conclusion that the proposed framework is viable for informing avian niche models with FLM simulations. Even models that poorly approximate habitat suitability, due to the inherent constraints of predicting spatial niche use of irruptive species produced informative results by identifying areas of management focus. This is primarily because LANDIS-II estimates spatially explicit variables that were unavailable over large spatial extents from alternative datasets. Thus, without integration, one of the ACN niche models was not applicable to the study area. The framework will be useful for integrating avifauna niche and forest ecosystem models, which can inform management of contemporary and future landscapes under differing management and climate scenarios.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6555514", "pubmed_id": "31173586", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0217299", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2948731380", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52065136", "1325332", "86465818", "4697238", "18748024", "73572413", "53062388", "86844668", "86364503", "10719469", "83762377", "132553236", "215357570", "85370682", "131794528", "85306695", "85597688", "84154673", "86683487", "89141", "83666790", "86412385", "17255578", "84589252", "19019299", "14936025", "84901519", "4559362", "56408774", "82524921", "84956555", "153568249", "83921849", "54499103", "3626971", "42039311", "32458922", "5616190", "90025491", "89909854", "36810442", "84407748", "8376439", "55190735", "82410920", "83581725", "45625094", "88759950"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182951074"}

In searching for document representation that is more suited for SVM, we first conduct a thorough empirical study on how various document representation methods influence the performance of two-class SVM on text categorization. We then investigate the issues in using standard term-weighting document representation schemes with one-class SVM, which not only results in better document representation for one-class SVM but also reveals insights into the internal structure of binary classification problems converted from multi-class problems in one-versus-rest fashion. To improve SVM for text categorization, we introduce a \u03bc\u03bd-SVM formulation, which allows for intuitive model selection for problems with highly imbalanced datasets like text categorization. This formulation greatly reduces the need for expensive cross-validation. We also motivate the weighted-margin SVM formulation, which makes predictions based on both the evidence embedded in training examples and prior knowledge in form of the weak prediction rules. By integrating the keyword-based weak prediction rules, the need for larger labeled datasets can be greatly reduce.

This is particularly of interest in Canada because it contains approximately one-fourth of the total global wetlands. In this study, the spectral separability of five wetland classes, namely Bog, Fen, Marsh, Swamp, and Shallow Water, was investigated in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada, using field data and multi-source optical Remote Sensing (RS) images. The objective was to select the most useful spectral bands for wetland studies from four commonly used optical satellites: RapidEye, Sentinel 2A, ASTER, and Landsat 8. However, because the ultimate objective was the classification of wetlands in the province, the separability of wetland classes was also evaluated using several other features, including various spectral indices, as well as textural and ratio features to obtain a high level of classification accuracy. For this purpose, two separability measures were used: The T-statistics, calculated from the parametric t-test method, and the U-statistics, derived from the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. The results indicated that the Near Infrared (NIR) band was the best followed by the Red Edge (RE) band for the discrimination of wetland class pairs. The red band was also the third most useful band for separation of wetland classes, especially for the delineation of the Bog class from the other types. Although the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) and green bands demonstrated poor separability, they were comparatively more informative than the Thermal Infrared (TIR) and blue bands. This study also demonstrated that ratio features and some spectral indices had high potential to differentiate the wetland species. Finally, wetlands in five study areas in NL were classified by inserting the best spectral bands and features into an object-based Random Forest (RF) classifier. By doing so, the mean Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient in the study areas were 86% and 0.82, respectively.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.07.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2884352191", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["196947425", "140119111", "155117478"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125367094"}

At the same time, with the wide deployment of wireless local area network (WLAN) and general support of the IEEE 802.11 protocol by various mobile devices, the target intrusion sensing can be realized based on the existing WLAN infrastructure without requiring the target to carry any special device. However, the existing indoor WLAN target intrusion sensing approaches usually depend on the radio map construction with huge labor and time cost, which is the major barrier of current systems. In response to this compelling problem, we propose the new ray-aided generative adversarial model (RaGAM) to automatically construct the radio map, which is used for the indoor WLAN intelligent target intrusion sensing and localization. To achieve the low labor and time cost, the RaGAM uses the adaptive-depth ray tree based the quasi three-dimensional ray-tracing model to depict the difference of WLAN signals between the silence and intrusion environments with the purpose of constructing the synthetic radio map. Considering the gap between the synthetic and actual radio maps, we modify the conventional generative adversarial network by the joint synthetic and unsupervised learning (or called S+U learning) from the actual unlabeled received signal strength (RSS) data to improve the precision of the proposed ray-tracing model, and consequently obtain the refined radio map. After that, the statistical characteristics of the refined radio map are utilized to construct the training set for the probabilistic neural network (PNN), and then by using the well-trained PNN to classify the newly collected RSS data, the target intrusion sensing, and localization are achieved. The experimental results show that the proposed approach cannot only perform well in terms of computation cost and the ray-tracing accuracy, but also sense the target intrusion states accurately.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TETCI.2019.2892748", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3001038584", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17332828", "120577957", "71685271", "13057745", "49315475", "207165124", "27654456", "13732702", "17097793", "780257", "123101719", "121193111", "24523335", "19647306", "8229065", "14360155", "763200", "195866450", "35126225", "8699669", "121878160", "28182474", "3492968", "140652307", "21308051", "3492968"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210971892"}

During exploration, geologists could encounter an unknown rock and instead of having to bring back the sample to the laboratory for analysis, a better approach would be to have a mobile device classify the image of a rock. As well, instead of waiting a long time for a planetary rover to send back an image to Earth for classification, its on-board computer could have a software that could automatically classify images of outcrops. In 2017, Shu et. al. used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm to classify uniform rock images into 9 different classes with the image features extracted autonomously. Through this method, they achieved a classification accuracy of 96.71%. Recent publications have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform better than other algorithms in classifying images of everyday objects, more specifically for the ImageNet dataset. In light of this development, this paper demonstrates the use of CNNs to classify the same set of rock images.

In this paper, we explore classification of laser-beam images from the National Ignition Facility (NIF) using a novel deeplearning approach. NIF is the world\u2019s largest, most energetic laser. It has nearly 40,000 optics that precisely guide, reflect, amplify, and focus 192 laser beams onto a fusion target. NIF utilizes four petawatt lasers called the Advanced Radiographic Capability (ARC) to produce backlighting X-ray illumination to capture implosion dynamics of NIF experiments with picosecond temporal resolution. In the current operational configuration, four independent short-pulse ARC beams are created and combined in a split-beam configuration in each of two NIF apertures at the entry of the pre-amplifier. The subaperture beams then propagate through the NIF beampath up to the ARC compressor. Each ARC beamlet is separately compressed with a dedicated set of four gratings and recombined as sub-apertures for transport to the parabola vessel, where the beams are focused using parabolic mirrors and pointed to the target. Small angular errors in the compressor gratings can cause the sub-aperture beams to diverge from one another and prevent accurate alignment through the transport section between the compressor and parabolic mirrors. This is an off-normal condition that must be detected and corrected. The goal of the off-normal check is to determine whether the ARC beamlets are sufficiently overlapped into a merged single spot or diverged into two distinct spots. Thus, the objective of the current work is three-fold: developing a simple algorithm to perform off-normal classification, exploring the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the same task, and understanding the inter-relationship of the two approaches. The CNN recognition results are compared with other machine-learning approaches, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results show around 96% classification accuracy using CNN; the CNN approach also provides comparable recognition results compared to the present feature-based off-normal detection.

This leads to an inhibition of normal host-cell functions. Further elucidation of phosphorylation in virus proteins is required in order to aid in drug design and treatment. However, only a few studies have investigated substrate motifs in identifying virus phosphorylation sites. Additionally, existing bioinformatics tool do not consider potential host kinases that may initiate the phosphorylation of a virus protein.Results329 experimentally verified phosphorylation fragments on 111 virus proteins were collected from virPTM. These were clustered into subgroups of significantly conserved motifs using a recursively statistical method. Two-layered Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were then applied to train a predictive model for the identified substrate motifs. The SVM models were evaluated using a five-fold cross validation which yields an average accuracy of 0.86 for serine, and 0.81 for threonine. Furthermore, the proposed method is shown to perform at par with three other phosphorylation site prediction tools: PPSP, KinasePhos 2.0 and GPS 2.1.ConclusionIn this study, we propose a computational method, ViralPhos, which aims to investigate virus substrate site motifs and identify potential phosphorylation sites on virus proteins. We identified informative substrate motifs that matched with several well-studied kinase groups as potential catalytic kinases for virus protein substrates.

The tracker aims to find the most possible position of the target by jointly classifying the pixels and superpixels and obtaining the best configuration across all levels. The motion of the bounding box is taken into consideration, while Online Random Forests are used to provide pixel- and superpixel-level quantizations and progressively updated on-the-fly.

We propose a direct latent fingerprint reconstruction model based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). Two modifications are applied to the cGAN to adapt it for the task of latent fingerprint reconstruction. First, the model is forced to generate three additional maps to the ridge map to ensure that the orientation and frequency information is considered in the generation process, and prevent the model from filling large missing areas and generating erroneous minutiae. Second, a perceptual ID preservation approach is developed to force the generator to preserve the ID information during the reconstruction process. Using a synthetically generated database of latent fingerprints, the deep network learns to predict missing information from the input latent samples. We evaluate the proposed method in combination with two different fingerprint matching algorithms on several publicly available latent fingerprint datasets. We achieved the rank-10 accuracy of 88.02\\% on the IIIT-Delhi latent fingerprint database for the task of latent-to-latent matching and rank-50 accuracy of 70.89\\% on the IIIT-Delhi MOLF database for the task of latent-to-sensor matching.

The experience of the group composed of masonry instructors and master masons averaged five times that of the other groups, their productivity was highest, and the loads on their joints were the lowest. Thus, they were deemed experts in this paper. Inertial measurement units (IMU) and video cameras were used to collect kinematic data of the masons, from which pose clusters were identified. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify masons' poses into expert and inexpert classes based on the relative frequency of poses in the motions used to lay each of 945 masonry units. Two classification scenarios were tested. While both scenarios achieved similar levels of accuracy, 91.23% and 92.04% respectively, the processing time for binary classification was only 13 s compared to 523 s for inter-group multiclass SVM. Like characteristic vibration frequencies in machine diagnostics and system identification, the characteristic poses identified provide insight into differing methods between expert and less experienced masons. For example, results show that experts utilize fewer and more ergonomicaly safe poses, while being more productive, which indicates lower energy expenditure (less wasted motions). The classification method and the poses identified contribute knowledge to help develop affordable mason training systems that utilize IMU and video feedback to improve health and productivity of apprentice masons.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.022", "venue": null, "journal": "Automation in Construction", "mag_id": "2761048929", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["165161578", "165162883", "129941422"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116463075"}

Apart from previous colon registration approaches based on global geometric information [1-4], this paper presents a feature selection and metric distance learning approach to build a pairwise matching function (where true pairs of polyp detections have smaller distances than false pairs), learned using local polyp classification features [5-7]. Thus our process can seamlessly handle collapsed colon segments or other severe structural artifacts which often exist in CTC, since only local features are used, whereas other global geometry dependent methods may become invalid for collapsed segmentation cases. Our automatic approach is extensively evaluated using a large multi-site dataset of 195 patient cases in training and 223 cases for testing.

However, selection of support vectors and intensive optimization of kernel width of a nonlinear SVM are inclined to get trapped into local optima, leading to an increased risk of underfitting or overfitting. To overcome these problems, a new nonlinear SVM algorithm is proposed using adaptive kernel transform based on a radial basis function network (RBFN) as optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The new algorithm incorporates a nonlinear transform of the original variables to feature space via a RBFN with one input and one hidden layer. Such a transform intrinsically yields a kernel transform of the original variables. A synergetic optimization of all parameters including kernel centers and kernel widths as well as SVM model coefficients using PSO enables the determination of a flexible kernel transform according to the performance of the total model. The implementation of PSO demonstrates a relatively high efficiency in convergence to a desired optimum. Applications of the proposed algorithm to QSAR studies of binding affinity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and activity of 1-phenylbenzimidazoles reveal that the new algorithm provides superior performance to the backpropagation neural network and a conventional nonlinear SVM, indicating that this algorithm holds great promise in nonlinear SVM learning.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17555309", "doi": "10.1021/ci700047x", "venue": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1986299774", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "28637672", "662987", "8995155", "9259468", "2814829", "16950792", "42339321", "9288920", "16225700", "118224933", "7367791", "16708577", "57833740", "8086214", "197095860", "25915420", "41407651", "35099221", "3000281", "25652594", "98227802", "24945938", "8228381"], "inbound_citations": ["62759960", "4687856", "18573735", "12176835", "28384108", "18574980", "77394144", "5459445", "120189807", "30024184", "53365281", "53365281"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15144258"}

However, this technique is not efficient enough to be used in applications with real world demands due to the time that the agent needs to learn. This paper investigates the use of Transfer Learning (TL) between agents to speed up the well-known Q-learning Reinforcement Learning algorithm. The new approach presented here allows the use of cases in a case base as heuristics to speed up the Q-learning algorithm, combining Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning (HARL) techniques.

Generally, due to the scale and complexity of modern networks, traditional methods are gradually losing the analytic efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, it is imperative to design a network analysis model which caters to the massive amount of data and learns more comprehensive information from networks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, namely Deep Isomorphic Substructure Learning (DISL) model, which aims to learn network representations from patterns with isomorphic substructures. Specifically, in DISL, deep learning techniques are used to learn a better network representation for each vertex (node). We provide the method that makes the isomorphic units self-embed into vertex-based subgraphs whose explicit topologies are extracted from raw graph-structured data, and design a Probability-guided Random Walk (PRW) procedure to explore the set of substructures. Sequential samples yielded by PRW provide the information of relational similarity, which integrates the information of correlation and co-occurrence of vertices and the information of substructural isomorphism of subgraphs. We maximize the likelihood of the preserved relationships for learning the implicit similarity knowledge. The architecture of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is redesigned for simultaneously processing the explicit and implicit features to learn a more comprehensive representation for networks. The DISL model is applied to several vertex classification tasks for social networks.

Our motivation is that a suitable feature representation for image aesthetic assessment should be able to distinguish different expert-designed image manipulations, which have close relationships with negative aesthetic effects. To this end, we design two novel pretext tasks to identify the types and parameters of editing operations applied to synthetic instances. The features from our pretext tasks are then adapted for a one-layer linear classifier to evaluate the performance in terms of binary aesthetic classification. We conduct extensive quantitative experiments on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approach can faithfully extract aesthetics-aware features and outperform alternative pretext schemes.

In this paper we focus on one incrasingly common appliance in the european homes: the bread-maker. There are a number of satisfaction parameters which can be specified by the user: crustiness, fragance, baking finish, and softness. A bread making recipe is composed mainly of the temperatures and times for each of the baking stages: first leavening, second leavening, precooking, cooking and browning. Although a thoroughful real life experimentation and data collection is being carried out by project partners, there are no data available for training/testing yet. Thus, in order to test out ideas we must resort to synthetic data generated using a very abstract model of the satisfaction parameters resulting from a given recipe. The recommendation in this context is carried by a couple of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) regression models trained to predict the satisfaction parameters from the recipe input, and the other the inverse mapping from the desired satisfaction to the breadmaker appliance recipe.

Methods: Text information in images is an important consideration for image based applications such as automatic geo coding, content based image retrieval and understanding scene. But to detect the text from a complex background with different colours is a complex task. There are different techniques has been proposed to detect text in images. One of the techniques is hybrid approach for text localization and text detection in natural scene images. In this approach, the text region detector is used to detect text region and to segment the candidate components by local binarization. Then the non text components are filtered using Conditional Random Field model (CRF). Finally the text components are grouped together as line or words. This approach feels hard to segment some complex images due to lack of colour information. In order to enhance the performance of text detection in images Mahalanobis Distance (MD) metric, cosine based similarity metric and text recognition is introduced. Findings: The Mahalanobis Distance (MD) metric, cosine based similarity metric are computed for image segmentation process where colour information of images is considered instead of gray level image information. Based on the color information the input images are segmented. Then CRF is employed to filter out the non text components. After that text components are grouped together to localize the text from images. Moreover in the proposed work, text recognition is done by Kohonen neural network and compares the results of text localization and text recognition to reduce the false positive of text localization.

Then a set of phase I IX control charts is constructed based on a Partition Around Medoids (PAM) clustering method. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is then used to label a new profile to its associated group for phase II monitoring so that the IX chart associated with a homogeneous group can provide better process monitoring. Overall 146 water temperature profiles were collected in phase I process, while 39 profiles were captured in phase II process. Out of those 39 profiles, 6 of which were recognized as abnormal waveform profiles by quality engineers and our judgements. The proposed framework with machine learning and SPC implementation in the frequency domain works well during phase I control charting with low false alarm rates. The proposed framework also outperforms the other profile analysis methods in phase II control charting in term of high detection rate of abnormal profiles.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cie.2020.106325", "venue": null, "journal": "Computers & Industrial Engineering", "mag_id": "3003162935", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213700036"}

Identification of the principal factors that determine this by-catch and understanding how they could be controlled is fundamental for improving the management of fisheries and so carry out a better conservation of Cory's shearwater populations in the Mediterranean. The aim of this paper was to model the longline by-catch of Mediterranean Cory's shearwater in the Spanish Mediterranean longline fishery as a function of time of the year, technical char- acteristics of the fishing operation, and geographical location. We used data recorded by an onboard observer program monitoring commercial longline fisheries. During the 10 years covered in this study, 80 birds were captured in 30 fishing operations out of a total of 2,587 observed fishing sets. We used favourability functions and Random Forest analyses to relate the presence of Cory's shearwater in the by-catch with the explanatory factors. The most explanatory factor in relation to incidence of by-catch was the geographical location (longitude and fishing over the continental shelf) and then the technical characteristics of the fishing operation (number of hooks and fishing during non-working days). Our con- clusion is clear, because seabirds are more likely to approach longline vessels when trawlers are not allowed to operate (i.e. non-working days), activity of longliners should be limited to working days, and closing longliners activity during the month of October could reduce greatly reducing seabird bycatch.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10531-014-0625-6", "venue": "Biodiversity and Conservation", "journal": "Biodiversity and Conservation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1979734167,2579434651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["13973236", "64903870", "84825513", "55811997", "84424282", "25671424", "86420048", "15049153", "45174121", "55732050", "86154817", "84032013", "89141", "5070067", "55696924", "44199915", "84559483", "89588751", "85093624", "4073915", "49365686", "86527080", "18746064", "53411914", "44871764", "52888686", "85653575", "55862410", "85358263", "84812517", "15206363", "56239411", "83897960", "54838133", "83890253", "11374168", "34887643", "83667457", "6552499", "88349320", "84382206", "44663565", "56472635"], "inbound_citations": ["131795837", "56095630", "20992042", "202611193", "67859995", "203405841", "3369039", "12198581", "202549466", "55583239", "202638487", "10690123"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15824871"}

However, the global mechanism also means that the LRR model is not suitable for handling large-scale data or dynamic data. For large-scale data, the LRR method suffers from high time complexity, and for dynamic data, it has to recompute a complex rank minimization for the entire data set whenever new samples are dynamically added, making it prohibitively expensive. Existing attempts to online LRR either take a stochastic approach or build the representation purely based on a small sample set and treat new input as out-of-sample data. The former often requires multiple runs for good performance and thus takes longer time to run, and the latter formulates online LRR as an out-of-sample classification problem and is less robust to noise. In this paper, a novel online LRR subspace learning method is proposed for both large-scale and dynamic data. The proposed algorithm is composed of two stages: static learning and dynamic updating. In the first stage, the subspace structure is learned from a small number of data samples. In the second stage, the intrinsic principal components of the entire data set are computed incrementally by utilizing the learned subspace structure, and the LRR matrix can also be incrementally solved by an efficient online singular value decomposition algorithm. The time complexity is reduced dramatically for large-scale data, and repeated computation is avoided for dynamic problems. We further perform theoretical analysis comparing the proposed online algorithm with the batch LRR method. Finally, experimental results on typical tasks of subspace recovery and subspace clustering show that the proposed algorithm performs comparably or better than batch methods, including the batch LRR, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art online methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28991739", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2017.2760510", "venue": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "journal": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195667981"}
