With booming number of intruders and hackers in todays vast and sophisticated computerized world, it is unceasingly challenging to identify unknown attacks in promising time with no false positive and no false negative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization.

Methods: Non-human sequence data from high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of PBMC samples from 10 SLE patients and 10 healthy individuals were used for taxonomic alignment against an integrated virome reference genome database. Based on abundance profiles of SLE-associated virome species, genera, or host, Random Forests model was used to identify the viruses associated with SLE diagnostic markers. Spearman's correlation and functional clustering was used to analyze the interaction of candidate virome dysbiosis and SLE-associated differentially expressed genes. Results: A total of 419 viruses (38 human associated viruses, 350 phage, and 31 other viruses) was detected and the diversity of the PBMC virome was significantly increased in patients with SLE compared to the healthy controls (HCs). Viral taxa discriminated the cases from the controls, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.883, 0.695, and 0.540 for species, genus, and host, respectively. Clinical subgroup analysis showed that candidate PBMC viral markers were associated with stable- and active-stage SLE.

Analyzing this data is difficult and most business intelligence tools cannot cope with the volume of the data. One example is churn prediction, where the cost of retaining existing customers is less than acquiring new ones. Several data mining and machine learning approaches can be used, but there is still little information about the different algorithm settings to be used when the dataset doesn't fit into a single computer memory. Because of the difficulties of applying feature selection techniques at a large scale, Incremental Probabilistic Component Analysis (IPCA) is proposed as a data preprocessing technique. Also, we present a new approach to large scale churn prediction problems based on the mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) algorithm. Compared to other techniques, the new method facilitates training with large data volumes using a small memory footprint while achieving good prediction results. Data is one of the important assets for any type of company and thats why large volumes of data are becoming more common everyday. Therefore, large scale data analysis and management is also turning increasingly more complex. Churn prediction is one such exemplar, where well known data mining models can be used to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a company (1). Whenever the signals that directly influence the churn phenomena are not known (i.e. customer satisfaction, competitive market strategies, etc.), it becomes difficult to achieve accurate prediction results, even if large volumes of transactional data are available. Most business operations are recorded and can therefore be used to create features that relate the customer behavior to the churn probability, however because of the size of the business data sets and the total number of different operations that can be performed, preprocessing techniques such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction must be performed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a well known technique for dimensionality reduction that projects the full dataset into a subset of the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix (2). The method is robust and can be used to reduce the dimensionality of high dimensional transactional data for the churn prediction problem, however the computational cost is expensive in the case of large datasets. An incremental version of PCA (IPCA) was proposed inn order to sequentially create the data projection, without an explicit pass over the whole data set each time a new data point", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.20944/preprints201608.0142.v1", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2515339469", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17793133", "1089627", "11858760", "1280295", "5113797", "2975968", "43793264", "10318837", "15514143", "10659969"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42358892"}

The Great Xing\u2019an Mountain is such a region in China that has a large area of wetlands with rare human disturbance. The predictions of the global circulation model CGCM3 (the third-generation coupled global climate model from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis) indicated that the temperature in The Great Xing\u2019an Mountain will rise by 2\u20134\u00b0C over the next 100 years. This paper predicts the potential distributions of wetlands in this area under the current and warming climate conditions. This predication was performed by the Random Forests model, with 18 environmental variables, which will reflect the climate and topography conditions. The model has been proven to have a great prediction ability. The wetland distributions are primarily topography-driven in the Great Xing\u2019an Mountains. Mean annual temperature, warmness index, and potential evapotranspiration ratio are the most important climatic factors in wetland distributions. The model predictions for three future climate scenarios show that the wetland area tends to decrease, and higher emission will also cause more drastic shrinkage of wetland distributions. About 30% of the wetland area will disappear by 2050. The area will decrease 62.47, 76.90, and 85.83%, respectively, under CGCM3-B1, CGCM3-A1B, and CGCM3-A2 by 2100. As for spatial allocation, wetlands may begin to disappear from the sides to the center and south to north under a warming climate.

Cow Trap and Cedar Lakes are potential oyster harvesting waters located in Brazoria County, Texas, that have been listed as impaired for bacteria on the 2004 Texas 303(d) list. Unknown source Escherichia coli were isolated from water samples collected in the study area during two sampling events. Isolates were confirmed as E. coli using carbon source utilization profiles and then analyzed via ARA, following the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Zone diameters from ARA profiles were analyzed with both DA and RF. Using a two-way classification (human vs nonhuman), both DA and RF categorized over 90% of the 299 unknown source isolates as a nonhuman source. The average rates of correct classification (ARCCs) for the library of 1172 isolates using DA and RF were 74.6% and 82.3%, respectively. ARCCs from RF ranged from 7.7 to 12.0% higher than those from DA. Rates of correct classification (RCCs) for individual sources classified with RF ranged from 23.2 to 0.2% higher than those of DA, with a mean difference of 9.0%. Additional evidence for the outperformance of DA by RF was found in the comparison of training and test set ARCCs and examination of specific disputed isolates; RF produced higher ARCCs (ranging from 8 to 13% higher) than DA for all 1000 trials (excluding the two-way classification, in which RF outperformed DA 999 out of 1000 times). This is of practical significance for analysis of bacterial source tracking data. Overall, based on both DA and RF results, migratory birds were found to be the source of the largest portion of the unknown E. coli isolates.

The non-overlapping labels challenge that the source domain and the target domain have entirely different persons further increases the re-identification difficulty. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to narrow such domain gaps. We derive a camera style adaptation framework to learn the style-based mappings between different camera views, from the target domain to the source domain , and then we can transfer the identity-based distribution from the source domain to the target domain on the camera level. Target camera variations can be captured by the style adaptation method, thus, the re-identification model trained on the target domain can learn target camera-invariant features better. It indicates that the style translator approximates an appropriate metric space for improving feature matching. To overcome the non-overlapping labels challenge and guide the person re-identification model to narrow the gap further, an efficient and effective soft-labeling method is proposed to mine the intrinsic local structure of the target domain through building the connection between GAN-translated source domain and the target domain.

Large mammals are especially affected because they require large tracts of intact habitat and functioning corridors between core habitat areas. Accurate land-cover data is critical to identify core habitat areas and corridors, and medium resolution sensors such as Landsat 8 provide opportunities to map land cover for conservation planning. Here, we used all available Landsat 8 imagery from launch through December 2014 to identify large mammal corridors and assess their quality across the Caucasus Mountains (> 700,000 km 2 ). Specifically, we tested the usefulness of seasonal image composites (spring, summer, fall, and winter) and a range of image metrics (e.g., mean and median reflectance across all clear observations) to map nine land-cover classes with a Random Forest classifier. Using image composites from all four seasons yielded markedly higher overall accuracy than using single-season composites (8% increase) and the inclusion of image metrics further improved the classification significantly. Our final land-cover map had an overall accuracy of 85%. Using our land-cover map, we parameterized connectivity models for three generic large mammal groups and identified wildlife corridors and bottlenecks within corridors with cost-distance modeling and circuit theory. Corridors were numerous (in total, 85, 131, and 132 corridors for our three mammal groups, respectively), but often had bottlenecks or high average cost along the least-cost path, indicating limited functioning. Our findings highlight the potential of Landsat 8 composites to support connectivity analyses across large areas, and thus to contribute to conservation planning, and serve as an early warning system for biodiversity loss in areas where on-the-ground monitoring is challenging, such as in the Caucasus.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.03.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2596615883", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["24479109", "52088087", "16588232", "14250897", "1680096", "22438567", "52085020", "19285046", "89141", "4226939", "44413065", "206525630", "129453262", "8556559", "23847364", "9743683", "110325", "154736190", "59129835", "16203715", "17220647", "62739295", "18929330", "134704846", "26051679", "15325054", "23541992", "128512889", "127329459", "27328449", "83674238", "10983264", "140597287", "85132807", "10813877", "54080433", "128818929", "8187769", "85995324", "129627611", "52086018", "2849835", "206550298", "52088091", "129627768", "84380098", "205241444", "140663136", "18445589", "55848513", "17440356", "7295768", "3268244", "86075432"], "inbound_citations": ["202619473", "89610897", "21654292", "208036910", "51965564", "92718022", "202174158"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52084461"}

We propose to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) jointly with an adversarial CNN to estimate routine-dose CT images from low-dose CT images and hence reduce noise. A generator CNN was trained to transform low-dose CT images into routine-dose CT images using voxelwise loss minimization. An adversarial discriminator CNN was simultaneously trained to distinguish the output of the generator from routine-dose CT images. The performance of this discriminator was used as an adversarial loss for the generator. Experiments were performed using CT images of an anthropomorphic phantom containing calcium inserts, as well as patient non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT images. The phantom and patients were scanned at 20% and 100% routine clinical dose. Three training strategies were compared: the first used only voxelwise loss, the second combined voxelwise loss and adversarial loss, and the third used only adversarial loss. The results showed that training with only voxelwise loss resulted in the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio with respect to reference routine-dose images. However, CNNs trained with adversarial loss captured image statistics of routine-dose images better. Noise reduction improved quantification of low-density calcified inserts in phantom CT images and allowed coronary calcium scoring in low-dose patient CT images with high noise levels. Testing took less than 10 s per CT volume. CNN-based low-dose CT noise reduction in the image domain is feasible.

Several computational methods have been proposed for predicting essential genes in model organisms by integrating multiple biological data sources either via centrality measures or machine learning based methods. However, the methods aiming to predict human essential genes are still limited and the performance still need improve. In addition, most of the machine learning based essential gene prediction methods are lack of skills to handle the imbalanced learning issue inherent in the essential gene prediction problem, which might be one factor affecting their performance. Results We proposed a deep learning based method, DeepHE, to predict human essential genes by integrating features derived from sequence data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A deep learning based network embedding method was utilized to automatically learn features from PPI network. In addition, 89 sequence features were derived from DNA sequence and protein sequence for each gene. These two types of features were integrated to train a multilayer neural network. A cost-sensitive technique was used to address the imbalanced learning problem when training the deep neural network. The experimental results for predicting human essential genes showed that our proposed method, DeepHE, can accurately predict human gene essentiality with an average AUC higher than 94%, the area under precision-recall curve (AP) higher than 90%, and the accuracy higher than 90%. We also compared DeepHE with several widely used traditional machine learning models (SVM, Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Adaboost). The experimental results showed that DeepHE greatly outperformed the compared machine learning models. Conclusions We demonstrated that human essential genes can be accurately predicted by designing effective machine learning algorithm and integrating representative features captured from available biological data. The proposed deep learning framework is effective for such task.

To improve objectivity, reduce the burden on well-experienced endocrinologists, allow screening of suspected patients in under-developed areas and provide TS patients with early detection and early treatment, a facial image analysis-based computer-aided system for automatic face classification is proposed. The system is composed of facial image pre-processing, image feature extraction, and automatic classification. First, several unique appearance features are identified in different facial regions based on clinical observations by endocrinologists, including ocular distance, epicanthus, and the numbers and sizes of melanocytic nevi. Based on the characteristics, we trained a 68 feature-points face model. Then, distance between points, Gabor wavelet filtering and spot detection are applied to extract global features and local features, respectively, and Gabor features are reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Adaboost algorithm are used for classification. Although all subjects involved in this trial are Chinese, the method achieves an average accuracy of 84.6% on the training set and 83.4% on the testing set based on K-fold cross- validation. The sustainable acquisition and accessibility of face images used for research is one of our advantages.

A machine learning based scheme was used to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis from primary care EHRs via the following steps: i) selection of variables by comparing relative frequencies of Read codes in the primary care dataset associated with disease case compared to non-disease control (disease/non-disease based on the secondary care diagnosis); ii) reduction of predictors/associated variables using a Random Forest method, iii) induction of decision rules from decision tree model. The proposed method was then extensively validated on an independent dataset, and compared for performance with two existing deterministic algorithms for RA which had been developed using expert clinical knowledge. ::: ::: Results ::: ::: Primary care EHRs were available for 2,238,360 patients over the age of 16 and of these 20,667 were also linked in the secondary care rheumatology clinical system. In the linked dataset, 900 predictors (out of a total of 43,100 variables) in the primary care record were discovered more frequently in those with versus those without RA. These variables were reduced to 37 groups of related clinical codes, which were used to develop a decision tree model. The final algorithm identified 8 predictors related to diagnostic codes for RA, medication codes, such as those for disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and absence of alternative diagnoses such as psoriatic arthritis. The proposed data-driven method performed as well as the expert clinical knowledge based methods. ::: ::: Conclusion ::: ::: Data-driven scheme, such as ensemble machine learning methods, has the potential of identifying the most informative predictors in a cost-effective and rapid way to accurately and reliably classify rheumatoid arthritis or other complex medical conditions in primary care EHRs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4852928", "pubmed_id": "27135409", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0154515", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2345744153", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["19883960", "27955425", "10713985", "32252127", "8206215", "1841217", "908193", "13536917", "38232914", "7204871", "13953568", "14806491", "4573381", "16695076", "22055481", "89141", "2491118", "6568475", "5262555", "154063464", "27585113", "11809051", "5545241", "32079905", "20077235", "10432002", "647821", "215181040", "5988956", "2011858", "24340027"], "inbound_citations": ["52067816", "140122484", "198133174", "92143727"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7096697"}

The network projects the input information into the high-dimensional reservoir space, which then can be processed simply by a trained readout system. This leads to interesting applications in the field of ultra-fast pattern recognition, or the prediction of chaotic temporal sequences [2]. To realize this interesting concept with nanophotonic nodes, we present a hardware platform based on a dense array of semiconductor micropillar lasers, which can be optically coupled and injected within a fully parallel concept. Our scheme is implemented by a diffractively multiplied external resonator, which redirects the emission of individual laser nodes in the array to their neighbouring nodes [3].

First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to represent each image as a feature vector (i.e., eigen-features) in a low-dimensional space. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are then employed to select a subset of features from the low-dimensional representation by disregarding certain eigenvectors that do not seem to encode important gender information.

The resulting map has five wetland classes (open-water/marsh complex, open bog, open fen, shrub/treed fen/bog, swamp), plus lakes and various upland classes. Its accuracy was assessed using data from 156 GPS wetland sites collected in 2012 and compared to the one obtained with the current wetland map of Nova Scotia. The best overall classification was obtained using a combination of Lidar, RADARSAT-2 HH, HV, VH, VV intensity with polarimetric variables, and QuickBird multispectral (89.2%). The classified image was compared to GPS validation sites to assess the mapping accuracy of the wetlands. It was first done considering a group consisting of all wetland classes including lakes. This showed that only 69.9% of the wetland sites were correctly identified when only the QuickBird classified image was used in the classification. With the addition of variables derived from lidar, the number of correctly identified wetlands increased to 88.5%. The accuracy remained the same with the addition of RADARSAT-2 (88.5%). When we tested the accuracy for identifying wetland classes (e.g. marsh complex vs. open bog) instead of grouped wetlands, the resulting wetland map performed best with either QuickBird and Lidar, or QuickBird, Lidar, and RADARSAT-2 (66%).

Therefore, efficient computational methods are needed to identify the possible candidates before experimentation. In this study, we proposed a new predictor, PIP-EL, for predicting PIPs using the strategy of ensemble learning (EL). Our benchmarking dataset is imbalanced. Thus, we applied a random under-sampling technique to generate 10 balanced models for each composition.

Then an automatic extraction method of focal features on 3D human body via random forest regression analysis of geodesics distance is used to extract the predefined feature points and lines. Finally, the individual human body size is calculated according to the feature points and lines. The method is an automatic data-driven way. The scale-invariant heat kernel signature is exploited to serve as feature proximity. So it is insensitive to postures and different shapes of 3D human body.

The TPSD including seasonal separation algorithm (SSA), fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) is proposed for the first time to handle the complex and irregular natures of wind speed comprehensively.

Frame-works such as Mahout on top of Hadoop support machine learning but their implementations are at the preliminary stage.

These surfaces were introduced by Shechtman & Irani (CVPR\u201907) in the context of matching similarities between images or videos. These surfaces are obtained by matching a small patch, centered at a pixel, to its larger surroundings, aiming to capture similarities of a patch to its neighborhood.

To navigate in a complex urban environment, it is necessary precise sensors with reliable data. The task of understanding the surroundings is hard by itself; for intelligent vehicles, it is even more critical due to the high speed in which the vehicle navigates. To successfully navigate in an urban environment, the perception system must quickly receive, process, and execute an action to guarantee both passenger and pedestrian safety. Stereo cameras collect environment information at many levels, e.g., depth, color, texture, shape, which guarantee ample knowledge about the surroundings. Even so, when compared to human, computational methods lack the ability to deal with missing information, i.e., occlusions. For many perception tasks, this lack of data can be a hindrance due to the environment incomplete information. In this paper, we address this problem and discuss recent methods to deal with occluded areas inference.

Considering the CpG density-dependent bias and limited resolution of MeDIP-seq, we developed a Random Forest Regression (RFR) model method, MeSiC, to estimate DNA methylation levels at single-base resolution. MeSiC integrated MeDIP-seq signals of CpG sites and their surrounding neighbors as well as genomic features to construct genomic element-dependent RFR models. In the H1 cell line, a high correlation was observed between MeSiC predictions and actual 5 mC levels. Meanwhile, MeSiC enabled to calibrate CpG density-dependent bias of MeDIP-seq signals. Importantly, we found that MeSiC models constructed in the H1 cell line could be used to accurately predict DNA methylation levels for other cell types. Comparisons with methylCRF and MEDIPS showed that MeSiC achieved comparable and even better performance.

To this end, we propose to learn a group of capsule subspaces onto which an input feature vector is projected. Then the lengths of resultant capsules are used to score the probability of belonging to different classes. We train such a Capsule Projection Network (CapProNet) by learning an orthogonal projection matrix for each capsule subspace, and show that each capsule subspace is updated until it contains input feature vectors corresponding to the associated class. We will also show that the capsule projection can be viewed as normalizing the multiple columns of the weight matrix simultaneously to form an orthogonal basis, which makes it more effective in incorporating novel components of input features to update capsule representations. In other words, the capsule projection can be viewed as a multi-dimensional weight normalization in capsule subspaces, where the conventional weight normalization is simply a special case of the capsule projection onto 1D lines. Only a small negligible computing overhead is incurred to train the network in low-dimensional capsule subspaces or through an alternative hyper-power iteration to estimate the normalization matrix. Experiment results on image datasets show the presented model can greatly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art ResNet backbones by $10-20\\%$ and that of the Densenet by $5-7\\%$ respectively at the same level of computing and memory expenses.

In this situation, the attributes that are generated are too many, and the best attributes with the best weight values need to be selected. In this paper, a hybrid model is proposed using Particle Swarm Optimization and Information Gain (PSO-IG). The proposed method is applied to 4 different methods, namely Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-NN. Based on the results of experiments carried out on the proposed model, there was an increase in accuracy up to the highest accuracy level of 90.55%. The method using hybrid PSO-IG is a solution as an effort to increase the accuracy level of review classification of culinary food restaurants as decision support information.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIC47613.2019.8985842", "venue": "2019 Fourth International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC)", "journal": "2019 Fourth International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3006159901", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206990340", "13908471", "33811600", "145959548", "16768404", "8488556", "22764221", "162168819", "133606106", "145964351", "182323353", "11079689"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211119270"}

Among many biometrics like finger print, iris, voice, hand geometry, signature etc., face recognition has attained the most popular research orientation because of high recognition rate, uniqueness and large number of features. Some of the challenges in face recognition task include the differences in illumination, poses, expressions and background. Now-a-days deep learning methods are widely employed and they ensure promising results for image recognition and classification problems. Convolutional Neural Networks automatically learn features at multiple levels of abstraction through back propagation with convolution layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers. In this work, an automated face recognition method using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning approach is proposed. The CNN with weights learned from pre-trained model VGG-16 on huge ImageNet database is used to train the images from the face database. The extracted features are fed as input to the Fully connected layer and softmax activation for classification. Two publicly available databases of face images \u2013 Yale and AT&T are used to test the performance of the proposed method.

Statistical relational learning (SRL) is an emerging area of research that addresses the problem of learning from these noisy structured/ relational data. Markov logic networks (MLNs), sets of weighted rstorder logic formulae, are a simple but powerful SRL formalism that generalizes both rst-order logic and Markov networks. MLNs have been successfully applied to a variety of real-world problems ranging from extraction knowledge from text to visual event recognition. Most of the existing learning algorithms for MLNs are in the generative setting: they try to learn a model that is equally capable of predicting the values of all variables given an arbitrary set of evidence; and they do not scale to problems with thousands of examples. However, many real-world problems in structured/relational data are discriminative|where the variables are divided into two disjoint sets input and output, and the goal is to correctly predict the values of the output variables given evidence data about the input variables. In addition, these problems usually involve data that have thousands of examples. Thus, it is important to develop new discriminative learning methods for MLNs that are more accurate and more scalable, which are the topics addressed in this thesis. First, we present a new method that discriminatively learns both the structure and parameters for a special class of MLNs where all the clauses are non-recursive ones. Non-recursive clauses arise in many learning problems in Inductive Logic Programming. To further improve the predictive accuracy we propose a max-margin approach to learning weights for MLNs. Then to address the issue of scalability, we present CDA, an online max-margin weight learning algorithm for MLNs.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1723409036", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31775094"}

Blind per tone equalization using Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) and Multi-Modulus Algorithm (MMA) are used as the comparison benchmark. The SVM-based cost function utilizes a CMAlike error function and the solution is obtained by means of an Iterative Re-Weighted Least Squares Algorithm (IRWLS). Moreover, like CMA, the error function allows to extend the method to multilevel modulations. In this case, a dual mode algorithm is proposed. Dual mode equalization techniques are commonly used in communication systems working with multilevel signals. Practical blind algorithms for multilevel modulation are able to open the eye of the constellation, but they usually exhibit a high residual error. In a dual mode scheme, once the eye is opened by the blind algorithm, the system switches to another algorithm, which is able to obtain a lower residual error under a suitable initial ISI level.

If NPDR is not identified at its earlier stage, it may lead to Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), the complicated stage of retinal symptom that may leads to blindness. Methods: It is proposed to develop an automatic computer aided detection system that screen a large number of people to identify the DR in its earlier stage for proper treatments. In this work, images are taken from publicly available e-optha database. Analysis mainly considers three stages which include removal of optic disc and normalization done by histogram processing; texture information extracted using Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and classification is done with the help of Support Vector Machines (SVM). Findings: Preprocessing method used in this work enhances the contrast of the low or poor quality images. Here, optic disc segmentation is performed, which helps in providing better result by avoiding the misclassification of optic disc as lesions. GLCM method provides different texture features to SVM o provide better result in identifying exudate lesions.

In the contrast learning step, all the samples in the 3D object dataset are cut into two parts and put into a \"part\" dataset. Then a contrast learning GNN (ContrastNet) is trained to verify whether two randomly sampled parts from the part dataset belong to the same object. In the cluster learning step, the trained ContrastNet is applied to all the samples in the original 3D object dataset to extract features, which are used to group the samples into clusters. Then another GNN for clustering learning (ClusterNet) is trained to predict the cluster ID of all the training samples. The contrasting learning forces the ContrastNet to learn high-level semantic features of objects but probably ignores low-level features, while the ClusterNet improves the quality of learned features by being trained to discover objects that probably belong to the same semantic categories by the use of cluster IDs. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed framework on point cloud classification tasks.

We propose two methods with different techniques, i.e., convolutional neural network features (CNN_Features)-based technique and a transfer learning-based technique to detect mispronunciation detection. In the first method, we use deep CNN features to detect mispronunciation. We also extract features from different layers of CNN (layer4 to layer7) to train k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) classifiers. In the transfer learning-based method, we trained the CNN using transfer learning to detect mispronunciation. To evaluate the performance of the system, we compare the results of these methods with baseline handcrafted features-based method for 28 Arabic phonemes. In the baseline method, we use the same classifiers; KNN, SVM, and NN to detect mispronunciation. The experimental results show that handcrafted_features method, CNN_features, and transfer learning-based method achieve an accuracy of 82%, 91.7%, and 92.2%, respectively.

In recent years, it is seen that text mining methods are used in analyzes in the literature. However, the evaluations of consumers which are formed by short texts make it necessary to realize the analysis with insufficient data. The weighting methods such as Term Frequency and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency as well as common used classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine have some inadequacies in short text analysis.

Recently, researchers have looked into improving non-adversarial alternatives that can close the gap of generation quality while avoiding some common issues of GANs, such as unstable training and mode collapse. Examples in this direction include Two-stage VAE and Generative Latent Nearest Neighbors. However, a major drawback of these models is that they are slow to train, and in particular, they require two training stages. To address this, we propose Generative Latent Flow (GLF), which uses an auto-encoder to learn the mapping to and from the latent space, and an invertible flow to map the distribution in the latent space to simple i.i.d noise. The advantages of our method include a simple conceptual framework, single stage training and fast convergence.

Because the number of markers is often much larger than the number of phenotypes, marker effect estimation is not a trivial task. The objective of this research was to compare the predictive performance of ten different statistical methods employed in genomic selection, by analyzing data from a heterogeneous stock mice population.ResultsFor the five traits analyzed (W6W: weight at six weeks, WGS: growth slope, BL: body length, %CD8+: percentage of CD8+ cells, CD4+/ CD8+: ratio between CD4+ and CD8+ cells), within-family predictions were more accurate than across-family predictions, although this superiority in accuracy varied markedly across traits. For within-family prediction, two kernel methods, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces Regression (RKHS) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were the most accurate for W6W, while a polygenic model also had comparable performance. A form of ridge regression assuming that all markers contribute to the additive variance (RR_GBLUP) figured among the most accurate for WGS and BL, while two variable selection methods ( LASSO and Random Forest, RF) had the greatest predictive abilities for %CD8+ and CD4+/ CD8+. RF, RKHS, SVR and RR_GBLUP outperformed the remainder methods in terms of bias and inflation of predictions.ConclusionsMethods with large conceptual differences reached very similar predictive abilities and a clear re-ranking of methods was observed in function of the trait analyzed. Variable selection methods were more accurate than the remainder in the case of %CD8+ and CD4+/CD8+ and these traits are likely to be influenced by a smaller number of QTL than the remainder. Judged by their overall performance across traits and computational requirements, RR_GBLUP, RKHS and SVR are particularly appealing for application in genomic selection.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3563460", "pubmed_id": "23134637", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2156-13-100", "venue": "BMC Genetics", "journal": "BMC Genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2082429221", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["10759276", "3379276", "18646696", "55571260", "16601563", "6249191", "20722172", "6331407", "35768825", "33349020", "28573474", "872270", "15969441", "17535443", "17901537", "14381069", "14683503", "16162039", "26729467", "2371760", "10138383", "25011070", "10540516", "9566319", "21466416", "13233742", "1866813", "83683677", "9315739", "41580833"], "inbound_citations": ["34132613", "145864051", "5045280", "14158520", "2530067", "5567255", "196637838", "92494282", "52183378", "202689198", "49408003", "195063415", "215228666", "58010106", "2230001", "214797276", "20450305", "15738054", "196631159"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11408662"}

These approaches are emerging and there is still much to explore. This work follows this track applying Kernel Machines to monocular visual ego-motion estimation. Unlike geometrical methods, learning-based approaches to monocular visual odometry allow issues like scale estimation and camera calibration to be overcome, assuming the availability of training data. While some previous works have proposed learning paradigms to VO, to our knowledge no extensive evaluation of applying kernel-based methods to Visual Odometry has been conducted.

Experimental results show good performances of learning algorithms and set them as a solid alternative to the computationally intensive and complex to implement geometrical techniques. We stress the advantages of non-geometric (learned) VO as an alternative or an addition to standard geometric methods.Ego-motion is computed with state-of-the art regression techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Processes (GP).To our knowledge this is the first time SVM have been applied to VO problem.We conduct extensive evaluation on three publicly available datasets, spanning both indoor and outdoor environments.The experiments show that non-geometric VO is a good alternative, or addition, to standard VO systems.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.robot.2014.08.001", "venue": "Robotics Auton.

Because there is insufficient labeled data from the domain of interest, validation techniques cannot be reliably used for the algorithm selection process in a transfer learning environment. A transfer learning algorithm is typically comprised of a domain adaptation step followed by a learning step. The learning step is usually implemented using a traditional machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we examine and analyze the impact that the traditional machine learning algorithm (the learning step) has on the overall performance of a transfer learning algorithm. Using the transfer learning test framework, we test five state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms coupled with seven different traditional learning algorithms for a total of 35 unique transfer learning algorithms. For our experiment, no labeled data from the domain of interest is available for the training process.

Rough \u03bd-TWSVR not only utilizes more data information rather than the extreme data points in the \u03bd-TWSVR, but also makes different points having different effects on the regressor depending on their positions. This method can implement the structural risk minimization and automatically control accuracies according to the structure of the data sets. In addition, the double \u03b5 s are utilized to construct the rough tube for upper(lower)-bound Rough \u03bd-TWSVR instead of a single \u03b5 in the upper(lower)-bound \u03bd-TWSVR. Moreover, This rough tube consisting of positive region, boundary region, and negative region yields the feasible set of the Rough \u03bd-TWSVR larger than that of the \u03bd-TWSVR, which makes the objective function of the Rough \u03bd-TWSVR no more than that of \u03bd-TWSVR. The Rough \u03bd-TWSVR improves the generalization performance of the \u03bd-TWSVR, especially for the data sets with outliers.

Tumor regions were segmented and registered to corresponding spectroscopic voxels. Spectroscopic features were computed (n = 860) in a radiomic approach and selected by a classification algorithm.

Molecular subgroups were significantly associated with the computed spectroscopic clusters (Fisher's Exact test p < 0.01). A machine-learning model was trained and validated by public available MRS data (n = 19).

In this paper, we present a coverage evaluation tool based on machine learning (ML) which is free from propagation model. In particular, received signal strengths (RSSs) reported by users and factors that affect the transmitted signal, such as distance, geography and configuration parameters of BS, are collected and used to train a classifier which allows to predict the RSS at the user side. In this way, the complicated procedures to obtain propagation model can be skipped, which reduces the great cost in coverage evaluation.

In this study, a substantiated combined Eulerian-Lagrangian mathematical model is developed to calculate the thermo-fluid behavior of the FGD wastewater in the flue gas during evaporating process. In order to increase the amount of FGD wastewater to be treated at the same time and avoid the scale and corrosion on flue duct walls, the mounting spacing between two nozzles and the safe mounting spacing between nozzles and flue duct wall are analyzed. Then the effect of nozzle characteristics on droplets evaporation is studied, such as the flow rate, full cone angle and direction of a spray nozzle. Based on the achieved numerical results, a Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) model is introduced to forecast the evaporation rate of droplets. The results show that the maximum evaporation rate of droplets can be obtained by spaying droplets in the co-flow direction of flue gas. An optimized arrangement of multiple nozzles having small flow rate is proposed to improve the droplets evaporation rate. The proposed LSSVM model can expeditiously predict the evaporation rate of droplets along the flue duct with high accuracy.

In this article, we propose a representation learning method for LBSNs called as JRLM++, which models check-in sequences together with social connections. To capture sequential relatedness, JRLM++ characterizes two levels of sequential contexts, namely fine-grained and coarse-grained contexts.

Being an efficient and general learning and recognition method, the eSVM can be broadly applied to various tasks in intelligent image search and video retrieval. The eSVM first defines a \\(\\varTheta \\) set that consists of the training samples on the wrong side of their margin derived from the conventional soft-margin SVM. The \\(\\varTheta \\) set plays an important role in controlling the generalization performance of the eSVM. The eSVM then introduces only a single slack variable for all the training samples in the \\(\\varTheta \\) set, and as a result, only a very small number of those samples in the \\(\\varTheta \\) set become support vectors. The eSVM hence significantly reduces the number of support vectors and improves the computational efficiency without sacrificing the generalization performance. The optimization of the eSVM is implemented using a modified Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm to solve the large Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. A new eye localization method then applies the eSVM for accurate and efficient eye localization. In particular, the eye localization method consists of the eye candidate selection stage and the eye candidate validation stage. The selection stage selects the eye candidates from an image through a process of eye color distribution analysis in the YCbCr color space. The validation stage applies first 2D Haar wavelets for multi-scale image representation, then PCA for dimensionality reduction, and finally the eSVM for classification.

However, RC has been criticized for not being principled enough, namely the reservoir which is unlikely to be optimal because the reservoir connectivity and weight structure are created randomly. A new Simple Cycle Reservoir Network (SCRN) with deterministically constructed connectivity and weight structure can yield performance competitive with standard Echo State Network (ESN). In order to determine the proper size of the reservoir and improve generalization ability of SCRN, a Sensitive Iterated Pruning Algorithm (SIPA), in which a larger than necessary reservoir is employed firstly and then its size is reduced by pruning out the least sensitive internal units, is proposed to optimize the reservoir size and weights of SCRN. A system identification and two time-series benchmark tasks are applied to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of SIPA. The results show that the SIPA method significantly outperforms a Least Angle Regression (LAR) method and SIPA is able to improve the generalization performance of SCRN.

The system makes use of different types of contextual information along with a variety of features that are helpful in predicting the different named entity (NE) classes. This set of features includes language independent as well as language dependent components. We have used the annotated corpora of 122,467 tokens for Bengali and 502,974 tokens for Hindi tagged with a tag set of twelve different NE classes, defined as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages (SSEAL). We have considered only the tags that denote person names, location names, organization names, number expressions, time expressions and measurement expressions. A number of experiments have been carried out in order to find out the most suitable features for NER in Bengali and Hindi.

Wet experimental identification of circRNA-disease associations is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and thus developing computational methods for the circRNA-disease association prediction is an urgent task. In this paper, we propose a linear neighborhood label propagation method to predict circRNA-disease associations, named CD-LNLP. First, CD-LNLP uses association profiles based on known associations to calculate circRNA-circRNA similarities and disease-disease similarities. Next, CD-LNLP implements the label propagation based on the circRNA-circRNA similarity-based graph and the disease-disease similarity-based graph respectively to predict circRNA-disease associations. Finally, we combine the outputs from circRNA-circRNA similarity-based graph model and disease-disease similarity-based graph model to produce the results.

This paradigm delivers a multi-level semantic video understanding framework that not only supports the detection of events-of-interest but also summarizes the overall semantic evolution. Specifically, we develop an Auxiliary Segmentation Conditional Random Fields (ASCRF) to explore the game flow from broadcasting sports video sequences. Not only can the proposed ASCRF support joint segmentation and recognition of drives from a set of plays annotated by multi-channel keywords, but also is capable of dealing with the problem of missing keywords by introducing an auxiliary layer by which some useful contextual information can be learned to compensate for the possible missing keywords.

Each segment corresponds to a structural component describable by a surface primitive of up to the second order. This segmentation is for use in subsequent urban object modeling, vectorization, and recognition. To overcome the high geometrical and topological noise levels in the 3D reconstructed urban surfaces, we formulate the structural segmentation as a higher-order Conditional Random Field (CRF) labeling problem. It not only incorporates classical lower-order 2D and 3D local cues, but also encodes contextual geometric regularities to disambiguate the noisy local cues. A general higher-order CRF is difficult to solve. We develop a bottom-up progressive approach through a patch-based surface representation, which iteratively evolves from the initial mesh triangles to the final segmentation. Each iteration alternates between performing a prior discovery step, which finds the contextual regularities of the patch-based representation, and an inference step that leverages the regularities as higher-order priors to construct a more stable and regular segmentation. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method is extensively demonstrated on real reconstruction models, yielding significantly better performance than classical mesh segmentation methods.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2015.242", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2216747437", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45438936", "8498653", "53227477", "355163", "62373172", "2499865", "2845053", "15089955", "6868780", "62206683", "3084505", "206590944", "61654023", "333838", "2794268", "6658283", "13949472", "10827410", "8075713", "9595546", "26931576", "206591049", "37631971", "14851213", "9124253", "16945984", "10118968", "171046", "12477713"], "inbound_citations": ["199490375", "9506382", "53772149", "46986511", "52955187", "18925236", "21165354", "21165354", "53031339", "53717934"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15296552"}

Forecasting stock behavior solely based on historical prices may not perform well due to continuous, dynamic and in general unpredictable influence of various factors, e.g. economic status, political stability, voiced leaders\u2019 opinions, emergency events, etc., which are often not reflected in historic data. It is, therefore, useful to look at other data sources for predicting direction of market movement. The objective of ISMIS 2017 Data Mining Competition was to verify whether experts\u2019 recommendations can be used as a reliable basis for making informed decisions regarding investments in stock markets. The task was to predict a class of a return from an investment in different assets over the next three months, using only opinions given by financial experts. To address it, the trading prediction is formulated as a 3-class classification problem solved within supervised machine learning domain. Specifically, a hybrid classification system has been developed by combining traditional probabilistic Bayesian learning and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based on Feed-forward Neural Networks (NN).

In an attempt to make these vehicles more autonomous, this research project aims to develop a multivariable, neurofuzzy network controller for application to an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The vehicle being studied is Ocean Voyager, an AUV based at Florida Atlantic University. Ocean Voyager is a torpedo shaped, 22 feet long and 13 inches in diameter with a displacement of 2700 lb. The design speed is 10.1 ft/s, with an overall cruise time of 2 hours. A thruster provides the forward propulsion and the vehicle motion is controlled by two surfaces, the stern plane and rudder. A simulation of the vehicle dynamics has been made available to the ISIS research group but for the purposes of this project it has been treated as a black box. Simulation of the vehicle dynamics is achieved by using the standard submarine equations of motion defined by the David Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Centre (DTNSRDC). Before attempting any control, the problem of modelling the AUV dynamics was studied. The AUV is a nonlinear, multivariable, dynamic process which means that to produce an accurate approximation the selected model must not only be nonlinear but also capable of dealing with high dimensional inputs. The required nonlinearities can be provided by a neurofuzzy system. Neurofuzzy systems combine the positive attributes of a neural network and a fuzzy system. Neural networks have become popular largely due to their ability to universally approximate any continuous nonlinear function using only the information contained in a set of input/output training pairs. The properties of a neural network are determined by its structure and the learning rule used to adapt the weights. Common examples include the multilayer perceptron and the radial basis function network but more recently B-spline networks have been suggested due to their superior numerical properties. The B-spline network belongs to the class of Associative Memory Networks (AMNs) as it generalises locally, i.e. similar inputs map to similar outputs whereas dissimilar inputs map to independent outputs. They also have the advantage that only the output layer weights are adapted which means that well established linear training algorithms can be employed with provable behavioural characteristics. However, a major criticism of most neural networks is their opaque structure where the information stored can not be easily interpreted by the designer. A fuzzy system generally consists of a rule base composed of vague production rules such as IF (error is small) THEN (output is small). The rules are generally linguistic representations and because the information can be easily interpreted by the designer, it is said to be transparent. The power of a fuzzy system lies in the way these production rules are given a precise mathematical meaning so that the resulting system can generalise to produce an appropriate output for previously unseen inputs. However, fuzzy systems have a serious drawback when applied to many applications, their rules are often very difficult or even impossible to determine. This has motivated the development of adaptive fuzzy systems which adjust their rule base parameters via heuristic training rules about which little can be proved. Recently the similarities between neural networks and fuzzy systems have been noted, allowing the positive attributes of both approaches to be combined. The result is termed a neurofuzzy system since it embodies the well established modelling and learning capabilities of a neural networks with the transparent knowledge representation of fuzzy systems. In particular, it has been shown that B-spline networks and certain forms of fuzzy system are equivalent. Unfortunately, these conventional lattice based neurofuzzy systems are limited to problems involving only a small number of inputs. Modelling in high dimensions is difficult due to a phenomenum called the curse of dimensionality, a term first introduced by Bellman in 1961, and which has plagued researchers from many disciplines ever since. The curse can be explained by considering the number of data points need to maintain the same sampling density as the input dimension rises. For example, if the domain of interest is the unit hypercube D = [0,1]^n and the required resolution is 0.1 then a minimum of 10^n observations must be stored. Obtaining and storing such a large training set quickly becomes infeasible for n>4. There have many attempts to alleviate the curse of dimensionality and in particular, much progress has been made in the field of statistics. A straightforward and popular approach is to try to exploit structural information which is known (either a priori or is discovered during the training process) about the form of the desired function. For example, an ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) decomposition for an n dimensional function f(x), is expressed as: f(x) = f_0 + ... where f_0 is the bias and the remaining terms represent the combinations of univariate, bivariate, e.t.c. subfunctions that additively decompose the function f. An ANOVA decomposition describes the relationship between the different input variables but it is only useful if the interactions involving more than say four inputs are identically zero. This constraint could limit the potential for applying an ANOVA representation but often an adequate approximation is still obtained. The question must be asked: are all the nonlinear features important or will a model composed of simple subfunctions suffice? An immediate advantage of the ANOVA representation is that each subfunction can be a lattice based neurofuzzy system and so network transparency is retained. Also, the output is a linear function of the concatenated weight vectors for each subfunction which means the training algorithms derived for conventional neurofuzzy systems still apply. The potential reduction in the number of fuzzy rules can be illustrated by considering the approximation of Powell's function, a system with four inputs and one output. This function is an ideal candidate for an ANOVA decomposition since it contains four, two-dimensional subfunctions. If seven basis functions are used on each axis, the ANOVA system will use approximately 200 rules whereas a conventional neurofuzzy system uses over 2000, the majority of which are redundant.", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1487967663", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["60722468", "60747287"], "inbound_citations": ["18003965", "2118650", "9539209"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13848573"}

To lower associated mortality and morbidity rates, early diagnosis as well as improved understanding of underlying biological mechanisms are essential. Here, metabolic investigations of biofluids by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the context of nephrology are presented to facilitate earlier detection and to enable new insights into renal disease manifestation. The detection of novel low-molecular-weight factors for improved early diagnosis and patient ::: treatment in the context of acute kidney injury (AKI) was successfully conducted in a prospective study of 85 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) use. One-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectral data sets of filtered ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma specimens collected 24 h after surgery were subjected to Random Forests based classification with t-test based feature filtering to prognosticate AKI. An average overall prognostication accuracy of 80 \u00b1 0.9% with a corresponding area under the receiver-operating ::: characteristic curve of 0.87 \u00b1 0.01 could be obtained with, on average, 24 \u00b1 2.8 spectral features. ::: The set of discriminative ions and molecules included Mg2+, lactate and the glucuronide conjugate of propofol, an anesthetic agent which had been administered to all patients during surgery. In AKI patients, increased levels of propofol-glucuronide seem to be a surrogate marker for reduced glomerular filtration, whereas an elevation of Mg2+ levels might be explained by its use for the treatment of cardiac arrythmias, and ischemic injury as well as systemic hypoperfusion present in this group might be linked to elevated lactate levels. Furthermore, this thesis presents a novel endogenous biomarker panel consisting of absolutely quantified EDTA plasma concentrations of Mg2+, creatinine, and lactate, which would offer a reliable and swift diagnostic tool for the early detection of AKI after cardiac surgery with CPB use only requiring easily implementable point-of-care technologies. This biomarker panel was further employed ::: to derive a novel Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) index score, which illustrated that the metabolic profile of patients diagnosed with mildest renal injury was very similar to that of ::: patients not developing AKI. ::: This study was further utilized to elucidate the importance of appropriate data normalization prior to statistical analysis, which proofed to be crucial for correct data interpretation. ::: The second part of this thesis presents first statistical data analysis results of 1D 1H NMR spectra of EDTA plasma or urine specimens, respectively, from two large-scale clinical trials on chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Distinct differences in metabolic fingerprints between various leading renal diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis, in the GCKD study, or associated with adverse patient outcome in the TREAT study could be detected by t-tests in concordance with standard clinical pathologies of CKD. Additionally, the prediction of future kidney performance, which is crucial for improved ::: patient care, with regression models based on either NMR derived EDTA plasma metabolic fingerprints or clinical parameters both assessed two years before was conducted within the GCKD study.

The accuracy of the predictor is 90.18% using jack knife test and 88.87% using 10-fold cross validation on the benchmark dataset. The accuracy of the predictor on the independent dataset is 80.64% which is also significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods. iDNAProt-ES is a novel prediction method that uses evolutionary and structural based features.

Evidence from literature indicates that forecasting techniques can be a robust approach to address this inventory management challenge. The purpose of this study is to propose an inventory forecasting solution based on time series data mining techniques applied to transactional data of medical consumptions. Four different machine learning algorithms for time series analysis were explored and their forecasting accuracy estimates were compared. Results reveal that Gaussian Processes (GP) produced better results compared to other explored techniques (Support Vector Machine Regression (SMOreg), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Linear Regression (LR)) for four weeks ahead prediction.

Classicists maintain that the level of analysis defined by the Classical architecture is the level of analysis at which psychological theorizing should reside. This level is called the symbolic level. On the other hand, Connectionists claim that the proper level of analysis for cognitive modeling is at the subsymbolic level which is considered a level lower than the symbolic level. This thesis argues that both Classicism and Connectionism characterized in the above way are single-level approaches. It is argued in this thesis that Classicism is wrong in denying the cognitive relevancy of the lower-level theorizing; and some forms of Connectionism should be rejected because they underestimate the theoretical significance of the higher-level modeling. ::: The concept of level is widely employed by philosophers and cognitive scientists, but has not received sufficient analysis. This thesis offers a general theory of levels, and evaluates Classicism and Connectionism on the basis of this general theory of levels. Basically this thesis argues that a cognitive system should be regarded as a system organized into a hierarchy of levels of organization. Different levels of organization may demand different levels of analysis. This thesis argues that each level of analysis enjoys a degree of autonomy, i.e., it is not totally reducible to the lower-level analysis. The traditional dichotomy of the cognitive and the implementational levels is too simplistic and overlooks the complexity of a cognitive system. Not all levels of organization of a system are cognitively relevant. But much empirical evidence has shown that many levels of organization are either strongly relevant or at least weakly relevant to cognitive modeling. It would be theoretically more plausible and fruitful to adopt a multi-level approach which takes many levels of analysis seriously in cognitive modeling.

Several statistical classification models and data mining methods are compared in order to determine the best prediction model. In particular these approaches are classical logistic regression, discriminant analysis, regularized regression with different lasso penalties, classification trees, Boosting (with trees and regressions), Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Neural Nets. To honestly assess the method performance, 50-fold random splits into training and test data are used. The best methods create an AUC (area under the curve) of approximately 0.7, which justifies the confidence in the predictive power of the data and the used covariates. But no dominant method, that highly outperformed the others, results. Thus, to assess the important covariates, a synthesis of the best prediction models is given, with substantial interpretation due to an extended logistic regression comprising interactions and non-parametric modeling of covariate effects. This approach suggests that higher mother\u2019s age prevents from LTFU. The same holds for mothers already having a HDSS-ID (health and demographic surveillance system identification) at enrolment. Salaried working mothers without a HDSS-ID should be avoided; here Farmers are preferred (regarding mother\u2019s occupation). Furthermore, families with lower socio-economic status regarding housing type or education level should be favored, as well as mothers with less additional children for whom it is advantageous to be recruited as soon as possible (lower infant\u2019s age). These results can help in creating better retention strategies for future trials. From a methodic point of view, it is important that classical logistic regression was among the best models, which not only justifies the application in similar data situations, but helps in deriving the right conclusion, as this method supports detailed interpretation of covariate influence.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5282/ubm/epub.21439", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2111790475", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14079035"}

Most of the current regression models assume that the distribution of error is Gaussian, which corresponds to the squared loss function and has helpful analytical properties such as easy computation and analysis. However, in many real world applications, most observations are subject to unknown noise distributions, so the Gaussian distribution may not be a useful choice. The developed SVR model with the parameterized lncosh loss provides a possibility of learning a loss function leading to a regression model which is maximum likelihood optimal for a specific input-output data. The SVR models obtained with different parameter choices of lncosh loss with \u03b5-insensitiveness feature, possess most of the desirable characteristics of well-known loss functions such as Vapnik's loss, the Squared loss, and Huber's loss function as special cases. In other words, it is observed in the extensive simulations that the mentioned lncosh loss function is entirely controlled by a single adjustable \u03bb parameter and as a result, it allows switching between different losses depending on the choice of \u03bb.

Since no single method may work in every situation, several methods need to be combined and robots have to select the appropriate one automatically. In this paper we propose a scheme to classify situations depending on the characteristics of the object of interest and user demand. We classify situations into four groups and employ different techniques for each. We use Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) in conjunction with Support Vector Machine (SVM) using intensity, color, and Gabor features for five object categories. We show that the use of appropriate features is important for the use of KPCA and SVM based techniques on different kinds of objects. Through experiments we show that by using our categorization scheme a service robot can select an appropriate feature and method, and considerably improve its recognition performance.

A total of 14 gait features were extracted and analyzed. The performance of six representative classification models: Multilayer Perceptron MLP, KStar, Support Vector Machine SVM, Naive Bayesian NB, C4.5 Decision Trees, and Random Forests were evaluated in terms of their ability to discriminate between younger and older adults climbing up- and downstairs. MLP was found to provide the highest accuracy for classification. Accuracy of 95.7% was found for classifying a subject walking either up or down the stairs and an accuracy of 80.6% for classifying whether the subject was younger or older. An evaluation of individual features showed poor performance of classification for younger and older subjects climbing up- and downstairs, and in most cases failed to distinguish between the two classes. To access which set of features derived from a triaxial accelerometer can better describe the performance differences between younger and older adults climbing up- and downstairs, two feature selection algorithms, sequential feature selection and correlation-based feature selection, were implemented. Results show that 10 features derived from correlation-based feature selection were able to produce a 96.8% accuracy for classification between subjects climbing up and down.

The efficiency of the DLNN model was estimated for the Kon Tum Province, Viet Nam, an area characterized by the presence of landslide phenomena. Nine landslide related variables, elevation, slope angle, aspect, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, distance to faults, distance to geology boundaries, lithology cover, and 1,657 landslide locations, were used so as to produce the training and validation datasets during the landslide susceptibility assessment. The Frequency Ratio method was used so as to estimate the existing relation between the landslide-related variables and the presence of landslides, assigning to each variable class a weight value. Based on the results concerning the predictive ability of the landslide related variables which was evaluated using the Information ration method, all variables were further processed since they appear as highly predictive. The learning ability of the DLNN model has been evaluated and compared with a Multi Layer Preceptron Neural Network, a Support Vector Machine, a C4.5-Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model using the training dataset, whereas the predictive performance of each model has been evaluated and compared using the validation datasets. In order to evaluate their learning and predictive capacity of each model the classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC) were calculated.

However, learning from synthetic faces may not achieve the desired performance due to the discrepancy betwedistributions of the synthetic and real face images. To narrow this gap, we propose a Dual-Agent Generative Adversarial Network (DA-GAN) model, which can improve the realism of a face simulator's output using unlabeled real faces while preserving the identity information during the realism refinement. The dual agents are specially designed for distinguishing real versus fake and identities simultaneously. In particular, we employ an off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate profile face images with varying poses. DA-GAN leverages a fully convolutional network as the generator to generate high-resolution images and an auto-encoder as the discriminator with the dual agents. Besides the novel architecture, we make several key modifications to the standard GAN to preserve pose, texture as well as identity, and stabilize the training process: (i) a pose perception loss; (ii) an identity perception loss; (iii) an adversarial loss with a boundary equilibrium regularization term. Experimental results show that DA-GAN not only achieves outstanding perceptual results but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts on the large-scale and challenging NIST IJB-A and CFP unconstrained face recognition benchmarks.

The measured CO2 concentration suffers from serious spikes. We find that pre-smoothing the CO2 data can greatly improve the estimation accuracy. In real applications, however, we cannot obtain the real-time globally smoothed CO2 data. We provide a way to use the locally smoothed CO2 data instead, which is real-time available.

Careful setting of Deep learning parameters is of paramount importance in order to avoid the overfitting unlike conventional methods with limited parameter settings.

Despite the progress of previous work, generating summaries, which are informative, grammatically correct and diverse, remains challenging in practice. In this paper, we present a Plausibility-promoting Generative Adversarial Network for Abstractive Text Summarization with Multi-Task constraint (PGAN-ATSMT), which shows promising performance for generating informative, grammatically correct, and novel summaries. First, PGAN-ATSMT adopts a plausibility-promoting generative adversarial network, which jointly trains a discriminative model D and a generative model G via adversarial learning. The generative model G employs the sequence-to-sequence architecture as its backbone, taking as input the original text and generating a corresponding summary. A novel language model based discriminator D is proposed to distinguish the generated summaries by G from the ground truth summaries without the saturation issue in the previous binary classifier discriminator. The generative model G and the discriminative model D are learned with a minimax two-player game, thus this adversarial process can eventually adjust G to produce high-quality and plausible summaries. Second, we propose two extended regularizations for the generative model G using the multi-task learning, sharing its LSTM encoder and LSTM decoder with text categorization task and syntax annotation task, respectively. The auxiliary tasks help to improve the quality of locating salient information of a document and generate high-quality summaries from language modeling perspective alleviating the issues of incomplete sentences and duplicated words.

Synthetic FLAIR images were created with the SyMRI software. Acquired data were divided into 30 training and 10 test datasets. A conditional generative adversarial network was trained to generate improved FLAIR images from raw synthetic MR imaging data using conventional FLAIR images as targets. The peak signal-to-noise ratio, normalized root mean square error, and the Dice index of MS lesion maps were calculated for synthetic and deep learning FLAIR images against conventional FLAIR images, respectively. Lesion conspicuity and the existence of artifacts were visually assessed. RESULTS: The peak signal-to-noise ratio and normalized root mean square error were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in generated-versus-synthetic FLAIR images in aggregate intracranial tissues and all tissue segments (all P P = 1 and .59, respectively). Generated FLAIR images showed fewer granular artifacts ( P = .003) and swelling artifacts (in all cases) than synthetic FLAIR images.

Unlike existing methods, our features represent spectral characteristics of speech in perceptual bands and also track temporal content omitting any linguistic segmentation. Despite conventional methods, we aim to model transitions between non-sleepy and sleepy modes rather than emotional states. Along with the proposed compact feature set, the developed system enable discrimination of medium term speaker states with a lower complexity compared to existing systems. This is achieved by constructing a dictionary for speech data based on bag-of-words concept. It has been identified that a training setup which is based on learned codewords, yields a robust classifier for sleepy speech. The speaker state classification has been performed by applying a two-class classification scheme on the observed test data. The numerical results, obtained on the Sleepy Language Corpus (SLC) by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier, demonstrate a 10% improvement on average on unweighted recall rates compared to the benchmarking results.

The presence of mobile devices with integrated cameras is growing at an unrelenting pace, resulting in the majority of digital images coming from this kind of device. Technological development not only facilitates the generation of these images, but also the malicious manipulation of them. Therefore, it is of interest to have tools that allow the device that has generated a certain digital image to be identified. The digital image source can be identified through the features that the generating device permeates it with during the creation process. In recent years most research on techniques for identifying the source has focused solely on traditional cameras. The forensic analysis techniques of digital images generated by mobile devices are therefore of particular importance since they have specific characteristics which allow for better results, and forensic techniques for digital images generated by another kind of device are often not valid. This thesis provides various contributions in two of the main research lines of forensic analysis, the field of identification techniques and the counter-forensics or attacks on these techniques. In the field of digital image source acquisition identification techniques, both closed and open scenarios are addressed. In closed scenarios, the images whose acquisition source are to be determined belong to a group of devices known a priori. Meanwhile, an open scenario is one in which the images under analysis belong to a set of devices that is not known a priori by the fo rensic analyst. In this case, the objective is not t he concrete image acquisition source identification, but their classification into groups whose images all belong to the same mobile device. The image clustering t echniques are of particular interest in real situations since in many cases the forensic analyst does not know a priori which devices have generated certain images. Firstly, techniques for identifying the device type (computer, scanner or digital camera of the mobile device) or class (make and model) of the image acquisition source in mobile devices are proposed, which are two relevant branches of forensic analysis of mobile device images. An approach based on different types of image features and Support Vector Machine as a classifier is presented. Secondly, a technique for the ident ification in open scenarios that consists of grouping digital images of mobile devices according to the acquisition source is developed, that is to say, a class-grouping of all input images is performed. The proposal is based on the combination of hierarchical grouping and flat grouping using the Sensor Pattern Noise. Lastly, in the area of att acks on forensic t echniques, topics related to the robustness of the image source identificat ion forensic techniques are addressed. For this, two new algorithms based on the sensor noise and the wavelet transform are designed, one for the destruction of t he image identity and another for its fo rgery. Results obtained by the two algorithms were compared with other tools designed for the same purpose. It is worth mentioning that the solution presented in this work requires less amount and complexity of input data than the tools to which it was compared. Finally, these identification t echniques have been included in a tool for the forensic analysis of digital images of mobile devices called Theia. Among the different branches of forensic analysis, Theia focuses mainly on the trustworthy identification of make and model of the mobile camera that generated a given image. All proposed algorithms have been implemented and integrated in Theia thus strengthening its functionality.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2930197255", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131872618"}

The benefits of livestock breeders are usually closely related to the weight of their animals. In this paper we present a method to anticipate the weight of each animal provided we know the past evolution of the herd. Our approach exploits the geometrical relationships of the trajectories of weights along the time. Starting from a collection of data from a set of animals, we learn a family of parallel functions that fits the whole data set, instead of having one regression function for each individual. In this way, our method enables animals with only one or a few weights to have an accurate estimation of their future evolution. Thus, we learn a function F defined on the space of weights and time that separates the trajectories in such a way that F has constant values on each trajectory. The key point is that the specification of F can be done in terms of ordering constraints, in the same way as preference functions or ordinal regressors. Therefore, F can be obtained from a classification SVM (Support Vector Machines). To evaluate the method, we have used a collection of real world data sets of bovines of different breeds and ages.

These benefits of multi-modality with unimodal biometric based systems are obtained by fusing multiple biometric traits.

We employed signal processing methods to extract features from the HRV signal. Since HRV signals are of nonlinear nature, we made use of Higher Order Spectrum HOS based features for analysis. In this paper, we have extracted the HOS features from HRV signals corresponding to normal and diabetic subjects. These selected features were fed independently to seven classifiers namely Gaussian Mixture Model GMM, Support Vector Machine SVM, NaiveBayes classifier NB, K-Nearest Neighbour KNN, Probabilistic Neural Network PNN, Fuzzy classifier and Decision Tree DT classifier. The performance of these classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve measures.

Such methods aim to reduce server energy consumption, cooling requirements, carbon footprint, and so on, thereby leading to improved holistic sustainability of the overall server infrastructure. At the core of many of these methods lie reliable workload-prediction techniques that guide in identifying servers, time intervals, and other parameters that are needed for building sustainability solutions based on techniques like virtualization and server consolidation for server systems. Many workload prediction methods have been proposed in the recent paper, but unfortunately they do not deal adequately with the issues that arise specifically in large-scale server systems, viz., extensive nonstationarity of server workloads, and massive online streaming data. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing two online ensemble learning methods for workload prediction, which address these issues in large-scale server systems. The proposed algorithms are motivated from the weighted majority and simulatable experts approaches, which we extend and adapt to the large-scale workload prediction problem.

All key research directions, e.g., the study of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD/IBS, indicate the need for bioinformatics methods that can model the complexity of the microbial communities ecology and unravel its disease-associated perturbations. A most promising direction is the \u201cmeta-omics\u201d approach, that allows a profiling based on various biological molecules at the metagenomic scale (e.g., metaproteomics, metametabolomics) as well as different \u201cmicrobial\u201d omes (eukaryotes and viruses) within a system biology approach. This thesis introduces a bioinformatic framework for microbiota datasets that combines predictive profiling, differential network analysis and meta-omics integration. In detail, the framework identifies biomarkers discriminating amongst clinical phenotypes, through machine learning techniques (Random Forest or SVM) based on a complete Data Analysis Protocol derived by two initiatives funded by FDA: the MicroArray Quality Control-II and Sequencing Quality Control projects. The biomarkers are interpreted in terms of biological networks: the framework provides a setup for networks inference, quantification of networks differences based on the glocal Hamming and Ipsen-Mikhailov (HIM) distance and detection of network communities. The differential analysis of networks allows the study of microbiota structural organization as well as the evolving trajectories of microbial communities associated to the dynamics of the target phenotypes. Moreover, the framework combines a novel similarity network fusion method and machine learning to identify biomarkers from the integration of multiple meta-omics data. The framework implementation requires only standard open source computational biology tools, as a combination of R/Bioconductor and Python functions. In particular, full scripts for meta-omics integration are available in a GitHub repository to ease reuse (https://github.com/AleZandona/INF). The pipeline has been validated on original data from three different clinical datasets. First, the predictive profiling and the network differential analysis have been applied on a pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) cohort (in faecal vs biopsy environments) and controls, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team at the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu (Rome, I). Then, the meta-omics integration has been tested on a paired bacterial and fungal gut microbiota human IBD datasets from the Gastroenterology Department of the Saint Antoine Hospital (Paris, F), thanks to the collaboration with \u201cCommensals and Probiotics-Host Interactions\u201d team at INRA (Jouy-en-Josas, F). Finally, the framework has been validated on a bacterial-fungal gut microbiota dataset from children affected by Rett syndrome.

Besides, clinical practice can take advantage of our framework, given the reproducibility and robustness of results, ensured by the adopted Data Analysis Protocol, as well as the biological relevance of the findings, confirmed by the clinical collaborators.

Both CNN and COSFIRE are trainable approaches that have been demonstrated to be effective in various computer vision applications. As to CNN, we use the pre-trained VGG-Face architecture and for COSFIRE we configure new COSFIRE filters from training data. Since recent literature suggests that CNNs deliver the highest accuracy rates within such problems, the hypothesis which we want to investigate in this work is whether combining CNN and COSFIRE approaches together will improve results.

To tackle the challenge of different data distributions, previous methods mine the high-level concepts (e.g., feature clusters) from original features, which shows to be suitable for the classification. The general strategies of the previous approaches are to utilize the identical concepts, the synonymous concepts or both of them as shared concepts to establish the bridge between the source and target domains. Besides the shared concepts, some methods use the different concepts for training model. Specifically, these methods assume that the identical concepts (e.g., feature clusters) in different domains can be mapped to the same example classes. However, some ambiguous concepts may exist in different domains and result in misleading classification in the target domains. Therefore, we need a general transfer learning framework, which can exploit four kinds of concepts including the identical concepts, the synonymous concepts, the different concepts and the ambiguous concepts simultaneously, for cross-domain classification.In this paper, we present a novel method, Quadruple Transfer Learning (QTL), which models these four kinds of concepts together to fit different situations on the data distributions.

Less is known about how different forest management practices influence fire severity in multi-owner landscapes, despite costly and controversial suppression of wildfires that do not acknowledge ownership boundaries. In 2013, the Douglas Complex burned over 19,000 ha of Oregon & California Railroad (O&C) lands in Southwestern Oregon, USA. O&C lands are composed of a checkerboard of private industrial and federal forestland (Bureau of Land Management, BLM) with contrasting management objectives, providing a unique experimental landscape to understand how different management practices influence wildfire severity. Leveraging Landsat based estimates of fire severity (Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio, RdNBR) and geospatial data on fire progression, weather, topography, pre-fire forest conditions, and land ownership, we asked (1) what is the relative importance of different variables driving fire severity, and (2) is intensive plantation forestry associated with higher fire severity? Using Random Forest ensemble machine learning, we found daily fire weather was the most important predictor of fire severity, followed by stand age and ownership, followed by topographic features. Estimates of pre-fire forest biomass were not an important predictor of fire severity. Adjusting for all other predictor variables in a general least squares model incorporating spatial autocorrelation, mean predicted RdNBR was higher on private industrial forests (RdNBR 521.85 \u00b1 18.67 [mean \u00b1 SE]) vs. BLM forests (398.87 \u00b1 18.23) with a much greater proportion of older forests. Our findings suggest intensive plantation forestry characterized by young forests and spatially homogenized fuels, rather than pre-fire biomass, were significant drivers of wildfire severity. This has implications for perceptions of wildfire risk, shared fire management responsibilities, and developing fire resilience for multiple objectives in multi-owner landscapes.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29698575", "doi": "10.1002/eap.1710", "venue": "Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America", "journal": "Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2800066382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["53366067", "62791376", "88723854", "202480733", "44715630", "83481140", "35260501", "140551511", "5808213", "11287431", "73562482", "85229507", "30226042", "14953216", "87586550", "133745139", "22401035", "51817342", "124590089", "89836418", "51809322", "18473364", "55999905", "14864905", "205657930", "2886414", "59943323", "84636081", "73721192", "1976151", "52085105", "14139607", "1171161", "3336266", "15582056", "153921908", "85674550", "56316751", "8690678", "20849169", "9368243", "131337727", "2106442", "84399631", "86182153", "86190724", "2210496", "15737232", "56442380", "22908029", "56067886", "55281662", "25028180", "25863816", "154946254", "85300021", "826015", "46304524", "55000500", "16811105", "2850586", "53477229", "20552798", "53687406", "16048585", "88770339", "38976063", "12617849", "553320", "53443928", "82074991", "91381624", "40016351", "128863833", "126366183"], "inbound_citations": ["91650533", "145826879", "212951845", "202672288", "52274520", "204857366", "132912878"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13852732"}

Lakes play a pivotal role in the development of cities and have major impacts on the ecosystem balancing of the area. Remote sensing techniques and advanced modeling methods make it possible to monitor natural phenomena, such as lakes\u2019 water level. The ecosystem of Urmia Lake is one of the most momentous ecosystems in Iran, which is almost close-ended and has become a global environmental issue in recent years. One of the parameters affecting this lake water level is snowfall, which has a key role in the fluctuations of its water level and water resources management. Hence, the purpose of this paper is the Urmia Lake water level estimation during 2000\u20132006 using observed water level, snow cover, direct precipitation, and evaporation. For this purpose, Support Vector Regression (SVR), which is the most outstanding kernel method (with various kernel types), has been used. Furthermore, four scenarios are considered with different variables as inputs, and the output of all scenarios is the water level of the lake. The results of training and testing data indicate the substantial impact of snow on retrieving the water level of the Urmia Lake at the desired period, and due to the complexity of the data relationships, the Gaussian kernel generally had better results. On the other hand, Quadratic and Cubic kernels did not work well.

We characterize dynamic textures as the temporal changes in spectral parameters of image sequences.

For complex dynamic data, the manifolds are usually nonlinear and we propose to use a mixture of linear subspaces to model a nonlinear manifold. These locally linear subspaces are further aligned within a global coordinate system. With the nonlinear manifold being globally parameterized, we overcome motion discontinuity problems encountered in switching linear models and dynamics. We present a nonparametric method to describe the complex dynamics of data sequences on the manifold. We also apply such approach to dynamic spatial parameters such as motion capture data.

In such cases, knowledge transfer from related domains, where labels are abundant, could greatly reduce the need for extensive labeling efforts. In this scenario, transfer learning comes in hand. In this paper, we propose Deep Variational Transfer (DVT), a variational autoencoder that transfers knowledge across domains using a shared latent Gaussian mixture model. Thanks to the combination of a semi-supervised ELBO and parameters sharing across domains, we are able to simultaneously: (i) align all supervised examples of the same class into the same latent Gaussian Mixture component, independently from their domain; (ii) predict the class of unsupervised examples from different domains and use them to better model the occurring shifts. We perform tests on MNIST and USPS digits datasets, showing DVT's ability to perform transfer learning across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we present DVT's top classification performances on the MNIST semi-supervised learning challenge. We further validate DVT on a astronomical datasets. DVT achieves states-of-the-art classification performances, transferring knowledge across real stars surveys datasets, EROS, MACHO and HiTS, .

In this context, the importance of soil is often underrepresented. Thus, we analyze and discuss the interdependency of soil and vegetation by classifying soil types and its woody cover for a region in the Senegalese Ferlo. Clustering of 28 soil parameters led to four soil types which correspond with local Wolof denotations: Dek, Bowel, Dior and Bardial. The soil types were confirmed by a Non-metric Multidimensional-Scaling (NMDS) ordination and extrapolated via a Random Forest classifier using six significant variables derived from Landsat imagery and a digital elevation model (out-of-bag error rate: 7.3%). In addition, canopy cover was modeled using Landsat and a Reduced-Major-Axis (RMA) regression (R2 = 0.81). A woody vegetation survey showed that every soil type has its own species composition. However, 29% of Bowel regions are deforested (i.e., degraded) and interviews revealed extensive environmental changes and a strong decline and local extinction of woody species. The differences between the soil types are significant, showing that vegetation changes (i.e., degradation and greening), resilience to climatic stress and human activities largely depend on soil properties. We highlight that spatial heterogeneity is an important aspect when dealing with environmental changes in the Sahel, and local knowledge can be well used to classify spatial units by means of public Earth observation data.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/land3030770", "venue": null, "journal": "Land", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1977815313", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["84285597", "84778836", "56512227", "83928545", "55078658", "86583779", "83593665", "85017686", "132764456", "40455711", "55014049", "84745027", "12207497", "145209897", "128651075", "128551318", "32863022", "123350066", "129538415", "18674044", "6361699", "89141", "131528125", "140566492"], "inbound_citations": ["55256590", "3948808", "9920908", "131839580", "846545"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17585408"}

Moreover, machine learning techniques have been proposed as tools to identify potential biomarkers and, ultimately, to support clinical diagnosis. However, few studies to date have investigated feature selection (FS) influences in OCD MRI-based classification. Methods Volumes of cortical and subcortical structures, from MRI data of 38 OCD patients (split into two groups according symptoms severity) and 36 controls, were submitted to seven feature selection algorithms. FS aims to select the most relevant and less redundant features which discriminate between two classes. Then, a classification step was applied, from which the classification performances before and after different FS were compared. For the performance evaluation, leave-one-subject-out accuracies of Support Vector Machine classifiers were considered. Results Using different FS algorithms, performance improvement was achieved for Controls vs. All OCD discrimination (19.08% of improvement reducing by 80% the amount of features), Controls vs. Low OCD (20.10%, 75%), Controls vs. High OCD (17.32%, 85%) and Low OCD vs. High OCD (10.53%, 75%). Furthermore, all algorithms pointed out classical cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuitry structures as relevant features for OCD classification. Limitations Limitations include the sample size and using only filter approaches for FS. Conclusions Our results suggest that FS positively impacts OCD classification using machine-learning techniques. Complementarily, FS algorithms were able to select biologically plausible features automatically.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28672179", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2017.06.061", "venue": "Journal of affective disorders", "journal": "Journal of affective disorders", "mag_id": "2693318660", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["150765878", "52004463", "92995427"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3687091"}

Nonetheless, despite the availability of diverse bearing fault detection methods, there is paucity of literature concerning the theoretical modelling of the bearing faults using mathematical representations. The principal goal of this communication is to build up an approach to predict ball bearing fault, including ball fault, outer race fault and inner race fault. The proposed method uses the vibration data collected from the rotating ball bearing and predicts the type of fault. The proposed method is based on wavelet decomposition method, PCA, ANFIS and SVM. The vibration data is decomposed into 3rd level wavelet components using wavelet packet decomposition; each wavelet component has been divided into several energy segments, these 3rd level wavelet components are reduced to lower level components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). ANFIS algorithm is trained using the reduced feature set as input and the type of fault as output. The trained ANFIS algorithm is validated using another set of data. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been used instead of ANFIS algorithm, the SVM based method gives more accurate prediction compared to that of ANFIS. The proposed method has been validated using the real-time data collected from the ball bearing setup. The validation results show that the proposed method exactly predicts the type of ball bearing fault. The real-time data validation results confirm the accuracy of the fault prediction method.

Community detection helps data scientists to extract meaningful information from the network (graph) so that they can use them in their analyzations. Therefore, the existence of a method that can identify communities with high performance and quality is essential. In the new parallel programming framework which is based on map-reduce, a method is proposed which can reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations while retaining scalability and fault tolerance of map-reduce.

The proposed descriptors correspond to an estimation of the pressure applied when writing using the grayscale image of the stroke. These descriptors are obtained from individual and simple graphemes, in contrast with the complexity of the handwritten stroke used in the signature processing systems. In addition, a study is presented which suggests that the combination of descriptors of simple characters improves the recognition capacity of the method. The descriptors considered correspond to different accuracy degrees of pressure distribution representation. Specifically, from the simplest representation to a more complex one, the descriptors proposed are as follows: the width of the stroke, the gray level of the grapheme skeleton, the average of the gray levels on the perpendicular line to the skeleton, and the approximation transformation coefficients of the area of the grapheme. The advantage of these descriptors is that they are invariant to scale and rotation. The descriptors performance was assessed using the original images and also reduced versions based on traditional methods such as Principal Component Analysis and Discrete Cosine Transform. For the evaluation, a one-vs-all scheme was considered which is consistent with the problem of identity verification. It was implemented with Support Vector Machine classifiers trained with K-Fold Cross Validation. The efficient search of SVM hyperparameters was performed with the heuristic optimization algorithm Simulated Annealing. The evaluation of individual simple characters gives a high average of hits and the combination of characters even improves the performance, getting closer to 100% of hits in identity verification.

To obtain a satisfactory compromise and resolve the issue of NP-hardness, most existing works have suggested employing meta-heuristic methods, such as ge-netic algorithms. In this research, we propose a novel data-driven approach for generating a single solution that com-promises multiple rules pursuing different objectives. The proposed method uses a data mining technique, namely, random forests, in order to extract the logics of several historic schedules and aggregate those. Since it involves learn-ing predictive models, future schedules with the same previous objectives can be easily and quickly obtained by ap-plying new production data into the models. The proposed approach is illustrated with a simulation study, where it appears to successfully produce a new solution showing balanced scheduling performances.

However, the state-of-the-art gk-SK runs extremely slow when we increase the dictionary size (\\(\\varSigma \\)) or allow more mismatches (M). This is because current gk-SK uses a trie-based algorithm to calculate co-occurrence of mismatched substrings resulting in a time cost proportional to \\(O(\\varSigma ^{M})\\). We propose a fast algorithm for calculating Gapped k-mer Kernel using Counting (GaKCo). GaKCo uses associative arrays to calculate the co-occurrence of substrings using cumulative counting. This algorithm is fast, scalable to larger \\(\\varSigma \\) and M, and naturally parallelizable. We provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis that compares GaKCo with the state-of-the-art gk-SK. Theoretically, the time cost of GaKCo is independent of the \\(\\varSigma ^{M}\\) term that slows down the trie-based approach. Experimentally, we observe that GaKCo achieves the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art and outperforms its speed by factors of 2, 100, and 4, on classifying sequences of DNA (5 datasets), protein (12 datasets), and character-based English text (2 datasets).

We introduce a novel method for activity recognition, which achieves high recognition rates in ADL scenarios, comparable to, or better than, the State-of-the-Art (SoA). Meaningful areas of interest, the motion boundary activity areas, are introduced for dense sampling of interest points, significantly reducing the computational cost of action representation. Interest points are tracked over time by an enhanced Kanade Lucas Tomasi (KLT) tracker and accumulated in a three-dimensional trajectory structure, where multi-scale descriptors are formed. The temporal length of trajectories is determined online in an adaptive, non ad-hoc manner, by applying sequential statistical change detection on motion features via the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) method. We thus build a multi-scale hybrid local-global appearance and motion descriptor, invariant to temporal changes, and supplemented with global location information. Encoding is performed using both standard Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) and Fisher scheme, while a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained for recognition purposes.

Over the years, many automated methods have been proposed to generate code examples by clustering and summarizing relevant code snippets extracted from a code corpus. These approaches simplify source code as method invocation sequences or feature vectors. Such simplifications only model partial aspects of the code and tend to yield inaccurate examples. We propose CodeKernel, a graph kernel based approach to the selection of API usage examples. Instead of approximating source code as method invocation sequences or feature vectors, CodeKernel represents source code as object usage graphs. Then, it clusters graphs by embedding them into a continuous space using a graph kernel. Finally, it outputs code examples by selecting a representative graph from each cluster using designed ranking metrics. Our empirical evaluation shows that CodeKernel selects more accurate code examples than the related work (MUSE and eXoaDocs).

The DDoS attack usually arises from the application layer or the network layer where the victims system and the attackers system are interconnected in a network. The effects of these attacks may vary from causing significant failures at the aimed servers to causing inconvenience for users to use a particular service. The DDoS attack brings reputation damage, productivity loss, revenue loss, and even theft for huge business firms and also for banking sectors. Hence there is a need for a good distributed denial detection and prevention technique. The major goal is to deliver optimum solution for these problems using feature analysis. When a heavy traffic flow is experienced at the targeted server, it is important to classify them as an attack or legitimate access. Therefore a novel method has been proposed for the detection of Distributed denial of service attacks through the traces in the traffic flow. A confusion matrix has been generated from these traces.

The concept drift phenomenon affects negatively the forecasting accuracy since the learned model becomes outdated after a change in the current concept.

Additionally, processing huge amounts of data recorded by modern monitoring systems may be complex and time consuming if no data mining and/or pre-processing methods are employed. Thus, features selection for FD is advisable in order to determine the optimal subset of features/variables for conducting statistical analyses or building a machine-learning model. In this work, features selection are formulated as an optimization problem. Several relevancy indices, such as Maximum Relevance (MR), Value Difference Metric (VDM), and Fit Criterion (FC), and redundancy indices such as Minimum Redundancy (mR), Redundancy VDM (RVDM), and Redundancy Fit Criterion (RFC) are combined to determine the optimal subset of features. Another approach of features selection is based on the optimal performance of the classifier, which is achieved by a classifier wrapped with genetic algorithm. Efficiency of this strategy is explored considering different classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). A Genetic algorithm (GA), as a Derivative Free Optimization (DFO) technique, has been used due to the robustness to deal with different kinds of problems. The optimal subset of obtained features has been tested with SVM, DT, KNN, and GNB for the Tennessee-Eastman process benchmark with 19 classes.

Rainfall is a prime example, as it exhibits unique characteristics of high volatility and chaotic patterns that do not exist in other time series data. Moreover, rainfall is essential for applications that surround financial securities, such as rainfall derivatives. This paper extensively evaluates a novel algorithm called Decomposition Genetic Programming (DGP), which is an algorithm that decomposes the problem of rainfall into subproblems. Decomposition allows the GP to focus on each subproblem, before combining back into the full problem. The GP does this by having a separate regression equation for each subproblem, based on the level of rainfall. As we turn our attention to subproblems, this reduces the difficulty when dealing with data sets with high volatility and extreme rainfall values, since these values can be focused on independently. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on 42 cities from Europe and the USA, and compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art (Markov chain extended with rainfall prediction), and six other popular machine learning algorithms (Genetic Programming without decomposition, Support Vector Regression, Radial Basis Neural Networks, M5 Rules, M5 Model trees, and k-Nearest Neighbours). Results show that the DGP is able to consistently and significantly outperform all other algorithms. Lastly, another contribution of this work is to discuss the effect that DGP has had on the coverage of the rainfall predictions and whether it shows robust performance across different climates.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2018.05.016", "venue": "Appl.

A variety of approaches have been proposed to resolve this problem, however, several issues still need to be addressed. In action recognition, effectively extracting and aggregating the spatial-temporal information plays a vital role to describe a video. In this research, we propose a novel approach to recognize human actions by considering both deep spatial features and handcrafted spatiotemporal features. Firstly, we extract the deep spatial features by employing a state-of-the-art deep convolutional network, namely Inception-Resnet-v2. Secondly, we introduce a novel handcrafted feature descriptor, namely Weber\u2019s law based Volume Local Gradient Ternary Pattern (WVLGTP), which brings out the spatiotemporal features. It also considers the shape information by using gradient operation. Furthermore, Weber\u2019s law based threshold value and the ternary pattern based on an adaptive local threshold is presented to effectively handle the noisy center pixel value. Besides, a multi-resolution approach for WVLGTP based on an averaging scheme is also presented. Afterward, both these extracted features are concatenated and feed to the Support Vector Machine to perform the classification.

In particular, the maintenance of rail tracks affects the traffic volume as well, and therefore it is an important issue for the management of a railway system. Accurate maintenance planning is necessary to optimize resources. The condition of railways is checked by special diagnostic trains. Because of the vast amount of data that these trains record, it is necessary to analyze these data through an appropriate decision support system (DSS). However, the most up-to-date DSSs, such as EcoTrack, are based on a binary logic with rigid thresholds and complicated algorithms with a large number of rules that restrict their flexibility in use. In addition, they adopt considerable simplifications in the rail track deterioration model. In this paper, a neurofuzzy inference engine has been implemented for a DSS to overcome these drawbacks. Based on fuzzy logic, it was able to handle thresholds expressed as a range, an approximate number, or even a verbal value. Moreover, through artificial neural networks, it was possible to obtain more precise rail track deterioration models. The results obtained with the proposed model have been clustered through a fuzzy procedure to optimize the maintenance schedule, thus grouping the interventions in space and in time.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3141/2043-06", "venue": null, "journal": "Transportation Research Record", "mag_id": "2080913161", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["110554542", "114771882", "113621691"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109975009"}

A recent technique is improved by introducing an efficient solver for the inner QP sub-problems and a preprocessing step useful to hot start the decomposition strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is evaluated by solving large-scale benchmark problems on different parallel architectures. For a parallel solution of the QP sub-problem at each decomposition iteration, a generalized variable projection method is proposed based on an adaptive step-length selection. Since this solver has the same cost per iteration and a better convergence rate than the variable projection method used in, a remarkable time reduction is observed in the sub-problems solution. The computational experiments on well known large-scale test problems showed that the new decomposition approach, based on the above improvements, outperforms the technique, in both, in serial and parallel environments and can further achieve a better scalability.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0927-5452(04)80035-2", "venue": "PARCO", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2304424527", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14402639", "961425", "8952183", "115376442", "12607429", "28637672", "14488336"], "inbound_citations": ["13616519", "18934952", "16921316", "8459314"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11463661"}

The hidden layer, representing manufacturers, converts them to products presented to market at the output layer. The activation or transfer functions used at hidden layer nodes represent economic production functions. The demand side network takes as inputs physiological, psychological, and social variables and converts them via the hidden layer to products demanded of the market at the output layer. The two networks are juxtaposed at their output layers such that the output of one network serves as target for the other network and vice versa. The resulting continuous adjustments by both networks explain economic cycles. Circular flows are enabled by connecting the input layer of one network with the input layer of the other network via the population. In this system money functions as tokens of demand that exist in counterflow to goods and services. Credit is a product generated primarily by banks.

Collaborative filtering, which uses the known preferences of a group of users to make recommendations or predictions of the unknown preferences for other users, is one of the most successful approaches to build recommendation systems. Most previous collaborative filtering approaches employ the matrix factorization techniques to learn latent user feature profiles and item feature profiles. Also many subsequent works are proposed to incorporate users' social network information and items' attributions to further improve recommendation performance under the matrix factorization framework. However, the matrix factorization based methods may not make full use of the rating information, leading to unsatisfying performance. Recently deep learning has been approved to be able to find good representations in natural language processing, image classification, and so on. Along this line, we propose a collaborative ranking framework via representation learning with pair-wise constraints (REAP for short), in which autoencoder is used to simultaneously learn the latent factors of both users and items and pair-wise ranked loss defined by (user, item) pairs is considered.

In these cases, the number of classes may become very large and at the same time many classes are associated with very few training examples.

For instance, SVM classifier performance largely relies on whether the selected kernel functions are suitable for real application data. To enhance the performance of individual classifiers, this dissertation proposes classifier fusion models using computational intelligence knowledge to combine different classifiers. The first fusion model called T1FFSVM combines multiple SVM classifiers through constructing a fuzzy logic system. T1FFSVM can be improved by tuning the fuzzy membership functions of linguistic variables using genetic algorithms. The improved model is called GFFSVM. To better handle uncertainties existing in fuzzy MFs and in classification data, T1FFSVM can also be improved by applying type-2 fuzzy logic to construct a type-2 fuzzy classifier fusion model (T2FFSVM). T1FFSVM, GFFSVM, and T2FFSVM use accuracy as a classifier performance measure. AUC (the area under an ROC curve) is proved to be a better classifier performance metric. As a comparison study, AUC-based classifier fusion models are also proposed in the dissertation. The experiments on biomedical datasets demonstrate promising performance of the proposed classifier fusion models comparing with the individual composing classifiers. The proposed classifier fusion models also demonstrate better performance than many existing classifier fusion methods. ::: The dissertation also studies one interesting phenomena in biology domain using machine learning and classifier fusion methods. That is, how protein structures and sequences are related each other. The experiments show that protein segments with similar structures also share similar sequences, which add new insights into the existing knowledge on the relation between protein sequences and structures: similar sequences share high structure similarity, but similar structures may not share high sequence similarity. ::: INDEX WORDS: Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, DNA Microarray, Protein Structures and Sequences, Classifier Fusion, Computational Intelligence, Support Vector Machines, Fuzzy Logic, Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, Classifier Performance Measure, Receiver Operating Characteristics.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "40850758", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9290501"}

While the training data is massive and training times are large, the current accuracies are very good even with reasonable small model sizes (when compared to models in image recognition tasks). However, the important task of personalizing such deep models (after a new user has downloaded the model onto his mobile device) to the writing style of the new user, resulting in an improved model with significantly higher accuracy, has not been investigated so far. It is clearly not feasible to download the massive training data for each new user, and re-train the model on the device itself (after mixing original data with the limited quantity of training samples a new user can supply). To our knowledge, it is not known so far with what adaptation technique, with what old training data (in addition to the user's new samples), how flexibly the retraining can be done on the device, how much accuracy gain can be expected, and whether the model can be simplified as a result of the retraining. In this paper we address all these important questions regarding deep network models on device: we demonstrate simple but robust continued-training techniques for adapting a pre-trained model to a specific user's writing style.

A combination of sensitive deep sequencing technology and computational algorithms is essential for virus surveillance, especially for characterizing novel- or distantly related virus strains. Here, we explore the use of profile Hidden Markov Model-defined Pfam protein domains (Pfam domains) encoded by new sequences as a Coronaviridae sequence classification tool.

The traditional methods of detection based on wired hospital monitoring systems are not suitable for the detection of long-term monitoring in outdoors.

In this thesis, we focus on the statistical methods for two aspects of genetic research: phenotype definition for diseases with complex etiology and methods for identifying potentially associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNP-SNP interactions. With regard to phenotype definition for diseases with complex etiology, we firstly investigated the effects of different statistical phenotyping approaches on the subsequent analysis. In light of the findings, and the difficulties in validating the estimated phenotype, we proposed two different methods for reconciling phenotypes of different models using Bayesian model averaging as a coherent mechanism for accounting for model uncertainty.

We review the use of Bayesian logistic regression with variable selection for SNP identification and extended the model for detecting the interaction effects for population based case-control studies.

Our work builds on variance estimates for bagging proposed by Efron (1992, 2012) that are based on the jackknife and the infinitesimal jackknife (IJ). In practice, bagged predictors are computed using a finite number B of bootstrap replicates, and working with a large B can be computationally expensive. Direct applications of jackknife and IJ estimators to bagging require B on the order of n^{1.5} bootstrap replicates to converge, where n is the size of the training set. We propose improved versions that only require B on the order of n replicates.

In RAN-LTM, not only new training data but also some memory items stored in long-term memory are trained either by a gradient descent algorithm or by solving a linear regression problem. In the latter approach, radial basis function (RBF) centers are not trained but selected based on output errors when connection weights are updated. The proposed incremental learning algorithm belongs to the latter approach where the errors not only for a training data but also for several retrieved memory items and pseudo training data are minimized to suppress the catastrophic interference. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that connection weights to be learned are restricted based on RBF activation in order to improve the efficiency in learning time and memory size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional function approximation problems in terms of approximation accuracy, learning time, and average memory size.

The automatic categorization of patent documents is the organization of such documents in digital form, thus replacing the manual time-consuming process. In this work, we proposed a system that can automatically categorize patent document by considering the structural information of the patents. Methods: We propose a three-stage mechanism for automatic categorization. In the first stage, we apply a pre-processing mechanism to reduce unwanted noise that can influence the categorization process. Such noise includes terms that have less structural meaning in the document. In the second stage, feature selection is conducted based on the term frequencies. Feature vectors are constructed from the structural information of the patent. In the third stage, classifications are conducted using a Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. Findings: It was found that the semantic structural information of a patent document is an important feature set in constructing the terms of a document for the categorization. The experimental results also show that feature reduction using Information Gain (IG) is beneficial for obtaining a higher accuracy rate in a reduced dimensional space.

The algorithm constitutes of four steps. In the first step, by applying the BoF method, the visual words of all images are calculated by inputting the extracted Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) feature vectors to the K-means clustering procedure.

Usually, learning from both labeled and unlabeled data is regarded as semi-supervised learning, where the unlabeled data and the labeled data are assumed to be generated from the same distribution. When this assumption is not satisfied, new learning paradigms are needed in order to effectively explore the information underneath the unlabeled data. This thesis consists of two parts: the first part analyzes the fundamental assumptions of semi-supervised learning and proposes a few efficient semi-supervised learning models; the second part discusses three learning frameworks in order to deal with the case that unlabeled data do not satisfy the conditions of semi-supervised learning. ::: In the first part, we deal with the unlabeled data that are in good quality and follow the conditions of semi-supervised learning. Firstly, we present a novel method for Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) by relaxing the unknown labels to the continuous variables and reducing the non-convex optimization problem to a convex semi-definite programming problem. In contrast to the previous relaxation method which involves O (n2) free parameters in the semi-definite matrix, our method takes advantage of reducing the number of free parameters to O (n), so that we can solve the optimization problem more efficiently. In addition, the proposed approach provides a tighter convex relaxation for the optimization problem in TSVM. Empirical studies on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than the previous semi-definite relaxation method and achieves promising classification results comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. Our second contribution is an extended level method proposed to efficiently solve the multiple kernel learning (MKL) problems. In particular, the level method overcomes the drawbacks of both the Semi-Infinite Linear Programming (SILP) method and the Subgradient Descent (SD) method for multiple kernel learning. Our experimental results show that the level method is able to greatly reduce the computational time of MKL over both the SD method and the SILP method. Thirdly, we discuss the connection between two fundamental assumptions in semi-supervised learning. More specifically, we show that the loss on the unlabeled data used by TSVM can be essentially viewed as an additional regularizer for the decision boundary. We further show that this additional regularizer induced by the TSVM is closely related to the regularizer introduced by the manifold regularization. Both of them can be viewed as a unified regularization framework for semi-supervised learning. ::: In the second part, we discuss how to employ the unlabeled data for building reliable classification systems in three scenarios: (1) only poorly-related unlabeled data are available, (2) good quality unlabeled data are mixed with irrelevant data and there are no prior knowledge on their composition, and (3) no unlabeled data are available but can be achieved from the Internet for text categorization. We build several frameworks to deal with the above cases. Firstly, we present a study on how to deal with the weakly-related unlabeled data, called the Supervised Self-taught Learning framework, which can transfer knowledge from the unlabeled data actively. The proposed model is able to select those discriminative features or representations, which are more appropriate for classification. Secondly, we also propose a novel framework that can learn from a mixture of unlabeled data, where good quality unlabeled data are mixed with unlabeled irrelevant samples. Moreover, we do not need the prior knowledge on which data samples are relevant or irrelevant. Consequently it is significantly different from the recent framework of semi-supervised learning with universum and the framework of Universum Support Vector Machine. As an important contribution, we have successfully formulated this new learning approach as a Semi-definite Programming problem, which can be solved in polynomial time. A series of experiments demonstrate that this novel framework has advantages over the semi-supervised learning on both synthetic and real data in many facets. Finally, for third scenario, we present a general framework for semi-supervised text categorization that collects the unlabeled documents via Web search engines and utilizes them to improve the accuracy of supervised text categorization. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed semi-supervised text categorization framework can significantly improve the classification accuracy. Specifically, the classification error is reduced by 30% averaged on the nine data sets when using Google as the search engine.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "65917906", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1077768"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35870864"}

Recently, breakthroughs have been made for traditional face recognition by applying deep learning on a huge amount of labeled VIS face samples. However, the same deep learning approach cannot be simply applied to HFR task due to large domain difference as well as insufficient pairwise images in different modalities during training. In general, the pooling layer of deep network can play the role of feature reduction, but also lead to the loss of useful face information, resulting in a decrease in the performance of HFR problem. It is important to eliminate modal-related information and retain more facial identity information. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Discriminant Deep Feature Learning Based on Joint Supervision Loss and Multi-layer Feature Fusion (DDFLJM) for HFR task. In most of the available CNNs, the softmax loss function is used as the supervision signal to train the deep model. In order to enhance the discriminative power of the deeply learned features, this paper proposes a new loss function called Scatter Loss (SL), which embeds both inter- and intra-class information for effectively training the deep model. To make full use of the various layers of the deep network, a Dimension Reduction Block (DRB) is designed to effectively extract the auxiliary features on multiple mid-level layers. An orthogonality constraint is introduced to the DRB block to reduce spectrum variations of two different modalities. The proposed SL is applied to multiple layers of network for joint supervision training, which enables multiple layers of the network to obtain discriminative identity features. Moreover, a Modified Gate Two-stream Neural Network (MGTNN) is adopted to fuse multiple-layer features.

Given an input CT volume our algorithm automatically detects and localizes the anatomical structures within, accurately and efficiently. Our technique builds upon randomized decision forests, which are enjoying much success in the machine learning and computer vision communities. Decision forests are enriched here with learned visual features which capture long-range spatial context. In this paper we focus on the detection of human organs, but our general-purpose classifier might be trained instead to detect anomalies. Applications include (and are not limited to) efficient visualization and navigation through 3D medical scans. The output of our algorithm is probabilistic thus enabling the modeling of uncertainty as well as fusion of multiple sources of information (e.g. multiple modalities).

In this work, we propose Double-Stage Action Model Acquisition (DSAMA), a system that obtains a descriptive PDDL action model with explicit preconditions and effects over the propositional variables unsupervized-learned from images. DSAMA trains a set of Random Forest rule-based classifiers and compiles them into logical formulae in PDDL. While we obtained a competitively accurate PDDL model compared to a black-box model, we observed that the resulting PDDL is too large and complex for the state-of-the-art standard planners such as Fast Downward primarily due to the PDDL-SAS+ translator bottleneck.

This study focuses on providing a unique data set of four residential houses collected from occupancy sensors.

The conventional method of linearized approximation is usually not accurate enough and tends to be affected by the background information, while the accurate method is more likely to be trapped in a local minimum and more computationally intensive. This paper delineates a novel method of AVO inversion based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). First, we describe the basic principle of SVM, and then we investigate an SVM procedure for the three-term AVO inversion problem. To demonstrate its performance, we compare it with the conventional Bayesian method. From the inversion results of both the synthetic and real data, we conclude that the algorithm of SVM leads to high-resolution P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, and density perturbation, moreover, the resolution of the density term has large improvement, compared to the Bayesian method.

For the modelling of the emotions, we considered colours features completed with other recent and efficient descriptors. We supposed that different features used could also implicitly encode high-level information about emotions. The concept of emotion is not easy to model. The perception of emotion is not only influenced by the content and the colour of the images. It is also modified by some personal experiences like cultural aspects and personal semantic associated to some colours or objects.

In order to overcome this problem, many methods have been proposed in the literature.

Although ELM has been successfully applied in different domains, its basic formulation cannot handle datasets with missing values properly. This paper presents a variant of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for datasets with missing values. In the proposed method, probability distributions for the missing values are estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, assuming that data is normally distributed. The Unscented Transform (UT) is used to estimate the values of the hidden layer outputs, and the weights of the output layer are assigned using the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse.

In this paper we question this practice and ask whether so many images are actually needed to learn the layers for which unsupervised learning works best. Our main result is that a few or even a single image together with strong data augmentation are sufficient to nearly saturate performance. Specifically, we provide an analysis for three different self-supervised feature learning methods (BiGAN, RotNet, DeepCluster) vs number of training images (1, 10, 1000) and show that we can top the accuracy for the first two convolutional layers of common networks using just a single unlabelled training image and obtain competitive results for other layers.

With the introduction of the Habitats Directive in 1992, EU member states are obligated to report every six years the status of the Natura 2000 habitats so that better conservation policy can be formulated. This paper examines the use of angular hyperspectral CHRIS/Proba image for the mapping of heathland at a Belgian Natura 2000 site. We find that the use of angular images increases the overall classification rate as compared to using only the nadir image; with the incorporation of angular images the final mapping is also more homogenous with less salt and pepper effect. While the class accuracy of Calluna- and Erica-dominated heathlands are still low, class accuracy of Molinia-dominated heathland is generally more encouraging. Two tree-based ensemble classifiers, Random Forest (RF) and Adaboost, were compared with Support Vector Machines (SVM). When only the nadir image was used, SVM attained the highest accuracy. When angular images were included, all three classifiers obtained comparable accuracies though in general RF and Adaboost had faster training time. We also adopted an assessment approach which repeats the accuracy assessment in ten independent trials, instead of the common practice of having only one trial. Our results show that accuracy attainment can vary significantly among different trials and hence it is recommendable to have more than one trial in order that a more objective characterization of the classifiers is obtained. 1", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049785", "venue": "2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "journal": "2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2114267890", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["85745747", "84012630", "43556639", "5707430", "129260885", "89141", "1836349", "62190785", "22121218", "16208472", "60993494"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7059211"}

To enhance the reality of results, couple-agent discriminators are served to distinguish fake-real pairs in both two sub-nets.

Many attempts have been made to reduce the occurrences of these accidents, but none of them has yet proved effective. With the development of infrared imaging technology, using thermal images to identify the presence of deer in night has become possible. A pattern recognition method, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), can be used to deer detection to reduce such accidents. However, the length of time required to process one image makes the method incapable of real-time deer identification and tracking. Based on the HOG method and a known classifier - Support Vector Machine (SVM), this research developed a contour based HOG + SVM method, called CNT- HOG method to process thermal images and to detect the presence of deer. Experimental results have demonstrated that this algorithm has the advantages of both high accuracy (up to 94.2%) and short computation time (0.1s) when compared to traditional HOG + SVM method. In this research, further analysis has been performed to evaluate the influence of body postures and occlusions on detection accuracy. By achieving such computation speed and accuracy, this CNT-HOG algorithm proves that deer can be tracked in real-time.

The strength of randomization in the tree induction is thus led by the hyperparameter K which plays an important role for building accurate RF classifiers. We have decided to focus our experimental study on this hyperparameter and on its influence on classification accuracy. For that purpose, we have evaluated the Forest-RI algorithm on several machine learning problems and with different settings of K in order to understand the way it acts on RF performance.

This means that some examples should be explained in the context of some information, whereas others should be explained in different contexts. In this paper, we capture this notion and present a context-dependent extension of the Learning from Ordered Answer Sets framework. In this extension, contexts can be used to further structure the background knowledge.

We demonstrate the gain in scalability by applying both algorithms to various learning tasks.

Major usage includes the storing and transporting of sensitive data over the Internet. The growth has consequently opened up a serious need for more secured network and application security protection devices. Security experts normally equip their databases with a large number of signatures to help in the detection of known web-based threats. In reality, it is almost impossible to keep updating the database with the newly identified web vulnerabilities. As such, new attacks are invisible. This research presents a novel approach of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in detecting unknown attacks on web servers using the Unified Intrusion Anomaly Detection (UIAD) approach. The unified approach consists of three components (preprocessing, statistical analysis, and classification). Initially, the process starts with the removal of irrelevant and redundant features using a novel hybrid feature selection method. Thereafter, the process continues with the application of a statistical approach to identifying traffic abnormality.

We introduce a novel perspective on AdaBoost and random forests that proposes that the two algorithms work for similar reasons. While both classifiers achieve similar predictive accuracy, random forests cannot be conceived as a direct optimization procedure. Rather, random forests is a self-averaging, interpolating algorithm which creates what we denote as a\"spikey-smooth\"classifier, and we view AdaBoost in the same light. We conjecture that both AdaBoost and random forests succeed because of this mechanism. We provide a number of examples and some theoretical justification to support this explanation.

Even if the fault point cant be located at the first time, the method can still work by repeating the process till the accurate fault position is located.

FLT3 ligand causes autocrine signaling in acute myeloid leukemia cells. Blood. 2004) and activating mutations of FLT3 are amongst the most common genetic lesions in AML (Levis M. FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia: what is the best approach in 2013? ASH Education Program Book. 2013). FLX925, a small molecule inhibitor of FLT3 would be expected to have antitumor efficacy against FLT3-driven AML tumors. However, FLX925 also inhibits two closely related cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK4 and CDK6 (described together as CDK4/6). Since CDK4/6 are important cell cycle genes and CDK4/6 inhibitors have demonstrated anti-tumor activity, the anti-CDK4/6 activity of FLX925 may drive anti-tumor efficacy in additional and potentially overlapping patient populations. To generate hypotheses about which tumors would be sensitive to FLX925 treatment and to understand the relative contributions of FLX9259s FLT3- and CDK4/6-inhibitory activities, a panel of XXX tumor-derived cell lines were screened for sensitivity to FLX925. We performed a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) analysis, a machine-learning approach, to generate a model that predicts sensitivity to FLX925 based on RNA-Seq expression data. This sensitivity model can predict which cell lines and tumors are likely to be sensitive to FLX925 and also which gene expression patterns contribute to that sensitivity. The GBM analysis was performed on 133 (75%) of the assayed cell lines with a random 45 (25%) of the cell line datasets reserved for model validation. Pearson9s correlations of r=0.96 on the test cell lines and r=0.68 on the validation cell lines were observed, indicating good predictive performance with modest overfitting. The two most important predictive genes in the model were Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) and by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A). RB1 and CDKN2A are important cell cycle genes immediately downstream and upstream, respectively, of CDK4/6, suggesting that sensitivity to FLX925 in these cell lines is driven by FLX9259s CDK4/6 inhibitory activity. To strengthen this conclusion, the modeling was repeated but gene sets covering cell cycle genes or genes in the FLT3/STAT5 signaling pathway were separately excluded from the analysis. While excluding the FLT3/STAT5 pathway genes had no impact on the predictive power of the model, excluding the cell cycle gene set completely abrogated the ability of the GBM to predict sensitivity to FLX925. Thus, we conclude that in this panel of largely FLT3-wild type (FLT3-WT) cell lines, FLX925-sensitivity is driven solely by the compound9s CDK4/6 activity. These results suggest that independent, but potentially overlapping, sets of tumors will be responsive to FLX925 due to both its FLT3- and its CDK4/6-inhibitory activities. To predict which tumor types would be most sensitive to FLX925 treatment, we applied our GBM model to the RNA-Seq expression data for 10,537 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Even though this model is indifferent to FLT3/STAT5-pathway gene expression, it nevertheless identifies AML tumors as having the highest median predicted sensitivity to FLX925. This is true even when all haem/lymph malignancy-derived cell lines are excluded from the training set. Thus, both FLT3-WT and FLT3-activated tumors are expected to have sensitivity to FLX925 treatment, the former due to FLX9259s CDK4/6 activity alone and the latter due to the independent FLT3 and CDK4/6 activities of the drug. The anti-tumor activity of FLX925 is currently being investigated in a Ph1/b dose-escalation study in subject with relapsed or refractory AML (NCT02335814).

However, it is difficult to obtain general engine model with high accuracy due to engine individual difference, lifecycle performance deterioration and modeling uncertainty. Recently, data-driven diagnostic approaches for aircraft engine become more popular with the development of machine learning technologies. While these data-driven methods to engine fault diagnosis tend to ignore experimental data sparse and uncertainty, which results in hardly achieve fast fault diagnosis for multiple patterns. This paper presents a novel data-driven diagnostic approach using Sparse Bayesian Extreme Learning Machine (SBELM) for engine fault diagnosis. This methodology addresses fast fault diagnosis without relying on engine model. To enhance the reliability of fast fault diagnosis and enlarge the detectable fault number, a SBELM-based multi-output classifier framework is designed. The reduced sparse topology of ELM is presented and utilized to fault diagnosis extended from single classifier to multi-output classifier. The effects of noise and measurement uncertainty are taken into consideration. Simulation results show the SBELM-based multi-output classifier for engine fault diagnosis is superior to the existing data-driven ones with regards to accuracy and computational efforts.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/tjj-2016-0050", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Turbo & Jet-Engines", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2521483576", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["109415071", "109727307", "112141496", "111153100", "108636296", "6128049", "109682008", "113155154", "109303405", "53351644", "123684306", "62722545", "15589402", "810240", "7596571", "18191908", "5516512", "125113539", "6723676", "19019393", "62464394", "109842554", "43765521", "109338236", "109146019"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114056879"}

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) using evolution strategies for its optimization problem frequently deliver better results with respect to the optimization criterion and the prediction accuracy. Moreover, evolutionary computation allows for the efficient large margin optimization of a huge family of new kernel functions, namely non-positive semi definite kernels as the Epanechnikov kernel. For these kernel functions, evolutionary SVM even outperform other learning methods like the Relevance Vector Machine. In this paper, we will discuss another major advantage of evolutionary SVM compared to traditional SVM solutions: we can explicitly optimize the inherent trade-off between training error and model complexity by embedding multi-objective optimization into the evolutionary SVM. This leads to three advantages: first, it is no longer necessary to tune the SVM parameter C which weighs both conflicting criteria. This is a very time-consuming task for traditional SVM. Second, the shape and size of the Pareto front give interesting insights about the complexity of the learning task at hand. Finally, the user can actually see the point where overfitting occurs and can easily select a solution from the Pareto front best suiting his or her needs.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1276958.1277323", "venue": "GECCO '07", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2076582109", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["271331", "194951", "523395", "9914171", "12512548", "8332750", "14363287", "1115550", "7367791", "105873", "9422570", "3355639", "17194652", "64543020", "117940753", "12633343", "21390567", "28637672"], "inbound_citations": ["29188518", "17599484", "58875831", "8809607", "63843509", "2131662", "18706921", "15179560", "7890157", "8112799", "6565691", "13555170", "19016201"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11805009"}

Since type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) are essential for the pathogenicity, identification of T3SEs is one of the core problems in computational biology. This paper puts forward a new method for the prediction of T3SEs. The method is a sequence-based approach which can extract useful features from amino acid sequences.

The limitations related to traditional methods of BE detection and management encourage the creation of computer-aided tools to assist in this problem. In this work, we introduce the unsupervised Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier for learning visual dictionaries in the context of Barrett\u2019s esophagus (BE) and automatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis. The proposed approach was validated in two datasets (MICCAI 2015 and Augsburg) using three different feature extractors (SIFT, SURF, and the not yet applied to the BE context A-KAZE), as well as five supervised classifiers, including two variants of the OPF, Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function and Linear kernels, and a Bayesian classifier. Concerning MICCAI 2015 dataset, the best results were obtained using unsupervised OPF for dictionary generation using supervised OPF for classification purposes and using SURF feature extractor with accuracy nearly to \\(78\\%\\) for distinguishing BE patients from adenocarcinoma ones. Regarding the Augsburg dataset, the most accurate results were also obtained using both OPF classifiers but with A-KAZE as the feature extractor with accuracy close to \\(73\\%\\). The combination of feature extraction and bag-of-visual-words techniques showed results that outperformed others obtained recently in the literature, as well as we highlight new advances in the related research area. Reinforcing the significance of this work, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first one that aimed at addressing computer-aided BE identification using bag-of-visual-words and OPF classifiers, being the application of unsupervised technique in the BE feature calculation the major contribution of this work.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) records the neurological activity in the brain and it is used to identify epilepsy. Visual inspection of EEG signals is a time-consuming process and it may lead to human error. Feature extraction and classification are two main steps that are required to build an automated epilepsy detection framework. Feature extraction reduces the dimensions of the input signal by retaining informative features and the classifier assigns a proper class label to the extracted feature vector. Our aim is to present effective feature extraction techniques for automated epileptic EEG signal classification. Methods In this study, two effective feature extraction techniques (Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern [LNDP] and One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern [1D-LGP]) have been introduced to classify epileptic EEG signals. The classification between epileptic seizure and non-seizure signals is performed using different machine learning classifiers. The benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset provided by the University of Bonn is used in this research. The classification performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. The classifiers used are the Nearest Neighbor (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiments have been repeated for 50 times. Results LNDP and 1D-LGP feature extraction techniques with ANN classifier achieved the average classification accuracy of 99.82% and 99.80%, respectively, for the classification between normal and epileptic EEG signals. Eight different experimental cases were tested. The classification results were better than those of some existing methods.

RUSBoost is an algorithm specifically designed for imbalanced classification, suitable for large data sets because it uses random undersampling of the majority class.

In this study we tested the use of digital images (DIs) to generate 3D plant reconstruction for retrieving the main plant architectural features (leaf area, leaf inclination, leaf azimuth) of olive tree branches. High resolution image of tree branches were firstly used to generate 3D reconstruction of plant structures using a Structure From Motion approach; we therefore answered the question whether these 3D models may be segmented to discriminate main plant structures (leaves and branch) proposing a simple classification algorithm (Random Forest, RF) with saliency features and color indices as predictors. Finally, on the good and robust performances of the proposed classification algorithm, the single leaves were analyzed to retrieve the relevant area, inclination and orientation and compared to the relevant observed data. The calibration of the RF model indicated that color indices better discriminated leaves and stem than the sole use of saliency features. The classification performances were further improved by tuning the scale at which saliency features were calculated and by filtering the final result to reduce misclassified points. A RF model calibrated on a single plant was successfully applied to 5 others, indicating the robustness of the calibration strategy. The analysis of single leaves, as segmented after the classification process, indicated that plant architecture was satisfactorily reproduced with strong correlations obtained between measured and calculated values of leaf inclination and azimuth, while biases were observed for leaf area. These results emphasize the effectiveness of SFM in reproducing complex arrangements of leaves like on an olive tree. The use of such a system can be therefore suggested as a first step towards an improved low cost plant phenotyping platform to speed up our understanding of plant responses to environment. Further experiments are required to test the effectiveness of the approach also under outdoor conditions.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.scienta.2016.05.021", "venue": null, "journal": "Scientia Horticulturae", "mag_id": "2424559117", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["73514250", "3542877", "37128851"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88630064"}

Eighty-one feature-matching patterns derived from cleavage type, uniqueness and variable masses of theoretical peptides together with the intensity rank of experimental peaks were proposed to characterize the matching profile of the peptide mass fingerprinting procedure. We developed a new strategy including the participation of matched peak intensity redistribution to handle shared peak intensities and 440 parameters were generated to digitalize each feature-matching pattern. A high performance for an evaluation data set of 137 items was finally achieved by the optimal multi-criteria support vector machines approach, with 491 final features out of a feature vector of 35,640 normalized features through cross training and validating a publicly available \u201cgold standard\u201d peptide mass fingerprinting data set of 1733 items.

Firstly, inherent attributes showed comparable or even greater robustness than other explicit. As an inherent attribute of an experimental spectrum, peak intensity should receive considerable attention during protein identification.

Since the detection of vehicles is the primary step of such system, there is a large body of works towards developing an efficient detection scheme on various operating conditions. However, those works mainly focus on the detection of car and pedestrian. In this paper, we shift our attention to motorbike, which is also a common road user, especially in developing country. In comparison to other target objects, motorbike is rather small in size but has more complex structure. Thus, detecting motorbike is not a trivial task in real-life context where there is variance due to presence of motorbike drivers and high degree of occlusions. To address this problem, we propose a method for detecting motorbike from the scenes. Our method can achieve robustness to changes in illuminations, affine transformations and occlusions. Firstly, local features are extracted from images which contain one single target object. These local features represent parts of objects and are used to construct a Bag-of-Visual Words model. Using this model, each object is represented as a histogram of their parts. Next, a Support Vector Machine classifier is trained with these representations for classifying motorbike and non-motorbike objects. Finally, we develop an algorithm to form a detection hypothesis to detect multiple target objects from the scene. We collect a dataset of 3000 images for evaluating our proposed method. The experimental results indicate that our method can achieve high accuracy in the context of real-life motorbike detection applications.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064450", "venue": "2014 13th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)", "journal": "2014 13th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2045991884", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3360110", "262977", "16288922", "17606900", "206590483", "15287479", "130535382", "461853", "1458265", "7211257", "163034", "42281583", "16804330"], "inbound_citations": ["51936652", "52111193", "6191059"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15152275"}

Secondly, the statistic values of these features about each tested image are calculated, it is used for deciding the weight value of corresponding image with the training model.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotherapy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter and intraobserver variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) and shows that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, cost-sensitive SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is applied to these different classi?cation tasks in di?erent domains with major focus in medical and Bioinformatics domains. In ?at classi?cation, a single class label is associated with a sample (in the dataset) and the class labels have no relationship with each other. On the other hand for hierarchical classi?cation, ?rstly, there are usually more than one class labels associated with a sample and secondly, the class labels to be predicted are related (parent-child relationship) and organized based on a class hierarchy. From a data mining perspective, all these characteristics associated with hierarchical classi?cation makes it more challenging and complex task as compared to ?at classi?cation. Several well known classi?ers cannot handle hierarchical classi?cation problems, including but not limited to decision tree, Support Vector Machine, Logit, Ripper etc. ::: Although, current ACO based classi?cation algorithms (also known as AntMiners) are able to cope with ?at single and multi-label as well as hierarchical single and multi-label classi?cation problems but they ignore the interaction and correlation between the attributes, which is their major limitation to gain better achievable performance. In this research work, new classi?ers are proposed and evaluated based on a number of performance aspects in comparison to the most recent and accurate classi?cation algorithms, available in the literature, for di?erent types of classi?cation problems. ::: First, a new ant-based classi?cation technique called AntMiner-CC is proposed for ordered rule list induction that uses the correlation of attribute value pairs to assist the learning, carried out using ACO. Following the same stream of work, two variants of AntMiner-CC are investigated for ?at single label classi?cation. Second, in order to cope with single path hierarchical classi?cation problems (discussed later), a new algorithm called hAntMiner-C is proposed. Third, to cater with complex multi-label hierarchical classi?cation task, a new classi?er called hmAntMiner-C is proposed and applied to protein function prediction problem. Experiments over large datasets (containing hundreds of attributes and thousands of class labels and data samples) validate the superiority of hmAntMiner-C as compared to recent available hierarchical multi-label classi?ers. ::: The underlying reason of why the proposed approaches perform better is the usage of feature interaction and feature correlation in exploration of better classi?cation rules which were previously unexplored and therefore can be considered as original contribution of this research work.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2768188866", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:65312733"}

Using an encoding-decoding network that learns to predict future 3D poses from the most recent past, we extract a feature representation of human motion. Most work on deep learning for sequence prediction focuses on video and speech. Since skeletal data has a different structure, we present and evaluate different network architectures that make different assumptions about time dependencies and limb correlations. To quantify the learned features, we use the output of different layers for action classification and visualize the receptive fields of the network units. Our method outperforms the recent state of the art in skeletal motion prediction even though these use action specific training data.

To provide more comprehensive supports in computing the similarity, we integrate structural features of the networks together with biological characteristics during the alignment. For the structural features, we apply on PPI networks a representation learning method, which creates a low-dimensional vector embedding with the surrounding topologies of each protein in the network. This approach quantifies the structural features, and provides a new way to determine the topological similarity of the networks by transferring which as calculations in vector similarities.

The proposed ELSIM-PCDS is established by hybridizing the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms. In this new paradigm, the SMOTE is specifically used to deal with the imbalanced classification problem. The LS-SVM acts as a supervised learning technique for learning the classification boundary that separates the default and non-default contractors. Additionally, the DE algorithm automatically searches for the optimal parameters of the classification model.

Drift adaptation has not yet been addressed in high dimensional, noisy, low-context data such as streaming text, video, or images due to the unique challenges these domains present. We present a two-fold approach to deal with concept drift in these domains: a density-based clustering approach to deal with virtual concept drift (change in statistical properties of features) and a weak-supervision step to deal with real concept drift (change in statistical properties of target). Our density-based clustering avoids problems posed by the curse of dimensionality to create an evolving 'map' of the live data space, thereby addressing virtual drift in features. Our weak-supervision step leverages high-confidence labels (oracle or heuristic labels) to generate weighted training sets to generalize and update existing deep learners to adapt to changing decision boundaries (real drift) and create new deep learners for unseen regions of the data space.

Results : The BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, WHR and diastolic blood pressure in MetS patients with NAFLD were significantly higher than patients without NAFLD ( P 0.05).

Conclusion : This research shows the incidence of abdominal obese and hyperlipidemia to be significantly higher in MetS patients with NAFLD than that observed in those without NAFLD.

Partitioning determines the in-memory layout of a graph, which affects locality, intertask load balance, communication time, and overall memory utilization.

We used a hierarchical classification with four levels, from land cover to crop rotation classes. Most of the classes showed accuracies higher than 90%. Single crop and Non-commercial crop classes presented lower accuracies.

The model utilises a set of neural networks for pattern recognition and a connectionist production system (CPS) for a higher level processing. Fuzzy rules for language processing are realised in the CPS. The whole process of speech recognition and language processing is considered to be one integrated process having two tightly coupled and interacting phases without a rigid, crisp border between them. The fuzziness and the ambiguity at the border line between the pattern matching and language understanding can be well represented in CPS. It facilitates flexible reasoning over fuzzy linguistic rules. An experiment on phonemes and digits recognition in English language is given for illustration.

Nonetheless, it is a challenging task in spatially and spectrally heterogeneous river environments, commonly characterized by high spatiotemporal variations in morphology, bed material, and bank cover. In this study, we investigate the influence of channel morphology and bank characteristics on the delineation of water surface boundaries in rivers using high spatial resolution passive remote sensing and a template-matching (object-based) algorithm, and compare its efficacy with that of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (pixel-based) algorithm. We perform a detailed quantitative evaluation of boundary-delineation accuracy using spatially explicit error maps in tandem with the spatial maps of geomorphic and bank classes. Results show that template matching is more successful than SVM in delineating water surface boundaries in river sections with spatially challenging geomorphic landforms (e.g. sediment bar structures, partially submerged sediment deposits) and shallow water conditions. However, overall delineation accuracy by SVM is higher than that of template matching (without iterative hierarchical learning). Vegetation and water indices, especially when combined with texture information, improve the accuracy of template matching, for example, in river sections with overhanging trees and shadows \u2013 the two most problematic conditions in water surface boundary delineation. By identifying the influence of channel morphology and bank characteristics on water surface boundary mapping, this study helps determine river sections with higher uncertainty in delineation. In turn, the most suitable methods and data sets can be selectively utilized to improve geomorphic/hydraulic characterization. The methodology developed here can also be applied to similar studies on other geomorphic landforms including floodplains, wetlands, lakes, and coastlines.

We consider imitation learning in relational domains, in which there is a varying number of objects and relations among them. In prior work, simple relational policies are learned by viewing imitation learning as supervised learning of a function from states to actions. For propositional worlds, functional gradient methods have been proved to be beneficial. They are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient, more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the form of the function. Building on recent generalizations of functional gradient boosting to relational representations, we implement a functional gradient boosting approach to imitation learning in relational domains. In particular, given a set of traces from the human teacher, our system learns a policy in the form of a set of relational regression trees that additively approximate the functional gradients. The use of multiple additive trees combined with relational representation allows for learning more expressive policies than what has been done before.

We compared several approaches for imputing the response variables BA and TD, aggregated at the plot-scale and species-level, from topographic and canopy structure predictor variables derived from discrete-return airborne LiDAR data. The predictor and response variables were associated using imputation techniques based on normalized and unnormalized Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (aka Most Similar Neighbor, or MSN), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (aka Gradient Nearest Neighbor, or GNN), and Random Forest (RF).

We found that RF produced the best results overall, especially after reducing the number of response variables to the most important species in each plot with regard to BA and TD.

The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null,

The major problems here are the non-uniform occurrence of class instances and the unbalanced numbers of samples per class. We show that standard online learning methods based on decision trees perform comparably bad for such data streams, which are however particularly relevant for mobile robots that need to learn semantics persistently.

Resulting respiration data were assimilated into a 3-pool model to derive decomposition kinetic parameters for fast, slow, and passive SOC pools. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal taxa and microbial functional genes were profiled throughout the 3-year incubation. Correlation analyses and a Random Forest approach revealed associations between model parameters and microbial community profiles, taxa, and traits. There were more associations between the microbial community data and the SOC decomposition parameters of slow and passive SOC pools than those of the fast SOC pool.

GPR data interpretation requires expertise from human operator which is a time consuming and costly task as the data amount can be enormously large. In this study, a framework that pairs up Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed to detect subsurface targets in GPR data automatically. HOG feature descriptors are extracted by characterizing the target appearance and shape from hyperbolic signatures that appear in GPR images. Extracted feature descriptors are then sent to SVM for classification. Contribution of this research includes designing the best SVM classifier model by considering the best kernel and its optimized parameter settings. The proposed algorithm is compared to the most commonly used approach (Hough Transform) to evaluate its performance. In this research, the data sets consist of images that are collected using different GPR system models. Despite having limited sample images for training, the proposed method managed to detect hyperbolic signatures in GPR images. SVM classifier with probabilistic estimation model shows better performance for its flexibility in decision making using confidence level while SVM without probabilistic estimation model shows high false positive rate of more than 50%. Moreover, results from the experiments have also shown that the proposed method is able to produce higher detection rate with a much lower false positive rate than that of Hough Transform. The accuracy of target detection using the proposed method records an average detection rate of 89.40% and 7.38% of false positive rate for all the data sets used in this research.

Visually searching for patterns by similarity is often challenging because of the large search space, the visual complexity of patterns, and the user\u2019s perception of similarity. For example, in genomics, researchers try to link patterns in multivariate sequential data to cellular or pathogenic processes, but a lack of ground truth and high variance makes automatic pattern detection unreliable. We have developed a convolutional autoencoder for unsupervised representation learning of regions in sequential data that can capture more visual details of complex patterns compared to existing similarity measures. Using this learned representation as features of the sequential data, our accompanying visual query system enables interactive feedback-driven adjustments of the pattern search to adapt to the users\u2019 perceived similarity. Using an active learning sampling strategy, Peax collects user-generated binary relevance feedback. This feedback is used to train a model for binary classification, to ultimately find other regions that exhibit patterns similar to the search target. We demonstrate Peax\u2019s features through a case study in genomics and report on a user study with eight domain experts to assess the usability and usefulness of Peax. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of the learned feature representation for visual similarity search in two additional user studies.

Existing work like Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) can effectively restore the texture details of the image. However, experimentally verified that the texture details of the image recovered by the SRGAN are not robust.

This paper proposes an approach for the classification of leaf, based on the characterization of texture, shape, and color properties. An original plant leaf is preprocessed initially using the cellular automata (CA) filter to minimize the noise. For enhancing the contrast and quality of the image, the histogram equalization and ROI segmentation are applied respectively. The GLCM and the LBP systems are introduced for the extraction of features. It has the issues of lower accuracy and recognition rate. The proposed feature extraction techniques overcome the difficulties faced by the existing method. The feature comprises of Haralick texture based features, Gabor features, shape features, and color features. The features are extracted from each leaf image, which increases the time complexity. Subsequently, the kernel-based PSO is presented to overwhelm the above issue of selecting the optimum features. Finally, the Fuzzy Relevance Vector Machine (FRVM) is employed to characterize the type of leaves. The main objective of the proposed FRVM classification is to accurately predict the type of leaf from the given input leaf images.

It is found that these methods have been applied for specific fluids like oil, gas and water, for different layout patterns like straight and zigzag, for various lengths of pipeline like short and long and also depending on various operating conditions. Therefore, a comparison among all methods has been done based on their applicability. Among all fault detection methods, Acoustic reflectometry is found most suitable because of its proficiency to identify blockages and leakage in pipe as small as 1% of its diameter.

In this study, we (i) compare different preprocessing techniques on the data collected from Twitter using various techniques such as (stemming, lemmatization and spelling correction) to obtain the efficient method (ii) develop an algorithm to weight the scores of the hashtag and cleaned text to obtain the sentiment. We retrieved N=1,314,000 Twitter data, and we compared the popularity of two products, Google Now and Amazon Alexa. Using our data preprocessing algorithm and sentiment weight score algorithm, we train SVM, DL, NB models. The results show that stemming technique performed best in terms of computational speed. Additionally, the accuracy of the algorithm was tested against manually sorted sentiments and sentiments produced before text data preprocessing. The result demonstrated that the impact produced by the algorithm was close to the manually annotated sentiments. In terms of model performance, the SVM performed better with the accuracy of 90.3%, perhaps, due to the unstructured nature of Twitter data.

In this paper, we investigate a simulation-based approach to optimize the aircraft re-routing process, by considering multiple sources of uncertainty. The proposed approach has four main components: system simulation, uncertainty representation, aircraft re-routing algorithm, and system performance assessment. Several sources of uncertainty are accounted for in this approach, related to incoming aircraft, space availability in neighboring airports, radar performance, and communication delays. An aircraft re-routing optimization model is formulated to make periodic re-routing decisions with the objective of minimizing the overall distance travelled by all the aircraft, subject to the system resources. We analyze the performance of this aircraft re-routing system using system failure time as the metric. Since the simulation time is limited, right-censored data arises with respect to system failure time. A novel methodology is developed to compute the lower bound of system failure time in the presence of right-censored data, and to analyze the sensitivity of the system performance metric to the uncertain variables relating to the aircraft, radars, nearby airports, and communication system. Since the simulation is time-consuming, we build a Support Vector Regression (SVR) surrogate model to efficiently construct the system failure time distribution. We model the aircraft re-routing using a dynamic simulation-based approach.Multiple sources of uncertainty sources are considered in this process.The proposed methodology provides novel insights into how uncertainty propagates through the system.A data-driven sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the contribution of uncertain model inputs on the output variability.A support vector regression surrogate model is constructed to predict the system performance distribution.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.dss.2017.02.005", "venue": "Decis.

We revisit the stream discovered in Meingast et al (2019) to search for new members, using Gaia DR2 data and a machine learning approach. We use a bagging classifier of one-class Support Vector Machines to perform a search in positions and proper motions for new stream members. We use the variable prediction frequency resulting from the multitude of classifiers to estimate a stream membership criterion which we use to select high fidelity sources. We use the HR diagram and the Cartesian velocity distribution as test and validation tools. We find about 2000 stream members with high-fidelity, or about an order of magnitude more than previously known, unveiling the stream's population across the entire stellar mass spectrum, from B-stars to M-stars, including white dwarfs. We find that, apart from being slightly more metal-poor, the HRD of the stream is indistinguishable from that of the Pleiades cluster. For the mass range at which we are mostly complete, $\\sim$0.2 M$_\\odot$ $ < $ M $ < $ $\\sim$4 M$_\\odot$, we find a normal IMF, allowing us to estimate the total mass of stream to be about 2000 M$_\\odot$, making this relatively young stream by far the most massive known. In addition, we identify several white dwarfs as potential stream members. The nearby Meingast 1 stream, due to its richness, age, and distance, is a new fundamental laboratory for star and planet formation and evolution studies for the poorly studied gravitationally unbound star-formation mode.

To solve these problems, data mining techniques are mostly applied to the prediction of single concrete performance but not multiple mechanical properties. This research compares four data mining models in predicting the mechanical properties of hydraulic concrete in the form of combined damming. These models involve a linear regression model (Bayesian Ridge), an advanced predictive model (Gaussian Processes), a regression tree model (Decision Trees) and an ensemble learning regression model (Gradient Boosting). The performance measures of these techniques are evaluated on the basis of the concrete data from the combined damming engineering. The results show that ensemble regression model (Gradient Boosting) performs higher accuracy, better measures, and stronger robustness than the other three types of prediction models used to predict the mechanical properties of hydraulic concrete. The feature importance of concrete components derived from Gradient Boosting is analyzed and validated by conclusions of previous studies.

In this work we introduce a semisupervised approach that can tackle multi-level bRE via string comparisons with mismatches in the string kernel framework. Our string kernel implements an abstraction step, which groups similar words to generate more abstract entities, which can be learnt with unlabeled data. Specifically, two unsupervised models are proposed to capture contextual (local or global) semantic similarities between words from a large unannotated corpus. This Abstraction-augmented String Kernel (ASK) allows for better generalization of patterns learned from annotated data and provides a unified framework for solving bRE with multiple degrees of detail.

The ship dynamic model is directly derived from our previous work which has been well verified and validated. The outliers are detected by introducing the robust estimation method namely the $3\\sigma $ principle and then deleted from the training data. The weighted version of LS-SVR (WLS-SVR) with spareness and robustness ability is used as the fundamental identification approach. To improve the performance of the WLS-SVR, the structural parameters involved in it are optimized by utilizing the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), and the weights of it are adaptively set with the use of the adaptive weight method. Two case studies including the simulation study on a container ship and the experimental study on an Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) are carried out to test the proposed hybrid intelligent identification method. The simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness and the acceptable time complexity in terms of the engineering application of the proposed identification method through the comparison with the cross-validation method and particle swarm optimization algorithm optimized LS-SVR. In the experimental study, ABC-LSSVR, ABC-LSSVR with the $3\\sigma $ principle (D-ABC-LSSVR), ABC-LSSVR with the adaptive weight (ABC-AWLSSVR), and ABC-LSSVR with both the $3\\sigma $ principle and the adaptive weight (D-ABC-AWLSSVR) are applied to identify the steering model for the USV.

In spite of its benefit of increasing crop yields, the booming expansion of the plastic mulching area has been changing the landscape patterns and affecting the environment. Accurate and effective mapping of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) can provide useful information for leveraging its advantages and disadvantages. However, mapping the PMF with remote sensing is still challenging owing to its varying spectral characteristics with the crop growth and geographic spatial division. In this paper, we investigated the potential of Radarsat-2 data for mapping PMF. We obtained the backscattering intensity of different polarizations and multiple polarimetric decomposition descriptors. These remotely-sensed information was used as input features for Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results indicated that the features from Radarsat-2 data have great potential for mapping PMF. The overall accuracies of PMF mapping with Radarsat-2 data were close to 75%. Although the classification accuracy with the back-scattering intensity information alone was relatively lower owing to the inherent speckle noise in SAR data, it has been improved significantly by introducing the polarimetric decomposition descriptors. The accuracy was nearly 75%. In addition, the features derived from the Entropy/Anisotropy/Alpha (H/A/Alpha) polarimetric decomposition, such as Alpha, entropy, and so on, made a greater contribution to PMF mapping than the Freeman decomposition, Krogager decomposition and the Yamaguchi4 decomposition. The performances of different classifiers were also compared. In this study, the RF classifier performed better than the SVM classifier. However, it is expected that the classification accuracy of PMF with SAR remote sensing data can be improved by combining SAR remote sensing data with optical remote sensing data.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs9121264", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2774350017", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["25419953", "130319624", "21150963", "20790860", "24914192", "3110565", "24239357", "126835028", "128599834", "129238260", "109729507", "128883330", "94954764", "131460786", "121407983", "681759", "14691640", "28275953", "61861942", "125090474", "128471830", "52248854", "294496", "18216385", "29188118", "205657134", "64000181", "874140", "205656467", "12513822", "2462964", "18254397", "5619984", "46340547", "22185553", "130076070", "133288964", "7044977", "129281451", "9051097", "129651912", "5433037", "10094317", "27545358", "129022625", "62527324", "9655660", "130118146", "42852118", "2371388", "39909196", "60985554", "62527324", "9655660", "130118146", "42852118", "2371388", "39909196", "60985554", "52831439", "44182237", "62527324", "9655660", "130118146", "42852118", "2371388", "39909196", "60985554", "52831439", "44182237", "52831439", "44182237"], "inbound_citations": ["56482090"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40474492"}

In this regard, clustering algorithms based on type-1 fuzzy set theory are suitable for the overlapping partitions while the rough set based clustering algorithms deal with uncertainty and vagueness. However, additional degree of fuzziness makes the clustering more challenging for various subtle uncertainties and noisy data in the overlapping areas. Hence, this fact motivates us to propose a hybrid technique, called Rough Possibilistic Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means clustering with the integration of Random Forest. In the proposed method, possibilistic approach handles the noisy data better, whereas the other various uncertainties and inherent vagueness are taken care by type-2 fuzzy set and rough set theories. After clustering, it produces rough and crisp points. Thereafter, such crisp points are used to train the Random Forest classifier in order to classify the rough points for yielding better clustering solution. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated in comparison with several other recently proposed methods for MR brain image segmentation. Finally, superiority of the results produced by the proposed hybrid method has also been validated through statistical significance test.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2016.01.040", "venue": "Appl.

Different from traditional ELM-AE (designed based on data information X only), SELM-AE is designed based on both data information X and label information T. In detail, SELM-AE not only minimizes the reconstruction error of input data but also minimizes the intra-class distance and maximizes the inter-class distance in the new feature space. Under this way, the new data representation extracted by proposed SELM-AE is more discriminative than traditional ELM-AE for further classification. Then multiple SELM-AEs are stacked layer by layer to develop a new multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network called ML-SAE-ELM. Benefit from SELM-AE, the proposed ML-SAE-ELM is highly effective on classification than ELM-AE based MLP. Moreover, different from ELM-AE based MLP that requires large number of hidden nodes to achieve satisfactory accuracy, ML-SAE-ELM usually takes very small number of hidden nodes on both feature learning and classification stages to achieve better accuracy, which highly lightens the network memory requirement. The proposed method has been evaluated over 13 benchmark binary and multi-class datasets and one complicated image dataset. As shown in the experimental results, through the visualization of data representation, the proposed SELM-AE extracts more discriminative data representation than ELM-AE.

One of these technologies wireless sensor network has emerged in many areas and has gained a large popularity because of its great capabilities and functionalities. Wireless sensor network shortly named as WSN, is a network made by grouping some or many sensor nodes, technically known as motes, which are able to make communication with each other within the network range for performing many different tasks when needed and colleting the necessary information for achieving the purposed goal of that network and then forward that complete information to the base station of that network, technically called sink. In recent years WSN has made its presence in most of the areas for example military applications, medical applications and industrial areas. As WSN is being widely used but there is still many problems are present in WSN. Some problems of WSN are maximum target coverage problem, most energy efficient network and fault tolerant network. For effective communication it is necessary to cover most of the targets and also use optimum path to connect nodes so that network lifetime could be increased. Main concern of target coverage problem is the random deployment of the sensor network for supervising the specific targets for rising the life span of the network it also dictates that how much efficiently the monitoring and sensor tracking of any sensor network works.. To increase the lifetime of the network an optimal node deployment scheme is required that would minimize the cost of the network, reduce the energy consumption and resilient to node. In this paper we have proposed a system that can be used to solve all these issues after reviewing some previous researches in this field. In this work we will use a hybrid approach of merging some important algorithms and approaches to design a system that can solve these issues. Our system will work in two phases: First, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to achieve optimum result and second, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to achieve a fault tolerant energy efficient network.

MRS, however, is affected by the issue of the Partial Volume Effect (PVE), where the signals of multiple tissue types can be found within a single voxel and provides an obstacle to the interpretation of the data. The PVE results from the low resolution achieved in MV-MRS images relating to the signal to noise ratio (SNR). To counteract PVE, this paper proposes a novel Pairwise Mixture Model (PMM), that extends a recently reported Signal Mixture Model (SMM) for representing the MV-MRS signal as normal, low or high grade tissue types. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF) and its continuous variant the PMM incorporates the surrounding voxel neighbourhood into an optimisation problem, the solution of which provides an estimation to a set of coefficients. The values of the estimated coefficients represents the amount of each tissue type (normal, low or high) found within a voxel. These coefficients can then be visualised as a nosological rendering using a coloured grid representing the MV-MRS image overlaid on top of a structural image, such as a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI). Experimental results show an accuracy of 92.69% in classifying patient tumours as either low or high grade compared against the histopathology for each patient.

While most of the existing methods deal with edges as pairwise relationships, only a few studies have been proposed for hyper-networks to capture more complicated tuplewise relationships among multiple nodes. A hyper-network is a network where each edge, called hyperedge, connects an arbitrary number of nodes. Different from conventional networks, hyper-networks have certain degrees of indecomposability such that the nodes in a subset of a hyperedge may not possess a strong relationship. That is the main reason why traditional algorithms fail in learning representations in hyper-networks by simply decomposing hyperedges into pairwise relationships. In this paper, we firstly define a metric to depict the degrees of indecomposability for hyper-networks. Then we propose a new concept called hyper-path and design hyper-path-based random walks to preserve the structural information of hyper-networks according to the analysis of the indecomposability. Then a carefully designed algorithm, Hyper-gram, utilizes these random walks to capture both pairwise relationships and tuplewise relationships in the whole hyper-networks.

This interaction raises several interesting questions concerning the representation of knowledge, the construction of communication structures and the study of social interaction mechanisms.

A framework for multiagent learning, MALEF (To\u017eicka et al, 2008), proposes the exchange of meta-level descriptions of the learning process of each agent that contain, among other elements, the hypothesis (i.e., the reasoning mechanism of the agent). This thesis focuses on how can an agent integrate an external hypothesis (i.e., the reasoning mechanism of another agent) into its own hypothesis. We propose a formal definition of hypothesis and integration of hypotheses compatible with the formalization of MALEF. Based on those definitions, a method for the integration of heterogeneous hypotheses is derived. The performance of the method is verified in several experiments of multiagent learning scenarios where agents using our method perform consistently better than agents keeping their initial hypothesis unaltered. The scenarios vary in terms of the difficulty of the dataset and of the main objectives.

It is very desirable to monitor the health condition and the performance degradation for rail vehicle suspension systems online, which offers the important information of the suspension system and it is critically important for the condition based maintenance rather than scheduled maintenance in the future. Advanced fault diagnosis method is one of the most effective means for the health monitoring of rail suspension systems. In this paper, taking the lateral suspension system as an example, the fault isolation issue for different component faults occurring in the suspension system is concerned. The sensor configuration for obtaining the state information for fault diagnosis and the mathematical model for the lateral suspension system are presented. Three different methods, Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, Fisher Discrimination Analysis (FDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques are applied to the fault isolation problem, respectively. Simulation study is carried out by means of the professional multi-body simulation tool, SIMPACK. The simulation results show that these methods can isolate the considered component faults effectively with a high accuracy.

To make effective use of this data, it is very beneficial to select a reduced number of genes which can be used for tasks like classification.

Several Data Mining Classifiers have been proposed recently to predict/identify the cancer patterns. In this research work, we have focused and studied a few Classification Techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Neighbor Classifier (k-NN), ICS4, Non-Parallel Plane Proximal Classifier (NPPC), NPPC-SVM and Margin-based Feature Elimination-SVM (MFE-SVM). The performances of these classifiers have been analysed in terms of Threshold Level, Execution Time, Memory Usage and Memory Utilization. From our experimental results, we revealed that the Threshold level and Execution Time to predict the Cancer Patterns are different for different Classifiers. Our experimental results established that among the above identified classifiers, the k-NN classifier achieves less Threshold to predict the cancer pattern, but however it consumes more execution time, whereas the MFE-SVM achieves less execution time to predict the cancer pattern, but it still needs more threshold to predict the Pattern. That is to find the best single classifier in terms of Threshold and Execution Time is still complicated. To address this major issue, we had proposed an efficient Classifier called Maximizing Feature Elimination Technique based Hybrid Classifier (MFE-HC), which is the combination of both k-NN and SVM classifiers. From the results, it was established that our proposed work performs better than both the k-NN and MFE-SVM Classifiers in terms of Threshold and Execution Time.

Then, an active contour model is applied to segment the rest of the image into photo and background regions. Finally, text candidates are clustered using mean-shift analysis technique according to their corresponding sizes. The method is applied for segmenting scanned document images (newspapers and magazines) that contain text, lines and photo regions. ::: Finally, I describe our stroke-based text extraction method. Our approach begins by extracting connected components and selecting text character candidates over the CIE LCH color space using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) correlation coefficients in order to detect low contrasted regions. The text region candidates are clustered using two different approaches ; a depth first search approach over a graph, and a stable text line criterion. Finally, the resulted regions are refined by classifying the text line candidates into \u00ab text\u00bb and \u00ab non-text \u00bb regions using a Kernel Support Vector Machine K-SVM classifier", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2945384212", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21717266"}

To concern the most important issues, which are real-time and resource efficiency, we propose a high efficiency hardware implementation for TSR. We divide the TSR procedure into two stages, detection and recognition. In the detection stage, under the assumption that most German traffic signs have red or blue colors with circle, triangle or rectangle shapes, we use Normalized RGB color transform and Single-Pass Connected Component Labeling (CCL) to find the potential traffic signs efficiently. For Single-Pass CCL, our contribution is to eliminate the \u201cmerge-stack\u201d operations by recording connected relations of region in the scan phase and updating the labels in the iterating phase. In the recognition stage, the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is used to generate the descriptor of the signs, and we classify the signs with Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the HOG module, we analyze the required minimum bits under different recognition rate. The proposed method achieves 96.61% detection rate and 90.85% recognition rate while testing with the GTSDB dataset. Our hardware implementation reduces the storage of CCL and simplifies the HOG computation. Main CCL storage size is reduced by 20% comparing to the most advanced design under typical condition. By using TSMC 90 nm technology, the proposed design operates at 105 MHz clock rate and processes in 135 fps with the image size of 1360 \u00d7 800. The chip size is about 1 mm2 and the power consumption is close to 8 mW.

In this perspective paper we highlight the potential of the one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM) as an unsupervised or exploratory approach that can be used to create normative rules in a multivariate sense. In contrast with the standard SVM that finds an optimal boundary separating two classes (discriminating boundary), the OC-SVM finds the boundary enclosing a specific class (characteristic boundary). If the OC-SVM is trained with patterns of healthy control subjects, the distance to the boundary can be interpreted as an abnormality score. This score might allow quantification of symptom severity or provide insights about subgroups of patients.

However, the enhancement of the diversity is at the expense of reducing the accuracies of individual classifiers in general and, thus, how to balance the diversity and accuracies is crucial for improving the ensemble performance. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble method which exploits the correlation between individual classifiers and their corresponding weights by constructing a joint optimization model to achieve the tradeoff between the diversity and the accuracy. Specifically, the proposed framework can be modeled as a shallow network and efficiently trained by the end-to-end manner.

Furthermore, the sparsity constraint is imposed on the weight to enforce that partial individual classifiers are selected for final classification. Finally, the experimental results on the UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the performance of classification compared with relevant existing ensemble methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31425063", "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2019.2931071", "venue": "IEEE transactions on cybernetics", "journal": "IEEE transactions on cybernetics", "mag_id": "2968660735", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201099467"}

In Digital Classics, these tasks are traditionally solved in a (i) cascaded and (ii) lexicon-dependent fashion. For example, a lexicon is used to generate all the potential lemma-tag pairs for a token, and next, a context-aware PoS-tagger is used to select the most appropriate tag-lemma pair.

Most current models for spoken language understanding assume (i) word-aligned semantic annotations as in sequence taggers and (ii) delexicalisation, or a mapping of input words to domain-specific concepts using heuristics that try to capture morphological variation but that do not scale to other domains nor to language variation (e.g., morphology, synonyms, paraphrasing).

Given a document as the input, document-level sentiment analysis aims to automatically classify its sentiment/opinion (such as thumbs up or thumbs down) based on the textural information. Despite the success of feature engineering in many previous studies, the hand-coded features do not well capture the semantics of texts. In this research, we argue that learning sentiment-specific semantic representations of documents is crucial for document-level sentiment analysis. We decompose the document semantics into four cascaded constitutes: (1) word representation, (2) sentence structure, (3) sentence composition and (4) document composition. Specifically, we learn sentiment-specific word representations, which simultaneously encode the contexts of words and the sentiment supervisions of texts into the continuous representation space. According to the principle of compositionality, we learn sentiment-specific sentence structures and sentence-level composition functions to produce the representation of each sentence based on the representations of the words it contains.

The temporal correlation and spectral similarity between multitemporal images have opened up an opportunity to alleviate this problem. In this study, a SVM-based Sequential Classifier Training (SCT-SVM) approach is proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image classification. The approach leverages the classifiers of previous images to reduce the required number of training samples for the classifier training of an incoming image. For each incoming image, a rough classifier is firstly predicted based on the temporal trend of a set of previous classifiers. The predicted classifier is then fine-tuned into a more accurate position with current training samples. This approach can be applied progressively to sequential image data, with only a small number of training samples being required from each image. Experiments were conducted with Sentinel-2A multitemporal data over an agricultural area in Australia. Results showed that the proposed SCT-SVM achieved better classification accuracies compared with two state-of-the-art model transfer algorithms.

Most of the works related to gender classification has been for English based content in the social media. Work for other languages, such as Arabic, is almost next to none. Typically people express themselves in the social media using colloquial, so this study is geared towards the identification of genders using the Saudi dialect of the Arabic language. To solve the gender identification problem the authors, a novel method called k-Top Vector k-TV, which is based on the k-top words based on the words occurrences and the frequency of the stems, was introduced. Part of this work required compiling a dataset of Saudi dialect words. For this, a well-known widely used social site was relied on. To test the system, we compiled 1200 samples equally split between both genders.

Especially for firms, having an early warning system for currency crises will enable them to plan raw material requirements, production or service capacity, stock levels, marketing strategies and cash requirements. With a good plan negative effects of crises can be minimized. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an early warning system to predict the currency crisis. In this study, a data set covering the period of January 1992 - December 2011 of Turkish economy is used, and an early warning system has been developed with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression Models. Financial Pressure Index (FPI) is calculated as a result of percentage changes in dollar exchange rate, gross foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank, and overnight interest rate. Financial Pressure Index is used as the dependent (crises) variable, while thirty-two macro-economic indicators are used as the independent variables. Three models, which are tested in Turkish case, have given clear signals anticipating 1994 and 2001 crises 12 months before. In addition, all three of the model predictions of a currency crisis, according to Turkey's economy, are not expected (ceteris paribus) until the end of 2012.

These models will then be used, by a strong classifier, to correctly distinguish shadows. To prevent misclassifications from corrupting the results of both classifiers, spatial and temporal dependencies are also taken into account. Based on a Conditional Random Field (CRF), spatial/temporal dependencies in traffic scenes are formulated under a probabilistic discriminative framework, where contextual constraints during the detection process can be adaptively adjusted in terms of data-dependent neighborhood interaction. To meet real-time requirements the CRF energy function is minimized using the Dynamic Graph Cut algorithm (DGC) for the st-mincut/maxflow problem. This fast and fully dynamic algorithm uses the solution of the previous graph cut computation for solving the new instance of the problem. Our solution is data-driven and recursively adapts the shadow models to the changing conditions. The accuracy improves as it processes frames that contain shadows and is not limited by preset values.

This method separates image feature extraction and classification into two steps for classification operation. The deep learning model has a powerful learning ability, which integrates the feature extraction and classification process into a whole to complete the image classification test, which can effectively improve the image classification accuracy. However, this method has the following problems in the application process: first, it is impossible to effectively approximate the complex functions in the deep learning model. Second, the deep learning model comes with a low classifier with low accuracy. So, this paper introduces the idea of sparse representation into the architecture of the deep learning network and comprehensively utilizes the sparse representation of well multidimensional data linear decomposition ability and the deep structural advantages of multilayer nonlinear mapping to complete the complex function approximation in the deep learning model. And a sparse representation classification method based on the optimized kernel function is proposed to replace the classifier in the deep learning model, thereby improving the image classification effect. Therefore, this paper proposes an image classification algorithm based on the stacked sparse coding depth learning model-optimized kernel function nonnegative sparse representation. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only has a higher average accuracy than other mainstream methods but also can be good adapted to various image databases. Compared with other deep learning methods, it can better solve the problems of complex function approximation and poor classifier effect, thus further improving image classification accuracy.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2020/7607612", "venue": "Scientific Programming", "journal": "Scientific Programming", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3004319599", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15486640", "206592766", "1318470", "10328909", "10716717", "47252984", "2227746", "12289712", "973101", "17615903", "4193807", "2510693", "14543254", "4004450", "3767412", "1412315", "22514900", "34856165", "21427918", "5258236", "130535382", "125823534", "16689126", "533055", "308212", "15006683", "15584821", "38633737", "1658773", "195908774", "14124313", "206770307", "5856281", "64673948", "15484977", "18290774", "17666380", "111838731", "64224888", "59606130", "4234245", "1424102", "3680335", "57201300", "7523372", "10840552", "899238", "206597351", "4071727", "207796551", "1027825"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211545235"}

Cataract and corneal arcus are the major abnormalities that exist in the anterior segment eye region of aged people. Hence, computer-aided diagnosis of anterior segment eye abnormalities will be helpful for mass screening and grading in ophthalmology. In this paper, we propose a multiclass computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using visible wavelength (VW) eye images to diagnose anterior segment eye abnormalities. In the proposed method, the input VW eye images are pre-processed for specular reflection removal and the iris circle region is segmented using a circular Hough Transform (CHT)-based approach. The first-order statistical features and wavelet-based features are extracted from the segmented iris circle and used for classification. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) by Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm was used for the classification. In experiments, we used 228 VW eye images that belong to three different classes of anterior segment eye abnormalities. The proposed method achieved a predictive accuracy of 96.96% with 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significant potential for use in clinical applications.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29860586", "doi": "10.1007/s10916-018-0980-z", "venue": "Journal of medical systems", "journal": "Journal of medical systems", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195666135"}
