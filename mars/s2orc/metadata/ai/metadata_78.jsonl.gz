In this work, we study the practicality of leveraging machine learning methods for early detection of MRSA infections based on a rich variety of patient information commonly available in modern Electronic Health Records (EHR). We explore heterogeneous types of data in EHRs including on-admission demographics, throughout-stay time series and free-form clinical notes. On-admission data capture non-clinical information (e.g., age, marital status) while Throughout-stay data include vital signs, medications, laboratory studies, and other clinical assessments. Clinical notes, free-from text documents created by medical professionals, contain expert observations about patients. Our proposed system generates dense patient-level representations for each data type, extracting features from each of our data types. It then generates scores for each patient, indicating their risk of acquiring MRSA. We evaluate prediction performance achieved by core Machine Learning methods, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, when mining these different types of EHR data retrospectively to detect patterns predictive of MRSA infection. We evaluate classification performance using MIMIC III \u2013 a critical care data set comprised of 12 years of patient records from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Intensive Care Unit in Boston, MA.

Furthermore, it calculates the entropy to mine the informative subgraphs instead of just mining the frequent subgraphs, which enables selecting the more accurate features for the classification.

The hyperspectral data was initially corrected for atmospheric effects using MODTRAN based FLAASH module and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation was applied to reduce data dimensionality. The threshold Eigen value of 1.76 in VNIR region and 1.68 in the SWIR region was used for selection of 145 stable bands. Advanced per pixel classifiers viz. , Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used for general urban land cover classification. Accuracy assessment of the classified data revealed that SVM was quite superior (82.4 per cent) for urban land cover classification as compared to SAM (67.1 per cent). Selecting training samples using end members significantly improved the classification accuracy by 20.1 per cent in SVM. The land cover classification using multispectral LISS-III data using SVM showed lower accuracy mainly due to limitation of spectral resolution.

Due to their nature, Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs) are hard to discover during software testing and are also challenging to reproduce. Therefore, automatically predicting ARBs before software release can help developers reduce ARB impact or avoid ARBs. Many bug prediction approaches have been proposed, and most of them show effectiveness in within-project prediction settings. However, due to the low presence and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, it is usually hard to collect sufficient training data to build an accurate prediction model. A recent work proposed a method named Transfer Learning based Aging-related bug Prediction (TLAP) for performing cross-project ARB prediction. Although this method considerably improves cross-project ARB prediction performance, it has been observed that its prediction result is affected by several key factors, such as the normalization methods, kernel functions, and machine learning classifiers. Therefore, this paper presents the first empirical study to examine the impact of these factors on the effectiveness of cross-project ARB prediction in terms of single-factor pattern, bigram pattern, and triplet pattern and validates the results with the Scott-Knott test technique. We find that kernel functions and classifiers are key factors affecting the effectiveness of cross-project ARB prediction, while normalization methods do not show statistical influence. In addition, the order of values in three single-factor patterns is maintained in three bigram patterns and one triplet pattern to a large extent. Similarly, the order of values in the three bigram patterns is also maintained in the triplet pattern.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11219-019-09460-7", "venue": "Software Quality Journal", "journal": "Software Quality Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2980853106", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18710036", "7540730", "47926", "30088593", "14804446", "35983023", "15027564", "7573685", "16206114", "6324563", "18039006", "18693205", "3185465", "11527276", "14687975", "206778480", "57146809", "6992832", "15980354", "10792564", "2861651", "32356339", "15171249", "54842956", "6630416", "47388286", "3432368", "7990285", "205435802", "32017442", "1638564", "15922689", "61740386", "16074379", "1770555", "5740922", "11067362", "1555189", "740063", "59566327", "13499137", "126133208", "18477840", "12549681", "125165001", "18253785", "12783877", "13405112", "124273988", "5970619", "10482384", "15105513", "18257062", "10269506", "18120932", "17038159"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204707415"}

However, the obvious intermittency and randomness of wind speed results in the fluctuation of the output power in a wind farm, seriously affecting the power quality. Therefore, the accurate prediction of wind power in advance can improve the ability of wind-power integration and enhance the reliability of the power system. In this paper, a model of wavelet decomposition (WD) and weighted random forest (WRF) optimized by the niche immune lion algorithm (NILA-WRF) is presented for ultra-short-term wind power prediction. Firstly, the original serials of wind speed and power are decomposed into several sub-serials by WD because the original serials have no obvious day characteristics. Then, the model parameters are set and the model trained with the sub-serials of wind speed and wind power decomposed. Finally, the WD-NILA-WRF model is used to predict the wind power of the relative sub-serials and the result is reconstructed to obtain the final prediction result. The WD-NILA-WRF model combines the advantage of each single model, which uses WD for signal de-noising, and uses the niche immune lion algorithm (NILA) to improve the model\u2019s optimization efficiency. In this paper, two empirical analyses are carried out to prove the accuracy of the model, and the experimental results verify the proposed model\u2019s validity and superiority compared with the back propagation neural network (BP neural network), support vector machine (SVM), RF and NILA-RF, indicating that the proposed method is superior in cases influenced by noise and unstable factors, and possesses an excellent generalization ability and robustness.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en11051098", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2799436787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["111371837", "111118582", "111537530", "5040026", "34844601", "2557260", "35942881", "113724970", "111230359", "108960701", "9270633", "114273352", "108902222", "123085358", "2346342", "36339437", "17984055", "111070844", "116681261", "25307319", "111010559", "6747781", "16146861", "38397636", "56392626", "114792819", "115809330", "10140327", "1226383", "125692234", "33534625"], "inbound_citations": ["182786465", "201883959", "115438679", "111383153", "159384512"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54924750"}

Also a technique for detecting faces in color images using AdaBoost algorithm combined with skin colour segmentation. First,skin colour model in the YCbCr chrominance space is built to segment the non-skin-colour pixels from the image. Then, mathematical morphological operators are used to remove noisy regions and fill holes in the skin-color region, so we can extract candidate human face regions. Finally,these face candidates are scanned by cascade classifier based on AdaBoost for more accurate face detection. This system can also detect human face in different scales, various poses, different expressions, lighting conditions, and orientation. Experimental results show the proposed system obtains competitive results and improves detection performance substantially.

INTRODUCTION Given the rather ambitious task of developing a robust face tracking algorithm which could be seamlessly integrated with Saya\u2019s vision system, we embarked on a journey of exploration of the various techniques kindly available for research. In light of the fact that first attempts at face detection date back to the late 90\u2019s, the amountof data archived so far was quite overwhelming. Our first attempts included subtraction of subsequent frames and subtraction of frames against a predefined background. These ideas failed to achieve the basic goals and where quickly banned.The next attempt was to implement a method based on skin color filtering in chromatic color space and Gaussianskin color model[1][2]. This method was chosen mostly for it\u2019s ability to be unaffected by luminosity changes. While looking promising at first and given a great deal of attention and effort, it was also rejected in favor of a method based on Haar-like features[3] which will be discussed in this report. There is substantial study based on the topic of face tracking. Basically, all the study can be simply divided into two categories. One is real time face detection, and the other is the combination of face detection and face tracking. Specifically, some face detection algorithms can get the faces in each frame timely, which can directly achieve the goal of face tracking; the other way to implement face tracking is to detect the face at the start frame first, and then adopt the object tracking algorithm to follow the face in the other frames. The second method of tracking face has been used in this project. In detail, viola jones face detection algorithm and camshift has been adopted to obtain the face and tracking the face, respectively.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2187531412", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52994605"}

This paper is intended for industry/ organization to optimize Electricity usage. Energy consumption and pricing analysis is a primary area in power systems planning and management. Recent developments in energy market deregulation and provision of sustainable energy have contributed to increase interest in this area. The prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. The prices in electricity market can be set every five minutes. With this motivation, an algorithm is proposed for efficient Classification of concept Drifting Electricity pricing data streams. Thus, it is a challenge to learn from concept drifting data streams. In proposed algorithm, a decision tree is built incrementally and also used to develop training set based on these methods, in order to improve the accuracy of classification and prediction models under concept drift. A base learner is adaptive, a decision tree can have its nodes included and deleted dynamically. Adaptivity can be achieved by manipulating training data (instance selection), instead of taking all training history, take a number of the latest instances (training window). The new proposed algorithms detect change faster, without increasing the rate of false positives. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that proposed algorithm outperforms well compared to several state-of-the-art online algorithms. In this paper we have compared electricity datasets with three algorithms to find out the algorithms efficiency on type of dataset. This data is again tested for error value for a particular number of iteration. The experimentation is conducted. The experimental evaluation produced satisfactory results.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5120/10438-5120", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2102390064", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11868540", "151207670", "2606652", "16786847", "9799087", "37022576"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9050386"}

To date, most existing graph embedding methods either focus on plain graphs with only the graph topology, or consider properties on nodes only. We propose PGE, a graph representation learning framework that incorporates both node and edge properties into the graph embedding procedure. PGE uses node clustering to assign biases to differentiate neighbors of a node and leverages multiple data-driven matrices to aggregate the property information of neighbors sampled based on a biased strategy. PGE adopts the popular inductive model for neighborhood aggregation. We provide detailed analyses on the efficacy of our method and validate the performance of PGE by showing how PGE achieves better embedding results than the state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on benchmark applications such as node classification and link prediction over real-world datasets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3292500.3330948", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2951486171", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14233495", "11955698", "12734918", "21723393", "393948", "7490480", "15195762", "17341970", "14675158", "4000470", "3636539", "355163", "10211629", "3953995", "207238980", "3215337", "4755450", "458476", "1658773", "6628106", "3144218", "14249137", "61440772", "6278891", "16447573", "4957091", "3051291", "9661057", "5232546", "207908316", "2838900", "207238964", "2742524"], "inbound_citations": ["209500945"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196195534"}

The main issue in Blind Steganalysis is the non-availability of knowledge about the Steganographic technique applied to the image. Feature extraction approaches best suited for Blind Steganalysis, either dealt with only a few features or single domain of an image. Moreover, these approaches lead to low detection percentage. The main objective of this paper is to improve the detection percentage. In this paper, the focus is on Blind Steganalysis of JPEG images through the process of dilation that includes splitting of given image into RGB components followed by transformation of each component into three domains, viz., frequency, spatial, and wavelet. Extracted features from each domain are given to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that classified the image as steg or clean. The proposed process of dilation was tested by experiments with varying embedded text sizes and varying number of extracted features on the trained SVM classifier. Overall Success Rate (OSR) was chosen as the performance metric of the proposed solution and is found to be effective, compared with existing solutions, in detecting higher percentage of steg images.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.diin.2013.12.002", "venue": "Digital Investigation", "journal": "Digital Investigation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2071482498", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8657249", "32084945", "5291243", "29396765", "67036357", "5875811", "36537957", "2066636", "19031738", "7935805", "56117708", "140109802", "14333144", "40230265", "2604297", "46131999", "123997496", "18452324", "61727171", "11531443", "24381826", "10495440"], "inbound_citations": ["7959118", "17296082", "14422004", "13078778", "46951924", "868894", "21690187", "11544409", "77394765"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44754597"}

In this paper, stochastic L-grammar rules are derived automatically from known drosophila and vertebrate promoter and non-promoter sequences using genetic programming. The fitness of grammar rules is evaluated using a machine learning technique, called Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is trained on the known promoter sequences to obtain a discriminating function which serves as a means of evaluating a candidate grammar (a set of rules) by determining the percentage of generated sequences that are classified correctly.

But why do the DRMs predict what they do? One way of answering this is the LIME setting, in which readable proxies for a black-box predictor. The proxies are intended only to model the predictions of the black-box in local regions of the instance-space. But readability alone may not enough: to be understandable, the local models must use relevant concepts in an meaningful manner. We investigate the use of a Bayes-like approach to identify logical proxies for local predictions of a DRM. We show: (a) DRM's with our randomised propositionalization method achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance; (b) Models in first-order logic can approximate the DRM's prediction closely in a small local region; and (c) Expert-provided relevance information can play the role of a prior to distinguish between logical explanations that perform equivalently on prediction alone.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.00595", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2810622939,2974669922", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["1648083", "1341209", "119746968", "2961336", "161811263", "57556820", "118927641", "121948783", "56889394", "121802173", "8517067", "16875156", "16875156", "4428725", "45816", "12776388", "26530550", "61536073", "117264", "119870011", "12643399", "6183510", "457364", "13029170", "10621079", "29408179", "10116897", "6180068", "15126143", "15544052", "18229590", "7841983", "9070073", "30038605"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49557240"}

The liver region is first located using an image segmentation method. A pre-learned tumor classifier follows to segment the tumors in the liver region. Next, two sets of feature points are detected: (1) feature points in the liver region; (2) randomly sampling several points in the tumor region. Using each feature point as the center of a region of interest (ROI), this study computes Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) which is further used to derive the texture features of the ROI. Multiple ROIs and thus multiple texture feature vectors are derived in an input CT image. These textures are collected and clustered into four clusters, where each of them is represented by a representative texture feature vector. To further enhance the discriminative powder of the texture features, for each CT image, we select two representative texture feature vectors which are from the two clusters with the highest probability belonging to the tumor region and the liver region, respectively. The resulting tumor (liver) texture feature vector is then labeled as a positive (negative) example in order to train a tumor Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In the diagnosis stage, the tumor SVM classifies an input texture feature vector and the classification result locates the liver tumors in a CT image. Given CT images of 72 patients, to associate the detected tumor texture feature vectors with the medical records, a treatment prediction dataset is constructed for mining the survival prediction model using logistic regression. In the testing stage, to input a tumor texture feature vector and the possible treatments to the survival prediction model, the system computes the survival probabilities and generates a treatment prediction report, which suggests the most suitable treatment for the patient.

In this paper, a hybrid streamflow forecast framework is proposed that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression. Correlation coefficients between the current streamflow and the streamflow with lags are analyzed using autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and grey correlation analysis (GCA). Support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are integrated with seasonal and trend decomposition to make monthly streamflow forecast. Auto-regression and multi-model combination error correction methods are used to ensure the accuracy. In our experiments, the proposed method is compared with a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) streamflow forecast model. Fourteen models are developed, and the monthly streamflow data of Shigu and Xiangjiaba, China from 1961 to 2009 are used to evaluate our proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the integrated model of grey correlation analysis, Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (STL), Support Vector Regression (GCA-STL-SVR) exhibits an improved performance for monthly streamflow forecast.

Another goal is to predict disease risk for different individuals given their genetic sequence. Such predictions could either be used as a \"black box\" in order to promote changes in life-style and screening for early diagnosis, or as a model that can be studied to better understand the mechanism of the disease. Current methods for risk prediction typically rank single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by the p-value of their association with the disease, and use the top-associated SNPs as input to a classification algorithm. However, the predictive power of such methods is relatively poor. To improve the predictive power, we devised BootRank, which uses bootstrapping in order to obtain a robust prioritization of SNPs for use in predictive models. We show that BootRank improves the ability to predict disease risk of unseen individuals in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and results in a more robust set of SNPs and a larger number of enriched pathways being associated with the different diseases. Finally, we show that combining BootRank with seven different classification algorithms improves performance compared to previous studies that used the WTCCC data. Notably, diseases for which BootRank results in the largest improvements were recently shown to have more heritability than previously thought, likely due to contributions from variants with low minimum allele frequency (MAF), suggesting that BootRank can be beneficial in cases where SNPs affecting the disease are poorly tagged or have low MAF.

Geological changes may continue in a reclaimed mine area, and the deformed aquifers may entail a breakdown of substrates and an increase in ground water tables, which may cause surface area inundation. Consequently, a reclaimed mine area may experience surface area collapse, i.e., subsidence, and degradation of vegetation productivity. Thus, monitoring short-term landscape dynamics in a reclaimed mine area may provide important information on the long-term geological and environmental impacts of mining activities. We studied landscape dynamics in Kirchheller Heide, Germany, which experienced extensive soil movement due to longwall mining without stowing, using Landsat imageries between 2013 and 2016. A Random Forest image classification technique was applied to analyze land-use and landcover dynamics, and the growth of wetland areas was assessed using a Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). We also analyzed the changes in vegetation productivity using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We observed a 19.9% growth of wetland area within four years, with 87.2% growth in the coverage of two major waterbodies in the reclaimed mine area. NDVI values indicate that the productivity of 66.5% of vegetation of the Kirchheller Heide was degraded due to changes in ground water tables and surface flooding.

This research is performed to assess if the use of PLS as standard practice is justified for chemometric modeling of Raman spectroscopy and cell culture data. Model development data from 5 small scale bioreactors (2 x 1 L & 3 x 5 L) using two Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines were used to predict against a manufacturing scale bioreactor (2000 L). Analysis demonstrated that Cubist predictive models were better for average performance over PLS, SVMr and RF for glucose, lactate and ammonia. The Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of Cubist modeling was acceptable for the process concentration ranges of glucose (1.437 mM), lactate (2.0 mM) and ammonia (0.819 mM).

The significant climatic variables which affect T. sebifera distribution not only include general trends (mean) and extreme values, but also reflect variation (seasonality). Since extreme temperature has been identified as a critical factor of T. sebifera\u2019s invasion ability, this study further revealed that water condition (precipitation) across the landscape also played a critical role in T. sebifera occupation. The results suggested that four models (GLM, BIOCLIM, MaxEnt, and Random Forest) performed well in estimating tallow distribution. However, MaxEnt and Random Forest performed slightly better than GLM and BIOCLIM. Longleaf-slash pine forests have the highest risk of invasion probabilities followed by oak-gum-cypress forests.

Firstly, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) was used to decompose vibration signals into several sub-bands. The fault features were extracted from the sub-bands to construct a high-dimensional fault feature set, and the improved kernel space distance evaluation method was used to extract the sensitive fault features. Then, orthogonal semi-supervised linear local tangent space alignment (OSSLLTSA), which is a semi-supervised manifold learning method, was proposed to reduce dimension of the fault feature set, and extract fusion features with low dimension and high clustering performance. OSSLLTSA is able to extract the structural information in both labeled and unlabelled samples, and so OSSLLTSA overcomes over-learning problem of supervised manifold learning. Meanwhile, OSSLLTSA also avoids the drawback of weak pertinence of unsupervised manifold learning. Finally, the extracted low dimensional feature set was input into TSVM for fault diagnosis.

Satellite imagery is useful for assessing particle transport from land to sea. However, in the oligotrophic and shallow waters of tropical lagoons, the bottom reflection of downwelling light usually hampers the use of classical optical algorithms. In order to address this issue, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was developed and tested. The proposed application concerns the lagoon of New Caledonia\u2014the second longest continuous coral reef in the world\u2014which is frequently exposed to river plumes from ultramafic watersheds. The SVR model is based on a large training sample of in-situ turbidity values representative of the annual variability in the Voh-Kone-Pouembout lagoon (Western Coast of New Caledonia) during the 2014\u20132015 period and on coincident satellite reflectance values from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It was trained with reflectance and two other explanatory parameters\u2014bathymetry and bottom colour. This approach significantly improved the model\u2019s capacity for retrieving the in-situ turbidity range from MODIS images, as compared with algorithms dedicated to deep oligotrophic or turbid waters, which were shown to be inadequate.

Machine learning methods proposed in previous work typically achieve high reported detection performance on fixed datasets. Some of them also report reasonably fast prediction times. However, most of them are not suitable for real-world deployment because requirements for malware detection go beyond these figures of merit. In this paper, we introduce several important requirements for deploying Android malware detection systems in the real world. One such requirement is that candidate approaches should be tested against a stream of continuously evolving data. Such streams of evolving data represent the continuous flow of unknown file objects received for categorization, and provide more reliable and realistic estimate of detection performance once deployed in a production environment. As a case study we designed and implemented an ensemble approach for automatic Android malware detection that meets the real-world requirements we identified. Atomic Naive Bayes classifiers used as inputs for the Support Vector Machine ensemble are based on different APK feature categories, providing fast speed and additional reliability against the attackers due to diversification. Our case study with several malware families showed that different families are detected by different atomic classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, our work contains the first publicly available results generated against evolving data streams of nearly 1 million samples with a model trained over a massive sample set of 120,000 samples.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cose.2017.07.013", "venue": "Comput.

The importance of this breakthrough is due to the way in which they are dealing with them as \u201cjunk RNA\u201d from the majority of scientific community. The importance of this change came when the micro non-coding RNAs showed the direct influence in the regulation mechanisms of gene expression as well as the importance of cell functions . With the passage of time the number of non-coding RNA categories is growing and the major factor of this growth is the new developments in the field of modern sequencing techniques (high throughput sequencing). Indicatively some of the most popular categories of these non-coding RNAs are the snoRNAs, microRNAs, siRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, piRNAS [5]. Recently, a new category has been discovered, tRNA-derived fragments (tRfs) which are products of tRNA and they have shown important signs in the regulation of ncRNAs. ::: Because of their small size (20-100 bases) the identification of their existence is still a difficult procedure and it was and it was one of the important reasons for the development of new bioinformatics tools which are based on computational intelligence as well as in techniques from mathematical, statistical fields which are precise and this is the main reason why we prefer using computational tools from the conventional experimental methods Some of the computational methods are the Bayesian networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Hidden Makov models. It is of great importance to mention that in the last few years more and more machine learning techniques are preferred due to their simplicity in such a way which helps us to fully understand the results of these procedures. Despite the fact that these techniques are preferred to conventional methods, the results may differ accordingly to the problem and more precisely to the kind of dataset we have to deal with in each case. In non-coding RNA datasets, some of these methods have shown that they can handle the false positive ncRNAs and their success to classify most of the experiments known as ncRNAs. Furthermore, in the past a few years ago the way of interpreting the classification of ncRNAs was simpleminded because the scientific community claimed for many years that every ncRNA can be classified in only one category. Now the most efficient methods can handle the multilabeling existence of ncRNAs, for example a mature micro RNA can have same the same properties and functions as a snoRNA and for this reason we tried to capture this multifunctionality in the present thesis with the development of GARF algorithm for which we will refer to later on. ::: In the present thesis, a new hybrid computational intelligence methodology is proposed whose target is to classify non-coding RNA molecules in many categories with different features as a result of sequencing analysis. Some of these features are thermodynamic properties, the per-base nucleotides, etc. The proposed methodology can classify all the known ncRNAs molecules and in a parallel way it will allow a sequence to be classified to more than one category. The proposed methodology is considered a hybrid methodology that combines a heuristic multicriterial optimization algorithm [9] for the selection of characteristics and optimization of the parameters based on random forests technique which is an ensemble learning method for classification. The Random forests approach method was chosen as it has been considered one of the most accurate machine learning methods for every kind of datasets and they have shown a unique characteristic of generalization. It is important to add that in the present thesis we will not make usage of the original version of Random Forest but we will try to capture the full potential of this algorithm with every parameter optimization with a final purpose the best handling of our biological multilabeled dataset. ::: For the validation of our methodology, we will use a majority of experiments in ncRNAs sequences which will be collected from databases such as Rfam In addition we will use the InSybio ncRNAseq tool for the feature extraction in every sequence of ncRNA molecules.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198638141"}

Whilst therapeutic intervention such as bariatric surgery can mitigate both obesity and hypertension, it is not the most suitable solution for all patients. Therefore an early biomarker detection system to assess hypertension in subjects with weight gain could reduce mortality risk. Such a platform could be developed through a urine centred biomarker system identifying disease related signatures based upon volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The focus of this study was to determine whether urinary VOCs could be used as a potential monitoring tool for detection of blood pressure change in obese- hypertensive bariatric patients. ::: ::: Design and Method: Pre-surgery urine of 23 obese female patients undergoing bariatric surgery was analysed by Field-Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometer (FAIMS). The data was processed by dividing the cohort into two classifications (high and low) based on individual median values: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), C-reactive protein (CRP) and heart rate. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were trained with features selected using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). ::: ::: Results: FAIMS urinary VOC analysis highlighted a significant association with blood pressure markers as determined by systolic (ROC curve AUC: 0.918, p < 0.001), MAP (AUC: 0.845 p < 0.001), CRP (AUC: 0.932, p < 0.001) and heart rate (AUC: 0.945, p < 0.001); whilst diastolic did not attain significance (AUC: 0., p = N.S).

The diagnosis of heart failure is a challenging task especially in under-developed and developing countries where there is a paucity of human experts and equipments. Hence, different researchers have developed different intelligent systems for automated detection of heart failure. However, most of these methods are facing the problem of overfitting i.e. the recently proposed methods improved heart failure detection accuracy on testing data while compromising heart failure detection accuracy on training data. Consequently, the constructed models overfit to the testing data. In order, to come up with an intelligent system that would show good performance on both training and testing data, in this paper we develop a novel diagnostic system. The proposed diagnostic system uses random search algorithm (RSA) for features selection and random forest model for heart failure prediction. The proposed diagnostic system is optimized using grid search algorithm. Two types of experiments are performed to evaluate the precision of the proposed method. In the first experiment, only random forest model is developed while in the second experiment the proposed RSA based random forest model is developed. Experiments are performed using an online heart failure database namely Cleveland dataset. The proposed method is efficient and less complex than conventional random forest model as it produces 3.3% higher accuracy than conventional random forest model while using only 7 features. Moreover, the proposed method shows better performance than five other state of the art machine learning models.

The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities.

Cataract is defined as a lenticular opacity presenting usually with poor visual acuity. It is one of the most common causes of visual impairment worldwide. Early diagnosis demands the expertise of trained healthcare professionals, which may present a barrier to early intervention due to underlying costs. To date, studies reported in the literature utilize a single learning model for retinal image classification in grading cataract severity. We present an ensemble learning based approach as a means to improving diagnostic accuracy. Three independent feature sets, i.e., wavelet-, sketch-, and texture-based features, are extracted from each fundus image. For each feature set, two base learning models, i.e., Support Vector Machine and Back Propagation Neural Network, are built. Then, the ensemble methods, majority voting and stacking, are investigated to combine the multiple base learning models for final fundus image classification. Empirical experiments are conducted for cataract detection (two-class task, i.e., cataract or non-cataractous) and cataract grading (four-class task, i.e., non-cataractous, mild, moderate or severe) tasks. The best performance of the ensemble classifier is 93.2% and 84.5% in terms of the correct classification rates for cataract detection and grading tasks, respectively.

Time series prediction has been widely used in a variety of applications in science, engineering, finance, etc. There are two different modeling options for constructing forecasting models in time series prediction. Global modeling constructs a model which is independent from user queries. On the contrary, local modeling constructs a local model for each different query from the user. In this paper, we propose a local modeling strategy and investigate the effectiveness of incorporating local modeling with three popular machine learning based forecasting methods, Neural Network (NN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), for time series prediction. Given a series of historical data, a local context of the user query is located and an appropriate number of lags are selected. Then forecasting models are constructed by applying NN, ANFIS, and LS-SVM, respectively. A number of experiments are conducted and the results show that local modeling can enhance the estimation performance of a forecasting method for time series prediction.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2014.07.032", "venue": "Expert Syst.

However, there are often barriers between people using this kind of languages and hearing people, typically oriented to express themselves by means of oral languages. To facilitate the social inclusiveness in everyday life for deaf minorities, technology can play an important role. Indeed many attempts have been recently made by the scientific community to develop automatic translation tools. Unfortunately, not many solutions are actually available for the Italian Sign Language (Lingua Italiana dei Segni--LIS) case study, specially for what concerns the recognition task. In this paper, the authors want to face such a lack, in particular addressing the signer-independent case study, i.e., when the signers in the testing set are to included in the training set. From this perspective, the proposed algorithm represents the first real attempt in the LIS case. The automatic recognizer is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and video features have been extracted using the OpenCV open source library. The effectiveness of the HMM system is validated by a comparative evaluation with Support Vector Machine approach. The video material used to train the recognizer and testing its performance consists in a database that the authors have deliberately created by involving 10 signers and 147 isolated-sign videos for each signer. The database is publicly available.

In actual software engineering practice, the extraction of formal requirements from scenario-based descriptions is a tedious and error-prone process that would benefit from automated tool support. This paper presents an Inductive Logic Programming method for inferring operational requirements from a set of example scenarios and an initial but incomplete requirements specification. The approach is based on translating the specification and the scenarios into an event-based logic programming formalism and using a non-monotonic reasoning system, called eXtended Hybrid Abductive Inductive Learning, to automatically infer a set of event pre-conditions and trigger-conditions that cover all desirable scenarios and reject all undesirable ones.

The high robustness benefits from two novel works: 1) a new sequential update rule that preserves the labels ranking information learned from all old (but discarded) samples while updating the model only based on new incoming samples and 2) a fixed threshold for label bipartition that is insensitive to any kind of changes in data distribution including CDDL.

As shown in the experimental results, the proposed work is highly robust to CDDL in both the sequential model update and multilabel thresholding.

Some aspects of data preprocessing are discussed, such as normalization method, data grouping method and the period of history data using as input vector. Proper normalization method, which is to map gas load data from the small and narrow range to the big and wide, will improve the forecasting accuracy. The feature of grouped gas load plays an important role to the model effectiveness, because of the different consumer compositions corresponding to different data groups. The principle to define a proper period of history data which are used as input vector is relevant to the number of training samples and the characteristic of the nonlinear regression problem.

To be specific, we extend adversarial autoencoders by imposing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the distributions among different domains, and matching the aligned distribution to an arbitrary prior distribution via adversarial feature learning. In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal to the seen source domains because of the MMD regularization, and is expected to generalize well on the target domain because of the introduction of the prior distribution.

In most of the existing works, fusion is performed at a single level (feature level or decision level), missing the opportunity to fuse rich mid-level features necessary for better classification. To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose three novel deep multilevel multimodal ( ${M}^{{2}}$ ) fusion frameworks to capitalize on different fusion strategies at various stages and to leverage the superiority of multilevel fusion. At input, we transform the depth data into depth images called sequential front view images (SFIs) and inertial sensor data into signal images. Each input modality, depth and inertial, is further made multimodal by taking convolution with the Prewitt filter. Creating \u201cmodality within modality\u201d enables further complementary and discriminative feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are trained on input images of each modality to learn low-level, high-level and complex features. Learned features are extracted and fused at different stages of the proposed frameworks to combine discriminative and complementary information. These highly informative features are served as input to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). We evaluate the proposed frameworks on three publicly available multimodal HAR datasets, namely, UTD Multimodal Human Action Dataset (MHAD), Berkeley MHAD, and UTD-MHAD Kinect V2.

Such heterogeneity is a driving factor in the evolution of MM, from founder clones through outgrowth of subclonal fractions. DNA Sequencing studies on MM samples have indeed demonstrated such heterogeneity in subclonal architecture at diagnosis based on recurrent mutations in pathologically relevant genes that may ultimately to lead to relapse. However, no study so far has reported a predictive gene expression signature that can identify, distinguish and quantify drug sensitive and drug-resistant subpopulations within a bulk population of myeloma cells. In recent years, our laboratory has successfully developed a gene expression profile (GEP)-based signature that could not only distinguish drug response of MM cell lines, but also was effective in stratifying patient outcomes when applied to GEP profiles from MM clinical trials using proteasome inhibitors (PI) as chemotherapeutic agents. Further, we noted myeloma cell lines that responded to the drug often contained residual sub-population of cells that did not respond, and likely were selectively propagated during drug treatment in vitro, and in patients. In this study, we performed targeted qRT-PCR analysis of single cells using a gene panel that included PI sensitivity genes and gene signatures that could discriminate between low and high-risk myeloma followed by intensive bioinformatics and statistical analysis for the classification and prediction of PI response in individual cells within bulk multiple myeloma tumors. Fluidigm9s C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System was used to perform automated single-cell capture, processing and cDNA synthesis on 576 pre-treatment cells from 12 cell lines representing a wide range of PI-sensitivity and 370 cells from 7 patient samples undergoing PI treatment followed by targeted gene expression profiling of single cells using automated, high-throughput on-chip qRT-PCR analysis using 96.96 Dynamic Array IFCs on the BioMark HD System. Probability of resistance for each individual cell was predicted using a pipeline that employed the machine learning methods Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (radial and sigmoidal), LASSO and kNN (k Nearest Neighbor) for making single-cell GEP data-driven predictions/ decisions. The weighted probabilities from each of the algorithms were used to quantify resistance of each individual cell and plotted using Ensemble forecasting algorithm. Using our drug response GEP signature at the single cell level, we could successfully identify distinct subpopulations of tumor cells that were predicted to be sensitive or resistant to PIs. Subsequently, we developed a R Statistical analysis package (http://cran.r-project.org), SCATTome (Single Cell Analysis of Targeted Transcriptome), that can restructure data obtained from Fluidigm qPCR analysis run, filter missing data, perform scaling of filtered data, build classification models and successfully predict drug response of individual cells and classify each cell9s probability of response based on the targeted transcriptome. We will present the program output as graphical displays of single cell response probabilities.

The evidence is mounting, not only to the presence of delays as physical constraints in signal propagation speed, but also to their functional role in providing dynamical diversity to the systems that comprise them. The latter observation in biological systems inspired the recent development of a computational architecture that harnesses this dynamical diversity, by delay-coupling a single nonlinear element to itself. This architecture is a particular realization of Reservoir Computing, where stimuli are injected into the system in time rather than in space as is the case with classical recurrent neural network realizations. This architecture also exhibits an internal memory which fades in time, an important prerequisite to the functioning of any reservoir computing device. However, fading memory is also a limitation to any computation that requires persistent storage. In order to overcome this limitation, the current work introduces an extended version to the single node Delay-Coupled Reservoir, that is based on trained linear feedback. We show by numerical simulations that adding task-specific linear feedback to the single node Delay-Coupled Reservoir extends the class of solvable tasks to those that require nonfading memory. We demonstrate, through several case studies, the ability of the extended system to carry out complex nonlinear computations that depend on past information, whereas the computational power of the system with fading memory alone quickly deteriorates.

The performance of the RTF algorithm was compared to other ensemble methods such as Random Forest (RF) and Gentle AdaBoost (GAB). The accuracy assessments showed that the RTF with 84.90% and 93.33% accuracies provided better performance than RF (7% and 4%) and GAB (15% and 11%) in urban and rural areas, respectively. Subsequently, in order to increase the classification accuracy, a majority filter was applied to post-classification images and the overall classification accuracy of the RFT was increased approximately up to 3%. Also, the results of classification were also analysed using the McNemar test. Consequently, this study shows the success of the RTF algorithm in the classification of UAV images for land use mapping.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/22797254.2017.1319252", "venue": null, "journal": "European Journal of Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2614780160", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210609625", "198945347", "19179234", "134886642", "208882529"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125109625"}

In new frames, simulated annealing and local voting align the deformable template with the image to yield a global shape probability map. The global shape probability is combined with a region-based probability of object boundary map and the pixel-level intensity gradient to determine each link cost in the graph. The CRF energy is minimized by min-cut, followed by Random Walk on the uncertain boundary region to get a soft segmentation result.

At the same time, one isoften only interested in a fragment of a Web page, which again may not fit on the limited-size screens of mobile devices, requiring more scrolling in both dimensions. In this paper, we address the problem of browsing fatigue during mobile Web access using geometric segmentation of Web pages and the notion of context. Our prototype system, CMo, reduces information overload by allowing its users to see the most relevant fragment of the page and then navigate between other fragments if necessary. On following a link, CMo captures the context of the link, employing a simple topic-boundary detection technique; then, it uses the context to identify relevant information in the next page with the help of a Support Vector Machine, a statistical machine-learning model.

Despite the continuous advances in multimedia features and representation models, to establish an effective measure for comparing different multimedia objects still remains a challenging task. While supervised and semi-supervised techniques made relevant advances on similarity learning tasks, scenarios where labeled data are non-existent require different strategies. In such situations, unsupervised learning has been established as a promising solution, capable of considering the contextual information and the dataset structure for computing new similarity/dissimilarity measures. This article extends a recent unsupervised learning algorithm that uses an iterative re-ranking strategy to take advantage of different k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) sets and rank correlation measures. Two novel approaches are proposed for computing the kNN sets and their corresponding top-k lists. The proposed approaches were validated in conjunction with various rank correlation measures, yielding superior effectiveness results in comparison with previous works.

Most of the commercial seismic inversion technologies are based on the classical one-dimensional models of seismic exploration involving plane-parallel medium that is described by the linear convolution equation. However, presumably, in some complex cases the linear operators of convolution type cannot properly describe the seismic field distribution. It is assumed that there is a nonlinear absorption of energy of seismic waves in some geological environments, such as in fractured, fluid - rich layers.

The NDVI index is defined as the ratio of the difference of the red and infrared radiances over their sum. In other words, information from the red channel of a RGB image and the corresponding infrared spectral band are required for its computation. In the current work the NDVI index is estimated just from the red channel by training a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN).

When data consist of feature vectors, a large body of work has focused on learning a Mahalanobis distance. Less work has been devoted to metric learning from structured objects (such as strings or trees), most of it focusing on optimizing a notion of edit distance. We identify two important limitations of current metric learning approaches. First, they allow to improve the performance of local algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, but metric learning for global algorithms (such as linear classifiers) has not been studied so far. Second, the question of the generalization ability of metric learning methods has been largely ignored. In this thesis, we propose theoretical and algorithmic contributions that address these limitations. Our first contribution is the derivation of a new kernel function built from learned edit probabilities. Our second contribution is a novel framework for learning string and tree edit similarities inspired by the recent theory of (e,g,t)-good similarity functions. Using uniform stability arguments, we establish theoretical guarantees for the learned similarity that give a bound on the generalization error of a linear classifier built from that similarity. In our third contribution, we extend these ideas to metric learning from feature vectors by proposing a bilinear similarity learning method that efficiently optimizes the (e,g,t)-goodness. Generalization guarantees are derived for our approach, highlighting that our method minimizes a tighter bound on the generalization error of the classifier.

Most existing learning-based dehazing methods are not fully end-to-end, which still follow the traditional dehazing procedure: first estimate the medium transmission and the atmospheric light, then recover the haze-free image based on the atmospheric scattering model. However, in practice, due to lack of priors and constraints, it is hard to precisely estimate these intermediate parameters. Inaccurate estimation further degrades the performance of dehazing, resulting in artifacts, color distortion and insufficient haze removal. To address this, we propose a fully end-to-end Generative Adversarial Networks with Fusion-discriminator (FD-GAN) for image dehazing. With the proposed Fusion-discriminator which takes frequency information as additional priors, our model can generator more natural and realistic dehazed images with less color distortion and fewer artifacts.

Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

HUs for un-cored sections were predicted using wire line logs as input and the associated conventional core values as guides to SVMs. HUs for the core data were identified using three popular correlations such as Kozeny\u2013Carmen (KC) equation, Nooruddin and Hossain equation, and the power law flow unit equation. The experimental results on a Middle East field data show that a better HU prediction accuracy is achieved using Nooruddin and Hossain correlation in comparison with using KC and the power law flow unit correlation. A further analysis to the predicted value reveals that better prediction accuracy is achieved if the granularity of HU class boundary is enlarged to the neighboring classes. Although Nooruddin and Hossain correlation could better relate wire line logs to HUs, however the permeability calculated from the predicted HUs showed less error with the power law flow unit correlation. Considering this, we achieved a maximum of 97% accuracy which encourages the application of SVMs in HU unit prediction using well log data for the un-cored sections of well or for the wells which do not have core data.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petrol.2013.09.005", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "2078792643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134179580"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:140686761"}

However, such basic geospatial information is reasonably lacking in this study area and sequel to this, the researcher aims at Mapping of Urban Features (Natural and Man-Made), which includes the Vegetation, wetlands/water bodies, buildings/pavement, open/bare surfaces and farm lands captured in GeoEye-1, High Resolution Satellite Image (HRSI) of 2016 using Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC) with a view of developing a reliable urban land use and land cover map of the area, which will serve as a base map for land-use planning and monitoring for a variety of end-users. The objectives include: to identify and extract features/regions of interest (ROIs) in a subset HRSI of the study area, to perform supervised classification using SVM in ENVI Software. The methodology used include Image acquisition, Image enhancement, Image Sub-setting, Image masking, Extraction of Regions of Interests (ROIs) and its separability index analysis, supervised classification using SVMC, Post-processing Accuracy Assessment, and Preparation of maps. Environment for Visualizing Image (ENVI 5.1) incorporated with Interactive Data Language (IDL 8.3) software was used for image processing, masking, spatial data analysis and image classification. Meanwhile, Esri ArcGIS 10.2 was employed for database development and production of thematic maps. Microsoft Excel and word was used for statistical analysis and result presentation. The result of image classification using SVMC, Radial Basis Function (BRF) default kernel in ENVI 5.1 indicates that Nnewi-North L.G.A is having 13.52% of Built-up Areas, 24.23% of Vegetation, 22.05% of Water bodies, Farm lands is equal to 39.40% and open/bare surface is 0.81% and result of image classification was validated using Error Matrix and Kappa Coefficient which results revealed that (SVMC overall Accuracy =98.07% and Kappa Coefficient = 0.97. The result revealed that \u2018Support Vector Machine Classifier\u2019 is robust in extracting urban landscape from HRSI, especially Built-up areas and open/bare for every Remote Sensing Analysis. The research recommends that it is imperative to check for \u2018ROIs index separability\u2019 before using it for classification, also there is need for periodic urban LULC analysis to guide stakeholders in Planning, Monitoring, and Management of Urban Areas..

In this paper, we propose a local neuro-fuzzy (LNF) approach based on the least-squares support vector machines (LSSVMs). The proposed LNF approach employs LSSVMs, which are powerful in modeling and predicting time series, as local models and uses hierarchical binary tree (HBT) learning algorithm for fast and efficient estimation of its parameters. The HBT algorithm heuristically partitions the input space into smaller subdomains by axis-orthogonal splits. In each partitioning, the validity functions automatically form a unity partition and therefore normalization side effects, e.g., reactivation, are prevented. Integration of LSSVMs into the LNF network as local models, along with the HBT learning algorithm, yield a high-performance approach for modeling and prediction of complex nonlinear time series. The proposed approach is applied to modeling and predictions of different nonlinear and chaotic real-world and hand-designed systems and time series.

The Affinity Propagation (AP) is employed to extract the exemplars from the HTTP traffic. K-Nearest Neighbor(K-NN) and one class Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for anomaly detection. To facilitate comparison, we also employ information gain to select key attributes (a.k.a. features) from the HTTP traffic for web attack detection.

These abnormal electrical activities can be recorded via multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals placed on the scalp of the brain. Usually, these signals, recorded from this EEG device, are interpreted by the neurologist which require their availability and it is very time consuming especially for long duration signals. This study presents a fully automatic system for the detection of seizure from non-seizure signals. Firstly, it pre-processes the signal to remove noise and artefacts from the raw-EEG signals and then extracts features. Features are extracted from time-domain, spectral domain, wavelet domain. In addition, connectivity and entropy based feature have also been extracted. After that, prominent features have been selected from this large feature set by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier has been used for classification. A Bayesian optimization algorithm has been used to optimize the hyper-parameters of SVM.

This paper\u2019s hypothesis is that general, informative features can be learned from the large amounts of data generated by aggregating the signals of multiple users, thus reducing the recording burden while enhancing gesture recognition. Consequently, this paper proposes applying transfer learning on aggregated data from multiple users while leveraging the capacity of deep learning algorithms to learn discriminant features from large datasets.

A third Myo armband dataset was taken from the NinaPro database and is comprised ten able-bodied participants. Three different deep learning networks employing three different modalities as input (raw EMG, spectrograms, and continuous wavelet transform (CWT)) are tested on the second and third dataset. The proposed transfer learning scheme is shown to systematically and significantly enhance the performance for all three networks on the two datasets, achieving an offline accuracy of 98.31% for 7 gestures over 17 participants for the CWT-based ConvNet and 68.98% for 18 gestures over 10 participants for the raw EMG-based ConvNet.

The L1-regulated feature selection is based on Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) which is characterized by adding a penalty term to the prediction error in order to reduce the weight of the irrelevant features and to make the relevant features having nonzero weights. For classification purpose, deep learning neural network is initialized with sigmoid activation function in the input and hidden layers and to accommodate multiclass classification, the softmax activation function is used in the output layer. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on the six numbers of standard multiclass cancer datasets and to argue the predictive capability of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on imbalanced class datasets such as 5-class lung cancer dataset, and 4-class Leukemia cancer dataset.

First step is the feature selection for the datasets used. A proposed algorithm of feature selection, which uses the Document Frequency technique for the term in the category, is presented. Second step is Web page classification. Two famous techniques of Web page classification are used: (i) Support Vector Machine and (ii) Naive Bayes Classifier.

A dimensional approach to emotion modeling is adopted: the ratings are based on continuous arousal and valence scales. We describe the TNO-Gaming Corpus that contains spontaneous vocal and facial expressions elicited via a multiplayer videogame and that includes emotion annotations obtained via self-report and observation by outside observers. Comparisons show that there are discrepancies between self-reported and observed emotion ratings which are also reflected in the performance of the emotion recognizers developed. Using Support Vector Regression in combination with acoustic and textual features, recognizers of arousal and valence are developed that can predict points in a 2-dimensional arousal-valence space.

Those methods are commonly under two default assumptions: 1) massive labeled training samples and 2) the training and test data share a similar distribution under unvarying working conditions. Unfortunately, these assumptions are nearly invalid in a real-world scenario, where the signals are unlabeled and the working condition changes constantly, resulting in the diagnosis models of the previous studies that always fail in classifying the unlabeled data in real applications. To deal with those issues, in this paper, we propose a novel feature adaptive motor fault diagnosis using deep transfer learning to improve the performance by transferring the knowledge learned from labeled data under invariant working conditions to the unlabeled data under constantly changing working conditions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted as the base framework to extract multi-level features from raw vibration signals. Then, the regularization term of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is incorporated in the training process to impose constraints on the CNN parameters to reduce the distribution mismatch between the features in the source and target domains. To verify the effectiveness of our proposal, data from the motor tests of European driving cycle (NEDC) for simulating the real working scenario and the motor tests under invariant working conditions are, respectively, conducted as the target domain and the source domain. The results show that the proposal presents higher diagnosis accuracy for the unlabeled target data than other methods, and it is of applicability to bridge the discrepancy between different domains.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921480", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2953680418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12885213", "125608550", "49576945", "127957159", "21699311", "740063", "6404260", "3761015", "9204815", "1689250", "18605691", "17674695", "206593710", "8795925", "5522822", "56594323", "69579811", "1606677", "117228979", "126544299", "29936334", "43868572", "5808102", "17169365", "19599316", "15859800", "788838", "13798326", "14180331", "110326167", "11758569", "4933375"], "inbound_citations": ["211226981", "211146257", "209376485", "203212766"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195775324"}

Firstly, 3D coordinates of human body contour are gotten by stereo matching. Then, 3D body contour descriptor (3D-BCD) is constructed to get the gait feature of human. The noise and glitch are eliminated by noise-eliminated method. Thus, manifold learning (Laplacian Eigenmaps) is used for dimensionality reduction. The nearest neighbor classifier (NN) and the nearest neighbor classifier about template (TNN) are used for classifying category. Finally, a series of experiment results on the stereo gait database of PRLAB\u2161 and the irregular test stereo gait dataset ExN proved out the high correct classification rate and the strong robustness of the proposed approach.

The agent occupies a certain position in a real-world space, and interacts with other nearby human.We developed a server that maintains information of agents and smartphone users, where the information includes current indoor position and direction. We also developed an Android application as a client, which collects real-time data from various sensors such as gyroscope, accelerometer, step detector, WiFi, magnetic field, and gravity sensor. The step detector values and WiFi signals are used to estimate the current location of the user, and the other remaining sensors are used to compute the user direction. The client application displays the real-world scene covered with some virtual objects (e.g., agent, board), as depicted in Fig. 1, where the cartoon character at the center is the dialog agent. In order to compute the right position to display the components, the client keeps consistent information of the virtual objects with the server.

ACT-R's selection mechanism, its expected value equation, has had many successes (see, for example [Anderson, J. R., & Lebiere, C. (Eds.). (1998). Atomic components of thought. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.]) and a recognized strength of this approach is that, across a wide variety of tasks, it tends to produce models that adapt to their task environment about as fast as humans adapt. (This congruence with human behavior is in marked contrast to other popular ways of computing the utility of alternative choices; for example, Reinforcement Learning or most Connectionist learning methods.) We believe that the failure to model the Blocks World task stems from the requirement in ACT-R that all actions must be counted as a binary success or failure. In Blocks World, as well as in many other circumstances, actions can be met with mixed success or partial failure. Working within ACT-R's expected value equation we replace the binary success/failure judgment with three variations on a scalar one. We then compare the performance of each alternative with ACT-R's default scheme and with the human data.

In this paper, we show that the time gap between activations of a pair of Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensors installed in the consecutively visited room pair carry rich latent information about a person's gait velocity. We name this time gap transition time and show that despite a six second refractory period of the PIR sensors, transition time can be used to obtain an accurate representation of gait velocity. ::: Using a Support Vector Regression (SVR) approach to model the relationship between transition time and gait velocity, we show that gait velocity can be estimated with an average error less than 2.5 cm/sec. This is demonstrated with data collected over a 5 year period from 74 older adults monitored in their own homes. ::: This method is simple and cost effective and has advantages over competing approaches such as: obtaining 20 to 100x more gait velocity measurements per day and offering the fusion of location-specific information with time stamped gait estimates. These advantages allow stable estimates of gait parameters (maximum or average speed, variability) at shorter time scales than current approaches. This also provides a pervasive in-home method for context-aware gait velocity sensing that allows for monitoring of gait trajectories in space and time.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1310.4880", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSEN.2016.2577708", "venue": "IEEE Sensors Journal", "journal": "IEEE Sensors Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1556530036,2963022647,2952934654", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37937284", "1500475", "28778357", "2348621", "31083716", "45941957", "3010158", "17057485", "1423706", "7264715", "3686153", "1167458", "38648429", "9297548", "13940894", "5472597", "109248037", "5646647", "26147144", "22491920", "5665917", "12530558", "10091619", "37801612", "25639912", "11645615", "25364777", "14189143", "119874162", "566709", "12290385", "109166", "961425", "14081229", "17724523", "15577321", "7310686", "5069101", "14145242"], "inbound_citations": ["2963243", "59231136", "121319698", "80628069", "67855992", "29035206", "196622453"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9561128"}

However, in a wide variety of situations, the task targeted may be more ambitious, consisting in sorting all the possible label values $y$ that may be assigned to $X$ by decreasing order of the posterior probability $\\eta_y(X)=\\mathbb{P}\\{Y=y \\mid X \\}$. This article is devoted to the analysis of this statistical learning problem, halfway between multiclass classification and posterior probability estimation (regression) and referred to as label ranking here. We highlight the fact that it can be viewed as a specific variant of ranking median regression (RMR), where, rather than observing a random permutation $\\Sigma$ assigned to the input vector $X$ and drawn from a Bradley-Terry-Luce-Plackett model with conditional preference vector $(\\eta_1(X),\\; \\ldots,\\; \\eta_K(X))$, the sole information available for training a label ranking rule is the label $Y$ ranked on top, namely $\\Sigma^{-1}(1)$. Inspired by recent results in RMR, we prove that under appropriate noise conditions, the One-Versus-One (OVO) approach to multiclassification yields, as a by-product, an optimal ranking of the labels with overwhelming probability.

In the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods based on fully convolutional neural networks, all label variables are predicted independently from each other, and the restricted field-of-views of the convolutional filters are difficult to capture the long-range information. In this paper, a novel post-processing method based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is explored to reinforce spatial contiguity in the output label maps. With the help of fully connected layers in the discriminator, the GAN can capture the long-range information, and provide an auxiliary higher-order potential loss to the segmentation model, thus the segmentation model has the ability of correcting higher order inconsistencies. Furthermore, the optimization scheme in Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) is adopted to the training process of our model to get better performance and stability.

The approach is based on copulas and support vector machines (SVMs).

It is shown that this construction of the failure boundary cannot be made in the original space due to the lack of \u201cisotropy\u201d of the probability densities. In this work the SVM is built in the uncorrelated standard normal space and refined using an adaptive sampling scheme. A transformation is used to map SVM training points and Monte-Carlo samples between the original space and the uncorrelated standard normal space. Because SVM is a classification-based approach, it can handle discontinuous responses and, more importantly, several limit states using one single SVM.

Thus, feature selection (FS) algorithms are often considered to find relevant/non-redundant features. This study aimed to evaluate the relevance of FS approaches applied to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) EEG-based diagnosis and compare the selected features with previous clinical findings. Methods Eight different FS algorithms were applied to EEG spectral measures from 22 AD patients and 12 healthy age-matched controls. The FS contribution was evaluated by considering the leave-one-subject-out accuracy of Support Vector Machine classifiers built in the datasets described by the selected features. Results The Filtered Subset Evaluator technique achieved the best performance improvement both on a per-patient basis (91.18% of accuracy) and on a per-epoch basis (85.29 \u00b1 21.62%), after removing 88.76 \u00b1 1.12% of the original features. All algorithms found out that alpha and beta bands are relevant features, which is in agreement with previous findings from the literature.

In particular, the learned concept is not static and may change over time under the influence of varying conditions (i.e. varying context).

The goal is to utilise knowledge of relevant context variables to facilitate the selection of more relevant training data. Specifically, we propose to weight each training example based on the degree of similarity with the current context. To detect such similarity, we utilise two approaches: a simple difference between the context variable values and a distribution-based distance metric.

ELM also yields good accuracy results, ranking in the top-5, alongside GBDT, RF, SVM, and C4.5 but this performance varies widely across all data sets.

There is interest in the research community to study acoustic measures that provide objective information to model PD speech. Although there are several studies in the literature that consider different characteristics of Parkinson\u2019s speech like phonation and articulation, there are no studies including the aging process as another possible source of impairments in speech. The aim of this work is to analyze the vowel articulation and phonation of Parkinson\u2019s patients compared with respect to two groups of healthy people: (1) young speakers with ages ranging from 22 to 50 years and (2) people with ages matched with respect to the Parkinson\u2019s patients. Each participant repeated the sustained phonation of the five Spanish vowels three times and those utterances per speaker are modeled by using phonation and articulation features. Feature selection is applied to eliminate redundant information in the features space, and the automatic discrimination of the three groups of speakers is performed using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) following a one vs. all strategy, speaker independent. The results are compared to those obtained using a cognitive-inspired classifier which is based on neural networks (NN). The results indicate that the phonation and articulation capabilities of young speakers clearly differ from those exhibited by the elderly speakers (with and without PD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper introducing experimental evidence to support the fact that age matching is necessary to perform more accurate and robust evaluations of pathological speech signals, especially considering diseases suffered by elderly people, like Parkinson\u2019s. Additionally, the comparison among groups of speakers at different ages is necessary in order to understand the natural change in speech due to the aging process.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-017-9497-x", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2742839404", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["13775215", "25865019", "36738865", "34047227", "208489953", "46598326", "22108874", "27836148", "42431122", "26369096", "14836749", "26733018", "33354208", "9019908", "17534983", "23964104", "13888598", "1542535", "82253990", "203931", "13527096", "26163234", "205862150", "60531168", "5543341", "206678746", "18593723", "961022", "15035716", "36306547", "110509029", "23130751", "24648560", "2363111", "10631351", "11448629", "14696389", "22548550", "120118103", "32391186", "6280595"], "inbound_citations": ["202753773", "202894885", "215309936", "208209695", "211689947", "115445316", "49471452", "88483589"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21758639"}

Since one of the important issues in statistical downscaling of GCMs is to select dominant variables among plenty of large-scale climate data (predictors), a predictors screening framework, which integrates Wavelet-Entropy (WE) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was developed in this study to statistically downscale mean monthly rainfall values. The advantage of proposed method is to reduce the noise and dimensionality of data as well as selecting reliable inputs of downscaling model for future rainfall projection. To this end, five GCMs (i.e., Can-ESM2, BNU-ESM, CSIRO-ACCESS1, GFDL-ESM2G and INM-CM4) were employed. ANN, LSSVM and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were trained to capture relationship between the predictors and the stations\u2019 observed rainfall values (predictand).

We focus on statistical IE programs which use a leading statistical model, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). We show how to model properties of the CRF inference algorithms for incremental update and how to exploit them to correctly recycle previous inference results. Then we show how to efficiently capture and store intermediate results of IE programs for subsequent recycling. We find that there is a tradeoff between the I/O cost spent on reading and writing intermediate results, and CPU cost we can save from recycling those intermediate results.

Such smart energy consumption, however, heavily relies on accurate short-term energy load forecasting, such as hourly predictions for the next $n$ $(n\\ge 2)$ hours. To attain sufficient accuracy for these predictions, it is important to exploit the relationships among the $n$ estimated outputs. This paper treats such multi-steps ahead regression task as a sequence labeling (regression) problem, and adopts the continuous conditional random fields (CCRF) to explicitly model these interconnected outputs. In particular, we improve the CCRF\u2019s computation complexity and predictive accuracy with two novel strategies. First, we employ two tridiagonal matrix computation techniques to significantly speed up the CCRF\u2019s training and inference. These techniques tackle the cubic computational cost required by the matrix inversion calculations in the training and inference of the CCRF, resulting in linear complexity for these matrix operations. Second, we address the CCRF\u2019s weak feature constraint problem with a novel multi-target edge function, thus boosting the CCRF\u2019s predictive performance. The proposed multi-target feature is able to convert the relationship of related outputs with continuous values into a set of \u201csub-relationships\u201d, each providing more specific feature constraints for the interplays of the related outputs. We applied the proposed approach to two real-world energy load prediction systems: one for electricity demand and another for gas usage. Our experimental results show that the proposed strategy can meaningfully reduce the predictive error for the two systems, in terms of mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error, when compared with three benchmarking methods.

It is desirable to develop a simple and easily interpretable prediction method with informative sequence features to provide insights into protein crystallization. This study proposes an ensemble method, SCMCRYS, to predict protein crystallization, for which each classifier is built by using a scoring card method (SCM) with estimating propensity scores of p-collocated amino acid (AA) pairs (p = 0 for a dipeptide). The SCM classifier determines the crystallization of a sequence according to a weighted-sum score. The weights are the composition of the p-collocated AA pairs, and the propensity scores of these AA pairs are estimated using a statistic with optimization approach. SCMCRYS predicts the crystallization using a simple voting method from a number of SCM classifiers. The experimental results show that the single SCM classifier utilizing dipeptide composition with accuracy of 73.90% is comparable to the best previously-developed SVM-based classifier, SVM_POLY (74.6%), and our proposed SVM-based classifier utilizing the same dipeptide composition (77.55%). The SCMCRYS method with accuracy of 76.1% is comparable to the state-of-the-art ensemble methods PPCpred (76.8%) and RFCRYS (80.0%), which used the SVM and Random Forest classifiers, respectively. This study also investigates mutagenesis analysis based on SCM and the result reveals the hypothesis that the mutagenesis of surface residues Ala and Cys has large and small probabilities of enhancing protein crystallizability considering the estimated scores of crystallizability and solubility, melting point, molecular weight and conformational entropy of amino acids in a generalized condition. The propensity scores of amino acids and dipeptides for estimating the protein crystallizability can aid biologists in designing mutation of surface residues to enhance protein crystallizability.

Next, we conducted an external evaluation of the usefulness of the approach and concluded that: i) supervised learning based on context specific data performs best for extractive summarization; ii) Random Forest trained on a combination of conversation and extractive summarization works best for predicting escalation of tickets, with the highest precision (of 0.9) and recall (of 0.55). Through external evaluation, we furthermore found that ESSMArT provides suggestions that are 71% aligned with human ones. Applying the prototype implementation to 315 customer requests resulted in an average time reduction of 9.2 min per request. ESSMArT helps to make ticket management faster and with reduced effort for human experts. We conclude that ESSMArT not only expedites ticket management, but furthermore reduces human effort.

Results: The proposed approach was experimentally validated using the finger flexion prediction dataset from the fourth BCI competition. The results show that eSPANNet results in 1) a higher classification accuracy, sensitivity and F1 score compared to several other multi-class classifiers and, 2) a better approximation of the actual movement compared to several regression analysis based approaches. Conclusion and Significance: The novelty of our algorithm is the ability to learn which inputs to focus on in an online manner.

In this paper, we propose an online Maximum Margin Correlation Tracker (MMCT) which combines the design principle of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the adaptive Correlation Filter (CF). In principle, bipartite classifier SVM is designed to offer good generalization, rather than accurate localization. In contrast, CF can provide accurate target location, but it is not explicitly designed to offer good generalization. Through incorporating SVM with CF, MMCT demonstrates good generalization as well as accurate localization. And because the appearance can be learned in Fourier domain, the computational burden is reduced significantly.

Data will have to be collected and processed in order to extract knowledge out of it, to feed users' and smart city applications. A typical approach to process such big amounts of data is to i) gather all the collected data on the cloud through wireless pervasive networks, and ii) perform data analysis operations exploiting machine learning techniques. However, according to many studies, this centralised cloud-based approach may not be sustainable from a networking point of view. The joint effect of data-intensive users' multimedia applications and smart cities monitoring and control applications may result in severe network congestions making applications hardly usable. To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a distributed machine learning approach that does not require to move data in a centralised cloud platform, but processes it directly where it is collected. Specifically, we exploit Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) to build a distributed machine learning framework. In our framework we train a series of partial models, each ''residing'' in a location where a subset of the dataset is generated. We then refine the partial models by exchanging them between locations, thus obtaining a unique complete model. Using an activity classification task on a reference dataset as a concrete example, we show that the classification accuracy of the HTL model is comparable with that of a model built out of the complete dataset, but the cost in term of network overhead is dramatically reduced. We then perform a sensitiveness analysis to characterise how the overhead depends on key parameters.

The study focuses on two evolutionary computing approaches to optimize the parameters of SVM: particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). And we combine above the two intelligent optimization methods with SVM to choose appropriate subset features and SVM parameters, which are termed GA-FSSVM (Genetic Algorithm-Feature Selection Support Vector Machines) and PSO-FSSVM(Particle Swarm Optimization-Feature Selection Support Vector Machines) models. Experimental results demonstrate that the classification accuracy by our proposed methods outperforms traditional grid search approach and many other approaches. Moreover, the result indicates that PSO-FSSVM can obtain higher classification accuracy than GA-FSSVM classification for hyperspectral data.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4236/iim.2010.26043", "venue": "Intelligent Information Management", "journal": "Intelligent Information Management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2045812742", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "36777484", "60567601", "21259921", "675013", "15943670", "120388336", "62722545", "18081491", "17401198", "2443126", "109980816", "6906514", "22519235", "7367791", "209099422", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["33078446", "28970358", "101869691", "16592423", "24698855", "23797390", "210696103"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2105614"}

As input for this reservoir we use a selection of different EEG features currently existing in seizure detection literature. This selection was made during training using a basic feature selection method. The output of the reservoir was trained using a ridge regression algorithm. ::: 3 Results : In this study intracranial rat data from two different types of generalized epilepsy are detected: absence and tonic-clonic epilepsy. For both seizure types our approach resulted in an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.99 on the test data. For absences an average detection delay of 0.3s was noted, for tonic-clonic seizures this was 1.5s. ::: The SWD detection method was tested on 15 hours of EEG-data coming from 13 GAERS rats, from which 10% was used for training. Our method outperformed the other implemented methods from which the best method was developed by Fanselow et al. in 2000 and resulted in an AUC of 0.96 and an average detection delay of more than 3 seconds. ::: To evaluate the tonic-clonic seizure detection method 4 hours and 23 minutes of data of 4 rats was used. 20% of the total dataset was used for training, the rest was used for testing.

Owing to this execution model, our approach is fundamentally different, translating Random Forest models from existing memory-bound tree-traversal algorithms to pipelined designs that use multiple automata to check all of the required thresholds independently and in parallel. We also describe techniques to handle floating-point feature values which are not supported in the native hardware, pipelining of the execution stages, and compression of automata for the fastest execution times.

The main drawback of these newer techniques is their lack of interpretability. In other words, it is difficult for the human analyst to understand the knowledge learnt by these models during training. The most popular way to overcome this difficulty is to extract if-then rules from SVM and SVR. Rules provide explanation capability to these models and improve the comprehensibility of the system. Over the last decade, different algorithms for extracting rules from SVM have been developed. However rule extraction from SVR is not widely available yet. In this paper a novel hybrid approach for extracting rules from SVR is presented. The proposed hybrid rule extraction procedure has two phases: (1) Obtain the reduced training set in the form of support vectors using SVR (2) Train the machine leaning techniques (with explanation capability) using the reduced training set. Machine learning techniques viz., Classification And Regression Tree (CART), Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Dynamic Evolving Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) are used in the phase 2. The proposed hybrid rule extraction procedure is compared to stand-alone CART, ANFIS and DENFIS. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark data sets viz. Auto MPG, Body Fat, Boston Housing, Forest Fires and Pollution, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating accurate regression rules. The efficiency of these techniques is measured using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). From the results obtained, it is concluded that when the support vectors with the corresponding predicted target values are used, the SVR based hybrids outperform the stand-alone intelligent techniques and also the case when the support vectors with the corresponding actual target values are used.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2010.02.055", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Build the cost-sensitive classifiers model for imbalanced massive data streams under MapReduce, and the data streams are processed in parallel. At last, the weighted costsensitive ensemble classifier is constructed, and the dynamic cost-sensitive ensemble classification based on extreme learning machine classification is given. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed ensemble classifier under the MapReduce framework can reduce the average misclassification cost and can make the classification results more reliable. DCECIMDS has high performance by comparing to the other classification algorithms for imbalanced data streams and can effectively deal with the concept drift.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14257/ijunesst.2015.8.1.30", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of u- and e- Service, Science and Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2188183501", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36743270", "4130095", "35716833", "32906997", "16971411", "30859420", "2188460", "17541016", "14003073", "13805036", "2529879", "10433697", "14292620"], "inbound_citations": ["133606075", "211690080"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28438583"}

Recent research suggests that deep learning technique is a promising approach to plan grasp poses on unknown objects in cluttered environments. In this field, three types of data are used for training: (a) human labeled data; (b) synthetic data; (c) real robot data. Each of them has different properties in terms of the cost of collection and label accuracy. Recent approaches solely use a single type of data to train a model. The problem of such a methodology is that human labeled data is inaccurate and costly, synthetic data is scalable but inaccurate, and real robot data is accurate but costly. In this paper, we use the method of combining synthetic data and real robot data to train a Grasp Quality Convolution Neural Network (GQ-CNN). We collect a real robot dataset of 10000 datapoints without human-annotation, by running a UR5 equipped with a pneumatic suction gripper, with an algorithmic supervisor. We use this dataset to fine-tune a GQ-CNN model. We evaluate models both by classifying collected data and running physical robot grasping experiments. We use 50 unknown objects with prismatic and complex shapes for testing. Our method achieves 100% grasp success rate on these objects, and results suggest that the fine-tuned model learns the diameter and the great suction force of the suction cup.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2946735141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:181749769"}

The experiments show that Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines perform best in classifying Albanian corpuses. Furthermore, Simple Logistics algorithm also shows good results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-75928-9_48", "venue": "EIDWT", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2792209851", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49408517"}

Using standard benchmark data, it is demonstrated that different regression model/preprocessing technique combinations exhibit different accuracies depending on the glycemic subrange under consideration. Therefore technique selection depends on the type of alert required.

It is known that EEG represents the brain activity by the electrical voltage fluctuations along the scalp, and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a device that enables the use of the brain's neural activity to communicate with others or to control machines, artificial limbs, or robots without direct physical movements. In our research work, we aspired to find the best feature extraction method that enables the differentiation between left and right executed fist movements through various classification algorithms. The EEG dataset used in this research was created and contributed to PhysioNet by the developers of the BCI2000 instrumentation system. Data was preprocessed using the EEGLAB MATLAB toolbox and artifacts removal was done using AAR. Data was epoched on the basis of Event-Related (De) Synchronization (ERD/ERS) and movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) features. Mu/beta rhythms were isolated for the ERD/ERS analysis and delta rhythms were isolated for the MRCP analysis. The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) spatial filter was applied on related channels for noise reduction and isolation of both artifactually and neutrally generated EEG sources. The final feature vector included the ERD, ERS, and MRCP features in addition to the mean, power and energy of the activations of the resulting Independent Components (ICs) of the epoched feature datasets. The datasets were inputted into two machine- learning algorithms: Neural Networks (NNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Intensive experiments were carried out and optimum classification performances of 89.8 and 97.1 were obtained using NN and SVM, respectively.

Further, we applied machine learning techniques for automated detection of AD. We used a sample of 137 patients with clinically probable AD (MMSE 20.6 \u00b15.3) and 143 healthy elderly controls, scanned in nine different scanners, obtained from the recently created framework of the European DTI study on Dementia (EDSD). For diagnostic classification we used the DTI derived indices fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) as well as grey matter density (GMD) and white matter density (WMD) maps from anatomical MRI. We performed voxel-based classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with tenfold cross validation. We compared the results from each single modality with those from different approaches to combine the modalities. For our sample, combining modalities did not increase the detection rates of AD. An accuracy of approximately 89% was reached for GMD data alone and for multimodal classification when GMD was included. This high accuracy remained stable across each of the approaches. As our sample consisted of mildly to moderately affected patients, cortical atrophy may be far progressed so that the decline in structural network connectivity derived from DTI may not add additional information relevant for the SVM classification. This may be different for predementia stages of AD. Further research will focus on multimodal detection of AD in predementia stages of AD, e.g. in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and on evaluating the classification performance when adding other modalities, e.g. functional MRI or FDG-PET.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-33530-3_2", "venue": "MBIA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1628636148", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36514894", "9380462", "2952200", "38574151", "17299530", "215332", "207178993", "6884758", "11646075", "24972439", "13466517", "8417104", "961425", "2203289", "4467142", "52874011"], "inbound_citations": ["4778884", "29336852", "58669778", "13682810", "51610741", "9967687", "31586438", "39856793", "69537852", "18982709"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38248734"}

Introdu ction In this paper a new method for calculation of heat power consumption in a heat exchanger is described. The method is based on the analysis of phenomena occurri ng on the ambient side. The calculation of heat power consumption represents an inverse heat transfer problem [1, 2]. In [3] an artificial neural network was used to approximate the characteristics of a heat exchanger. In this paper an Adaptiv e Neurofuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), trained with data obtaining from infrared thermography measurements [4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ] is used to calculate the heat power consumption in steady s tate. The experiments were carried out using measuring stand with an open chamber [9]. The problem of calculation of heat power consumption on the basis of the temperature distribution on the front surface of a radiator can be considered as the convective-radiative, inverse problem [1, 2]. In the typical (simple) heat transfer problem, the heat flux or fluid temperature is usually known. In the convective-radi ative inverse problem, the temperature distribution on the considered surface is known.

In this work, we present a simple yet powerful baseline for few-shot classification by emphasizing the importance of feature embedding. Specifically, we revisit the classical triplet network from deep metric learning, and extend it into a deep K-tuplet network for few-shot learning, utilizing the relationship among the input samples to learn a general representation learning via episode-training. Once trained, our network is able to extract discriminative features for unseen novel categories and can be seamlessly incorporated with a non-linear distance metric function to facilitate the few-shot classification. Our result on the miniImageNet benchmark outperforms other metric-based few-shot classification methods.

Most of the existing multi-atlas based methods use image intensity features to calculate the similarity between a pair of image patches for label fusion. In particular, using only low-level image intensity features cannot adequately characterize the complex appearance patterns (e.g., the high-order relationship between voxels within a patch) of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. To address this issue, this paper develops a high-order feature learning framework for multi-atlas based label fusion, where high-order features of image patches are extracted and fused for segmenting ROIs of structural brain MR images. Specifically, an unsupervised feature learning method (i.e., means-covariances restricted Boltzmann machine, mcRBM) is employed to learn high-order features (i.e., mean and covariance features) of patches in brain MR images. Then, a group-fused sparsity dictionary learning method is proposed to jointly calculate the voting weights for label fusion, based on the learned high-order and the original image intensity features. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art label fusion methods on ADNI, NIREP and LONI-LPBA40 datasets.

Among the factors contributing to genomic instability are non-B DNA structures with stem-loops and quadruplexes being the most prevalent. We aimed at investigating the impact of specifically these two classes of non-B DNA structures on cancer breakpoint hotspots using machine learning approach.MethodsWe developed procedure for machine learning model building and evaluation as the considered data are extremely imbalanced and it was required to get a reliable estimate of the prediction power. We built logistic regression models predicting cancer breakpoint hotspots based on the densities of stem-loops and quadruplexes, jointly and separately. We also tested Random Forest models varying different resampling schemes (leave-one-out cross validation, train-test split, 3-fold cross-validation) and class balancing techniques (oversampling, stratification, synthetic minority oversampling).ResultsWe performed analysis of 487,425 breakpoints from 2234 samples covering 10 cancer types available from the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We showed that distribution of breakpoint hotspots in different types of cancer are not correlated, confirming the heterogeneous nature of cancer. It appeared that stem-loop-based model best explains the blood, brain, liver, and prostate cancer breakpoint hotspot profiles while quadruplex-based model has higher performance for the bone, breast, ovary, pancreatic, and skin cancer. For the overall cancer profile and uterus cancer the joint model shows the highest performance. For particular datasets the constructed models reach high predictive power using just one predictor, and in the majority of the cases, the model built on both predictors does not increase the model performance.ConclusionDespite the heterogeneity in breakpoint hotspots\u2019 distribution across different cancer types, our results demonstrate an association between cancer breakpoint hotspots and stem-loops and quadruplexes. Approximately for half of the cancer types stem-loops are the most influential factors while for the others these are quadruplexes.

Our proposed method first compresses the original sensing data collected using wearable sensors by applying random projections on each sensor node before the data are transmitted to the central node. On the central node, each activity test sample can be approximately represented as a linear combination of all the activity samples in the training set. Then the L1 minimization method is applied to derive the sparse representation of the test sample. Residuals between the activity test sample and its corresponding sparse representation form with only nonzero entries in each activity class are calculated. The activity test sample is finally classified into the activity class with the smallest residual. Our sparse representation based activity recognition method is evaluated on a real-world dataset and its experimental results are also compared with those of Support Vector Machine and Hidden Markov Model. Outcomes of the numerical experiments show that our proposed method achieves the highest recognition rate among the three methods, which verifies the effectiveness of our method and demonstrates that sparse representation classification method based on random projections is promising in recognizing human activities using wearable sensors.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CCWC.2017.7868489", "venue": "2017 IEEE 7th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC)", "journal": "2017 IEEE 7th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2592756387", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18357791", "24202622", "4941823", "14841487", "871856", "12746776", "22230585", "7677466", "5695961", "18017635", "32819461", "2269521", "12976896"], "inbound_citations": ["42531279", "1143180", "11726758"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14770058"}

Translational bioinformatics is now more powerful than ever and has become a clinch between biological findings and clinical informatics. The computational techniques contribute by integrating multidimensional data consisting of medications, diseases, and genomes with clinical and pathological features. They are applied in various aspects with the hope of uncovering therapeutic targets and biomarkers of patient response. However, the accumulation of rich data from past studies, advancement of new experimental techniques, and ease of access to publications nowadays result in enormous repositories of scientific literatures and biomedical data, hindering the translation of molecular understandings into technologies that could impact patients. Text mining is an established field, but its application for translational bioinformatics is still a novel research direction with enormous research potential. The present issue emphasizes the application of text mining on biomedical/clinical publications and knowledge bases to facilitate the discovery and management of translational medical research knowledge. ::: ::: Rapid growth of disease related biomedical literature makes the traditional information retrieval techniques insufficient to fulfill searchers' information needs. In the paper \u201cDisease Related Knowledge Summarization Based on Deep Graph Search,\u201d X. Wu et al. developed an approach which is able to automatically retrieve disease related knowledge in a summarized form from the large volume of online biomedical literature. This approach is capable of finding both direct relations between diseases and genes as well as indirect obscure relationships among diseases and other biomedical entities. Their experiment results show that a precision of 0.6 and a recall of 0.61 can be achieved on extracting bladder cancer-related genetic entities compared to a reference standard recorded in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Genetics Home Reference database. ::: ::: The large amount of biomedical literature provides useful knowledge resource for researchers to form biomedical hypotheses. In their work entitled \u201cSupervised Learning Based Hypothesis Generation from Biomedical Literature,\u201d S. Sang et al. proposed a supervised learning-based approach to generate hypotheses from biomedical literature. This approach splits the traditional processing of hypothesis generation model into two models, the AB model and the BC model, which are constructed with a supervised learning method. The purpose of the AB model is to determine whether a physiological phenomenon is caused by a disease in a sentence, and the BC model is used to judge whether there exists an entity having physiological effects on human beings in a sentence. The experimental results on the three classic Swanson's hypotheses demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better performance in comparison to concept cooccurrence and grammar engineering-based approaches like SemRep. ::: ::: DNA, RNA, microRNA, genes, and their products play important roles in molecular biology. Recognizing them from published literature resources is a fundamental and important step in linking molecular biology observations to the clinical world. In contrast to previously developed tools, which are typically restricted to identifying genes mentions in the literature, the paper by C.-H. Wei et al. entitled \u201cGNormPlus: An Integrative Approach for Tagging Genes, Gene Families, and Protein Domains\u201d implemented an open source system that is able to detect genes, gene families, and protein domains. Furthermore, a corpus that allows the development of methods for distinguishing gene-related entities was created in this work. The new system, GNormPlus, achieved an F1-score of 0.867 on the BioCreative II gene normalization task dataset. This tool may be used to potentially solidify the automatic recognition of gene-related biological entities buried in the literature and transform the information into valuable resources. ::: ::: Due to the lack of function and resource requirement in the existed RNA-Seq databases, the study \u201cMetaRNA-Seq: An Interactive Tool to Browse and Annotate Metadata from RNA-Seq Studies\u201d presented by P. Kumar et al. constructed a web service to browse, search, and annotate RNA-Seq metadata for Homo sapiens interactively at the study level. This web tool provides enhanced utilization of metadata for RNA-Seq studies in NCBI resources with semiautomatic curation, structural presentation, and a convenient browser for study- or project-level metadata. The MetaRNA-Seq web service provides a semiautomatic curation pipeline and a friendly interface for annotating metadata. Reviewing the annotated studies with the guided search function provided by MetaRNA-Seq is indeed a supplement to the RNA-Seq metadata resources. ::: ::: Clinical studies focus on targets including diseases, symptoms, drugs, patients, laboratory measurements, and images within clinical data such as electronic health records. However, previous study has revealed that approximately half of the electronic health record data is stored as free text. Unstructured format as such makes it difficult to retrieve meaningful information. The contribution by H.-J. Dai et al. \u201cRecognition and Evaluation of Clinical Section Headings in Clinical Documents Using Token-Based Formulation with Conditional Random Fields\u201d proposed a token-based formulation with the conditional random field model to establish an electronic health record section heading recognition system. The proposed method provides an integrated solution without the requirement to develop additional heuristics rules for isolating the heading from the surrounding section contents. The authors discussed the existing approaches in section heading recognition and the possibility of applying the method to enhance the meaningful use of electronic health records. They compiled a section heading recognition corpus on the i2b2 2014 clinical dataset and used it to evaluate the performance of the developed system. The proposed method achieved a satisfactory F-score of 0.942, which outperformed the sentence-based approach and the dictionary-based system. ::: ::: Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. The study by J. Jonnagaddala et al. entitled \u201cIdentification and Progression of Heart Disease Risk Factors in Diabetic Patients from Longitudinal Electronic Health Records\u201d devised methods to extract heart disease risk factor information from unstructured electronic health records and track their progression. The study has identified the extraction of lab values and test results from unstructured records as a challenging task. The authors employed a hybrid approach combining both rule-based and machine learning clinical text mining techniques and achieved an averaged overall micro F-score of 0.8302 for identifying and tracking risk factors including coronary artery diseases, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, medication, obesity, family illness, and smoking histories. Nevertheless, their approach obtained unsatisfactory results in extracting information of coronary artery disease and related medications. ::: ::: Through this special issue, we hope to shed light on the current major advancements in the area of text mining for translational bioinformatics and seize the attention of the scientific community to pursue further investigation and propel more potential applications of text mining techniques in translational bioinformatics research.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4563058", "pubmed_id": "26380272", "doi": "10.1155/2015/368264", "venue": "BioMed research international", "journal": "BioMed research international", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1562480646", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215122062"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14165652"}

Each classifier was trained on 600 reports (300 positives, 300 negatives), and tested on 372 reports (248 positives, 124 negatives). The results were evaluated using standard measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Classifier learning rates were also evaluated, using classifier accuracy against training set size. ::: ::: Results All classifiers performed well in categorising clinical handover and patient identification incidents. Naive Bayes attained the best performance on handover incidents, correctly identifying 86.29% of reporter-classified incidents (precision=0.84, recall=0.90, F-measure=0.87, AUC=0.93) and 91.53% of expert-classified incidents (precision=0.87, recall=0.98, F-measure=0.92, AUC=0.97).

Additionally, we discuss geographical variation of calls, comment on their frequency band structure and compare calls with those described for other species of Trachycephalus. Calls of 32 males were recorded and temporal and spectral features of 269 calls were measured. To search for discrimination among three populations sampled we used the Random Forest (RF) model, Multidimensional Scaling Analysis (MDS) and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test. The advertisement calls of T. typhonius consist of a multipulsed note of 343-540 ms of duration, emitted at regular intervals, with up to three emphasized frequency bands. Dominant frequency ranged between 1705-2750 Hz. Calls from Rond\u00f4nia (Brazil) were significantly different from those recorded in Argentina and Minas Gerais (Brazil) in relation to pulse rate and dominant frequency.

Due to the complexity of climate-associated processes, identification of predictor variables from high dimensional atmospheric variables is considered a key factor for improvement of climate change projections in statistical downscaling approaches. For this purpose, the present paper adopts a new approach of supervised dimensionality reduction, which is called \u201cSupervised Principal Component Analysis (Supervised PCA)\u201d to regression-based statistical downscaling. This method is a generalization of PCA, extracting a sequence of principal components of atmospheric variables, which have maximal dependence on the response hydro-climate variable.

The effectiveness of the Supervised PCA methods in comparison with some state-of-the-art algorithms for dimensionality reduction is evaluated in relation to the statistical downscaling process of precipitation in a specific site using two soft computing nonlinear machine learning methods, Support Vector Regression and Relevance Vector Machine.

Machine tool thermal error varies considerably depending upon the specific operating parameters adopted. Most error models developed thus far generally employ neural networks to map temperature data against thermal error. However, it is very important to account for the specific conditions as well within the model. This paper presents a hybrid Support Vector Machines (SVM)\u2013Bayesian Network (BN) model that seeks to address this issue. The experimental data is first classified using a BN model with a rule-based system. Once the classification has been effected, the error is predicted using a SVM model. The hybrid thermal error model thus predicts the thermal error according to the specific operating conditions. This concept leads to a more generalised prediction model than the conventional method of directly mapping error and temperature irrespective of conditions.

To compensate for the overly smooth performance of the generative network, a gradient loss is proposed to recover the high-frequency details.

To facilitate this step we developed Hypergate, an algorithm which given a cell population of interest identifies a gating strategy optimized for high yield and purity. Results Hypergate achieves higher yield and purity than human experts, Support Vector Machines and Random-Forests on public datasets.

Second, studying the performance of various feature reduction methods and various classifiers on these synthesized datasets. The two most popular feature extraction approaches for such a problem were compared, namely the Traditional Text Categorization (TC) approach and the Stylometric Features approach (SF). Although the experimental results show the superiority of the TC approach over the SF approach, the results also indicate that the latter approach can be significantly improved by adding new and more discriminating features. The experimental results also show that the feature selection techniques reduce the accuracies of the considered classifiers under the TC and SF approaches in general.

When the number of covariates far exceeds the number of samples, the parameter estimation becomes very difficult. Researchers in many fields such as text categorization deal with the burden of finding and estimating important covariates without overfitting the model. In this study, we developed a Sparse Probit Bayesian Model (SPBM) based on Gibbs sampling which utilizes double exponentials prior to induce shrinkage and reduce the number of covariates in the model. The method was evaluated using ten domains such as mathematics, the corpuses of which were downloaded from Wikipedia. From the downloaded corpuses, we created the TFIDF matrix corresponding to all domains and divided the whole data set randomly into training and testing groups of size 300. To make the model more robust we performed 50 re-samplings on selection of training and test groups. The model was implemented in R and the Gibbs sampler ran for 60 k iterations and the first 20 k was discarded as burn in. We performed classification on training and test groups by calculating P (yi = 1) and according to [1] [2] the threshold of 0.5 was used as decision rule. Our model\u2019s performance was compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM) using average sensitivity and specificity across 50 runs.

However, such cells are exceedingly difficult to detect from blood or biopsy samples at the disease onset. It is reported that cancer cells, and especially metastatic tumor cells, show very distinctive morphological behavior compared to their healthy counterparts on aptamer functionalized substrates. The ability to quickly analyze the data and quantify the cell morphology for an instant real-time feedback can certainly contribute to early cancer diagnosis. A supervised machine learning approach is presented for identification and classification of cancer cell gestures for early diagnosis. Methods We quantified the morphologically distinct behavior of metastatic cells and their healthy counterparts captured on aptamer-functionalized glass substrates from time-lapse optical micrographs. As a proof of concept, the morphologies of human glioblastoma (hGBM) and astrocyte cells were used. The cells were captured and imaged with an optical microscope. Multiple feature vectors were extracted to quantify and differentiate the complex physical gestures of cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Three different classifier models, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Tree (RFT), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) were trained with the known dataset using machine learning algorithms. The performances of the classifiers were compared for accuracy, precision, and recall measurements using five-fold cross-validation technique. Results All the classifier models detected the cancer cells with an average accuracy of at least 82%. The NBC performed the best among the three classifiers in terms of Precision (0.91), Recall (0.9), and F1-score (0.89) for the existing dataset.

In this paper, we focus on building generative models of electron microscope (EM) images in which the positions of cell membranes and mitochondria have been densely annotated, and propose a two-stage procedure that produces realistic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (or GANs) in a supervised way. In the first stage, we synthesize a label \"image\" given a noise \"image\" as input, which then provides supervision for EM image synthesis in the second stage.

In the current context, with constantly increasing constraints like requirement ambiguity and complex development process, developing fault free reliable software is a daunting task. To deliver reliable software, it is essential to execute exhaustive number of test cases which may become tedious and costly for software enterprises. To ameliorate the testing process, a defect prediction model can be used which enables the developers to distribute their quality assurance activity on defect prone modules. However, a defect prediction models requires empirical validation to ensure their relevance to a software enterprises. In recent past, several classification and prediction models, based on historical defect data sets, have been used for early prediction of error-prone modules. Considering these facts, in this paper, a new Support Vector based Fuzzy Classification System (SVFCS) has been proposed for defective module prediction. In the proposed model an initial rule set is constructed using support vectors and Fuzzy logic. Rule set optimization is done using Genetic algorithm. The new method has been compared against two other models reported in recent literature viz.

Grouping of similar complex substances is a challenge that can be addressed via advanced analytical methods and streamlined data analysis and visualization techniques. Here, we propose a framework with unsupervised and supervised analyses to optimally group complex substances based on their analytical features. We test two data sets of complex oil-derived substances. The first data set is from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of 20 Standard Reference Materials representing crude oils and oil refining products. The second data set consists of 15 samples of various gas oils analyzed using three analytical techniques: GC-MS, GC\u00d7GC-flame ionization detection (FID), and ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IM-MS). We use hierarchical clustering using Pearson correlation as a similarity metric for the unsupervised analysis and build classification models using the Random Forest algorithm for the supervised analysis.

A hybrid load forecasting model with parameter optimization is proposed for short-term load forecasting of micro-grids, being composed of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Extreme Learning Machine with Kernel (KELM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Firstly, the time-series load data are decomposed into a number of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components through EMD. Two typical different forecasting algorithms (EKF and KELM) are adopted to predict different kinds of IMF components. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the parameters in the model. Considering the limited computation resources, an implementation mode based on off-line parameter optimization, period parameters updating and on-line load forecasting is proposed. Finally, four typical micro-grids with different users and capacities are used to test the accuracy and efficiency of the forecasting model.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.05.023", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Energy", "mag_id": "2008406084", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18846732", "56178187", "61519995", "19387264", "23855023", "54952804", "146001625", "125934718", "20605182", "6795637", "115679517", "210693226", "114425576", "86539072", "4568628", "212638011", "195831102", "16110057", "116054207", "38905501", "116123523", "19731801", "117638408", "18970225", "116625343", "42567030", "116482462", "6884897", "41573234", "77385126", "56291079", "54016782", "115199440", "116479134", "201872867", "15700297", "18358382", "25758622", "13582781", "55376594", "195736829", "210915675", "67871544", "195882800", "16030891", "210986072", "52899641", "41453614", "46881199", "46863311", "20482463", "55807666", "26797190", "21847549", "202560908", "196017839", "46807595", "16370092", "114197479", "13767000", "3009781", "806660", "36004870"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109505425"}

The goal of semi-supervised learning is to leverage ubiquitous unlabelled data, together with small quantities of labelled data, to achieve high task performance. Though substantial recent progress has been made in developing semi-supervised algorithms that are effective for comparatively small datasets, many of these techniques do not scale readily to the large (unlaballed) datasets characteristic of real-world applications. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to scalable semi-supervised learning, called Local Label Propagation (LLP). Extending ideas from recent work on unsupervised embedding learning, LLP first embeds datapoints, labelled and otherwise, in a common latent space using a deep neural network. It then propagates pseudolabels from known to unknown datapoints in a manner that depends on the local geometry of the embedding, taking into account both inter-point distance and local data density as a weighting on propagation likelihood. The parameters of the deep embedding are then trained to simultaneously maximize pseudolabel categorization performance as well as a metric of the clustering of datapoints within each psuedo-label group, iteratively alternating stages of network training and label propagation. We illustrate the utility of the LLP method on the ImageNet dataset, achieving results that outperform previous state-of-the-art scalable semi-supervised learning algorithms by large margins, consistently across a wide variety of training regimes. We also show that the feature representation learned with LLP transfers well to scene recognition in the Places 205 dataset.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.11581", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2947485218", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["49865868", "9895171", "206597351", "13953660", "84591", "7890982", "16979536", "206771194", "206594692", "6447277", "7230302", "8420436", "104291869", "207763512", "2319779", "18507866", "56517312", "17504174", "8094713", "187547", "7275771", "3966049", "14124313", "52005617", "4591284", "143422950", "167209887", "50698", "1849990", "508435", "116930672", "88523028"], "inbound_citations": ["202779035"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167217621"}

Range sensors and traditional depth estimation algorithms (both stereo and single view) predict depth for distances of less than 100 meters in outdoor settings and 10 meters in indoor settings. The shortcomings of outdoor single view methods that use learning approaches are, to some extent, due to the lack of long-range ground truth training data, which in turn is due to limitations of range sensors. To circumvent this, we first propose a novel strategy for generating synthetic long-range ground truth depth data. We utilize Google Earth images to reconstruct large-scale 3D models of different cities with proper scale. The acquired repository of 3D models and associated RGB views along with their long-range depth renderings are used as training data for depth prediction.

In certain countries the relevance taken by wind energy is particularly high within its national production share, mainly due to its large-scale wind flow patterns. This noted potentiality of wind energy has so far attracted public and private funds to support the development of advanced wind energy technologies. However, the proliferation of wind farms makes it challenging to achieve a proper electricity balance of the grid, a problem that becomes further involved due to the fluctuations of wind generation that occur at different time scales. Therefore, acquiring a predictive insight on the variability of this renewable energy source becomes essential in order to optimally inject the produced wind energy into the electricity grid. To this end the present work elaborates on a hybrid predictive model for wind power production forecasting based on meteorological data collected at different locations over the area where a wind farm is located. The proposed method hybridizes Extreme Learning Machines with a feature selection wrapper that models the discovery of the optimum subset of predictors as a metric-based search for the optimum path through a solution graph efficiently tackled via Ant Colony Optimization.

The cyclic-CO2 flooding optimization consisted of injection, soaking, and production durations over the prediction period. Also, Minimum bottom hole pressure, maximum oil production rate, and water cut were optimized for the production wells, and maximum bottom hole injection pressure and maximum gas injection rate were optimized for the injection wells. To reach the optimal solution, 176-candidate solutions were created as training experiments with 4 successive iterations of approximately 20 experiments each. The optimal solution increased oil production by 322,675 surface barrels. Next, a 2nd order polynomial regression, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Random Forest Model proxy models were constructed to metamodel the large reservoir simulator.

In this paper, GAMs are proposed as base classifiers for ensemble learning. Three alternative ensemble strategies for binary classification using GAMs as base classifiers are proposed: (i) GAMbag based on Bagging, (ii) GAMrsm based on the Random Subspace Method (RSM), and (iii) GAMens as a combination of both. In an experimental validation performed on 12 data sets from the UCI repository, the proposed algorithms are benchmarked to a single GAM and to decision tree based ensemble classifiers (i.e.\u00c2 RSM, Bagging, Random Forest, and the recently proposed Rotation Forest). From the results a number of conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, the use of an ensemble of GAMs instead of a single GAM always leads to improved prediction performance. Secondly, GAMrsm and GAMens perform comparably, while both versions outperform GAMbag. Finally, the value of using GAMs as base classifiers in an ensemble instead of standard decision trees is demonstrated. GAMbag demonstrates performance comparable to ordinary Bagging. Moreover, GAMrsm and GAMens outperform RSM and Bagging, while these two GAM ensemble variations perform comparably to Random Forest and Rotation Forest.

In general, reinforcement learning is used to solve optimization problems. Learning agents acquire a policy to accomplish the target task autonomously. To solve the problems, agents require long learning processes for trial and error. Transfer learning is one of effective methods to accelerate learning processes of machine learning algorithms. It accelerates learning processes by using prior knowledge from a policy for a source task. We propose an effective transfer learning algorithm for actor-critic method. Two basic issues for the transfer learning are method to select an effective source policy and method to reuse without negative transfer. In this paper, we mainly discuss the latter. We proposed the reuse method which based on the selection method that uses the forbidden rule set. Forbidden rule set is the set of rules that cause immediate failure of tasks. It is used to foresee similarity between a source policy and the target policy. Agents should not transfer the inappropriate rules in the selected policy. In actor-critic, a policy is constructed by two parameter sets: action preferences and state values. To avoid inappropriate rules, agents reuse only reliable action preferences and state values that imply preferred actions. We perform simple experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In conclusion, the proposed method accelerates learning processes for the target tasks.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "362282400", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["49743036", "1708582", "8358530", "207099612", "632032"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17750595"}

In practical applications major challenges are often limited field accessibility and the question on how to integrate legacy soil samples to cope with usually scarce resources for field sampling and laboratory analysis. The study focuses on the development and application of an efficiency improved DSM sampling design that (1) applies an optimized sample set size, (2) compensates for limited field accessibility, and (3) enables the integration of legacy soil samples. The proposed sampling design represents a modification of conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS), which originally returns distinct sample sites to optimally cover a soil related covariate space and to preserve the correlation of the covariates in the sample set. The sample set size was determined by comparing multiple sample set sizes of original cLHS sets according to their representation of the covariate space. Limited field accessibility and the integration of legacy samples were incorporated by providing alternative sample sites to replace the original cLHS sites. We applied the modified cLHS design (cLHSadapt) in a small catchment (4.2 km2) in Central China to model topsoil sand fractions using Random Forest regression (RF). For evaluating the proposed approach, we compared cLHSadapt with the original cLHS design (cLHSorig). With an optimized sample set size n = 30, the results show a similar representation of the cLHS covariate space between cLHSadapt and cLHSorig, while the correlation between the covariates is preserved (r = 0.40 vs. r = 0.39).

In particular, we highlight the individual and combinatorial influence of spectral and temporal components of MODIS reflectance data in land cover classification. Our study relies on an annual time series of twelve MODIS 8-days composited images (MOD09A1) monthly acquired during the year 2000, at a 500 m nominal resolution. As our aim is not to propose an operational classifier directed at thematic mapping based on the most efficient combination of reflectance inputs \u2014 which will probably change across geographical regions and with different land cover nomenclatures \u2014 we intentionally restrict our experimental framework to continental Portugal. Because our observation data stream contains highly correlated components, we need to rank the temporal and the spectral features according not only to their individual ability at separating the land cover classes, but also to their differential contribution to the existing information. To proceed, we resort to the median Mahalanobis distance as a statistical separability criterion. Once achieved this arrangement, we strive to evaluate, in a classification perspective, the gain obtained when the dimensionality of the input feature space grows. We then successively embedded the prior ranked measures into the multitemporal and multispectral training data set of a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. In this way, we show that, only the inclusion of the approximately first three dates substantially increases the classification accuracy. Moreover, this multitemporal factor has a significant effect when coupled with combinations of few spectral bands, but it turns negligible as soon as the full spectral information is exploited. Regarding the multispectral factor, its beneficence on classification accuracy remains more constant, regardless of the number of dates being used.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2007.07.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2081345410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32330530", "11259833", "16022225", "84179581", "51695198", "90080232", "8380235", "132002769", "8656545", "131223983", "3904403", "55302928", "211687574", "16830513", "12030176", "120762146", "10788254", "132993057", "13931616", "26171836", "8974588", "120121996", "14767463", "5512484", "10551087", "12872756", "530499", "2891334", "173179651", "784576", "116439138", "7628420", "16910580", "124944069", "9614041", "16789883", "3805417", "14468355", "210697551", "8642286", "7036722", "128857896", "5430665", "2357415", "15045806", "31157320", "8805431", "104293236", "3819455", "157061192", "58013916", "46897202", "61806713", "3610669", "20500153", "212711847", "53711847", "31008753"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129732113"}

Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. However, a general framework for fitting such models to experimentally measured tuning curves is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable to compute. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of measured tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, e.g., the biophysical parameters of individual cells or the particular realization of the full synaptic connectivity matrix, and directly learns model parameters which characterize the statistics of connectivity or of single-cell properties. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the entire, joint distribution of experimental tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user.

The proposed approach integrates a complex neurofuzzy system (CNFS) using complex fuzzy sets (CFSs) and ARIMA models to form the proposed computing model, which is called the CNFS-ARIMA. The output of CNFS-ARIMA is complex-valued, of which the real and imaginary parts can be used for two different functional mappings. This is the so-called dual-output property. There is no fuzzy If-Then rule in the genesis of CNFS-ARIMA. For the formation of CNFS-ARIMA, structure learning and parameter learning are involved to self-organize and self-tune the CNFS-ARIMA. A class of CFSs is used to describe the premise parts of fuzzy If-Then rules, whose consequent parts are specified by ARIMA models. CFS is an advanced fuzzy set whose membership degrees are complex-valued within the unit disc of the complex plane. With the synergetic merits of CNFS and ARIMA, CNFS-ARIMA models have excellent nonlinear mapping capability for time-series forecasting.

Although several morphing strategies have been proposed as promising approaches, very few works, however, have investigated their impact on the actual traffic classification performance. This work sets out to fulfill this gap from an empirical study point of view. It takes into account different morphing strategies exerted on packet size PS and/or inter-arrival time IAT and evaluates them by simulation. The impact is evaluated by using three popularity used classification algorithms, including C4.5, Support Vector Machines , and Naive Bayes, with various performance metrics considered. The results show that not all morphing strategies can effectively thwart traffic classification. Different morphing strategies perform distinctively in degrading traffic identification, among which the integration of PS and IAT morphings is the best, and the PS-based method alone is the worst. Furthermore, the three classifiers also exhibit distinct robustness to the morphing, with C4.5 being the most robust and Naive Bayes being the weakest. Finally, our study shows that classifiers can learn nontrivial information merely from the traffic direction patterns, which partially explains the weak protection of PS-based morphing methods because they fail to take the direction patterns into consideration.

Multivariate clustering methods have been used to define ecological regions based on subjectively chosen environmental variables. We developed and tested three procedures for defining ecological regions based on spatial modeling of a multivariate target pattern that is represented by compositional dissimilarities between locations (e.g., taxonomic dissimilarities). The procedures use a \u201ctraining dataset\u201d representing the target pattern and models this as a function of environmental variables. The model is then extrapolated to the entire domain of interest. Environmental data for our analysis were drawn from a 400 m grid covering all of Switzerland and consisted of 12 variables describing climate, topography and lithology. Our target patterns comprised land cover composition of each grid cell that was derived from interpretation of aerial photographs. For Regionalization 1 we used conventional cluster analysis of the environmental variables to define 60 hierarchically organized levels comprising from 5 to 300 regions. Regionalization 1 provided a base-case for comparison with the model-based regionalizations. Regionalization 2, 3 and 4 also comprised 60 hierarchically organized levels and were derived by modeling land cover composition for 4000 randomly selected \u201ctraining\u201d cells. Regionalization 2 was based on cluster analysis of environmental variables that were transformed based on a Generalized Dissimilarity Model (GDM). Regionalization 3 and 4 were defined by clustering the training cells based on their land cover composition followed by predictive modeling of the distribution of the land cover clusters using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF) models. Independent test data (i.e. not used to train the models) were used to test the discrimination of land cover composition at all hierarchical levels of the regionalizations using the classification strength (CS) statistic. CS for all the model-based regionalizations was significantly higher than for Regionalization 1. Regionalization 3 and 4 performed significantly better than Regionalization 2 at finer hierarchical levels (many regions) and Regionalization 4 performed significantly better than Regionalization 3 for coarse levels of detail (few regions).

Video summarization, the task of finding the smallest subset of frames, which still conveys the whole story of a given video, is thus of great significance to improve efficiency of video understanding. We propose a novel Dilated Temporal Relational Generative Adversarial Network (DTR-GAN) to achieve frame-level video summarization. Given a video, it selects the set of key frames, which contain the most meaningful and compact information. Specifically, DTR-GAN learns a dilated temporal relational generator and a discriminator with three-player loss in an adversarial manner. A new dilated temporal relation (DTR) unit is introduced to enhance temporal representation capturing. The generator uses this unit to effectively exploit global multi-scale temporal context to select key frames and to complement the commonly used Bi-LSTM. To ensure that summaries capture enough key video representation from a global perspective rather than a trivial randomly shorten sequence, we present a discriminator that learns to enforce both the information completeness and compactness of summaries via a three-player loss. The loss includes the generated summary loss, the random summary loss, and the real summary (ground-truth) loss, which play important roles for better regularizing the learned model to obtain useful summaries.

To evaluate the performance of different strategies, one important evaluation criterion is robustness, which is to investigate which negotiating strategies the agents are going to adopt finally if they are given the opportunity to repeatedly negotiate and allowed to change their choices. However the current way of evaluating the robustness suffers from several drawbacks. First, it is assumed that all agents can have access to the global payoff information, which may not be available beforehand in practice. Second, it is based on the single-agent best deviation principle, however, in practice, each agent may change their strategies simultaneously and in any possible rational way. To this end, we firstly propose the repeated negotiation game learning framework to evaluate the robustness of different negotiation strategies, in which each agent can adopt any rational learning approach to make decisions without knowing the global payoff information beforehand.

Depth images are advantageous over normal colour images because of how easily objects in a scene can be segregated in real-time. Microsoft used the depth images from the Kinect to successfully separate multiple users and track various larger body joints, but has difficulty tracking smaller joints such as those of the fingers. This is a result of the low resolution and noisy nature of the depth images produced by the Kinect. The objective of this project is to use the depth images produced by the Kinect to remotely track the user\u2019s hands and to recognise the static hand poses in real-time. Such a system would make it possible to control an electronic device from a distance without the use of a remote control. It can be used to control computer systems during computer aided presentations, translate sign language and to provide more hygienic control devices in clean rooms such as operating theatres and electronic laboratories. The proposed system uses the open-source OpenNI framework to retrieve the depth images from the Kinect and to track the user\u2019s hands. Random Decision Forests are trained using computer generated depth images of various hand poses and used to classify the hand regions from a depth image. The region images are processed using a Mean-Shift based joint estimator to find the 3D joint coordinates. These coordinates are finally used to classify the static hand pose using a Support Vector Machine trained using the libSVM library. The system achieves a final accuracy of 95.61% when tested against synthetic data and 81.35% when tested against real world data. ii Stellenbosch University http://scholar.sun.ac.za", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2147547786", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62396726"}

The results of the fitting process are used in a facial expression recognition task using a region-based intermediate representation related to Action Units, with the expression classification task realised using a Support Vector Machine. Experiments are performed for both person-dependent and person-independent setups. Overall, the best facial expression recognition results were obtained by using the Iterative Error Bound Minimisation method, which consistently resulted in accurate face model alignment and facial expression recognition even when the initial face detection used to initialise the fitting procedure was poor.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACII.2009.5349489", "venue": "2009 3rd International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction and Workshops", "journal": "2009 3rd International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction and Workshops", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2101909076", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9832894", "15823252", "693754", "33520001", "14096429", "6029328", "14465553", "11269423", "2443126", "16251989", "1560575", "6603524", "207578069", "2245165", "16879760", "3170501", "6980052"], "inbound_citations": ["12735462", "1403431", "10593937", "50002362", "201033391", "215514982", "31727077", "9047720", "4358006", "2483224", "753606", "17028002", "15387778", "18228594", "9923051", "4592066", "15664502", "6976991", "151867623", "58954545", "15524641", "32399654", "2637589", "6558379", "15196103", "877775", "14052060", "16361974", "3333563", "6537375"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6319875"}

Motivation: In software design phase, inexperienced designers are mostly concerned on how to select an appropriate design pattern from the catalog of relevant patterns in order to solve a design problem. The existing automated design pattern selection methodologies are limited to the need of formal specification of design patterns or an appropriate sample size to make the learning process more effective. Method: To address this concern, we propose a three step methodology to automate the selection process of design pattern for a design problem. The steps of the methodology are text preprocessing, use of an unsupervised learning technique (that is Fuzzy c-Mean) as a core function to quantitatively determine the resemblance of different objects and selection of most appropriate pattern for a design problem. We evaluate our methodology with two samples that is Gang-of-Four (GoF) design pattern and spoiled pattern collection, and three object-oriented related design problems. Moreover, we used Fuzzy Silhouette test, Kappa (k) test, Cosine Similarity and argmax function to measure the effectiveness of our methodology. Results: In case of GoF pattern collection, we validated the reliability of Fuzzy c-Mean (FCM) results using a classification decision tree, and observed promising results compared to other automation techniques.

As part of our derivation we find that many previous multimodal variational autoencoders used objectives that do not correctly bound the joint marginal likelihood across modalities. We further generalize our objective to work with several types of deep generative model (VAE, GAN, and flow-based), and allow use of different model types for different modalities. We benchmark our models across many image, label, and text datasets, and find that our multimodal VAEs excel with and without weak supervision.

However, the inconsistent distribution and representation between fMRI signals and visual images cause the heterogeneity gap, which makes it challenging to learn a reliable mapping between them. Moreover, considering that fMRI signals are extremely high-dimensional and contain a lot of visually-irrelevant information, effectively reducing the noise and encoding powerful visual representations for image reconstruction is also an open problem. We show that it is possible to overcome these challenges by learning a visually-relevant latent representation from fMRI signals guided by the corresponding visual features, and recovering the perceived images via adversarial learning.

Considering that current adopted methods are only suitable for excavating the time period of non-occurrence of dust storm rather than the regularity of dust storm occurrence, we find that the current algorithms are defective in studying rare classes, thus their accuracy is relatively low and is difficult to be improved.

In this combination algorithm, we first balance the samples of different classes according to the idea of SMOTE algorithm, and then we make predictions utilizing random forest algorithm according to the adaboost system.

The two major contributions of our work are (1) as the words in the news documents are not absolutely negative or positive, and the lengths of the financial news documents are various; here, we propose a new sentimental analysis methodology based on mutual information to improve the efficiency of feature selection, which is different from the traditional sentimental analysis algorithm, and a new weighting scheme is also used in the feature weighting process; (2) since ELM is a fast learning model and has been successfully applied in many research fields, we propose a prediction model which combined mutual information-based sentimental analysis with kernel-based ELM named as MISA-K-ELM.

State-of-the art methods for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) build models using hand-crafted features that usually capturing shallow linguistic information. Complex background knowledge, such as semantic relationships, are typically either not used, or used in specialised manner, due to the limitations of the feature-based modelling techniques used. On the other hand, empirical results from the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems have repeatedly shown that they can use diverse sources of background knowledge when constructing models. In this paper, we investigate whether this ability of ILP systems could be used to improve the predictive accuracy of models for WSD. Specifically, we examine the use of a general-purpose ILP system as a method to construct a set of features using semantic, syntactic and lexical information. This feature-set is then used by a common modelling technique in the field (a support vector machine) to construct a classifier for predicting the sense of a word. In our investigation we examine one-shot and incremental approaches to feature-set construction applied to monolingual and bilingual WSD tasks. The monolingual tasks use 32 verbs and 85 verbs and nouns (in English) from the SENSEVAL-3 and SemEval-2007 benchmarks; while the bilingual WSD task consists of 7 highly ambiguous verbs in translating from English to Portuguese.

Moreover, it is time-consuming to manually label huge amounts of driving data due to uncertainties of driver behavior and variances among the data analysts. To address this problem, a semisupervised approach, a semisupervised support vector machine (S3VM), is employed to classify drivers into aggressive and normal styles based on a few labeled data points. First, a few data clusters are selected and manually labeled using a $ k$ -means clustering method. Then, a specific differentiable surrogate of a loss function is developed, which makes it feasible to use standard optimization tools to solve the nonconvex optimization problem. One of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is then used to assign the optimal label to all of the training data. Finally, we compare the S3VM method with a support vector machine method for classifying driving styles from different amounts of labeled data. Experiments show that the S3VM method can improve the classification accuracy by about 10% and reduce the labeling effort by using only a few labeled data clusters among huge amounts of unlabeled data.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/THMS.2017.2736948", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2746721413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["54813582", "14390213", "25266132", "28622340", "5760346", "208121821", "110406477", "110809581", "14909029", "106765315", "115093371", "14845188", "22822206", "60691042", "39540829", "32260010", "110944929", "15605090", "64137185", "1688946", "109667119", "18403642", "15881133", "16226488", "55589353", "18550758", "8020836", "17155710", "3238213", "53872239", "18343919", "9265645", "3705154", "14283441", "198120256", "113050215", "110579212", "29515540", "108822336", "15808443"], "inbound_citations": ["198164835", "51864708", "3544255", "115980898", "208548145", "208629935", "208631934", "53397193", "197680839", "211146414", "21679046", "39475860", "4758368", "53014302", "128358881", "46941377", "2048198", "53281732", "58050962", "198145343", "198146216", "54463823", "203610475", "81978181", "203705913", "212644748", "23289842", "195775508", "116144379", "49905056", "199557984", "53452731", "116320599", "211691537", "9306810"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25851919"}

Also, most of them cannot fully exploit the structure embedded in the multimodal data. This paper introduces embedding layer to provide cross-modal shared representation with non-linearity and reformulates the cross-modal retrieval problem as a graph embedding problem by constructing a multimodal graph. To learn the graph embedding, training pairs and triplets are uniformly generated from random walk sequences on the graph. Then graph pair and triplet constraints are imposed on the embedding layer for structure preservation. Meanwhile, a classifier is trained with labeled data to ensure the learned embedding is coupled with semantic information. For optimization, graph pair and triplet constraints are integrated into a unified multi-task learning with the supervised classifier.

The outcomes demonstrate the GLSSVM method with the DirRec strategy can give a normalized error of 2.92% under different weather conditions with evident improvements respect to the traditional ANN (Artificial Neural Network).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2016.04.020", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy", "mag_id": "2347494083", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["44430082", "54440449", "210671343", "52105905", "20790795"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112944238"}

Conventional metric learning methods learn a single linear Mahalanobis metric, yet such linear projections are not powerful enough to capture the nonlinear relationships. Recently, deep metric learning approaches, such as discriminative deep metric learning and deep transfer metric learning, have been introduced to fully exploit the nonlinearity of samples by learning hierarchical nonlinear transformations. However, these methods only learn holistic metrics over the input space and are limited for the heterogeneous data sets, where data varies locally. In this paper, we propose a deep localized metric learning approach for visual recognition by learning multiple fine-grained deep localized metrics. We first learn $K$ local subspaces and one holistic subspace with the K-auto-encoders-based clustering. Then, given an input pair, we compute its localized distance on each learned subspace and obtain the final distance representation. Finally, we train the entire neural networks to ensure the distances of positive pairs smaller than negative pairs by a large margin. Experimental results on three visual recognition applications, including face recognition, person re-identification, and scene recognition, show that our DLML outperforms most existing metric learning approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2711015", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2621325716", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206592295", "4637184", "3217198", "4854422", "3043202", "9643263", "207763512", "14124313", "206594692", "13417115", "4525490", "1826741", "8600094", "47325215", "2814112", "1010081", "14679447", "10589121", "13241530", "11072034", "11843115", "10070153", "2145760", "369876", "16512846", "10519398", "12148694", "14124239", "7839088", "2814088", "206592766", "206592484", "14243997", "18453384", "6213726", "9022685", "656536", "9898157", "130535382", "1502583", "14166521", "8009203", "6079839", "206591781", "12353933", "14057321", "5825434", "5726206", "11257247", "27525955", "4616444", "15225312", "425268", "2304733", "1661291", "13536642", "15229292", "84297", "11783552", "61863364", "1849990", "14864236", "8763431", "15405383", "6334137", "1346519", "15408668", "7989590", "206593051", "18605691"], "inbound_citations": ["54462907", "69723750", "204969091", "52967007", "212642810", "201710040", "199002749", "69324408", "30056608", "167207498", "51611259"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53082739"}

Identification of m6A sites is fundamentally important for better understanding of their functional mechanisms. Recently, machine learning based prediction methods have emerged as an effective approach for fast and accurate identification of m6A sites. In this paper, we proposed \u201cM6AMRFS\u201d, a new machine learning based predictor for the identification of m6A sites. In this predictor, we exploited a new feature representation algorithm to encode RNA sequences with two feature descriptors (di-nucleotide binary encoding and Local position-specific dinucleotide frequency), and used the F-score algorithm combined with SFS (Sequential Forward Search) to enhance the feature representation ability. To predict m6A sites, we employed the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to build a predictive model. Benchmarking results showed that the proposed predictor is competitive with the state-of-the art predictors. Importantly, robust predictions for multiple species by our predictor demonstrate our predictive models have strong generalization ability. To the best of our knowledge, M6AMRFS is the first tool that can be used for the identification of m6A sites in multiple species. To facilitate the use of our predictor, we have established a user-friendly webserver with the implementation of M6AMRFS, which is currently available in http://server.malab.cn/M6AMRFS/.

We conclude by discussing the main theoretical and practical challenges associated with the implementation of this method into the clinic and possible future directions.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22305994", "doi": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.01.004", "venue": "Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews", "journal": "Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews", "mag_id": "1969959732", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21528367", "2394357", "71146671", "214725042", "210907432", "1200565", "11668644", "11154720", "41402165", "3779750", "11138408", "4908871", "13699443", "32294020", "2478460", "4767262", "3830552", "215269228", "9092372", "215223916", "3316183", "23423085", "215604059", "579349", "5033666", "37430069", "25475826", "7318622", "174798593", "17369035", "14884976", "52114364", "22167940", "3368416", "174812816", "189813289", "6573721", "210157425", "52877951", "2782130", "2331188", "3034688", "207198396", "207198396", "17884321", "201843589", "149107249", "193205", "12026304", "49666435", "174819290", "52947116", "14971751", "9780742", "9176539", "9978015", "54447726", "13840899", "215166581", "56910428", "39341953", "3665372", "4467554", "25687041", "109289139", "215327058", "215472346", "210985902", "11242742", "25974215", "13046983", "42452113", "16922724", "4611736", "7782110", "51915126", "63562826", "196616239", "12386511", "5835640", "21023929", "11703045", "167207116", "15551566", "121304886", "215128047", "30195862", "167209785", "4773443", "140478849", "6042951", "210986371", "1270399", "1585716", "215041664", "215008074", "10679072", "25588636", "52963627", "8429417", "4634700", "14515700", "189893379", "215037278", "2797350", "3377541", "6563396", "33887910", "214978145", "1447703", "2518268", "197682578", "204800284", "3310882", "203661153", "7497627", "44101123", "208978756", "3824164", "3343219", "10221646", "8916901", "90465014", "25042564", "58015038", "214883292", "17395457", "37170998", "21504559", "212703446", "54558618", "46448997", "10681586", "52313220", "4394044", "14406903", "201062534", "8212774", "9190371", "15603572", "18501055", "215270680", "186203519", "41348485", "7046977", "3922225", "215464511", "4800320", "14542376", "88868082", "46820658", "52004463", "5823943", "63387179", "46605906", "24375999", "215600027", "208591144", "9588245", "215229120", "41415932", "7321361", "23838228", "215455563", "49211102", "58026715", "21740954", "43707033", "214722366", "201835092", "7032830", "26579486", "49349432", "16951607", "17766609", "67772756", "15349271", "4408242", "14717799", "674222", "199504862", "4842784", "18570010", "215699731", "7827584", "22424355", "214903260", "20117583", "34611602", "18159960", "24748950", "42462061", "2021440", "59490445", "2510318", "3069347", "204807356", "16332495", "3974348", "15314851", "46944000", "27073145", "15737709", "3552509", "215418708", "195064077", "17190923", "8578878", "215107298", "73491446", "10887637", "52306689", "2554275", "3823692", "17502445", "203617516", "12096572", "4759310", "70103", "54810", "207188645", "16005915", "53246778", "9039238", "3354544", "214832583", "10823355", "463201", "5255065", "14875103", "17406056", "214946435", "207914289", "45352612", "215197216", "62881456", "3159886", "5786860", "56357814", "16147797", "5509976", "4545641", "9166261", "13406749", "207017399", "211547388", "37558779", "15321460", "129004467", "11513963", "209411589", "5730394", "3252936", "13773641", "17159358", "215691639", "21308332", "4642090", "4491774", "81975996", "16537826", "23002127", "206970660", "10557999", "21951438", "49391406", "40177840", "1146298", "10191356", "10191356", "86863875", "215203038", "113753228", "53647584", "9615405", "3519334", "4380392", "5396749", "11575659", "39210177", "24090226", "52196802", "215118917", "5602329", "64948498", "3847953", "53281101", "214901848", "25475369", "39144837", "215275447", "215428077", "4227917", "55154209", "22415439", "9556991", "25364403", "184487538", "208143212", "18018597", "56990567", "207093716", "52243598", "53945587", "24467636", "59279584", "204939659", "14653915", "9996526", "16996083", "3574892", "196670660", "17836546", "36902580", "7005732", "56282149", "26263904", "15726662", "13651823", "12368762", "15422201", "8855968", "214679433", "201968169", "14102252", "210117403", "1855986", "17084010", "5045863", "52141252", "170079079", "2778196", "78093644", "22221602"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21221784"}

Thus, it is urgent to identify recurrence-related markers. We investigated the effectiveness of CpG methylation in predicting recurrence for patients with E-HCCs. Patients and Methods In total, 576 patients with E-HCC from four independent centers were sorted by three phases. In the discovery phase, 66 tumor samples were analyzed using the Illumina Methylation 450k Beadchip. Two algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination, were used to select significant CpGs. In the training phase, penalized Cox regression was used to further narrow CpGs into 140 samples. In the validation phase, candidate CpGs were validated using an internal cohort (n = 141) and two external cohorts (n = 191 and n =104). Results After combining the 46 CpGs selected by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation and the Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination algorithms, three CpGs corresponding to SCAN domain containing 3, Src homology 3-domain growth factor receptor-bound 2-like interacting protein 1, and peptidase inhibitor 3 were highlighted as candidate predictors in the training phase. On the basis of the three CpGs, a methylation signature for E-HCC (MSEH) was developed to classify patients into high- and low-risk recurrence groups in the training cohort ( P < .001). The performance of MSEH was validated in the internal cohort ( P < .001) and in the two external cohorts ( P < .001; P = .002). Furthermore, a nomogram comprising MSEH, tumor differentiation, cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and antivirus therapy was generated to predict the 5-year recurrence-free survival in the training cohort, and it performed well in the three validation cohorts (concordance index: 0.725, 0.697, and 0.693, respectively).

Existing large-scale visual datasets with annotations such as image class labels, bounding boxes and region descriptions are good sources for learning rich and diverse visual concepts. However, it is not straightforward how the visual concepts can be captured and transferred to visual question answering models due to missing link between question dependent answering models and visual data without question. We tackle this problem in two steps: 1) learning a task conditional visual classifier, which is capable of solving diverse question-specific visual recognition tasks, based on unsupervised task discovery and 2) transferring the task conditional visual classifier to visual question answering models. Specifically, we employ linguistic knowledge sources such as structured lexical database (e.g. WordNet) and visual descriptions for unsupervised task discovery, and transfer a learned task conditional visual classifier as an answering unit in a visual question answering model. We empirically show that the proposed algorithm generalizes to out-of-vocabulary answers successfully using the knowledge transferred from the visual dataset.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1810.02358", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00858", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2972581488,2895135219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["19298149", "3753452", "6918332", "58727669", "7278297", "207167677", "5201925", "206597351", "261138", "2840197", "8081284", "15208114", "206594692", "47018509", "11050189", "15458100", "4445015", "51969884", "195908774", "7016601", "7249642", "4406645", "3158329", "14420812", "19347376", "1957433", "10328909", "8457705", "5692837", "7483388", "206594383", "8849206", "6153535", "5714907"], "inbound_citations": ["202537727", "212644515"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52934282"}

Emotions produce different psycho physiological signal which is either stimulated by conscious or unconscious profundity of a situation or an object. Emotion has a key role in human communication as well as in modern BCI (brain-computer interaction) systems. Most of the contemporary BCI systems are lacking emotional intelligence and also they are not able to detect human emotional states for proper execution of action. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the common methods to acquire brain signals for brain computer interface (BCI). Most of the works for emotion recognition using EEG data are complex and with relatively average performance obtained. Hence, there is still a lot of space for developing a better performing system in emotion recognition. In the present work, a wavelet based better performing feature extraction algorithm is proposed. Further this algorithm is tested for different classifiers namely k Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The goal of future data-recording is to optimise the success factors: security, costs, time and quality. This is especially relevant in shield tunnelling taking into account the significant monetary and schedule risks, connected to a disturbed construction process or malfunction (mechanical damage, collapse, etc.). To adequately utilize the information potential of the data an analysis simultaneous to the advance of the shield is necessary. The results of such an analysis can be used preventively in the further process and optimise the current advance. This paper presents the current situation of data recording and data analysis and defines future requirements regarding a database management system for the administration and simultaneous analysis of the data. The different methods of statistic or knowledge-based analysis of data gained during tunnelling (statistics, fuzzy-logic, neural networks and neuro-fuzzy) are presented and discussed using examples. The huge amount of registered tunnel drive data can only provide useful information in order to optimise the drive when the data is systematically analysed. The manual data analysis performed until now in root course analysis and in the shield drive documentation is not sufficient. On the one hand the involved experts can only analyse part of the data, and on the other hand the analysis is time consuming so that the given results are delayed. An automatic analysis of all the drive data using the discussed methods and tools would therefore greatly increase the capacity and efficiency of the experts. The first requirement for a systematic evaluation is the structurised saving and management of the data within a database management system (DBMS), which provides an individual source for further data evaluation. Simple statistical methods and the more complex neuronal networks (NN) can offer part of the support required by the experts, since they can detect relationships within the unmanageable amount of data and allow simulation of construction situations. The use of NN is suitable for very complex and difficult to formulate problems, with a sufficient amount of example data available. But the so-called black-box behaviour of these NN prevents a direct manual intervention in the process of analysing and leads to solution, which can often not be understood. Fuzzy logic makes it possible to consider the engineering know-how (expert knowledge) and also the intuition in the data analysis and the process controlling. The outstanding compatibility and integration possibilities in the standardised controller and SPS systems are advantageous for the application in shield tunnelling. The main principle of the fuzzy technology is the formulation of a problem with linguistic rules and variables instead of figures and formulas. Relationships are not described through complex mathematical models, but through simple rule based conclusions, in the same way as the human thinking. They represent another interesting possibility for mechanised tunnelling, since they allow to implement the existing practical knowledge into an automatic evaluation and analysis procedure. Neurofuzzy methods are the combination of NN with the fuzzy technology. These methods can be integrated into standard hardware and software applications. Together with the data analysis for the specification of guide values, it is possible to think in the future of further automation of sub-processes up to an integral process-controlling system.

Including such correlations drastically reduces the size of the training set needed, accounts for time-lagged relationships, and enables downscaling even in the presence of short gaps in the auxiliary data. The algorithm is based upon bagged regression trees (BRT) and uses correlations between high-resolution remote sensing products and SM observations. The algorithm trains multiple regression trees and automatically chooses the trees that generate the best downscaled estimates. The algorithm was evaluated using a multi-scale synthetic dataset in north central Florida for two years, including two growing seasons of corn and one growing season of cotton per year.

A major line of researches employs hard data mining, which makes efforts on searching a subset of significant data. However, hard data mining based approaches only rely on a small percentage of data, which is apt to overfitting. This motivates us to propose a novel framework, named deep asymmetric metric learning via rich relationship mining (DAMLRRM), to mine rich relationship under satisfying sampling size. DAMLRRM constructs two asymmetric data streams that are differently structured and of unequal length. The asymmetric structure enables the two data streams to interlace each other, which allows for the informative comparison between new data pairs over iterations. To improve the generalization ability, we further relax the constraint on the intra-class relationship. Rather than greedily connecting all possible positive pairs, DAMLRRM builds a minimum-cost spanning tree within each category to ensure the formation of a connected region. As such there exists at least one direct or indirect path between arbitrary positive pairs to bridge intra-class relevance. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets including CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products show that DAMLRRM effectively boosts the performance of existing deep metric learning approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00420", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2959898566", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14342571", "5518345", "198120201", "2120774", "5555257", "1325997", "2261947", "78094295", "52044673", "13417115", "8281592", "2637786", "1845522", "1139945", "16382303", "4466042", "5850884", "1799558", "207763512", "4606637", "11193591", "14618636", "17861456", "206595144", "1136006", "2930547", "653791", "206592766", "49897094", "14124313", "911406", "5726681", "1395439", "206592484", "2814088", "23083969", "2897719", "47325215", "24718057", "2643381", "54034334", "51609659", "50768996", "10024504", "51610534", "30912239", "56178972", "58951815", "19149393", "7849657", "9757556", "229339", "508435", "7724688"], "inbound_citations": ["204957123", "199472785", "208527171"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198184907"}

The reconstruction of a bifurcation diagram estimates the oscillatory patterns of a target system when its parameters are changed. These patterns can be periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic. Examples of the parameters are electric current and power, temperature, pressure, and concentration. We also estimate Lyapunov exponents so that the reconstructed bifurcation diagram can be quantitatively evaluated. We use typical chaotic systems as target for the reconstruction of bifurcation diagrams, such as logistic and Henon maps, as well as Rossler equations.

We studied 25 individuals with an At Risk Mental State for psychosis and 25 healthy controls using structural MRI, and functional MRI in conjunction with a verbal memory task. Data were analysed using a standard univariate analysis, and with Support Vector Machine (SVM), a multivariate pattern recognition technique that enables statistical inferences to be made at the level of the individual, yielding results with high translational potential. The application of SVM to structural MRI data permitted the identification of individuals at high risk of psychosis with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 76%, resulting in an accuracy of 72% (p<0.001). Univariate volumetric between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, the univariate fMRI analysis identified between-group differences (p<0.05 corrected) while the application of SVM to the same data did not.

A SentiWordNet is typically generated from WordNet in which each synset has numerical scores to indicate its opinion polarities. However, Vietnamese WordNet is not yet available currently. Therefore, we propose a method to construct a VSWN from a Vietnamese electronic dictionary, not from WordNet. The main drawback of constructing a VSWN from a dictionary is that it is easy to suffer from the sparsity problem, since the glosses in the dictionary are short in general. As a solution to this problem, we adopt a string kernel function which measures the string similarity based on both common contiguous and non-contiguous subsequences. According to our experimental results, first, the use of string kernel outperforms a baseline model which uses the standard bag-of-word kernel. Second, the Vietnamese SentiWordNet is competitive with the English SentiWordNet which uses WordNet when it constructed.

In this paper, we argue that the clusters formed by positive examples and potential negative examples in the feature space should be critically utilized to establish the PU learning model, especially when the negative data are not explicitly available.

Theoretically, we derived the generalization error bound of LLSVM which reveals that the introduction of PU data does help to enhance the algorithm performance.

Moreover, multi-instance (MI) relation is embedded along the consecutive layers. Both the ML structure and MI relation are essential for video concept detection. The previous work [5] dealt with ML structure and MI relation by constructing a MLMI kernel in which each layer is assumed to have equal contribution. However, such equal weighting technique cannot well model MI relation or handle ambiguity propagation problem, i.e., the propagation of uncertainty of sublayer label through multiple layers, as it has been proved that different layers have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named MILC2 (Multi-Layer Multi-Instance Learning with Inter-layer Consistency Constraint.) to tackle the ambiguity propagation problem, in which an inter-layer consistency constraint is explicitly introduced to measure the disagreement of inter-layers, and thus the MI relation is better modeled. This learning task is formulated in a regularization framework with three components including hyper-bag prediction error, inter-layer inconsistency measure, and classifier complexity.

We first (a) design a hierarchical representation of complex activity taxonomy in terms of human-readable semantic attributes, and (b) develop a hierarchy of classifiers which incorporates a cluster tree built on the domain knowledge from training samples. Though this model is rich in recognizing complex activities that are previously seen in training data, it is not well versed to recognize unseen complex activities without new training samples. To tackle this challenge, we extend Hierarchical Active Transfer Learning (HATL) approach that exploits semantic attribute cluster structure of complex activities shared between seen (source) and unseen (target) activity domains.

Distinguishing between what is true, what is false and what is unknown can be useful in situations where decisions have to be taken on the basis of scarce, ambiguous, or downright contradictory information. In a three-valued setting, we learn a definition for both the target concept and its opposite, considering positive and negative examples as instances of two disjoint classes. To this purpose, we adopt Extended Logic Programs (ELP) under a Well-Founded Semantics with explicit negation (WFSX) as the representation formalism for learning, and show how ELPs can be used to specify combinations of strategies in a declarative way also coping with contradiction and exceptions.Explicit negation is used to represent the opposite concept, while default negation is used to ensure consistency and to handle exceptions to general rules. Exceptions are represented by examples covered by the definition for a concept that belong to the training set for the opposite concept.Standard Inductive Logic Programming techniques are employed to learn the concept and its opposite. Depending on the adopted technique, we can learn the most general or the least general definition. Thus, four epistemological varieties occur, resulting from the combination of most general and least general solutions for the positive and negative concept. We discuss the factors that should be taken into account when choosing and strategically combining the generality levels for positive and negative concepts.In the paper, we also handle the issue of strategic combination of possibly contradictory learnt definitions of a predicate and its explicit negation.All in all, we show that extended logic programs under well-founded semantics with explicit negation add expressivity to learning tasks, and allow the tackling of a number of representation and strategic issues in a principled way.Our techniques have been implemented and examples run on a state-of-the-art logic programming system with tabling which implements WFSX.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1007681906490", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1575741940", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["392315", "1527620", "2436763", "14270899", "5672134", "58253094", "10659111", "122553054", "168624574", "2884276", "45343550", "59814754", "60789806", "41328852", "7790233", "5053470", "15875914", "7246502", "8058325", "36237350", "43615542", "61536073", "12643399", "14992676", "2769679", "18672432", "27884159", "157595", "62688491", "5262555", "12753612", "61182438"], "inbound_citations": ["16087016", "540708", "8859509", "12983036", "7422773", "3200415", "14513872", "1275239", "16648643", "9721333", "7832423", "30908236", "15601108", "18449335", "7246502", "4606702", "6153112"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7246502"}

Since support vector machines (SVMs) tend to scale better and run faster than neural networks with higher accuracy, we apply the technique of deleting one feature at a time to perform experiments on SVMs to rank the importance of input features for the DARPA collected intrusion data.

This enlarges the list of methods that are eventually useful to the purpose at hand and justifies an overall examination of their distinguishing features. This task is performed in this paper from the point of view of the Theory of Statistical Learning, which provides a unified framework for all regression, classification and probability density estimation. The classification methods are grouped into three categories and it is shown that only one group is useful for structural reliability, according to some specific criteria. In this category are the Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the Support Vector Machines, which are the recommended methods because (a) they can estimate the function on the basis of a few samples, (b) they use flexible and adaptive models and (c) they can overcome the curse of dimensionality.

Although a variety of powerful algorithms have been presented in the past few years, most of them usually focus on designing hand-crafted features and learning metrics either individually or sequentially. Different from previous works, we formulate a unified deep ranking framework that jointly tackles both of these key components to maximize their strengths. We start from the principle that the correct match of the probe image should be positioned in the top rank within the whole gallery set. An effective learning-to-rank algorithm is proposed to minimize the cost corresponding to the ranking disorders of the gallery. The ranking model is solved with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that builds the relation between input image pairs and their similarity scores through joint representation learning directly from raw image pixels. The proposed framework allows us to get rid of feature engineering and does not rely on any assumption. An extensive comparative evaluation is given, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and CNN-based methods on the challenging VIPeR, CUHK-01, and CAVIAR4REID datasets.

In particular, it investigates the area of unsupervised model updating in which a classification model is updated without using information about the changing distributions of the classes. ::: An adaptive framework that contains an ensemble of classifiers is developed. These can be mature or naive. In particular, only mature classifiers generate decisions, through majority voting, while naive classifiers are candidate to become mature. ::: The first novelty of the proposed framework is a technique of feedback that combines concepts from ensemble-learning with concepts from self-training. In particular, naive classifiers are trained using unlabelled data and labels generated by mature classifiers over that data, by means of voting. This technique allows updates of the model of the framework in absence of supervision, namely, without using the true classes of the data. The second novelty is a technique that infers the presence of concept drift by measuring the similarity between the decisions of mature classifiers and the decisions of naive classifiers. When concept drift is inferred, a naive classifier is selected to become mature, and a mature classifier is deleted. ::: A series of experiments are performed. They show that the framework can classify data with Gaussian distribution, and that this capability regards different classification techniques. The experiments also reveal that the framework cannot deal with the concept drift of a uniformly distributed dataset. Moreover, further experiments show that the inference of drift combines quick adapation with low false detections, thus leading to higher classification performance than comparative methods. However, this technique is not able to detect concept drift if the classes are separable.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1509956566", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53907264"}

These algorithms use the matchable observable linear identification parameterization that leads to an LTI predictor in a linear regression form, where the ouput prediction is a linear function of the unknown parameters. With a proper choice of the predictor parameters, the optimal prediction error estimator can be approximated. In a previous work, an LPV version of this method, that also used an LTI predictor, was proposed; this LTI predictor was in a linear regression form enablin, in this way, the model estimation to be handled by a Least-Squares Support Vector Machine approach, where the kernel functions had to be filtered by an LTI 2D-system with the predictor dynamics. As a result, it can never approximate an optimal LPV predictor which is essential for an optimal prediction error LPV estimator. In this work, both the unknown parameters and the state-matrix of the output predictor are described as a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions of the scheduling signal; the LPV predictor is derived and it is shown to be also in the regression form, allowing the unknown parameters to be estimated by a simple linear least squares method. Due to the LPV nature of the predictor, a proper choice of its parameters can lead to the formulation of an optimal prediction error LPV estimator.

Public opinions, as the response of Internet users to the information such as social events and government policies, reflect the status of both society and economics, which is highly valuable for the decision-making and public relations of enterprises. At present, the analysis methods for Internet public opinion are mainly based on discriminative approaches, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural network. However, when these approaches analyze the sentiment of Internet public opinion, they are failed to exploit information hidden in text, e.g. topic. Motivated by the above observation, this paper proposes a detection method for public sentiment based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model. PLSA inherits the advantages of LSA, exploiting the semantic topic hidden in data. The procedure of detecting the public sentiment using this algorithm is composed of three main steps: (1) Chinese word segmentation and word refinement, with which each document is represented by a bag of words; (2) modeling the probabilistic distribution of documents using PLSA; (3) using the Z-vector of PLSA as the features of documents and delivering it to SVM for sentiment detection. We collect a set of text data from Weibo, blog, BBS etc. to evaluate our proposed approach. The experimental results shows that the proposed method in this paper can detect the public sentiment with high accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches, i.e., word histogram based approach.

A lack of annotated data, due to time and costs for pathologist and their limited numbers, has become a difficulty. This limits the amount of annotated data and leads to a large number of unannotated data, preventing traditional deep learning algorithms from being effective.

Therefore, an attempt has been made to introduce and explore the potential of an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which deviates from iterative weight adjustment of neurons during the learning process and is extremely fast at classifying high resolution images. A detailed comparison of the ELM is made with back propagation ANN with better learning algorithms (Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)) in terms of accuracy, the time required for fine tuning different parameters, and generalisation capability. A high resolution QuickBird satellite image collected over an area of Warsaw, Poland was used for the analysis. Experimental results showed that the ELM produced classification accuracy comparable to that achieved with newer state-of-the-art ANN. The benefits of employing the ELM over conventional ANN are the need of determining only one user parameter, namely the number of neurons in the network, and the significantly lower computational costs.

Learning a useful feature representation from graph data lies at the heart and success of many machine learning tasks such as classification, anomaly detection, link prediction, among many others. Many existing techniques use random walks as a basis for learning features or estimating the parameters of a graph model for a downstream prediction task. Examples include recent node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, as well as graph-based deep learning algorithms. However, the simple random walk used by these methods is fundamentally tied to the identity of the node. This has three main disadvantages. First, these approaches are inherently transductive and do not generalize to unseen nodes and other graphs. Second, they are not space-efficient as a feature vector is learned for each node which is impractical for large graphs. Third, most of these approaches lack support for attributed graphs. ::: To make these methods more generally applicable, we propose a framework for inductive network representation learning based on the notion of attributed random walk that is not tied to node identity and is instead based on learning a function $\\Phi : \\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x} \\rightarrow w$ that maps a node attribute vector $\\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x}$ to a type $w$.

The AMPs are relatively easy to predict from a protein sequence because they usually include several long membrane-spanning hydrophobic \u03b1-helices. The OMBBs play important roles in cell biology, they are targeted by multiple drugs, and they are more challenging to identify as they have shorter membrane-spanning regions which lack a folding pattern, that is, as consistent as in the case of the AMPs. Hence, accurate in silico methods for prediction of OMBBs from their primary sequences are needed.

While the existing methods mostly focus on the network embedding of the entire network, there are also some situations, where people may only be interested in some nodes (i.e., partial nodes) rather than all nodes, especially in large-scale networks. Although there are some approaches dealing with the large-scale network, most of them require that all nodes are present during the optimization procedure. The necessity to generate the embedding results for redundant non-interested nodes makes these methods quite inefficient. In this paper, we present a novel node representation framework termed partial nodes representation learning (PartNRL), which is capable of preserving the local similarity of the interested node pairs and generating the embedding results efficiently. Two phases are carefully designed in PartNRL. The first phase is to use local random walk to capture the t -step local similarity for memory-efficiency. By modeling the inherent properties of nodes through the first phase, we design the second phase to learn the node representations by maximizing a likelihood function based on the skip-gram model. To make the optimization procedure more efficient, the negative sampling strategy is applied. The extensive experiments have been conducted on three tasks: node clustering task, single-labeled classification task, and multi-labeled classification task.

In a previous work, a SAD system, which used Linear Discriminant Analysis-extracted features and a Decision Tree classifier, was successfully contrasted with other previously reported techniques in a set of room environment tests with the SPEECON database. In this work, the same SAD system has been tested in even more realistic conditions involving meetings, and it has been modified to significantly improve its performance. Actually, we have trained the SAD system with a subset of SPEECON data, and without any further tuning we have used it to carry out tests with the meeting databases from the NIST RT05 evaluation. In order to improve the SAD performance, we consider two additional features which are measures of energy dynamics at low and high frequencies, respectively.

In particular, SVMs offer several advantages over artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have attracted the attention of the speech processing community. Nevertheless, their high computational requirements prevent them from being used in practice in automatic speech recognition (ASR), where ANNs have proven to be successful. The high complexity of SVMs in this context arises from the use of huge speech training databases with millions of samples and highly overlapped classes. This paper suggests the use of a weighted least squares (WLS) training procedure that facilitates the possibility of imposing a compact semiparametric model on the SVM, which results in a dramatic complexity reduction. Such a complexity reduction with respect to conventional SVMs, which is between two and three orders of magnitude, allows the proposed hybrid WLS-SVC/HMM system to perform real-time speech decoding on a connected-digit recognition task (SpeechDat Spanish database).

Despite their popularity, few works have tried to exploit contextual and structural information in random forests in order to improve their performance. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to integrate contextual information in random forests, which is typically reflected in the structured output space of complex problems like semantic image labelling. Our paper has several contributions: We show how random forests can be augmented with structured label information and be used to deliver structured low-level predictions. The learning task is carried out by employing a novel split function evaluation criterion that exploits the joint distribution observed in the structured label space. This allows the forest to learn typical label transitions between object classes and avoid locally implausible label configurations. We provide two approaches for integrating the structured output predictions obtained at a local level from the forest into a concise, global, semantic labelling. We integrate our new ideas also in the Hough-forest framework with the view of exploiting contextual information at the classification level to improve the performance on the task of object detection.

In contrast to say expression analysis, age determination is dependent on a number of factors. To construe the real age of a person is an esoteric task. The changes that appear on a face are not only due to aging, but also a number of factors like stress, appropriate rest etc. In this paper an approach has been developed to determine true age of a person by making use of some existing algorithms and combining them for maximum efficiency. The image is represented using an Active Appearance Model (AAM). The AAM uses geometrical ratio of the local face features along with wrinkle analysis. Next, to enhance the feature selection, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is done. For the learning process a Support Vector Machine is used. Relationships in the image are obtained by making use of binarized statistical image features (BSIF) and the patterns are stored in Local Binary Pattern Histograms (LBPH). This histogram acts as input for the learning unit. The SVM is made to learn the patterns by studying the LBPH. Finally after the learning phase, when a new image is taken, a Least Square-Support Vector Machine Regression model (LS-SVM) is used to predict the final age of the person in the image.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-50832-0_36", "venue": "ISVC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2560377170", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["189999027", "207835871", "59553454", "203646692", "53948845"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27841446"}

Vision loss can be prevented, if these diseases are detected at an early stage. Structural abnormalities such as changes in cup-to-disc ratio, Hard Exudates (HE), drusen, Microaneurysms (MA), Cotton Wool Spots (CWS), Haemorrhages (HA), Geographic Atrophy (GA) and Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) in PSED can be identified by manual examination of fundus images by clinicians. However, manual screening is labour-intensive, tiresome and time consuming. Hence, there is a need to automate the eye screening. In this work Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) technique is used to decompose fundus images into 2D Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) to capture variations in the pixels due to morphological changes. Further, various entropy namely Renyi, Fuzzy, Shannon, Vajda, Kapur and Yager and energy features are extracted from IMFs. These extracted features are ranked using Chernoff Bound and Bhattacharyya Distance (CBBD), Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), Fuzzy-minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (FmRMR), Wilcoxon, Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC) and t-test methods. Further, these ranked features are fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify normal and abnormal (DR, AMD and glaucoma) classes. The performance of the proposed eye screening system is evaluated using 800 (Normal=400 and Abnormal=400) digital fundus images and 10-fold cross validation method. Our proposed system automatically identifies normal and abnormal classes with an average accuracy of 88.63%, sensitivity of 86.25% and specificity of 91% using 17 optimal features ranked using CBBD and SVM-Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifier. Moreover, a novel Retinal Risk Index (RRI) is developed using two significant features to distinguish two classes using single number. Such a system helps to reduce eye screening time in polyclinics or community-based mass screening. They will refer the patients to main hospitals only if the diagnosis belong to the abnormal class. Hence, the main hospitals will not be unnecessarily crowded and doctors can devote their time for other urgent cases.

Thanks to the wide use of the open sourced XGBoost library, GBDTs have become very popular in recent years and won many awards in machine learning and data mining competitions. Although GPUs have demonstrated their success in accelerating many machine learning applications, there are a series of key challenges of developing a GPU-based GBDT algorithm, including irregular memory accesses, many small sorting operations and varying data parallel granularities in tree construction.

However, the application of machine learning and probabilistic methods for activity recognition problems has been studied only in the past couple of years. For the first time, this thesis explores the application of semi-supervised and active learning in activity recognition. We present a new and efficient semi-supervised training method for parameter estimation and feature selection in conditional random fields (CRFs), a probabilistic graphical model. In real-world applications such as activity recognition, unlabeled sensor traces are relatively easy to obtain whereas labeled examples are expensive and tedious to collect. Furthermore, the ability to automatically select a small subset of discriminatory features from a large pool can be advantageous in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy. We introduce the semi-supervised virtual evidence boosting (sVEB) algorithm for training CRFs \u2013 a semi-supervised extension to the recently developed virtual evidence boosting (VEB) method for feature selection and parameter learning. sVEB takes advantage of the unlabeled data via minimum entropy regularization. The objective function combines the unlabeled conditional entropy with labeled conditional pseudo-likelihood. The sVEB algorithm reduces the overall system cost as well as the human labeling cost required during training, which are both important considerations in building real world inference systems. Moreover, we propose an active learning algorithm for training CRFs is based on virtual evidence boosting and uses entropy measures. Active virtual evidence boosting (aVEB) queries the user for most informative examples, efficiently builds up labeled training examples and incorporates unlabeled data as in sVEB. aVEB not only reduces computational complexity of training CRFs as in sVEB, but also outputs more accurate classification results for the same fraction of labeled data. In a set of experiments we illustrate that our algorithms, sVEB and aVEB, benefit from both the use of unlabeled data and automatic feature selection, and outperform other semi-supervised and active training approaches.

To address this problem, a novel approach is presented in this paper. The view sphere is separated into several small segments. On each segment, a face detector is constructed. We explicitly estimate the pose of an image regardless of whether or not it is a face. A pose estimator is constructed using Support Vector Regression. The pose information is used to choose the appropriate face detector to determine if it is a face. With this pose-estimation based method, considerable computational efficiency is achieved. Meanwhile, the detection accuracy is also improved since each detector is constructed on a small range of views. We developed a novel algorithm for face detection by combining the Eigenface and SVM methods which performs almost as fast as the Eigenface method but with a significant improved speed. Detailed experimental results are presented in this paper including tuning the parameters of the pose estimators and face detectors, performance evaluation, and applications to video based face detection and frontal-view face recognition. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, this work aimed at analyzing models\u2019 performance when predicting soil types at subgroup taxonomic level via pXRF and Vis-NIR separately and together. 315 soil samples were collected in both A and B horizons in three important Brazilian states. Samples undergone laboratorial analyses for soil classification and were submitted to pXRF and Vis-NIR (350\u20132500 nm) analyses. Vis-NIR spectral data preprocessing was evaluated utilizing Savitzky-Golay (WT) and Savitzky-Golay with Binning (WB) methods. Four classification algorithms were employed in modeling: Support Vector Machine with Linear (SVM-L) and Radial (SVM-R) kernel, C5.0, and Random Forest (RF). Predictions were made using only B horizon and using A + B horizon data. Overall accuracy and Cohen\u2019s Kappa index evaluated model quality. Both sensors displayed efficacy in soil types prediction. A + B horizons data combined using pXRF + Vis-NIR via SVM-R (WT and WB) delivered accurate predictions (89.32% overall accuracy and 0.75 Kappa index), but the best predictions were achieved using only B horizon data via pXRF with RF, pXRF + Vis-NIR (WT) with RF, pXRF + Vis-NIR (WB) with C5.0, and pXRF + Vis-NIR (WB) with RF (89.23% overall accuracy and 0.80 Kappa index).

In this paper, we propose a system that is capable of using a supervised learning model to predict the status of patients when they get discharged from the hospital. For example, given a medical dataset, we would like to build a model that is capable of predicting with a high accuracy the likelihood that a newly admitted patient could be at risk of death or hospital readmission.

Among deep learning-based action recognition methods, one of the most commonly used structures is a two-stream network. This type of network extracts high-level spatial and temporal features from skeleton coordinates and optical flows, respectively. However, other features, such as the structure of the skeleton or the relations of specific joint pairs, are sometimes ignored, even though using these features can also improve action recognition performance. To robustly learn more low-level skeleton features, this paper introduces an efficient fully convolutional network to process multiple input features. The network has multiple streams, each of which has the same encoder-decoder structure. A temporal convolutional network and a co-occurrence convolutional network encode the local and global features, and a convolutional classifier decodes high-level features to classify the action. Moreover, a novel fusion strategy is proposed to combine independent feature learning and dependent feature relating. Detailed ablation studies are performed to confirm the network\u2019s robustness to all feature inputs.

Hence this work focuses on a hybrid computational intelligence technique for the analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to detect epileptic seizure by taking the EEG scalp data of ten patients from an open source (CHB-MIT) and converting these collected data into signal for the accurate seizure detection. Thereafter four spectral features i.e energy, entropy, mean and standard deviation have been extracted from the EEG signal by an efficient feature extraction method such as Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) followed by Genetic Algorithm (GA) based feature selection technique to remove redundant features for more estimable accuracy. Later on, the selected features are grouped into training and test data sets. Finally, these selected sets are classified by a robust classifier namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the accurate detection of epileptic seizure.

Classifying hyperspectral remote sensing data from urban environments is challenging due to spectrally heterogeneous materials with similar spectral properties. There is a lack of studies on the use of hyperspectral technology in urban mapping in Malaysia although it has widely been used in other countries. The selection of mapping techniques in classification which is the selection of data transformation and classifier selections are very essential to acquire maximum mapping accuracy. This research was conducted to study the effects of data transformation and classifier selections in urban feature discrimination using ::: hyperspectral imagery. Two techniques of data transformation are tested in this study which are the spectral derivative and wavelet transformations. Various wavelet parameters which are the selection of wavelet transformation techniques, mother wavelets, number of vanishing moments and scale or level decompositions have been tested in this study. The selection of classifiers such as Minimum Distance to Mean, Spectral Angle Mapper and Support Vector Machine are also tested in this study. The performance of each parameter tested in this study is assessed through their classification accuracy. McNemar statistical test is used to test the significance difference between two classification results. Three hyperspectral images from two different sensors are tested in this study which are two images came from AisaEAGLE sensor while the other image acquired by AISA CLASSIC sensor. The results show that each transformation parameter and classifier selected gave different results. The classification accuracy derived from derivative transformation is lower than the classification accuracy of reflectance. The right selection of wavelet ::: transformation parameters can give maximum classification accuracy. There is no best wavelet transformation parameters can be determined since the best wavelet transformation parameters of all images are different. Classification using Support Vector Machine gave better accuracy than other classifiers for all images and more robust as it is not affected by the types of data used. The results clearly show the advantages of the Support Vector Machine and wavelet-based data in terms of accuracy. They significantly outperform the other method and achieve overall higher accuracies. Thus, both methods can be considered attractive and useful for the classification of urban hyperspectral data. Wavelet based images of rbio2.2 (Scale-8CWT) of first data set and bior2.8 (Scale-16 CWT) of second data set, and reflectance image of third data set gave highest classification accuracies using SVM classifier which are 96%, 98.4% and 98.4%.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "43372676", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115295598"}

However, in existing approaches, the events in EHRs are treated as separate variables which are indiscriminately entered into the model, without taking into account the meaning and grouping of them. Besides, the efficacy of treatment is often neglected. In this paper, we first embed the efficacy information into the disease diagnosis, and then propose Grouped Correlational GAN (GcGAN) to explicitly learn inherent correlations between different groups of variables. We also introduce a dense connection to strengthen the generator capacity in GcGAN. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the generated data from GcGAN are able to simulate real-world data in terms of distribution statistics. The results on multi-label treatment recommendation tasks show that GcGAN can boost the performances by augmenting the training dataset with the generated data and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Elements of this structure include the root (that could also be composite), prefixes and suffixes with which various nuances and relations to other words can be expressed. Thus, in order to build a proper word representation one must take into account its internal structure. From a corpus of texts we extract a set of frequent subwords and from the latter set we select patterns, i.e. subwords which encapsulate information on character n-gram regularities. The selection is made using the pattern-based Conditional Random Field model [19, 23] with \\(l_1\\) regularization. Further, for every word we construct a new sequence over an alphabet of patterns. The new alphabet\u2019s symbols confine a local statistical context stronger than the characters, therefore they allow better representations in \\({\\mathbb {R}}^n\\) and are better building blocks for word representation. In the task of subword-aware language modeling, pattern-based models outperform character-based analogues by 2\u201320 perplexity points.

This dissertation involves the design of a multiple frequency continuous wave (MFCW) radar for micro-Doppler research and detection and classification algorithm design. ::: First, sensor hardware is developed and tested. Various design tradeoffs are considered, with the application of micro-Doppler based detection and classification in mind. A diverse database of MFCW radar micro-Doppler signatures was collected for this dissertation. The micro-Doppler signature database includes experimental data from human, vehicle, and animal targets. Signatures are acquired from targets with varying ranges, velocities, approach angles, and postures. The database is analyzed for micro-Doppler content with a focus on its application to target classification. ::: Joint time-frequency detection algorithms are developed to improve detection performance by exploiting noise-spreading and the micro-Doppler phenomenon. Following detection algorithm development, this dissertation covers the design of micro-Doppler feature extraction, feature selection, and classification algorithms. Feature selection is performed automatically via a Fisher score initialized sequential backward selection algorithm. Classification is performed using two distinct approaches: a generative statistical classification algorithm based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and a discriminative statistical classification algorithm based on support vector machines (SVMs). ::: Classifier performance is analyzed in detail on a micro-Doppler signature database acquired over a three-year period. Both the SVM and GMM classifiers perform well on the radar target classification task (high accuracy, low nuisance alarm probability, high F-measure, etc.). The performance of both classifiers is remarkably similar, and neither algorithm dominates the other in any performance metric when using the chosen feature set. (However, the difference between SVM and GMM classification accuracy becomes statistically significant when many redundant features are present in the feature set.) The accuracy of both classifiers is shown to vary as a function of approach angle, which physically corresponds to the angular dependence of micro-Doppler. The results suggest that overall classifier performance is more sensitive to feature selection than classifier selection (with GMM being more sensitive to redundant features than SVM). Both classifiers are robust enough to handle human targets attempting to evade detection by either army crawling or hands-and-knees crawling.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1513113215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109436558"}

To cut down the cost, surrogate models, also known as metamodels, are constructed and then used in place of the actual simulation models. In this study, structural damage detection is performed using two approaches. In both cases ten popular metamodeling techniques including Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN), Least Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs), Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural network (RBFN), Large Margin Nearest Neighbors (LMNN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Gaussian Process (GP), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forests and Kriging are used and the comparative results are presented. In the first approach, by considering dynamic behavior of a structure as input variables, ten metamodels are constructed, trained and tested to detect the location and severity of damage in civil structures. The variation of running time, mean square error (MSE), number of training and testing data, and other indices for measuring the accuracy in the prediction are defined and calculated in order to inspect advantages as well as the shortcomings of each algorithm. The results indicate that Kriging and LS-SVM models have better performance in predicting the location/severity of damage compared with other methods. In the second approach, after locating precisely the eventual damage of a structure using modal strain energy based index (MSEBI), to efficiently reduce the computational cost of model updating during the optimization process of damage severity detection, the MSEBI of structural elements is evaluated using a properly trained surrogate model. The results indicate that after determining the damage location, the proposed solution method for damage severity detection leads to significant reduction of computational time compared to finite element method.

In order to use track geometry inspection data, having accurate and reliable position information is a prerequisite. Due to various issues identified in this research, the positions of different track geometry inspections need to be aligned and synchronized to the same location before being used for track degradation modeling and maintenance planning. This is referred to as \u201cposition synchronization\u201d, a long-standing important research problem in the area of track data analytics. With the aim of advancing the state of the art in research on this subject, we propose a novel approach to more accurately and expediently synchronize track geometry inspection positions via big-data fusion and incremental learning algorithms. Distinguishing it from other relevant studies in the literature, our proposed approach can simultaneously address data exceptions, channel offsets and local position offsets between any two inspections. To solve the Position Synchronization Model (PS-Model), an Incremental Learning Algorithm (IL-Algorithm) is developed to handle the \u201clack of memory\u201d challenge for the fast computation of massive data. A case study is developed based on a dataset with data size of 18 GB, including 58 inspections between February 2014 and July 2016 over 323 km (200 miles) of tracks belonging to China High Speed Railways. The results show that our proposed model performs robustly against data exceptions via the use of multi-channel information fusion. Also, the position synchronization error using our proposed approach is within 0.15 meters (0.5 feet). Our proposed data-driven, incremental learning algorithm can quickly solve the complex, data-extensive, position synchronization problem, using an average of 0.1 s for processing one additional kilometer of track.

Recent approaches address this challenge by learning performance models based on a sample set of configurations. However, collecting enough sample configurations can be very expensive since each such sample requires configuring, compiling, and executing the entire system using a complex test suite. When learning on new data is too expensive, it is possible to use \\textit{Transfer Learning} to\"transfer\"old lessons to the new context. Traditional transfer learning has a number of challenges, specifically, (a) learning from excessive data takes excessive time, and (b) the performance of the models built via transfer can deteriorate as a result of learning from a poor source. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel transfer learning framework called BEETLE, which is a\"bellwether\"-based transfer learner that focuses on identifying and learning from the most relevant source from amongst the old data. This paper evaluates BEETLE with 57 different software configuration problems based on five software systems (a video encoder, an SAT solver, a SQL database, a high-performance C-compiler, and a streaming data analytics tool). In each of these cases, BEETLE found configurations that are as good as or better than those found by other state-of-the-art transfer learners while requiring only a fraction ($\\frac{1}{7}$th) of the measurements needed by those other methods. Based on these results, we say that BEETLE is a new high-water mark in optimally configuring software.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.01817", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/tse.2020.2983927", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2983089019,3014979526", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13945218", "8635810", "16059634", "6817584", "3113891", "1388079", "5738823", "23879882", "49300204", "196178337", "3935388", "2977459", "5740922", "11067362", "15287603", "10482384", "13074764", "31052633", "24324165", "740063", "6126098", "20524606", "43112561", "207247842", "5844313", "14770655", "784510", "2443795", "3282867", "3113891", "5194351", "2296300", "15019466", "16072686", "5818634", "67869537", "16616897", "64639083", "16253010", "120137017", "59747577", "13559191", "14462525", "14223436", "12257712", "10806430", "3686513", "21928578", "5613212", "6089057", "29192939", "1119864", "2472445", "2230060", "1738167", "3975213", "4949076", "1952960", "3975213", "699198", "12220995", "44621520", "19971112", "362467", "556999", "13967968", "597779", "740063"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207780498"}

However, recognizing human activities using smartphones remains a challenging task and requires efficient data mining approaches due to the limited resources of the device. For example, the training process is usually performed offline but rarely online on the mobile device itself, because traditional batch learning usually needs a large dataset of many users. Therefore, building models using complex multiclass algorithms is generally very time-consuming. In this paper, we present a comparison study using two approaches in order to reduce training time and memory usage while maintaining significant performance. In the first approach, we conducted experiments using batch learning on a GPU platform. Results showed that High Performance Extreme Learning Machine (HPELM) offers the best compromise: accuracy, memory usage and training time. Moreover, it achieved better performance on two dynamic activities, outperforming the best SVM model obtained in our previous study. In the second approach, we conducted experiments using online stream learning on the MOA platform. Unlike the first approach, experiments were performed using accelerometer data only. We also studied the effects of user/device dependency and feature engineering on the classification performance and memory usage by comparing five constructed real data streams.

In this paper, we propose the Empirical Co-occurrence Rate Networks (ECRNs) for sequence labeling. ECRNs are discriminative models, so ECRNs overcome the problems of HMMs. ECRNs are also immune to the label bias problem even though they are locally normalized. To make the estimation of ECRNs as fast as possible, we simply use the empirical distributions as the estimation of parameters. Experiments on two real-world NLP tasks show that ECRNs reduce the training time radically while obtain competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art models.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2013.23", "venue": "2013 12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journal": "2013 12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2088692044", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52867179", "1282113", "9389968", "38548504", "337131", "14835360", "11986411", "13618539", "5914287", "775373", "277918", "26736998", "6931178", "59901908", "342976", "8559332", "1549479", "1978101", "122608613", "47390681", "10790700", "13017157", "7449734", "10790700", "59921147", "58714863", "564746", "201720", "2765456"], "inbound_citations": ["12464954", "8211418"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5974948"}

Principal Component Analysis is employed as the supplement in feature dimensional reduction state, prior to training and testing speech samples via Maximum Likelihood Classifier (ML) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Keywords\u2014Speech Signal, MFCC, SVM, ML I. INTRODUCTION PEECH recognition is the process of automatically recognizing the spoken words of person based on information in speech signal. Recognition technique makes it possible to the speaker's voice to be used in verifying their identity and control access to services such as voice dialing, banking by telephone, telephone shopping, database access services, information service, voice mail, security control for the confidential information areas, and remote access to computers. The acoustical parameters of spoken signal used in recognition tasks have been popularly studied and investigated, and being able to be categorized into two types of processing domain: First group is spectral based parameters and another is dynamic time series. The most popular spectral based parameter used in recognition approach is the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients called MFCC (2,3). Due to its advantage of less complexity in implementation of feature extraction algorithm, only sixteen coefficients of MFCC corresponding to the Mel scale frequencies of speech Cepstrum are extracted from spoken word samples in database. All extracted MFCC samples are then statistically analyzed for principal components, at least two dimensions minimally required in further recognition performance evaluation.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2312101546", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2552444", "11448629", "13043277", "122308290", "2584811", "52874011"], "inbound_citations": ["17731613", "204822921", "207930315", "17466260", "12433702", "14290224", "201811368", "2419970", "33892873", "9453817", "53365031", "13756998", "209696072", "204862063", "202771430", "145830807", "10604653", "41142693", "40443031", "195697396", "16564704", "6113351", "16602985", "1270486", "18659403", "53787164", "36918164", "212704308", "208317715", "202719737", "58015538", "5780906", "14416067", "56455790", "155766712", "18760126", "19334247", "5792113", "201847334", "212648327", "4595761", "1565062", "18254807"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5979747"}

The domain of the developing NLU system covers from sentence decoding to text understanding and the automatic decoding of GP sentence belongs to the domain of NLU system. GP sentence is a special linguistic phenomenon in which processing breakdown and backtracking are two key features. If the syntax-based system can present the special features of GP sentence and decode GP sentence completely and perfectly, NLU system can improve the effectiveness and develop the understanding skill greatly. On the one hand, by means of showing Octav Popescu's model of NLU system, we argue that the emphasis on the integration of syntactic, semantic and cognitive backgrounds in system is necessary. On the other hand, we focus on the programming skill of IF-THEN-ELSE statement used in N-S flowchart and highlight the function of context free grammar (CFG) created to decode GP sentence. On the basis of example-based analysis, we reach the conclusion that syntax- based machine comprehension is technically feasible and semantically acceptable, and that N-S flowchart and CFG can help NLU system present the decoding procedure of GP sentence successfully.

Mass preserving splines were fitted to legacy SOC and bulk density (BD) pedon data based on GlobalSoilmap soil depths. SOC concentrations (g kg \u22121 ) were predicted using Random Forest model (RFM), Cubist and Boosted regression tree (BRT). Thereafter, the soil carbon density (Mg C ha \u2212 1 ) was calculated from the SOC concentration and BD (Mg m \u2212 3 ). The information was combined with land use/land cover (LULC) map and agro-ecological zone (AEZ) digital maps to estimate SOC sequestration. The mean SOC concentration ranged between 4.2 and 23.7 g kg \u2212 1 in the top 30 cm and between 2.6 and 9.2 g kg \u2212 1 at the lower soil depth. Total SOC stock in the top 1 m was 6.5 Pg with an average density of 71.60 Mg C ha \u2212 1 . Almost half of the SOC stock was found in the 0\u201330 cm layer. SOC stocks decreased from the southwest to the northeast of Nigeria, and increased from Sahel to Humid forest agro-ecological zones. Restoration of the various land use types has the potential to sequester about 0.2 to 30.8 Mg C ha \u2212 1 depending on the AEZ.

Finally, we provide some open problems and future challenges, particularly from the clinical domain, that we expect to stimulate future research.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-662-43968-5_16", "venue": "Interactive Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in Biomedical Informatics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2159709123", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1836783", "60290655", "32381228", "59616425", "14216734", "7610269", "140109802", "195586934", "13856869", "15660099", "15618342", "6473756", "25731683", "2427083", "60910424", "1965284", "15094383", "62575552", "1144461", "62729021", "4576162", "31406632", "62137831", "8048194", "32098300", "61894598", "14925035", "53303687", "7605995", "18579506", "10091130", "14894276", "42615137", "60981168", "18689435", "25994933", "15413323", "3177797", "5629537", "12167445", "400973", "1143723", "34881994", "6025908", "1290272", "88511796", "1909938", "2562333", "118502441", "9695995", "5914140", "144828484", "125037489", "8127858", "13967571", "42905772", "7831590", "206787478", "3705154", "10151608", "61649919", "6328759", "6534012", "12469104", "9589564", "14910898", "77139", "5262555", "8589534", "12360287", "11522524", "10793792", "2271082", "6945503", "1365754", "22425932", "15493987", "8977393", "1736466", "1603280", "8053070", "40160393", "6773023", "9262964", "8252126", "8099087", "10526385", "6354308", "18647938", "17857885", "17782846", "10932903", "10310299", "12969923", "15902587", "11216567", "6082305", "609950", "18189334", "16940982", "33083000", "1008946", "2016685", "5906333", "2171994", "45223718", "39461100"], "inbound_citations": ["39876559", "20127528", "1439684", "15832444", "749010", "215119962", "214883525", "15635651", "215021422", "9119161", "12527921", "609950", "882974", "210832128", "64884241", "29641249", "16868288", "4649427", "214975210", "24182222", "52067805", "12216988", "25567027"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12786118"}

Successful navigation needs predicting of intention of other traffic participants at the intersection. Such prediction is an important component for both Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) Systems. In this paper, we present a driver intention prediction model for general intersections. Our model incorporates lane-level maps of an intersection and makes a prediction based on past position and movement of the vehicle. We create a real-world dataset of 375 turning tracks at a variety of intersections. We present turn prediction results based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). SVM and DBN models give higher accuracy compared to HMM models. We get over 90% turn prediction accuracy 1.6 seconds before the intersection.

Given that an analytical solution is often not feasible because of un-scalability and because the background knowledge may be too complicated to determine, we propose an approach based on machine learning, inspired by the GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) paradigm. The idea is to set up two nets: the generator, that tries to produce an optimal obfuscation mechanism to protect the data, and the classifier, that tries to de-obfuscate the data. By letting the two nets compete against each other, the mechanism improves its degree of protection, until an equilibrium is reached. We apply our method to the case of location privacy, and we perform experiments on synthetic data and on real data from the Gowalla dataset. We evaluate the privacy of the mechanism not only by its capacity to defeat the classificator, but also in terms of the Bayes error, which represents the strongest possible adversary.

One approach is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns a mapping between variable-length input and output sequences in one step using a purely data-driven method. The attention model has often been shown to improve the performance over another end-to-end approach, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), mainly because it explicitly uses the history of the target character without any conditional independence assumptions. However, we observed that the performance of the attention has shown poor results in noisy condition and is hard to learn in the initial training stage with long input sequences. This is because the attention model is too flexible to predict proper alignments in such cases due to the lack of left-to-right constraints as used in CTC. This paper presents a novel method for end-to-end speech recognition to improve robustness and achieve fast convergence by using a joint CTC-attention model within the multi-task learning framework, thereby mitigating the alignment issue. An experiment on the WSJ and CHiME-4 tasks demonstrates its advantages over both the CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder baselines, showing 5.4\u201314.6% relative improvements in Character Error Rate (CER).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1609.06773", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953075", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2526425061,2952470929", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1166498", "206514100", "453615", "1921173", "14177763", "1054182", "28854814", "9530137", "9901844", "11212020", "34466505", "1915014", "3338763", "7365802", "14650762", "7961699", "40821847"], "inbound_citations": ["204762991", "61808975", "522164", "51997624", "11686878", "214714409", "61807503", "158046633", "211132778", "3264579", "203173771", "208526920", "53110828", "21657328", "52287921", "44088679", "209672447", "85562057", "198179632", "139105396", "52191558", "202736731", "201670774", "53719646", "52191029", "46832296", "204963057", "53620543", "28162171", "201847408", "59158774", "208910268", "10794266", "203605948", "128358609", "53219757", "202708931", "53108333", "195069070", "119182040", "53300658", "211297467", "118718747", "49310616", "52291521", "209386736", "28347739", "202750925", "54440079", "129945352", "162168707", "196181140", "49904308", "49298369", "52146277", "172130340", "211204802", "20618558", "195346053", "204960988", "211243887", "209515342", "210871884", "204907214", "13698582", "52909749", "207870284", "208053780", "204823747", "160032741", "209458553", "202706950", "59356170", "210165977", "13747638", "102353552", "76665028", "202709716", "204907222", "53278056", "53243343", "181790631", "204575685", "13073881", "19423475", "52188328", "215428936", "57189410", "50783772", "52192283", "195848036", "7133552", "201667597", "202714206", "166228043", "57376347", "202784940", "52291664", "209516191", "139102249", "52901144", "210166059", "54574138", "215238573", "2133607", "4405911", "212747696", "145988813", "207853196", "211068692", "195345582", "53250201", "61811678", "53093485", "59600206", "22341905", "202895612", "96447004", "202578082", "53963748", "3351788", "212649384", "52283417", "201269007", "195699400", "52190576", "53211033", "209405385", "4892333", "53568836", "131773802", "201131946", "10006724", "3699548", "208857701", "2711142", "14796367", "204826204", "49866660", "54034784", "40083640", "208202287", "202722552", "35327623", "12002329", "86681848", "202888764", "146098760", "211020929", "198897538", "204788690", "21673427", "212644801", "8048373", "49744505", "169034874", "4844799", "2855522", "61810678", "59554452", "214624257", "202734954", "53288567", "53246129", "145856164", "13664502", "3923407", "49219040", "462024", "53669807", "59336132", "211075834", "195775702", "209444482", "207810836", "202736833", "209832454", "54008003", "33957080", "204838317", "145863130", "53227873", "211207577", "51934732", "202890641", "6632535", "199577606", "210970951", "212648457", "212648722", "208211832", "24376954", "146086263", "204231599", "51703166", "202717400", "214714370", "59606277", "202893473", "53618759", "81985132"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206742834"}

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the cloud computing customers\u2019 opinions, feedbacks, attitudes, and emotions towards cloud computing services using sentiment analysis. The associated aim, is to help people and organizations to understand the benefits and challenges of cloud services from the general public\u2019s perspective view as well as opinions about existing cloud providers, focusing on three main cloud providers: Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. The methodology used in this paper is based on sentiment analysis applied to the tweets that were extracted from social media platform (Twitter) via its search API. We have extracted a sample of 11,000 tweets and each cloud provider has almost similar proportion of the tweets based on relevant hashtags and keywords. Analysis starts by combining the tweets in order to find the overall polarity about cloud computing, then breaking the tweets to find the specific polarity for each cloud provider.

The goal of this work is to develop a robust algorithm to add Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capabilities to extract efficient feature vectors and ensure a comprehensive recognition process. In the first part on this paper, we used a database of ISAR images reconstructed from anechoic chamber simulations in order to extract efficient feature vectors. In the second part of this work, we proposed a recognition architecture to perform recognition tasks and provide a human operator with useful information for target recognition tasks. Several kinds of descriptor can be used to acquire information about target characteristics from radar signals and images. Indeed, a number of methods are currently used in automatic target recognition; notably based on ISAR imaging. However, target characteristic extraction from radar echoes remains a difficult task, and the methods are generally specific to either aircraft or ship recognition. In this work, we describe our approach to designing faster, more effective retrieval systems and a comprehensive architecture. Our approach uses global feature vectors for both ship and aircraft recognition. Firstly, the global feature vectors are described by two types of descriptor which have shown to be efficient in radar target recognition. The first type defines target shape obtained by watershed transformation, facilitating interpretation for the human operator. The second type of vector descriptor is based on so-called polar signatures, obtained using the polar mapping procedure. The latter are highly discriminative and thus significantly improve and facilitate target recognition, leading to greater precision and accuracy. Secondly, we describe the retrieval architecture suitable for the second type of vector descriptor, which checks invariance in relation to target rotation and scale. It is, in itself, more efficient and processing time at the retrieval step is reduced and controlled by the human operator.

In this paper, we propose a novel method-- unsupervised ensemble learning via Ising model approximation (unElisa) that combines a pruning step with a predicting step. We focus on the binary case and use an Ising model to characterize interactions between the ensemble and the underlying true classifier. The presence of an edge between an observed classifier and the true classifier indicates a direct dependence whereas the absence indicates the corresponding one provides no additional information and shall be eliminated. This observation leads to the pruning step where the key is to recover the neighborhood of the true classifier. We show that it can be recovered successfully with exponentially decaying error in the high-dimensional setting by performing nodewise $\\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression. The pruned ensemble allows us to get a consistent estimate of the Bayes classifier for predicting.

Sampling of HUs in these regions revealed significant differences between all regions (p<0.001 for all comparisons), confirming the intrinsic differences in the radiomic signatures between these regions. To generate a large training dataset, paired axial slices from the training set (n=13) were augmented to produce a total of 23,551 2-D images. We trained a 2-D Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (cycleGAN) for this non-contrast to contrast (NC2C) transformation task. The accuracy of the cycleGAN output was assessed by comparison to the contrast image. This pipeline is able to differentiate between visually incoherent soft tissue regions in non-contrast CT images. The CTAs generated from the non-contrast images bear strong resemblance to the ground truth. Here we describe a novel application of Generative Adversarial Network for CT image processing.

Also in plants the nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of proteins emerges as an important regulation mechanism for many plant-specific processes. ::: One requirement for a protein to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm lies in its nuclear export activity. The widely used mechanism for export of proteins from the nucleus involves the receptor Exportin 1 and the presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) in the cargo protein. Given the big amount of sequence data available nowadays the possibility to use a computational tool to predict the proteins potentially containing an NES would help to facilitate the screening and experimental characterization of NES-containing proteins. However, the computational prediction of NESs is a challenging task. Currently there is only one NES prediction tool and that is unfortunately not accurate for predicting these signals in proteins of plants. In that direction, this study aimed mainly at developing a prediction method for identifying NESs in proteins from Arabidopsis and to validate its usefulness experimentally. It included also the definition of the influence of the NES protein context in the nuclear export activity of specific proteins of Arabidopsis. ::: Three machine-learning algorithms (i.e. k-NN, SVM and Random Forests) were trained with experimentally validated NES sequences from proteins of Arabidopsis and other organisms. Two kinds of features were included, the sequence of the NESs expressed as the score obtained from an HMM profile constructed with the NES sequences of proteins from Arabidopsis, and physicochemical properties of the amino acid residues expressed as amino acid index values. The Random Forest classifier was selected among the three classifiers after evaluation of the performance by different methods. It showed to be highly accurate (accuracy values over 85 percent, classification error around 10 percent, MCC around 0.7 and area under the ROC curve around 0.90) and performed better than the other two trained classifiers. ::: Using the Random Forest classifier around 5000 proteins from the total of protein sequences from Arabidopsis were predicted as containing NESs. A group of these proteins was selected by using Gene Ontologies (GO) and from this last group, 13 proteins were experimentally tested for nuclear export activity. 11 out of those 13 proteins showed positive interaction with the receptor Exportin 1 (XPO1a) from Arabidopsis in yeast two-hybrid assays. The proteins showing nuclear export activity include 9 transcription factors and 2 DNA metabolism-related proteins. Furthermore, it was established that the amino acid residues located between the hydrophobic residues in the NES as well as the protein structure of the regions around the NES could modify the nuclear export activity of some proteins. ::: In conclusion, this work presents a new prediction tool for NESs in proteins of Arabidopsis based on a Random Forest classifier. The experimental validation of the nuclear export activity in a selected group of proteins is an indicative of the usefulness of the tool. From the biological point of view, the nuclear export activity observed in those proteins strongly suggest that nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning could be involved in the regulation of their functions. For the follow up research the further characterization of the proteins showing positive nuclear export activity as well as the validation of additional predicted NES-containing proteins is envisioned. In the near future, the developed tool is going to be available as a web application to facilitate and promote its further usage.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1812720483", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:83683438"}

Data-based bearing fault diagnosis has become a research hotspot. Naive Bayes (NB), which is based on independent presumption, is widely used in fault diagnosis. However, the bearing data are not completely independent, which reduces the performance of NB algorithms. In order to solve this problem, we propose a NB bearing fault diagnosis method based on enhanced independence of data. The method deals with data vector from two aspects: the attribute feature and the sample dimension. After processing, the classification limitation of NB is reduced by the independence hypothesis. First, we extract the statistical characteristics of the original signal of the bearings effectively. Then, the Decision Tree algorithm is used to select the important features of the time domain signal, and the low correlation features is selected. Next, the Selective Support Vector Machine (SSVM) is used to prune the dimension data and remove redundant vectors. Finally, we use NB to diagnose the fault with the low correlation data. The experimental results show that the independent enhancement of data is effective for bearing fault diagnosis.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5856166", "pubmed_id": "29401730", "doi": "10.3390/s18020463", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2792332216", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["114678888", "123721717", "12122852", "1426699", "25254098", "46887708", "122755859", "111121639", "110055372", "122514256", "122250052", "109497630", "24868690", "120886118", "109682008", "120691167", "122577268", "14632188", "44564975", "40467634", "3334701", "24967843", "110933717", "60735185", "46532027", "121448487", "875220", "39809197", "14727192", "109780726"], "inbound_citations": ["202981213", "135458585", "203028108", "59540726", "52052697", "73498137", "46934075", "209495907", "58551742", "88510516", "59540842"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3793030"}

Adaptive mechanisms must act continuously to restore perceptual-motor alignments necessary for perception of a coherent world. Experimental manipulations that exposed participants to localized discrepancies showed that adaptation is revealed by the acquisition of a constrained relation between entire modalities rather than associations between individual exemplars within these modalities. The computational problem faced by the human nervous system can thus be conceived as having to induce constrained relations between continuous stimulus and response dimensions from ambiguous or incomplete training sets, that is, performing interpolation and extrapolation. How biological neuronal networks solve this problem is unknown. Here we show that neural processing based on linear collective computation and least-square (LS) error learning in populations of frequency-coded neurons (i.e., whose discharge varies in a monotonic fashion with a parameter) has built-in interpolation and extrapolation capacities.

In particular, it is important to have tools to map changes in forest resources, which helps us to understand the significance of the forest biomass changes in the global carbon cycle. In the task of mapping changes in forest resources for wide areas, Earth Observing satellites could play the key role. In 2013, an EU/FP7-Space funded project \u201cAdvanced_SAR\u201d was started with the main objective to develop novel forest resources mapping methods based on the fusion of satellite based 3D measurements and in-situ field measurements of forests. During the summer 2014, an extensive field surveying campaign was carried out in the Evo test site, Southern Finland. Forest inventory attributes of mean tree height, basal area, mean stem diameter, stem volume, and biomass, were determined for 91 test plots having the size of 32 by 32 meters (1024 m 2 ). Simultaneously, a comprehensive set of satellite and airborne data was collected. Satellite data also included a set of TanDEM-X (TDX) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, suitable for interferometric and stereo-radargrammetric processing to extract 3D elevation data representing the forest canopy. In the present study, we compared the accuracy of TDX InSAR and TSX stereo-radargrammetric derived 3D metrics in forest inventory attribute prediction. First, 3D data were extracted from TDX and TSX images. Then, 3D data were processed as elevations above the ground surface (forest canopy height values) using an accurate Digital Terrain Model (DTM) based on airborne laser scanning survey. Finally, 3D metrics were calculated from the canopy height values for each test plot and the 3D metrics were compared with the field reference data. The Random Forest method was used in the forest inventory attributes prediction. Based on the results InSAR showed slightly better performance in forest attribute (i.e. mean tree height, basal area, mean stem diameter, stem volume, and biomass) prediction than stereo-radargrammetry.

A ten-minute non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can potentially pick subtle impairments like subclinical language deficit. Machine learning can supplement neuropsychological test to detect language deficit from white matter tracts in post-stroke DTI with high accuracy. Thirty subjects were categorized into three groups based on stroke status and language neuropsychological test (verbal fluency task): ten healthy controls, ten ischemic stroke subjects with language deficit (normed verbal fluency score = -1.5). Subjects were age and gender matched across groups. DTI with 56 directions acquired on 3T GE MRI 750 scanners were processed using standard steps to generate fractional anisotropy (FA) maps that measure microstructural integrity of the brain. Individual 48 white matter tracts were extracted using Johns Hopkins University (JHU) ICBM-DTI-81 white matter atlas. Mean FA per tract per subject was computed. A support vector machine (SVM) used mean FA to classify among groups. With a Gaussian kernel and leave-one-out cross validation, SVM ranked tracts predicting language deficit. Groups were age and gender matched resulting in no significant difference in the age across groups ( p > 0.05). While a three-class SVM yields a 57% classification accuracy, binary SVM on pairs of groups provides accuracy of 80% (healthy controls vs. stroke with language deficit), 85% (healthy controls vs. stroke with no language deficit) and 75% (stroke with language deficit vs. stroke with no language deficit). Top independent white matter tract with highest weight given by classifier was: splenium of corpus callosum, right superior corona radiata, right external capsule respectively for the three classifications above.

First, machine learning requires significant amount of truthed data to capture complex channel and emitter characteristics, and train the underlying algorithm (e.g., a classifier). Second, the training data that has been identified for one spectrum environment cannot be used for another one (e.g., after channel and emitter conditions change).

Existing methods focus either on finding a dictionary that produces discriminative sparse representation, or on enforcing priors that best describe the dataset distribution. In many cases, the dataset size is often small with large intra-class variability and nondiscriminative feature space. In this work we propose a simple and effective framework called ELM-DDL to address these issues. Specifically, we represent input features with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with orthogonal output projection, which enables diverse representation on nonlinear hidden space and task specific feature learning on output space. The embeddings are further regularized via a maximum margin criterion (MMC) to maximize the inter-class variance and minimize intra-class variance. For dictionary learning, we design a novel weighted class specific l 1 , 2 norm to regularize the sparse coding vectors, which promotes uniformity of the sparse patterns of samples belonging to the same class and suppresses support overlaps of different classes. We show that such regularization is robust, discriminative and easy to optimize. The proposed method is combined with a sparse representation classifier (SRC) to evaluate on benchmark datasets. Results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other dictionary learning methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31901564", "doi": "10.1016/j.neunet.2019.11.015", "venue": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "mag_id": "2995732134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209893408"}

Methods for estimation of parameters of GMMs include the expectation-maximization method which is a non-discriminative learning based method and the large margin method which is a discriminative learning based method. Discriminative classifier based approaches to speaker recognition include support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers using dynamic kernels such as generalized linear discriminant sequence kernel, probabilistic sequence kernel, GMM supervector kernel and Bhattacharyya distance based kernel . Recently, the intermediate matching kernel (IMK) has been proposed as a dynamic kernel for recognition of objects in an image represented using a set of local feature vectors. The IMK-based SVMs give a better performance than the state-of-the-art GMM-based approaches for speaker identification tasks, because they are well suited for meeting the basic challenge of providing reliable scores of intra-speaker variation of suspects and scores of inter-speaker variation of the potential population which is crucial to law enforcement and counter terrorism agencies in evaluating the strength of the evidence at hand. Thus, the IMK-based SVMs can be used to build the speaker recognition models in the FSR (forensic speaker recognition) systems. However, it is necessary to develop techniques to determine the strength of evidence from the outputs of SVM-based models. The SVM-based models are trained using discriminative methods and their generalization ability is good. We propose to use the IMK-based SVM classifier for speaker identification from the speech signal of an utterance represented as a set of local feature vectors. The main issue in building the IMK-based SVM classifier is selection of the virtual feature vectors using which the local feature vectors from the representations of two different utterances are matched. We explore the use of components of universal background GMM as the set of virtual feature vectors. We compare the performance of the GMM-based approaches and the dynamic kernel SVM-based approaches to speaker identification. The 2002 and 2003 NIST speaker recognition corpora are used in evaluation of different approaches to speaker identification. Results of our studies show that the dynamic kernel SVM-based approaches give a significantly better performance than the GMM-based approaches. For speaker identification task, the IMK-based SVM gives a performance that is comparable to that of SVMs using any of the other dynamic kernels. The storage requirements and the computational complexity of the IMK-based SVMs are less than of SVMs using any of the other dynamic kernels.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4614-0263-3_14", "venue": "Forensic Speaker Recognition", "journal": "Forensic Speaker Recognition", "mag_id": "2132110050", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["374358", "131936797", "18338249"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61889843"}

The antecedent part of the TFS-SVMPC classifier is generated using an algorithm that is similar to fuzzy clustering. The dimension of the free parameter vector in the TS consequent part of the TFS-SVMPC is first reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). A linear SVM is then used to tune the subsequent parameters in the principal component space to give the system better generalization performance. The TFS-SVMPC is used as a classifier in a camera-based real-time object detection system. The object detection system consists of two stages. The first stage uses a color histogram of the global color appearance of an object as a detection feature for a TFS-SVMPC classifier.

Given a pre-trained speaker embedding network developed with out-of domain data, we explore and analyze how this pre-trained model can benefit for the in-domain speaker verification task. Two alternative strategies are investigated to perform transfer learning, i.e., vanilla transfer learning (V-TL) and curriculum learning based transfer learning (CL-TL). The proposed methods are validated on UT-SCOPE-physical speech corpus, where we create a setup to introduce mismatched evaluation conditions with the neutral and the physical task stressed speech. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both V-TL and CL-TL techniques.

There are several automated feature selection methods, ranging from backward, forward or stepwise procedures, to further elaborated methodologies such as evolutionary programming. The problem lies in selecting the minimum subset of descriptors that can predict a certain property with a good performance, computationally efficient and in a more robust way, since the presence of irrelevant or redundant features can cause poor generalization capacity. In this paper an alternative selection method, based on Random Forests to determine the variable importance is proposed in the context of QSPR regression problems, with an application to a manually curated dataset for predicting standard enthalpy of formation. The subsequent predictive models are trained with support vector machines introducing the variables sequentially from a ranked list based on the variable importance. The model generalizes well even with a high dimensional dataset and in the presence of highly correlated variables. The feature selection step was shown to yield lower prediction errors with RMSE values 23% lower than without feature selection, albeit using only 6% of the total number of variables (89 from the original 1485).

The predictive model was selected using a 10-fold cross validation procedure and, after selection, it was validated with an independent set to assess its performance when applied to new data and the results were similar to the ones obtained for the training set, supporting the robustness of the proposed approach.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) systems can be defined to be a non-muscular pathway to operate rehabilitative devices using motor imagery signals captured from the motor activation areas in the brain. Supervised learning can help in prediction of motor imagery actions by processing raw EEG signals. However, dimension of the feature space plays a crucial role in this process. Large dimensional features not only increase the computational complexity but also the presence of redundant features causes reduction in classification accuracy. In this work, we intend to select the relevant features from the feature vector obtained by Power Spectrum Density estimation of the left/right motor imagery signals. BCI Competition 2008 \u2014 Graz dataset B has been used as the source of raw EEG data. To achieve this goal, we have used single-objective as well as many-objective version of Differential Evolution which optimizes the classifier's performance in terms of five metrics obtained from the Confusion Matrix.

Upon examination, however, models with the connectionist framework are found to be wrong in important respects or are too powerful to be meaningful. The following observations support these claims. The assumption of interactive activation (i.e., two-way connections between units) of specific connectionist models is shown to be both unnecessary and inconsistent with empirical results. Connectionist models with hidden units are demonstrated to be too powerful; they can simulate different types of results that are generated by different process models. Given the power of connectionist models with hidden units, they can describe results with unrealistic assumptions about the psychophysical relationships that are functional in the task. Connectionist models with hidden units are limited in theoretical value without postulating something like sequential stages of processing in which some categorization occurs before response selection.

In this paper, a deep learning based method for blind hyperspectral unmixing is presented. The method uses multitask learning through multiple parallel autoencoders to unmix a neighborhood of pixels simultaneously. Operating on image patches instead of single pixels enables the method to take advantage of spatial information in the hyperspectral image.

Motivated by the fact that age labels are usually correlated in real-world scenarios, we carefully develop a similarity-aware function to well measure the distance of each face pair based on the age value gaps. Consequently, the age-difference information is exploited in the synthetic feature space for robust age estimation. During the learning process, we jointly optimize both procedures of generating hard negatives and learning discriminative age ranker via a sequence of adversarial-game iterations. Another major issue lies on that existing methods only enforce the indiscriminativeness within each class, which is probably trapped into model overfitting and thus the generation capacity is limited particularly on unseen age classes with many individuals. To circumvent this problem, we propose a variational deep adversarial learning (VDAL) paradigm, which learns to encode each face sample in two factorized parts, i.e., the intra-class variance distribution and the intra-class invariant class center. Moreover, our VDAL principally optimizes the variational confidence lower bound on the variational factorized feature representation. To better enhance the discriminativeness of the age representation, our VDAL further learns to encode the ordinal relationship among age labels in the reconstructed subspace. Experimental results on folds of widely-evaluated benchmarking datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance in contrast to most state-of-the-art age estimation methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMM.2020.2969793", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Multimedia", "mag_id": "3003383851", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212776220"}
