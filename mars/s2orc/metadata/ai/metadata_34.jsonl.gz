To this end, we extend a previous intelligent system approach to volume rendering, and we systematically compare five supervised classification techniques -- Gaussian Naive Bayes, k Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and Random Forests -- with respect to probabilistic classification, support for multiple materials, interactive performance, robustness to unreliable input, and easy parameter tuning, which we identify as key requirements for the successful use in this application. Based on theoretical considerations, as well as quantitative and visual results on volume datasets from different sources and modalities, we conclude that, while no single classifier can be expected to outperform all others under all circumstances, random forests are a useful off-the-shelf technique that provides fast, easy, robust and accurate results in many scenarios.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/cgf.12623", "venue": "Comput.

However, plastic-mulched farmland significantly influences the environment and has so far been inadequately investigated. Accurately monitoring and mapping plastic-mulched farmland is crucial for agricultural production, environmental protection, resource management, and so on. Monitoring plastic-mulched farmland using moderate-resolution remote sensing data is technically challenging because of spatial mixing and spectral confusion with other ground objects. This paper proposed a new scheme that combines spectral and textural features for monitoring the plastic-mulched farmland and evaluates the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with different kernel functions using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. The textural features were extracted from multi-bands OLI data using a Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) algorithm. Then, six combined feature sets were developed for classification. The results indicated that Landsat-8 OLI data are well suitable for monitoring plastic-mulched farmland; the SVM classifier with a linear kernel function is superior both to other kernel functions and to two other widely used supervised classifiers: Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC). For the SVM classifier with a linear kernel function, the highest overall accuracy was derived from combined spectral and textural features in the 90\u00b0 direction (94.14%, kappa 0.92), followed by the combined spectral and textural features in the 45\u00b0 (93.84%, kappa 0.92), 135\u00b0 (93.73%, kappa 0.92), 0\u00b0 (93.71%, kappa 0.92) directions, and the spectral features alone (93.57%, kappa 0.91).

In cases of hydrological impact assessments, such as herbicide pollution through runoff, methods for generating these data over the entire water resource catchment and at the plot resolution are needed. In this study, we aimed to identify indicators for simulating the spatial distribution of weed control practices (WCP) in a French vine growing catchment. On the basis of interviews of 63 winegrowers, a spatially explicit database was developed that included 1007 vine plots and information regarding practices and potential explanatory variables. Four practices were differentiated according to the methods used (chemical weed control, shallow tillage, grass cover or a combination) that determine the intensity of herbicide use and potential surface runoff. Three groups of explanatory variables corresponding to three assumed levels of spatial organisation of WCP (the plot, the farm and the local government area (LGA)) were tested and compared. In the first step, selection of explanatory variables within each group was performed using a tree-partitioning method that combined the advantages of the CART algorithm (building an interpretable and controlled model) and the Random Forest algorithm (limiting overfitting) algorithm. In the second step, the performance of the selected variables for reproducing the observed repartition of practices was evaluated by a stochastic use of the tree, leading to a set of equiprobable spatial distributions of practices at the plot resolution. The results indicate that plot characteristics related to alley width play an important role in the weed control choices; however, to take into account the total diversity of the WCP, it appears to be necessary to focus on the farm holding variables and, in particular, on the variable LGA. However, the interpretation of these results is still difficult. Specifically, the great relevance of the variable LGA to discriminate the practices may be related to various factors, one of which is the distribution of soil properties within the Peyne catchment that still requires more precise characterization. The results also indicate that the combination of the three groups of variables leads to the highest-performing simulations of the spatial distribution of WCP. Nevertheless, the farm holding variables provided little additional spatial information, which supports the idea that they may be omitted without significantly impacting the final results.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.agsy.2008.10.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2029810007", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["154815479", "30697864", "52083334", "60993494", "53824787", "40921612", "153997784", "140723138", "154902926", "98080188", "15615263", "129151372", "154741161", "128620467", "60206680", "134485760", "153669074", "152904886", "96023134", "128397820", "9073564", "83811685", "129723141", "8529157", "154399375", "39983073", "86708380", "1189046", "18266008", "128893679"], "inbound_citations": ["37510739", "15147995", "215267062", "181617738", "211266339"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:859243"}

The widely used assumption by many existing tagging methods is that images are independently and identically distributed is not effective to capture the geographical correlation. In this paper, we study the novel problem of utilizing the geographical correlation among images and landmarks for better tagging landmark images. In particular, we propose an unsupervised feature learning approach to learn the geographically discriminative features across geographical locations, by integrating latent space learning and geographically structural analysis (LSGSA) into a joint model. A latent space learning model is proposed to effectively fuse the heterogeneous features of visual content and tags. Meanwhile, the geographical structure analysis and group sparsity are applied to learn the geographically discriminative features. Then, a geo-guided sparse reconstruction method is proposed to tag images by utilizing the discriminative information of features, in which the landmark-specific tags are boosted by a weighting method. Experiments on the real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2018.03.005", "venue": "Knowl.

It is a critical limitation to broader neurophysiological study of hf-SEPs in that hundreds of responses have to be averaged to detect hf-SEPs reliably. Here, we establish a framework for detecting human hf-SEPs non-invasively in single trials. Methods Spatio-temporal features were extracted from band-pass filtered (400-900 Hz) hf-SEPs by bilinear Common Spatio-Temporal Patterns (bCSTP) and then classified by a weighted Extreme Learning Machine (w-ELM). The effect of varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of trials, and degree of w-ELM re-weighting was characterized using surrogate data. For practical demonstration of the algorithm, median nerve hf-SEPs were recorded inside a shielded room in four subjects, spanning the hf-SEP signal-to-noise ratio characteristic for a larger population, utilizing a custom-built 29-channel low-noise EEG amplifier. Results Using surrogate data, the SNR proved to be pivotal to detect hf-SEPs in single trials efficiently, with the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm being obtained by the w-ELM re-weighting parameter. In practice, human hf-SEPs were detected non-invasively in single trials with a sensitivity of up to 99% and a specificity of up to 97% in two subjects, even without any recourse to knowledge of stimulus timing. Matching with the results of the surrogate data analysis, these rates dropped to 62\u201379% sensitivity and 18\u201331% specificity in two subjects with lower SNR. Conclusions Otherwise buried in background noise, human high-frequency EEG components can be extracted from low-noise recordings. Specifically, refined supervised filter optimization and classification enables the reliable detection of single-trial hf-SEPs, representing non-invasive correlates of cortical population spikes. Significance While low-frequency EEG reflects summed postsynaptic potentials, and thereby neuronal input, we suggest that high-frequency EEG (> 400 Hz) can provide non-invasive access to the unaveraged output of neuronal computation, i.e., single-trial population spike activity evoked in the responsive neuronal ensemble.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25451476", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.024", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "mag_id": "2039893299", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52988374", "215647858", "453940"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7207887"}

Also, in some new domains, the knowledge to organize and label different classes might not be unavailable. Therefore unsupervised learning schemes for automatically clustering data in the training phase are needed. Furthermore, even when knowledge exists, variation is high when the subject under classification depends on personal opinions and is open to different interpretations. This paper describes a methodology which uses Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and alternatively does the automatic clustering by using the Correlation Coefficient (CorrCoef). Consequently the clusters are used as the labels to train the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experiments and results are presented based on applying the methodology to some standard text datasets in order to verify the accuracy of the proposed scheme.

The irregularity in size and shape of the superpixels measured with the Hausdorff distance served to determine the salient regions in the very large aerial images. Then, the car detection was performed with both the component-based approach and the featurebased approaches. We merged the superpixels with the statistical region merging (SRM) algorithm. The regions were described by the radiometric, geometrical moments and shape features, and classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The cast shadow were detected and removed by a radiometry based tricolor attenuation model (TAM).

The object parts were combined to the object according to their unique spatial relations. On the other hand, we used the invariant scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features to describe superpixels and classed them by the SVM as belong or not to the object.

By solving an inverse problem in computational imaging, DNNs can overcome several shortcomings in the conventional lensless imaging through scattering media methods, namely, high cost, poor quality, complex control, and poor anti-interference. However, for training, a large number of training samples on various datasets have to be collected, with a DNN trained on one dataset generally performing poorly for recovering images from another dataset. The underlying reason is that lensless imaging through scattering media is a high dimensional regression problem and it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution. In this work, transfer learning is proposed to address this issue. Our main idea is to train a DNN on a relatively complex dataset using a large number of training samples and fine-tune the last few layers using very few samples from other datasets. Instead of the thousands of samples required to train from scratch, transfer learning alleviates the problem of costly data acquisition. Specifically, considering the difference in sample sizes and similarity among datasets, we propose two DNN architectures, namely LISMU-FCN and LISMU-OCN, and a balance loss function designed for balancing smoothness and sharpness.

Repeated cessation can result in reduced oxygen supply to the brain and the rest of the body parts leading to poor sleep quality. Apnea cases are mostly unrecognized owing to the fact that the sleep studies are time and money consuming. Furthermore, the unavailability of high hospital standards and the lack of specialized persons, especially in rural areas have added up to the reason for the non-recognition of apnea. High accurate apnea detection systems were developed which made use of features extracted from the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage and thus demanded the persons complete 8 hour sleep. As an initial stage of disease screening, the patient may be uncomfortable to spend his complete night for testing. This paper has brought a system which can detect apnea as soon as the patient goes into his sleep rather than waiting him to enter to the REM stage. This requirement is accomplished by removing the stage dependency of features through Nuisance Attribute Projection (NAP), a used technique for removal of channel nuisances in speaker recognition system. Using the time and frequency domain features of heart rate and respiratory rate variability as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, a baseline system of 50% absolute accurate system was developed. NAP was performed on the training features. A weight matrix was developed which brought together those features which belong to same classification label, but separated by the sleep stage and patient-specific variations. Individual systems were developed which removed the stage variations and patient-specific variations. An improvement in classification accuracy of 12.5% and 7.5% absolute were observed when stage and patient-specific variations were removed respectively.

This enables our system to generate images with any given combination of objects, all composed into a visually realistic natural image. The system learns the interrelationships of all classes represented in a dataset, and can generate diverse samples including a set of these classes. It displays the ability to arrange these objects together, accounting for occlusions and inter-object spatial relations that characterize complex natural images.

The monitoring data indicated that the fluctuation of groundwater level is significantly consistent with rainfall and reservoir level in time, but there is a lag. In addition, there is a spatial difference in the impact of reservoir levels on the landslide groundwater level. The data of two monitoring locations were selected for establishing the prediction model of groundwater. Combined with the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the influencing factors were selected, respectively, to establish the hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) prediction model.

Shultz (shultz@psych.mcgill.ca) Department of Psychology; McGill University Montreal, QC H3C 1B1 Canada Abstract Although it is commonly assumed that rule-based models generalize more effectively than do connectionist models, the comparison is often confounded by pitting hand-written rules against learned connections. Three case studies from cognitive development show that, under the constraint that both types of models learn their representations from equivalent examples, generalization is consistently superior in connectionist models. Generalization Problems A significant part of the ongoing debate between rule- based and connectionist modeling in psychology has focused on the ability to generalize. A common claim from supporters of the classical, symbolic approach is that rule-based models are superior because they generalize more effectively than do connectionist models (Ling & Marinov, 1993; Pinker, 1997; Marcus, 1998). Generalization is considered important by most modelers because it distinguishes understanding of a problem from mere memorization of solutions. The generalization ability of rules is often enhanced by the use of variables that can be bound to any number of objects or events. Consider the following rule, written in Common Lisp for a production system program. It generates correct responses on some Piagetian conservation of number problems: ((response more ?x ?y) (and (initially-same-number ?x ?y) (or (add1 ?x) (subtract1 ?y)))) The rule says to conclude that row x has more items than row y if the two rows initially had the same number of items and if one item was subsequently either added to row x or subtracted from row y. It has plenty of generality because the variables x and y can be bound to any rows with any number of items. It could be made even more general by adding a third variable n, representing the number of items added or subtracted. More generally, a rule can be defined as a conditional statement in which conjunctively and disjunctively connected conditions, if verified as true, produce a set of conjunctively connected conclusions. Each condition and conclusion is a proposition that can be stated in predicate-argument form, where arguments can be constants, variables, or other propositions. Leaving aside the issue of whether people actually generalize as well as such rules do, the claim has commonly been made that connectionist models rarely learn to generalize that well. Indeed, this argument seems to have been accepted by many connectionists (e.g., Anderson, 1995), and is at least partly responsible for the many attempts to improve generalization in neural network learning (e.g., Reed & Marks, 1995). However, closer inspection reveals a serious confound in this argument. The symbolic rules are often written by hand, or perhaps merely alluded to, while the neural network learns its own connection weights by processing examples. The purpose of this paper is to remove this confound between representation and learning by requiring both types of model to learn their representations from equivalent examples. It is already well known that an alternate method of removing this confound, by hand-designing neural networks to explicitly implement rules and variables, also produces excellent generalization (Shastri, 1995). The learning constraint proposed here is reminiscent of the developmental tractability constraint proposed by Klahr (1984). In discussing cognitive development, Klahr argued that any two plausible, consecutive developmental states must be integrated in a transition theory that can transform one state into the other. Similarly, and a bit more generally, I propose a constraint that acquired knowledge representations, whether rules or weight vectors, must be learned by a model in order to be considered plausible. Knowledge representations that are instead hypothesized to be produced through biological evolution may be dealt with by hand designing rule-based and connectionist models as noted earlier, or even more ambitiously, by simulated evolution. Covering both inherited and acquired representations is the more general principle that other, non-representational features must be held constant when assessing generalization ability. Otherwise claims about superior generalization ability may be confounded with acquisition issues and possibly other differences.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2625186559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["144049430", "64130676", "58047721", "9921081", "9953904", "2013430", "9484437", "6261323", "15672898", "32095112", "38521835", "13252401", "5262555", "59917632", "18615818", "145151627", "57967240", "34427444", "19450119"], "inbound_citations": ["8435843", "169033816", "17551358"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6999083"}

To address this issue, we extend one of the sequential approaches to work in parallel and propose an Online Map-Reduce Drift Detection Method (OMR-DDM). It uses the combined online error rate of the parallel classification algorithms to identify changes in the underlying concept. For reasons of algorithmic efficiency it is built on a modified version of the popular Map-Reduce paradigm which permits for using preliminary results within mappers.

Therefore, attempts have usually been carried out to use artificial neural network for identification of the relationship between the well log data and core permeability. In this way, recent works on artificial intelligence techniques have led to introduce a robust machine learning methodology called support vector machine.

However, to build a robust deep neural network classifier model, sufficient number of image data is necessary. In preparing image data, collection and annotation of large datasets can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. This work aims to reduce the effort and time needed to perform such tasks. In this research, a method for synthesizing insect pest training images in sticky paper trap images and enhancing the performance of insect pest convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier models through a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. Through GAN, images were synthesized to balance and increase the number of training images even with limited data. The fidelity of the synthetic images was tested using t-SNE visualization. To evaluate the developed network, the minimum number of images required to apply GAN-based augmentation was determined. Furthermore, the performance of the insect pest classifier models without augmentation, with traditional augmentation, and with GAN-based augmentation were compared. Testing results show that the classifier models trained with images augmented using GAN achieved an F1-score of 0.95, outperforming the models trained with traditionally augmented images with an F1-score of 0.92. This research shows that by using GAN-based augmentation method, the insect pest CNN classification models can yield a better performance compared to classic augmentation method and reduce the effort needed for data collection. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be easily adapted to various agricultural applications using deep neural networks when image data is limited.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.12.406", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC-PapersOnLine", "mag_id": "2997266778", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212845411"}

Although default values can result in models with good predictive performance, different implementations of the same machine learning algorithms use different default values, leading to models with clearly different predictive performance for the same dataset. Optimization techniques have been used to search for hyper-parameter values able to maximize the predictive performance of induced models for a given dataset, but with the drawback of a high computational cost.

Based on the observation that the underlying spectrum of user preferences is reflected in various types of interactions with items and can be uncovered by latent relational learning in metric space, we propose a unified neural learning framework, named Multi-Relational Memory Network (MRMN). It can not only model fine-grained user-item relations but also enable us to discriminate between feedback types in terms of the strength and diversity of user preferences. Extensive experiments show that the proposed MRMN model outperforms competitive state-of-the-art algorithms in a wide range of scenarios, including e-commerce, local services, and job recommendations.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.09882", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.24963/ijcai.2019/619", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951282211,2966199682", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["207168823", "4884763"], "inbound_citations": ["211526208"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195345617"}

In this way, promotion recommendation lacks mobile data usage pattern and consumption level of customers so that telecom operators hardly provide precision marketing. Conclusively, it may be possibly an inappropriate telecom offer, resulting in low customer satisfaction and loyalty, high churn rate, or in the worst case, erosion of average revenue per user (ARPU).

In recent years, the use of rhythm-based features in speech processing systems has received growing interest. This approach uses a wide array of rhythm metrics that have been developed to capture speech timing differences between and within languages. However, the reliability of rhythm metrics is being increasingly called into question. In this paper, we propose two modifications to this approach. First, we describe a model that is based on auditory cues that simulate the external, middle and inner parts of the ear. We evaluate this model by performing experiments to discriminate between native and non-native Arabic speech. Data are from the West Point Arabic Speech Corpus; testing is done on standard classifiers based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a hybrid GMM/SVM. Results show that the auditory-based model consistently outperforms a traditional rhythm-metric approach that includes both duration- and intensity-based metrics. Second, we propose a framework that combines the rhythm metrics and the auditory-based cues in the context of a Logistic Regression (LR) method that can optimize feature combination.

Key features of our proposed model include: (i) simultaneous learning of the joint representation and temporal dependencies between modalities, (ii) use of multiple loss terms in the objective function, including a maximum correlation loss term to enhance learning of cross-modal information, and (iii) the use of an attention model to dynamically adjust the contribution of different input modalities to the joint representation.

We assessed the correlation of disability and specific impairment of the clinical functional system with overall and regional CNS damage in a large cohort of patients with MS with different clinical phenotypes by using a random forest approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain conventional MR imaging and DTI were performed in 172 patients with MS and 46 controls. Cervical cord MR imaging was performed in a subgroup of subjects. To evaluate whether MR imaging measures were able to correctly classify impairment in specific clinical domains, we performed a random forest analysis. RESULTS: Between-group differences were found for most of the MR imaging variables, which correlated significantly with clinical measures ( r ranging from \u22120.57 to 0.55). The random forest analysis showed a high performance in identifying impaired versus unimpaired patients, with a global error between 7% (pyramidal functional system) and 31% (Ambulation Index) in the different outcomes considered. When considering the performance in the unimpaired and impaired groups, the random forest analysis showed a high performance in identifying patients with impaired sensory, cerebellar, and brain stem functions (error below 10%), while it performed poorly in defining impairment of visual and mental systems (error of 91% and 70%, respectively). In analyses with a good level of classification, for most functional systems, damage of the WM fiber bundles subserving their function, measured by using DTI tractography, had the highest classification power. CONCLUSIONS: Random forest analysis, especially if applied to DTI tractography data, is a valuable approach, which might contribute to overcoming the MS clinical\u2212MR imaging paradox.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22081673", "doi": "10.3174/ajnr.A2864", "venue": "AJNR.

The model starts by learning from image pairs the normal existing patterns in the before and after images to come up with a suitable representation of the normal (nonchange) class. To achieve this, we employ a stacked sparse autoencoder trained on a large number of temporal image features (training data) in an unsupervised manner. To classify pixels of new unseen image-pairs, the built anomaly detection model reconstructs the input from its representation in the latent space. First, the probe (new) image (i.e., the bitemporal heterogeneous image pair as the input request) is encoded in this compact normal space from a stacked hidden representation. The reconstruction error is computed using the L2 norm in what we call the residual normal space. In which, the nonchange patterns are characterized by small reconstruction errors as a normal class while the change patterns are quantified by high reconstruction errors categorizing the abnormal class. The dichotomic (changed/unchanged) classification map is generated in the residual space by clustering the reconstructed errors using a Gaussian mixture model.

The main objective of this work is to expose performance difference between state-of-the-art parcel-based smoothing and purely data-driven conditional random field (CRF) smoothing, which is yet unknown. To fulfill this objective, we perform extensive tests with four different classification methods (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gaussian Mixtures, and Maximum Likelihood) to compute the pixel-wise data term; and we also test two different definitions of the pairwise smoothness term. We have performed a detailed evaluation on different multispectral VHR images (Ikonos, QuickBird, Kompsat-2). The main finding of this study is that pairwise CRF smoothing comes close to the state-of-the-art parcel-based method that requires parcel boundaries (average difference \u2248 2.5%). Our results indicate that a single multispectral (R, G, B, NIR) image is enough to reach satisfactory classification accuracy for six crop classes (corn, pasture, rice, sugar beet, wheat, and tomato) in Mediterranean climate.

In recent years, the demand for energy-saving oriented researches has been increased to provide recommendations to the final energy abatement policy making for the industry. Hence, a study which analyzes the typical energy consumption influencing factors and the potential energy-saving capability for the current power industry of China is needed. In this paper, the energy consumption significant influence factors have been picked out and the potential energy-saving capability has been estimated through the analysis conducted under several different scenarios. The results of this work can contribute to the assessment of energy abatement spaces for the power industry of China from now to the year of 2025. At the beginning of the study, 8 factors including social, economic and technical aspects which affect the energy consumption significantly have been selected by Back Propagation Mean Impact Value (BP-MIV) network approach. Then the 8 filtered factors are employed as input in the Back Propagation Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost-BP) neural network model. The Adaboost-BP was trained and tested on existing data set. Being compared with the results on the same data set from grey prediction and regular BP network, the results of Adaboost-BP showed better accuracy over the other two methods. In the final step of this work, the potential energy-saving capability of China's power industry through the year 2025 was predicted using the trained Adaboost-BP network under 3 different scenarios. The results show that the energy consumption estimates can reach at most 319.657 million tons of standard coal under conventional condition at the year of 2025, with 307.8087 and 294.0182 million tons under moderate and advanced conditions respectively. This means that, 11.8483 million tons and 25.6388 million tons of standard coal could be potentially saved at the year of 2025 under moderate scenario and advanced scenario respectively.

LDF focuses on discriminative body parts by approximating a representation learned with body region segmentation. In this way, extra pose extraction is only introduced during the training stage to supervise the learning of PGR, but is not required during the testing stage for feature extraction.

Signal is whitened to improve the SNR, and then the weak burst signal can be detected by checking the short-term Root Mean Square (RMS) of the whitened signal. The second stage is to identify the detected burst signal for reducing the false alarm rate. Taking the signal's LPC coefficients as its characteristics, SVM is then utilized to determine whether the signal is generated by the impact of a loose part.

Authenticity is a substantial matter and a current concern of the organic food industry. Organic foods are appreciated by customers because of their benefits to health and friendliness to the environment. However, currently, the most common way for customers to confirm that the organic food they are buying are organic is by certificates and label information, which can be fraudulent. Furthermore, it is interesting to gain insight into organic food composition and visualize which mineral components are fundamental in the differentiation of organic from conventional food. This work addresses these problems using data mining concepts and techniques in a comparative study of organic and conventional food focusing on grape juice, but the proposed methodology can be adapted and employed for analysis of other types of organic food. This article presents a data mining analysis of the elemental composition of 37 grape juice samples collected from different locations in Brazil. The elemental composition of grape juice samples was determined by inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Forty-four elements were determined in the two types of samples, namely organic and conventional grape juice. Special effort was devoted to selecting the variables (elements) that best described each type of grape juice. Predictive models based on support vector machines, neural networks and decision trees were developed to successfully differentiate organic from conventional grape juice samples. We found that, according to the F-score, Chi-square and Random Forest Importance variable selection measures, the components Na, Sn, P, K, Sm and Nd are among the most important variables in the differentiation of organic and conventional grape juice samples. Particularly, the components Na, Sn and K received first, second or third position according to at least two methods.

And it has been found that the citrullination in protein sequences was catalyzed by a type of Ca2+-dependent enzyme family called peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD), which include five isotypes: PAD1, 2, 3, 4/5, and 6. Citrullinated proteins participate in many biological processes, e.g. the citrullination of myelin basic protein (MBP) assists the early development of central nervous system. However, abnormal modifications on citrullinated proteins would also lead to some severe human diseases including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: Therefore, it is necessary and important to identify the citrullination sites in protein sequences. The information about the location of citrulliantion sites in protein sequences will be useful to investigate the molecular functions and disease mechanisms related to citrullinated proteins. ::: ::: ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS ::: In this study, we investigated the peptide segments that contain the citrullination sites in the centers, which were encoded into numeric digits from four aspects. Thus, we yielded a training set with 116 positive samples and 232 negative samples. Then, a reliable feature selection technique, called maximum-relevance-minimum-redundancy (mRMR), was applied to analyze these features, and four algorithms, including random forest (RF), Dagging, nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA), and support vector machine (SVM), together with the incremental feature selection (IFS) method were adopted to extract important features. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Finally an optimal classifier derived from RF algorithm was constructed to predict citrullination sites. 44 most prominent features were comprehensively analyzed and their biological characteristics in citrullination catalysis were also revealed. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: We believed that the biological features obtained in this pioneering work would provide some useful insights into the formation and function of citrullination and the optimal classifier could be a useful tool to identify citrullination sites in protein sequences.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28029071", "doi": "10.2174/1386207319666161227124350", "venue": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "journal": "Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening", "mag_id": "2569439418", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32401871", "214908703", "215360154", "28059814", "57013417", "4377737", "167219502", "4797846"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11244183"}

With the increasing demands on developing effective ranking functions for different search domains, we have seen a big bottleneck, that is, the problem of insufficient labeled training data, which has significantly slowed the development and deployment of machine-learned ranking functions for different domains. There are two possible approaches to address this problem: (1) combining labeled training data from similar domains with the small target-domain labeled data for training or (2) using pairwise preference data extracted from user clickthrough log for the target domain for training. In this article, we propose a new approach called tree-based ranking function adaptation (Trada) to effectively utilize these data sources for training cross-domain ranking functions. Tree adaptation assumes that ranking functions are trained with the Stochastic Gradient Boosting Trees method\u2014a gradient boosting method on regression trees. It takes such a ranking function from one domain and tunes its tree-based structure with a small amount of training data from the target domain. The unique features include (1) automatic identification of the part of the model that needs adjustment for the new domain and (2) appropriate weighing of training examples considering both local and global distributions. Based on a novel pairwise loss function that we developed for pairwise learning, the basic tree adaptation algorithm is also extended (Pairwise Trada) to utilize the pairwise preference data from the target domain to further improve the effectiveness of adaptation.

The \u2018Neural Gas\u2019 algorithm was used to find clusters in a sample of 376 students who evaluated the Nike brand across 42 items of Brand Personality Scale. Discriminant Analysis was performed to check the ability of PBA to form homogeneous segments, and an Exploratory/Confirmatory Factor Analysis (E/CFA) was carried out to confirm the validation. Five prototypes of perception were identified and described according to the importance respondents put on brand attributes. Four (among five) prototypes demonstrate a significant relationship (positive or inverse) with two or more dimensions of brand perception. Homogeny of the segments was attested, both, by Discriminant and by the E/CFA.

It can be used to build domain-specific Web search portals and online personalized search tools. Focused crawlers can only use information obtained from previously crawled pages to estimate the relevance of a newly seen URL. Therefore, good performance depends on powerful modeling of context as well as the quality of the current observations. To address this challenge, we propose capturing sequential patterns along paths leading to targets based on probabilistic models. We model the process of crawling by a walk along an underlying chain of hidden states, defined by hop distance from target pages, from which the actual topics of the documents are observed. When a new document is seen, prediction amounts to estimating the distance of this document from a target. Within this framework, we propose two probabilistic models for focused crawling, Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) and Linear-chain Conditional Random Field (CRF). With MEMM, we exploit multiple overlapping features, such as anchor text, to represent useful context and form a chain of local classifier models. With CRF, a form of undirected graphical models, we focus on obtaining global optimal solutions along the sequences by taking advantage not only of text content, but also of linkage relations. We conclude with an experimental validation and comparison with focused crawling based on Best-First Search (BFS), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Context-graph Search (CGS). \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00411.x", "venue": "Comput.

To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a service desk ticket classifier system which automatically classifies the ticket using ticket description provided by user. By mining historical ticket descriptions and label, we have built a classifier model to classify the new tickets. A benefit of building such an automated service desk system includes improved productivity, end user experience and reduced resolution time. In this paper, different classification algorithms like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, K-Nearest neighbor and Support vector machines are used to build such a ticket classifier system and performances of classification models are evaluated using various performance metrics. A real-world IT infrastructure service desk ticket data is used for this research purpose.

In this study, we apply a machine learning technique [support vector machines (SVMs)] for automated recognition of OSAS types from their nocturnal ECG recordings. A total of 125 sets of nocturnal ECG recordings acquired from normal subjects (OSAS - ) and subjects with OSAS (OSAS +), each of approximately 8 h in duration, were analyzed. Features extracted from successive wavelet coefficient levels after wavelet decomposition of signals due to heart rate variability (HRV) from RR intervals and ECG-derived respiration (EDR) from R waves of QRS amplitudes were used as inputs to the SVMs to recognize OSAS +/- subjects. Using leave-one-out technique, the maximum accuracy of classification for 83 training sets was found to be 100% for SVMs using a subset of selected combination of HRV and EDR features. Independent test results on 42 subjects showed that it correctly recognized 24 out of 26 OSAS + subjects and 15 out of 16 OSAS - subjects (accuracy = 92.85%; Cohen's kappa value of 0.85). For estimating the relative severity of OSAS, the posterior probabilities of SVM outputs were calculated and compared with respective apnea/hypopnea index. These results suggest superior performance of SVMs in OSAS recognition supported by wavelet-based features of ECG.

A new feature selection metric inspired by the Fisher criterion is designed to measure the importance of the features.

OCC approaches like one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) and support vector data description (SVDD) have wide practical applications. Recently, one-class extreme learning machine (OCELM), which inherits the fast learning speed of original ELM and achieves equivalent or higher data description performance than OCSVM and SVDD, is proposed as a promising alternative. However, OCELM faces the same thorny parameter selection problem as OCSVM and SVDD. It significantly affects the performance of OCELM and remains under-explored. This paper proposes minimal spanning tree (MST)-GEN, an automatic way to select proper parameters for OCELM. Specifically, we first build a ${n}$ -round MST to model the structure and distribution of the given target set. With information from ${n}$ -round MST, a controllable number of pseudo outliers are generated by edge pattern detection and a novel \u201crepelling\u201d process, which readily overcomes two fundamental problems in previous outlier generation methods: where and how many pseudo outliers should be generated. Unlike previous methods that only generate pseudo outliers, we further exploit ${n}$ -round MST to generate pseudo target data, so as to avoid the time-consuming cross-validation process and accelerate the parameter selection. Extensive experiments on various datasets suggest that the proposed method can select parameters for OCELM in a highly efficient and accurate manner when compared with existing methods, which enables OCELM to achieve better OCC performance in OCC applications. Furthermore, our experiments show that MST-GEN can also be favorably applied to other prevalent OCC methods like OCSVM and SVDD.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28600273", "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2017.2707463", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2624463054", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1662330", "795827", "16561543", "62332", "14712495", "34367456", "10262313", "11917361", "4545714", "21275597", "64180856", "2110475", "207566367", "116858", "14460616", "12691358", "974999", "6954793", "11860755", "15037168", "7028394", "12450925", "19861033", "33492707", "335128", "38135033", "13861810", "10555375", "36027474", "207663697", "6767002", "11422092", "16360551", "30348686", "36777529", "11134230", "43857791", "15252489", "15107573", "2250085", "18142383", "62359231", "2702042", "5959423", "2941443", "37218320", "961425", "5230804"], "inbound_citations": ["51880839", "57378582", "3887842", "53018317"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3428911"}

In this study the authors try to give an overview of the most accurate methods to detect phishing websites to compare three methods such as Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree using public datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (www.uci.edu) optimized with feature selection and processed using RapidMiner program that showed Decision Tree has a accuracy rate of 91.84%, Naive Bayes method amounted to 74.07% and Support Vector Machine by 92.34%. Hereby declare that the method of Support Vector Machine has the highest degree of accuracy. ::: ::: Keyword: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Phishing, Support Vector Machine", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2783049111", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64694375"}

If the discriminative information among words in specific speech region but not whole utterance can be added, this operation can change the word ranks. However, a processing unit in most of automatic speech recognizer (ASR) is a frame but not a segment, while discriminative information for ASR is included in a segment, such as phone and word, but not a frame. That is, a useful information extraction from segments with various durations is important to improve the system performance. Actually, we can extract useful multi-scale information in speech, such as phone and word lattices, from various event detectors. However, it is very difficult that this multi-scale information is jointly modeled in traditional ASR based on a frame synchronous processing. This means the need of Markov assumption modeling of a segment level and classifier combining of various segment scales of observations. Thus, this paper adopts the segmental conditional random field (SCRF) framework and proposes new likelihoodbased external features for the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Evaluation in a mobile voice search domain shows that the proposed features provide some improvements over the conventional SCRF.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2182518606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61568097"}

The need to handle symbol processing and heuristic search to process natural language in real time, has prompted the, search for an alternative approach to tackle these issues. This has led to the cycle-intensive approach using a large number of very simple processors to get around the limitations of conventional symbolic processing. The system described in this work uses a sort and scan approach to assign lexical details to words. During the training phase of the syntactic module an incremental learning method to establish weak connections to represent the syntax of the connections to represent the syntax of the natural language by exposing the system to example syntactic constituent patterns and sentence patterns. A bottom-up parsing strategy is used to progressively fire word nodes, syntactic constituent nodes, using a marker propagation and constraint decision technique to maintain the relative ordering. The approacli creates a distributed representation of the parse tree and allows selective retrieval of parts of the structure. The semantic representation phase also works from the word nodes and utilizes projection rules to propagate markers and establish semantic connections after satisfying the semantic selectional restrictions imposed by the semantic descriptions. This marker propagation continues until a semantic structure has been associated with the sentence node.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TENCON.1991.753887", "venue": "TENCON '91.

It means that the systems sometimes do not perform well on newly generated data because new data have different distribution with existing training data. In particular, named entity recognition (NER) task often face this problem due to numerous newly created named entities over time. However it is challenging to annotate for every newly generated text data manually. Therefore we propose the method of reducing the cost of manual annotation for recently generated texts by using a large amount of unlabeled data. We first automatically recognize named entities in unlabeled data with a knowledge-base (KB). Automatic annotation for unstructured data costs less, but it has considerable noise because they are not a golden-standard data. To overcome this problem, we next apply a transfer learning approach that reduces the influence of noise from automatically annotated data. In our transfer learning approach, the automatically annotated data are used as data for pre-training the NER model, and then the model is finetuned with the existing manually annotated data. We evaluate our proposed method with three different distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of NER in recent texts.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIGCOMP.2019.8679473", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2929704235", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12740621", "6042994", "2470716", "277918", "11664683", "351666", "18375389", "10910955", "6018348", "14343843", "12784362", "15768270", "740063", "7928230", "59566327", "16631020", "17984798", "16732516", "1957433", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:96432090"}

In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to conduct simulation training for hourly water consumption data (over a period of 11 months) which had been processed by fuzzy information granulation method, and water consumption for the following month was predicted. First, the maximum hourly water consumption was extracted from the previous 11 months' water consumption. Then every seven data (a week) were transformed to a triangle fuzzy particle. Three parameters of the triangle fuzzy particle, Low, R, and Up, were defined as the minimum change (Low), the average change (R) and the maximum change (Up) of the maximum water consumption during one week.

Unlike traditional supervised learning problems, JCHL uses a single feature space to jointly classify multiple classification tasks with heterogeneous labels. For instance, biologists usually have to label the gene expression images with developmental stages and simultaneously annotate their anatomical terms. We would like to classify the developmental stages and at the same time classify anatomical terms by learning from the gene expression data. Recently, researchers have considered using Preferential random walk (PRW) to build different relations to link heterogeneous labels, thus the heterogeneous label information can be propagated by the instances. On the other hand, it has been shown that learning performance can be significantly enhanced if the dynamic propagation is exploited in PRW. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called random walk with dynamic label propagation (RWDLP), for the JCHL problems. In RWDLP, a joint transition probability graph is constructed to encode the relationships among instances and heterogeneous labels, and we utilize dynamic label propagation in the graph to generate the possible labels for the joint classification tasks with heterogeneous labels.

However, the dynamic regulation of two motion states, which usually happens in real life, is rarely studied. Besides, popular within-subject methods also require an extensive and time-consuming learning stage when testing on a new subject. This paper proposed a method to discriminate dynamic gait- adjustment intention with strong adaptability for different subjects. Methods: Cerebral hemoglobin signals obtained from 30 subjects were studied to decode gait-adjustment intention. Cerebral hemoglobin information was recorded by using fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) technology. Mathematical morphology filtering was applied to remove zero drift and EWM (Entropy Weight Method) was used to calculate the average hemoglobin values over Regions of Interest (ROIs). The gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) was utilized to detect the onset of self-regulated intention. A 2-layer-GA-SVM (Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine) model based on stacking algorithm was further proposed to identify the four types of self-regulated intention (speed increase, speed reduction, step increase, and step reduction). Results: It was found that GBDT had a good performance to detect the onset intention with an average AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.894. The 2-layer-GA-SVM model boosted the average ACC (accuracy) of four types of intention from 70.6% to 84.4% ( ${p} =0.005$ ) from the single GA-SVM model. Furthermore, the proposed method passed pseudo-online test with the average results as following: AUC = 0.883, TPR (True Positive Rate) = 97.5%, FPR (False Positive Rate) = 0.11%, and LAY (Detection Latency) = \u22120.52 \u00b1 2.57 seconds for the recognition of gait-adjustment intention; ACC = 80% for the recognition of adjusted gait. Conclusion: The results indicate that it is feasible to decode dynamic gait-adjustment intentions from a motion state for different subjects based on fNIRS technology.

In this work, we assessed a supervised object-based Random Forests classifier on the same scene.

However, such process is done simultaneously on all features and does not explicitly select the features. This paper introduces a new hybrid system R-EDML, combining the sequential decision making of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the evolutionary feature prioritizing process of EDML in clustering. The goal is to create a feature selection control strategy that aims to optimize the input space by reducing the number of selected features while maintaining the clustering performance. This can lead to future data collection time and cost reduction. In the proposed method, features represented by the elements of EDML distance transformation matrices are prioritized by a differential evolution algorithm. Then a selection control strategy using reinforcement learning is learned by sequentially inserting and evaluating the prioritized elements. This process is repeated with the aim to optimize the matrices by filtering the elements used in them. The outcome is the selection of the best R-EDML generation matrices with the least number of elements possible. R-EDML was compared to normal EDML in terms of feature selection and accuracy.

In addition, a focus on prediction accuracy often comes at the cost of slower processing time. This paper focuses on the prediction of future human actions in an intelligent environment with the goal of achieving both high prediction accuracy and response times that are appropriate for a real-time application environment. We performed experiments using the MavPad dataset, which was gathered from a fully-instrumented home environment and compared several different machine learning algorithms that included both single and ensemble classifiers.

Current sequencing technologies have made it possible to compile large amount of cleavage data and brought greater understanding of the underlying protein interactions.

Such methods must be able to quickly mark substrate candidates and putative cleavage sites for further analysis. Available methods and expected reliability depend heavily on the type and complexity of proteolytic action, as well as the availability of well-labelled experimental data sets: factors varying greatly across enzyme families. For this review, we chose to give a quick overview of the general issues and challenges in cleavage prediction methods followed by a more in-depth presentation of major techniques and implementations, with a focus on two particular families of cysteine proteases: caspases and calpains. Through their respective differences in proteolytic specificity (high for caspases, broader for calpains) and data availability (much lower for calpains), we aimed to illustrate the strengths and limitations of techniques ranging from position-based matrices and decision trees to more flexible machine-learning methods such as hidden Markov models and Support Vector Machines.

These techniques utilized color, texture and height from vertical images or range data while oblique images contain facade information that can also be used to identify buildings. This paper presents a methodology to verify 2D building outlines in a cadastral dataset by using oblique airborne images. The method searches for clues such as building edges, wall facade edges and texture. The 2D clues in images taken from different perspectives but expected to contain the same wall are transformed to 3D, combined and used for a verification of the particular wall. Unlike methods that use vertical images or LIDAR, walls are verified individually and then the results are combined for the building. We compare three methods for combining wall-based evidence.

The set of variables which describes each of the clusters is being referred to as a ::: knowledge packet (KP). As histograms have the generic ability to characterize any type of data, a histogram based regression line has been used as one of the variable to describe a KP.

Based on the ratio of the local peripheral heat transfer coefficient at the top and the bottom, the heat transfer data was classified as either forced or mixed convection among the different flow regimes. The forced-mixed convection boundary was then obtained by empirical correlations. From the flow maps, heat transfer correlations for different flow regimes were recommended. Recently Trafalis et al. (2005) used the Multiclass Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to classify vertical and horizontal two-phase flow regimes in 4 pipes with good accuracy. In this study, the SVM method was applied to the single-phase experimental data of Ghajar and Tam (1994) and new flow regime maps were developed. Five flow regimes (forced turbulent, forced transition, mixed transition, forced laminar, mixed laminar) were identified in the flow maps using Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers as the identifying parameters. The flow regimes on the boundaries of the new maps were represented by the SVM decision functions. The results show that the new flow regime maps for the three types of inlets can classify the forced and mixed convection experimental data in different flow regimes with good accuracy.Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/HT2008-56094", "venue": "Heat Transfer: Volume 1", "journal": "Heat Transfer: Volume 1", "mag_id": "2044214833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["125191423", "54701689", "126342324"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:122318679"}

While the first variable is exogenously driven by the environment, the second variable corresponds to the interpretation of the instruction conveyed by the cue; it is endogenously driven and corresponds to the output of internal cognitive operations performed on the visual attributes of the cue.

From the recorded data, blinks are classified from any other type of eye movements using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with different kernel functions. We obtain a maximum average accuracy of 95.83% over all classes and participants using second order polynomial kernel SVM classifier.

Modelling techniques like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MAR Splines), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Automated Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) were used to estimate the function points from the IFPUG data set repository The training and validation data was randomly selected from the data repository. The performance of the various models was analyzed by comparing the observed and predicted function points. The comparison of results on the validation data set of 100 projects indicate that MAR Splines gives the best predicted values for function points as it has the lowest Mean Relative Error (MRE) and highest correlation coefficient. SVM and ANN also gave good results as compared to kNN. MAR Splines is thus a competitive predictive model for estimating function points.

The cell identification stage accurately segments background and noise from foreground pixels. A boundary box is generated enclosing the foreground pixels identifying all isolated cells and cell clusters. The cell classification and inspection stage uses one-dimensional intensity profiles that behave as signature plots to segregate isolated cells from cell clusters and evaluate total count within each cluster. The designed algorithm is tested with a variety of leukemia cell images that vary in image acquisition conditions, image sizes, cell sizes, intensity distributions, and image quality.

We also show that the temporal filtering can be used to generate a 3D map of the broccoli head positions in the field.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IROS.2016.7759121", "venue": "2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)", "journal": "2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2530039282", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16242553", "111170477", "33047064", "62593301", "15911916", "206858048", "112987225", "1766307", "36573762", "17047648", "36044850", "4877695", "18821578", "18899821", "206722232", "206849822", "13250628", "17080437", "1758445", "9494267", "4246903"], "inbound_citations": ["52164359", "199089119", "64723613", "215417104", "49730657", "44501757"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15528585"}

Therefore, it is crucial to propose reliable yet economically efficient new bio-composites. Nano-clays (NCs), short latania fibers (SLFs) and new bio fillers, e.g. pistachio shell powders (PSPs) and date seed powders (DSPs), were used to reinforce poly(propylene)/ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer (PP/EPDM) composites. Heat deflection temperature (HDT) tests were conducted. Then a machine learning (ML)-based prediction tool, the K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNNR), was used to investigate HDTs of various bio-composite compositions. KNNR was employed in this study versus the Decision Tree Regressor (DTR) and Adaptive Boosting Regressor (ABR) ML approaches utilized in the previous study by Daghigh et al. (2019) for fracture toughness predictions. Furthermore, in contrast to other natural fiber composites, SLF composites have been seldom investigated. Different contents of SLFs, NCs, macro-sized PSPs and macro-sized DSPs were added to the PP/EPDM to investigate the combined effects of bio-fiber, nano-particulate, and macro bio-particulate reinforcements. This research helps develop an understanding of how such low-cost bio-reinforcements influence the HDT of PP/EPDM composites. ML predictions were used to develop lightweight, cost-effective materials where their use temperatures can be improved.

In this paper we take the Combinatorial Neural Model (CNM), proposed by Machado and Rocha ([6], [7], and [8]), and explore the adoption of a committee machine to cope with the complexity problem present in this model. In our proposal, a static committee machine is built on a certain number of CNMs. The committee machine takes the discrete outputs from the individual models, and proceeds by choosing the most accurate output using a voting process. Many works has been presented to alleviate the complexity problem in CNM and this one represents an alternative that can be combined with other solutions. The results from the experiments point out that, by means of a committee machine, one can reach a better trade-off between predictive accuracy and complexity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to some well-known data sets from the UCI repository [2].

The great variety of applications of sequential pattern mining, such as user profiling, medicine, local weather forecast and bioinformatics, makes this problem one of the central topics in data mining. Nevertheless, sequential information may concern data on multiple dimensions and, hence, the mining of sequential patterns from multi-dimensional information results very important. In a multi-dimensional sequence each event depends on more than one dimension, such as in spatio-temporal sequences where an event may be spatially or temporally related to other events. In literature, the multi-relational data mining approach has been successfully applied to knowledge discovery fromcomplex data. However, there exists no contribution to manage the general case of multi-dimensional data in which, for example, spatial and temporal information may co-exist. This work takes into account the possibility to mine complex patterns, expressed in a first-order language, in which events may occur along different dimensions. Specifically, multidimensional patterns are defined as a set of atomic first-order formulae in which events are explicitly represented by a variable and the relations between events are represented by a set of dimensional predicates. A complete framework and an Inductive Logic Programming algorithm to tackle this problem are presented along with some experiments on artificial and real multi-dimensional sequences proving its effectiveness.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Fundam.

The method is referred to as Minimum Redundancy \u2013 Maximum Relevance (MRMR). To assess the proposed approach, its performance is evaluated against four scenarios: long window (latest 50 variables), short window (latest 5 variables), standard Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and clear-sky model. All these scenarios are applied to three typical forecasting horizons (15-min ahead, 1-h ahead and 24-h ahead). Based on measured irradiance data from 20 sites representing a variety of climates, the test results reveal that the selection of a good set of relevant variables positively impacts the forecasting performance of global solar radiation.

Using different types of input controls available on the Android platform, we collected interactions from 42 users in five sessions. We created base classifiers from each type of input control and combined them into an ensemble classifier to authenticate and identify users.

SAD is particularly difficult in environments with acoustic noise. A practical solution is to incorporate visual information, increasing the robustness of the SAD approach. An audiovisual system has the advantage of being robust to different speech modes (e.g., whisper speech) or background noise. Recent advances in audiovisual speech processing using deep learning have opened opportunities to capture in a principled way the temporal relationships between acoustic and visual features. This study explores this idea, proposing the bimodal recurrent neural network (BRNN) framework for SAD. The approach models the temporal dynamic of the sequential audiovisual data, improving the accuracy and robustness of the proposed SAD system. Instead of estimating hand-crafted features, the study investigates an end-to-end training approach, where acoustic and visual features are directly learned from the raw data during training. The experimental evaluation considers a large audiovisual corpus with over 60.8 h of recordings, collected from 105 speakers. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to absolute improvements up to 1.2% under practical scenarios over a VAD baseline using only audio implemented with deep neural network (DNN). The proposed approach achieves 92.7% F1-score when it is evaluated using the sensors from a portable tablet under noisy acoustic environment, which is only 1.0% lower than the performance obtained under ideal conditions (e.g., clean speech obtained with a high definition camera and a close-talking microphone).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1809.04553", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.specom.2019.07.003", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2889596223,2965002127", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["19353517", "30547896", "3696964", "16528321", "14677733", "114521105", "19222127", "26930299", "173043", "14957556", "18357707", "2556158", "9328806", "1924061", "16017490", "2309950", "207178999", "352650", "52838186", "10533088", "1736224", "1662180", "11358191", "33070877", "52190563", "37048542", "9901844", "1506905", "11590585", "16979536", "10197738", "8735447", "17904629", "12372962", "5733769", "62713335", "15256166", "15250734", "15875672", "1424061", "14786746", "6466605", "15705375", "6916627", "207763512", "10796944", "16193459", "14212185", "14711886", "17048224", "206741496", "11760007", "15119071", "1033682", "15539264", "608055", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": ["214795312", "214605913", "207909136"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52196241"}

We discuss the relative merits of various automated methods for recognizing G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), a superfamily of cell membrane proteins. GPCRs are found in a wide range of organisms and are central to a cellular signalling network that regulates many basic physiological processes. They are the focus of a significant amount of current pharmaceutical research because they play a key role in many diseases. However, their tertiary structures remain largely unsolved. The methods described in this paper use only primary sequence information to make their predictions. We compare a simple nearest neighbor approach (BLAST), methods based on multiple alignments generated by a statistical profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and methods, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), that transform protein sequences into fixed-length feature vectors. Results: The last is the most computationally expensive method, but our experiments show that, for those interested in annotation-quality classification, the results are worth the effort. In two-fold cross-validation experiments testing recognition of GPCR subfamilies that bind a specific ligand (such as a histamine molecule), the errors per sequence at the Minimum Error Point (MEP) were 13.7% for multi-class SVMs, 17.1% for our SVMtree method of hierarchical multi-class SVM classification, 25.5% for BLAST, 30% for profile HMMs, and 49% for classification based on nearest neighbor feature vector Kernel Nearest Neighbor (kernNN). The percentage of true positives recognized before the first false positive was 65% for both SVM methods, 13% for BLAST, 5% for profile HMMs and 4% for kernNN.

In this article we propose AIDIS, an Advanced Intrusion Detection and Interpretation System capable to explain anomalous behavior within a network-enabled user session by considering kernel event anomalies identified through their deviation from a set of baseline process graphs. For this purpose we adapt star structures, a bipartite representation used to approximate the edit distance between two graphs. Baseline templates are generated automatically and adapt to the nature of the respective operating system process. We prototypically implemented smart anomaly classification through a set of competency questions applied to graph template deviations and evaluated the approach using both Random Forest and linear kernel support vector machines.

The key idea of our approach is to implement the shape representation as a shape-specific global memory that is shared between all local view inter-predictions for each shape. Intuitively, this memory enables the system to aggregate information that is useful to better solve the view inter-prediction tasks for each shape, and to leverage the memory as a viewindependent shape representation.

In the planning-time learning, it firstly models the patient's 3D deformation space from the patient's time-varying 3D planning images using a low-dimensional parametrization. Secondly, it samples deformation parameters within the deformation space and generates corresponding simulated projection images from the deformed 3D image. Finally, it learns a Riemannian metric in the projection space for each deformation parameter. The learned distance metric forms a Gaussian kernel of a kernel regression that minimizes the leave-one-out regression residual of the corresponding deformation parameter. In the registration, REALMS interpolates the patient's 3D deformation parameters using the kernel regression with the learned distance metrics. Our test results showed that REALMS can localize the tumor in 10.89 ms (91.82 fps) with 2.56\u00b11.11 mm errors using a single projection image. These promising results show REALMS's high potential to support real-time, accurate, and low-dose IGRT.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-36620-8_1", "venue": "MCV", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1784553244", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["892582", "14582000", "687042", "23627586", "20199667", "9972996", "8855372", "10350669", "14667431", "861459"], "inbound_citations": ["11568203", "6169433"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15640641"}

The problem of face verification faces many challenges; however, the challenge of progressing age for verification of human faces remains to be the most challenging of all. The work in the field of face verification across age progression is limited and the field requires more attention and research. This work proposes a technique for face verification which can handle large age gaps. The proposed technique extracts Center Symmetric Local Binary Patterns (CSLBP) to represent the features of the face image. CSLBP has been widely used as a texture descriptor in face recognition. The performance of CSLBP features when combined with weighted K-Nearest Neighbor classifier is best when compared with Support Vector Machine and Tree based classifiers.

As the model is a static mapping employing external dynamics and the electricity consumption time-series trend and dynamics are varying with time, further work was carried out in order to test model resetting techniques as a means to update the model over time. In on-line operation, when performing the model reset procedure, it is not possible to employ the same model selection criteria as used in the MOGA identification, which results in the possibility of degraded model performance after the reset operation. This work aims to overcome that undesirable behaviour by means of least-squares support vector machines. Results are presented on the identification of such model by selecting appropriate regression window size and regressor dimension, and on the optimization of the model hyper-parameters. A strategy to update this model over time is also tested and its performance compared to that of the existing neural model.

Nitrogen removal is one of the essential concerns in wastewater treatment. Nitrogen removal is a nonlinear, dynamic, and time variant complex process as complicated activities of microbial metabolism are involved. The mechanistic models for nitrogen removal are complicated and still uncertain to some extent. A new machine learning approach, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was proposed as black-box modeling technique to model the biological wastewater treatment processes. LS-SVM, a simplified formulation of SVM, has been applied in this study to predict the concentration of nitrate and nitrite (NO) in the Mixed Liquor (ML) of wastewater treatment plant. Nonlinear Autoregressive model with Exogenous inputs (NARX model) can be employed with LS-SVM to extract useful information and improve the prediction performance.

The simulation results indicate that the proposed method has good generalization performance, especially when the input is fluctuated without a usual pattern.

Synapse uses incremental learning, rule generation based on bottom-up parsing, and the search for rule sets. The form of production rules in the previous system is extended from Revised Chomsky Normal Form A\u2192\u03b2\u03b3 to Extended Chomsky Normal Form, which also includes A\u2192B, where each of \u03b2 and \u03b3 is either a terminal or nonterminal symbol. From the result of bottom-up parsing, a rule generation mechanism synthesizes minimum production rules required for parsing positive samples. Instead of inductive CYK algorithm in the previous version of Synapse, the improved version uses a novel rule generation method, called ``bridging,'' which bridges the lacked part of the derivation tree for the positive string. The improved version also employs a novel search strategy, called serial search in addition to minimum rule set search. The synthesis of grammars by the serial search is faster than the minimum set search in most cases. On the other hand, the size of the generated CFGs is generally larger than that by the minimum set search, and the system can find no appropriate grammar for some CFL by the serial search.

Further, the reliability indexes of engine systems are computed by the weibull probability paper programmed with Matlab. The results shows that the probability distribution of the forecasting outcomes is consistent to the distribution of the actual data, which all follow weibull distribution and the predictions by SVM and LSSVM can provide accurate predictions of the characteristic life.

We have proven that Linear Discriminant Analysis on a linearly selected set of features also achieves similar accuracies. We perform cross-database experiments and prove that single database experiments were optimistically biased. If enough training data and computational resources are available, SVM's gender classifiers are superior to the rest. When computational resources are scarce but there is enough data, boosting or linear approaches are adequate. Finally, if training data and computational resources are very scarce, then the linear approach is the best choice.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21135443", "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2010.208", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2119486225", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5656478", "819452", "16941488", "14911142", "11962383", "5425332", "6537135", "62359231", "1581217", "122308290", "5523504", "984311", "20484362", "497801", "24625819", "42281583", "394517", "17596655", "30070785", "1378528"], "inbound_citations": ["203574168", "7799894", "9442999", "37395823", "208520552", "3565714", "5683119", "775137", "21509434", "184746559", "4879175", "39570226", "69308591", "123625333", "39978995", "32593108", "11455816", "203838555", "6973", "2100094", "207118592", "198892889", "23019339", "4786416", "16075165", "29843932", "7034138", "2586191", "40705390", "230096", "33128248", "16464837", "15795342", "10891530", "29128657", "12985759", "195774686", "21728953", "17967077", "1533206", "37898200", "16488772", "623327", "3885762", "62598012", "45156377", "4378486", "9369898", "31933368", "14880212", "198981650", "3030416", "825236", "28567461", "15586127", "14050446", "10843897", "14656117", "31679716", "8550074", "22238548", "5121022", "16687750", "18692064", "39745601", "1691529", "25033363", "67485784", "204902623", "17692065", "18295613", "214692001", "13637370", "9498406", "16323278", "16641429", "22507655", "18703449", "15007586", "1428032", "206743429", "14802023", "4775502", "7302141", "38022412", "15824656", "7010463", "207013757", "3162935", "28969808", "34178357", "46638556", "24043957", "7761753", "5987249", "18600985", "1786704", "41971973"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14439267"}

Certain histone modification patterns, distributed over the genome, are connected to cell as well as tissue differentiation and to the adaption of organisms to their environment. Abnormal changes instead influence the development of disease states like cancer. The regulation mechanisms for modifying histones and its functionalities are the subject of epigenomics investigation and are still not completely understood. Text provides a rich resource of knowledge on epigenomics and modifications of histones in particular. It contains information about experimental studies, the conditions used, and results. To our knowledge, no approach has been published so far for identifying histone modifications in text.ResultsWe have developed an approach for identifying histone modifications in biomedical literature with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and for resolving the recognized histone modification term variants by term standardization. For the term identification F1 measures of 0.84 by 10-fold cross-validation on the training corpus and 0.81 on an independent test corpus have been obtained. The standardization enabled the correct transformation of 96% of the terms from training and 98% from test the corpus. Due to the lack of terminologies exhaustively covering specific histone modification types, we developed a histone modification term hierarchy for use in a semantic text retrieval system.ConclusionThe developed approach highly improves the retrieval of articles describing histone modifications.

In this paper, the potential of support vector machine (SVM) based classification approach has been used to assess the liquefaction potential from actual shear wave velocity data. In this approach, an approximate implementation of a structural risk minimization (SRM) induction principle is done, which aims at minimizing a bound on the generalization error of a model rather than minimizing only the mean square error over the data set. Here SVM has been used as a classification tool to predict liquefaction potential of a soil based on shear wave velocity. The dataset consists the information of soil characteristics such as effective vertical stress (sigma'(v0)), soil type, shear wave velocity (V-s) and earthquake parameters such as peak horizontal acceleration (a(max)) and earthquake magnitude (M). Out of the available 186 datasets, 130 are considered for training and remaining 56 are used for testing the model. The study indicated that SVM can successfully model the complex relationship between seismic parameters, soil parameters and the liquefaction potential. In the model based on soil characteristics, the input parameters used are sigma'(v0), soil type. V-s, a(max) and M. In the other model based on shear wave velocity alone uses V-s, a(max) and M as input parameters.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for DNA-binding residue prediction, referred to as EL_LSTM, which includes two main components. The first component is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which learns pairwise relationships between residues through a bi-gram model and then learns feature vectors for all residues. The second component is an ensemble learning based classifier introduced to tackle the data imbalance problem in binding residue predictions. We use a variant of the bagging strategy in ensemble learning to achieve balanced samples. Evaluations on PDNA-224 and DBP-123 show that adding feature relationships performs better than classifiers without feature relationships by at least 0.028 on MCC, 1.18 percent on ST and 0.012 on AUC. This indicates the usefulness of feature relationships for DNA-binding residue predictions.

In this paper, a novel fast and accurate human action descriptor named Kinematic Spline Curves (KSC) is introduced. This descriptor is built by interpolating the kinematics of joints (position, velocity and acceleration).

Local protein structure prediction can be transformed into the multiclass problem for huge datasets. In previous study, multiclass clustering support vector machines (CSVMs) was proposed for local protein structure prediction. The greedy algorithm is utilized to select the next closest class if CSVM modeled for the assigned class predicts the sequence segment as negative. However, the greedy algorithm may not be optimal. If all CSVM predict the sequence segment as negative, this sequence segment cannot be classified. In order to further improve performance of the multiclass problem, we propose fuzzy clustering support vector machines (FCSVMs) in this study. The FCSVMs model calculates the class membership value of the given sequence segment for each class and assigns the representative structure of the finally selected class to the sequence segment. Values of the fuzzy membership function are based on testing accuracy of decision function outputs from FCSVMs. Under this mechanism, values of different fuzzy membership functions can be compared. FCSVMs are built specifically for each class partitioned intelligently by the clustering algorithm. This feature makes learning tasks for each FCSVM more specific and simpler. Furthermore, FCSVM modeled for each class can be easily parallelized to handle the complex multiclass problems for huge datasets.

Their popularisation can largely be attributed to the step-change in performance they brought to pedestrian detection, and their subsequent successes in deformable parts models. This paper explores the interactions that make the HOG-SVM symbiosis perform so well. By connecting the feature extraction and learning processes rather than treating them as disparate plugins, we show that HOG features can be viewed as doing two things: (i) inducing capacity in, and (ii) adding prior to a linear SVM trained on pixels. From this perspective, preserving second-order statistics and locality of interactions are key to good performance.

The objective is to predict whether the percentage of infected coffee leaves (the incidence of the disease) will be above a given threshold. The requirements of such a system include avoiding false negatives, seeing as these would lead to not preventing the disease. The aim of reliable predictions, on the other hand, is to use chemical prevention of the disease only when necessary in order to obtain healthier products and reductions in costs and environmental impact. Although the breadth of the predicted intervals improves the reliability of predictions, it also increases the number of uncertain situations, i.e. those whose predictions include incidences both below and above the threshold.

In order to quantify carbon stock for peatland management and conservation, the knowledge of the spatial distribution of peat and its depth is essential. This paper proposed a cost-effective and accurate methodology for mapping peat depth and carbon stocks in Indonesia. The method, based on the scorpan spatial soil prediction function framework, was tested in Ogan Komering Ilir, South Sumatra and Katingan, Central Kalimantan. A peat hydrological unit, where a peatland is bounded by at least two rivers, is defined as the mapping area or extent. Peat depth is modelled as a function of topography and spatial position. Four machine learning models were evaluated to model and map peat depth: Cubist regression tree, Random Forests (RF), Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Covariates representing topography and spatial position were derived from the 1 arc-second digital elevation model (DEM) of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (resolution of 30.7 m). The spatial models were calibrated from field observations. For model calibration and uncertainty analysis, the k-fold cross validation approach was used. Three models: Cubist, Random Forests, and Quantile Regression Forests models showed excellent accuracies of peat depth prediction for both areas where the coefficient of determination values range from 0.67 to 0.92 and root mean squared error (RMSE) values range from 0.6 to 1.1 m. ANN showed inferior results. In addition, QRF and Cubist showed the best account of the uncertainty of prediction, in terms of percentage of observations that fall within the defined 90% confidence interval. In terms of the best predictor, elevation comes first. Using the spatial prediction functions, peat depth maps along with their 90% confidence interval were generated. The estimated mean carbon stock for Ogan Komering Ilir is 0.474 Gt and for Katingan is 0.123 Gt. Our estimate for Ogan Komering Ilir is twice larger than a previous study because we mapped the peatland hydrological unit, while the previous study only delineated peat domes. Finally, we recommend a sampling method for peat depth mapping using numerical stratification of elevation to cover both the geographical and covariate space. We expect that the combination of an improved sampling strategy, machine learning models, and kriging will increase the accuracy of peat depth mapping.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.02.026", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "2295776121", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["89611408", "189986723", "37142064", "208260913", "92616612", "191163559", "55737589", "52203980", "8433981", "4515625", "103369852", "156044035", "197411143", "44207664", "56481867"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131701334"}

For example, birds (Aves) can be categorized according to a four-level hierarchy of order, family, genus, and species. This hierarchy encodes rich correlations among various categories across different levels, which can effectively regularize the semantic space and thus make prediction less ambiguous. However, previous studies of fine-grained image recognition primarily focus on categories of one certain level and usually overlook this correlation information. In this work, we investigate simultaneously predicting categories of different levels in the hierarchy and integrating this structured correlation information into the deep neural network by developing a novel Hierarchical Semantic Embedding (HSE) framework. Specifically, the HSE framework sequentially predicts the category score vector of each level in the hierarchy, from highest to lowest. At each level, it incorporates the predicted score vector of the higher level as prior knowledge to learn finer-grained feature representation.

Fundus images can be acquired by low-cost and easy access diagnostic systems also in resource limited countries. In this paper, we focus on the segmentation of pigment signs in retinal fundus images, which is an important step in the diagnosis and monitoring of Retinitis Pigmentosa. At present, most of the existing approaches adopted for this purpose are based on the analysis of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data, with only a few algorithms working on fundus images. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a supervised segmentation technique for pigment sign detection in fundus images, which exploits the ensemble classifiers for both bagged and boosted decision trees, namely Random Forests and AdaBoost.M1. The ensemble classifiers are trained on feature vectors encoding the information of a set of regions obtained by partitioning a pre-processed image, so that each region is labeled as either normal fundus or pigment sign.

Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel high-resolution remote sensing image retrieval approach via multiple feature representation and collaborative affinity metric fusion (IRMFRCAMF). In IRMFRCAMF, we design four unsupervised convolutional neural networks with different layers to generate four types of unsupervised features from the fine level to the coarse level. In addition to these four types of unsupervised features, we also implement four traditional feature descriptors, including local binary pattern (LBP), gray level co-occurrence (GLCM), maximal response 8 (MR8), and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). In order to fully incorporate the complementary information among multiple features of one image and the mutual information across auxiliary images in the image dataset, this paper advocates collaborative affinity metric fusion to measure the similarity between images. The performance evaluation of high-resolution remote sensing image retrieval is implemented on two public datasets, the UC Merced (UCM) dataset and the Wuhan University (WH) dataset.

Recent advances in wearable technology have generated comfortable flexible sensors that conform to the contours of the body and can measure heart-rate in the field by capturing QRS complexes of ECG signals. Due to various activities of daily living (ADL), skin deformation by means of lateral, rotational or skin stretching can cause changes in the current pathways of the sensor creating noisy data. The challenge is to disentangle the noise from the usable data in order to accurately detect QRS complexes of ECG signals. In this paper we design a framework to capture noise from a miniaturized flexible sensor, the Biostamp1 (with 4 leads), worn on the chest of 16 participants performing a set of structured ADL in a home setting, and a baseball player (pitcher). We present a machine-learning framework using a consensus fusion classifier comprising a Support Vector Machine and Neural Network learned model to remove noise while preserving neighboring R-peaks. We evaluate the model using Leave One Subject Out (LOSO) and yield an average of 83% F-measure on the 17 participants (including the pitcher). The low false negative rate provides accurate heart-rate detection on a finegrained (every 5 seconds) level, in the presence of intermittent stretching of the skin.

Motivated from Computer Vision, we propose a two-stage approach. The first stage trains a deep network that works as feature extractor and in the second stage, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) are used for classification. The proposed approach outperforms all previously reported structural and deep learning based methods with a final accuracy of 83.24% on Tobacco-3482 dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 25% when compared to a previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach (DeepDocClassifier). More importantly, the training time of the ELM is only 1.176 seconds and the overall prediction time for 2,482 images is 3.066 seconds.

Specimens have to be examined for minor differences of setae compositions, mouthpart morphology or number of segments for various extremities. DNA-based methods such as metabarcoding as well as recently emerged rapid analyses using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify specimens based on a proteome fingerprint could vastly accelerate the process of specimen identification in biodiversity assessments. However, these techniques depend on reference libraries to connect assessed data to morphologically described species. In this study the success rate of both approaches have been tested based on reference libraries constructed using part of the samples from a new study area to identify unknown samples. Using MALDI-TOF MS we found, that species not contained in an incomplete mass spectra reference library only have minor impact on the results, when employing a post hoc test for Random Forest classifications. This test reveals specimens that demand morphological re-examination for the final species assignment. Metabarcoding however strongly demands a rich reference library to provide correct MOTU assessments in congruence with morphological determination. Nevertheless, with a complete library and a suitable data transformation (herein log(x+1)), the number or reads per MOTU reflects relative species abundances in metabarcoding inference. Furthermore, a single gene barcoding approach on selected specimens was performed here in order to provide a cost comparison among the three techniques. The results of this study facilitate specimen identification by using MALDI-TOF MS, which is incomparably cheap for specimen-by-specimen identification, but when it comes to sample wise analyses, metabarcoding outperforms other techniques by far.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3389/fmars.2019.00659", "venue": "Front.

Among them, schools have a pivotal role since, besides energy performance, they have to cope also with high indoor environmental quality requirements. However, the definition of a refurbishment policy for the stock of school buildings presents some criticalities: limited data are often available, comprehensive energy audits are too onerous to apply to each school building, and the findings of many case-studies discussed in the literature can be too specific for a robust generalization. In this context, this work proposes a new integrated method for energy audit on large stocks of existing buildings, avoiding case-by-case analyses and focusing on identifying the most significant retrofit areas and priorities of intervention. This approach, based on the combination of different data mining techniques (i.e., Wrapper Feature Selection, Random Forests, Hierarchical and k-medoids Clustering), is meant to deliver a useful tool for the existing buildings\u2019 stock to professionals and Public Administrations.

However, inaccurate conclusions can be drawn from models with a large degree of uncertainty around multiple parameter estimates if uncertainty is ignored. This is especially true in nonlinear systems with multiple interacting variables. We addressed these issues for a mechanism-based, demographic model of Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood), the dominant riparian tree species along southwestern U.S. rivers. Many cottonwood populations have declined following widespread floodplain conversion and flow regulation. As a result, accurate predictive models are needed to analyze effects of future climate change and water management decisions. To quantify effects of parameter uncertainty, we developed an analytical approach that combines global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with classification and regression trees (CART) and Random Forest, a bootstrapping CART method. We used GSA to quantify the interacting effects of the full range of uncertainty around all parameter estimates, Random Forest to rank parameters according to their total effect on model predictions, and CART to identify higher-order interactions. GSA simulations yielded a wide range of predictions, including annual germination frequency of 10-100%, annual first-year survival frequency of 0-50%, and patch occupancy of 0-100%. This variance was explained primarily by complex interactions among abiotic parameters including capillary fringe height, stage-discharge relationship, and floodplain accretion rate, which interacted with biotic factors to affect survival. Model precision was primarily influenced by well-studied parameter estimates with minimal associated uncertainty and was virtually unaffected by parameter estimates for which there are no available empirical data and thus a large degree of uncertainty. Therefore, research to improve model predictions should not always focus on the least-studied parameters, but rather those to which model predictions are most sensitive. We advocate the combined use of global sensitivity analysis, CART, and Random Forest to: (1) prioritize research efforts by ranking variable importance; (2) efficiently improve models by focusing on the most important parameters; and (3) illuminate complex model properties including nonlinear interactions.

The method consists of a cascade of sliding window detectors. Each detector is a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) composed of HOG features at different resolutions, from coarse at the first level to fine at the last one. In contrast to previous methods, our approach uses a non-uniform stride of the sliding window that is defined by the feature resolution and allows the detection to be incrementally refined as going from coarse-to-fine resolution. In this way, the speed-up of the cascade is not only due to the fewer number of features computed at the first levels of the cascade, but also to the reduced number of windows that need to be evaluated at the coarse resolution.

In order to train a high performance classifier, it is crucial to extract representative features from raw data, such as text and images. In reality, instances could be highly diverse even if they belong to the same class, which indicates different instances of the same class could represent very different characteristics. For example, in a facial expression recognition task, some instances may be better described by Histogram of Oriented Gradients features, while others may be better presented by Local Binary Patterns features. From this point of view, it is necessary to adopt ensemble learning to train different classifiers on different feature sets and to fuse these classifiers towards more accurate classification of each instance. On the other hand, different algorithms are likely to show different suitability for training classifiers on different feature sets. It shows again the necessity to adopt ensemble learning towards advances in the classification performance. Furthermore, a multi-class classification task would become increasingly more complex when the number of classes is increased, i.e. it would lead to the increased difficulty in terms of discriminating different classes. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning framework that involves transforming a multi-class classification task into a number of binary classification tasks and fusion of classifiers trained on different feature sets by using different learning algorithms. We report experimental studies on a UCI data set on Sonar and the CK+ data set on facial expression recognition. The results show that our proposed ensemble learning approach leads to considerable advances in classification performance, in comparison with popular learning approaches including decision tree ensembles and deep neural networks. In practice, the proposed approach can be used effectively to build an ensemble of ensembles acting as a group of expert systems, which show the capability to achieve more stable performance of pattern recognition, in comparison with building a single classifier that acts as a single expert system.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.04.051", "venue": "Expert Syst.

This study presents the concept of an orthogonal\" approach to the identification of gas traces identified as pertinent targets for illicit substances (drugs and explosives) as well as for human presence. The techniques employed to perform the analysis are based on completely different physical principles, these are the Mid-Infrared photo-acoustic spectroscopy (MIR-PAS - demonstration of a novel widely tunable integrated MIR source coupled with a miniature photo-acoustic cell) and the Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) using a non radio-active ionization source. Definition of the pertinent compounds and their \"spectral signature\" (characterized with recording of the vapour phase IR properties via GC-FTIR and GC-MS), lead to a database of the target substances, the IR wavelengths were selected based on the individual target. For the case of human presence, volatile fatty acids (VFA) present in human sweat identified as ideal targets for remote detection of hidden persons, for example some VFAs are human specific, such as HMHA and 3MHA. The aforementioned VFAs are also active in the MIR range. Similarly for the case of the illicit drugs targeting has been based on their emitted VOCs depending on the type of substance (e.g. alkaloid drugs associated with their volatile degradation products etc), during this study, characterization of the cannabis markers lead to the identification of a new marker (under revision for European patent). For explosives substances volatile taggants are mainly associated with VOCs available during their preparation. In total 58 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified in this study as candidates for the detection of Humans (31), Illegal Drugs (19), and Explosives (13). The aforementioned spectral database has been employed for algorithm selection and training, the algorithms used were the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Partial Least Squares--Discrimant Analysis (PLS--DA) and the k--Nearest Neighbour (KNN), the results are very promising reaching levels of matching during training up to 98%. These algorithms will fuse the data collected and analysed by the two powerful techniques selected as the components of this \u00ab orthogonal \u00bb approach to the detection of the aforementioned gas traces. Target specific cavitand receptors were developed for the pre-concentrator procedure that increase the concentration of the gas trace in quest. During this work, improvement to the pre-concentration configuration has reduced the required time for the pre-concentration procedure significantly (10s of seconds compared to several minutes), this is part of the novelties developed during this study. IMS studies for detection of human presence has shown very promising results, recording levels of human specific gas traces after 15 minutes of a human present in an area of 50m3. This is very important considering that in most cases the people illegaly immigrating are confined in much smaller spaces and for very much longer periods (most of the times are more than one person too) which leads to increased concentration and abundance of the related VOCs hence, the instrument will definetely perform better.

However, many reviews that spread across forums or social media are written in plain text, which is not rated, and these reviews are called non-rated reviews in this paper. From the perspective of sentiment analysis at the aspects level, this study develops a predictive framework for calculating ratings for non-rated reviews. The idea behind the framework began with an observation: the sentiment of an aspect is determined by its context; the rating of the review depends on the sentiment of the aspects and the number of positive and negative aspects in the review. Viewing term pairs that co-occur with aspects as their context, we conceived of a variant of a Conditional Random Field model, called SentiCRF, for generating term pairs and calculating their sentiment scores from a training set. Then, we developed a cumulative logit model that uses aspects and their sentiments in a review to predict the ratings of the review. In addition, we met the challenge of class imbalance when calculating the sentiment scores of term pairs. We also conceived of a heuristic re-sampling algorithm to tackle class imbalance.

The rapid increase in population in the world has propelled pressure on arable land. Consequently, the food basket has continuously declined while global demand for food has grown twofold. There is need to monitor and update agriculture land-cover to support food security measures. This study develops a spatial-temporal approach using conditional random fields (CRF) to classify co-registered images acquired in two epochs. We adopt random forest (RF) as CRF association potential and introduce a temporal potential for mutual crop phenology information exchange between spatially corresponding sites in two epochs. An important component of temporal potential is a transitional matrix that bears intra- and inter-class changes between considered epochs. Conventionally, one matrix has been used in the entire image thereby enforcing stationary transition probabilities in all sites. We introduce a site dependent transition matrix to incorporate phenology information from images. In our study, images are acquired within a vegetation season, thus perceived spectral changes are due to crop phenology. To exploit this phenomena, we develop a novel approach to determine site-wise transition matrix using conditional probabilities computed from two corresponding temporal sites. Conditional probability determines transitions between classes in different epochs and thus we used it to propagate crop phenology information.

To understand the coding mechanisms of these attributes in the brain, and the functional organization of the early visual cortices, it is necessary to determine whether different attributes are represented by different compartments within each cortex. Previous studies addressing this question have focused on the information encoded by the response amplitude of individual neurons or cortical columns, and have reached conflicting conclusions. Given the correlated variability in response amplitude across neighboring columns, it is likely that the spatial pattern of responses across these columns encodes the attribute information more reliably than does the response amplitude. Here we present a new method of mapping the spatial distribution of information that is encoded by both the response amplitude and the spatial pattern. This new method is based on a statistical learning approach, the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Application of this new method to our optical imaging data suggests that information about stimulus orientation and color are distributed differently in the striate cortex, and this observation is consistent with the hypothesis of segregated representations of orientation and color in this area.

A sequential search approach which is in principle similar to the \"plus L and take away R\" algorithm is then applied in order to find an optimum subset of the adopted classifiers. The selected classifiers are combined using the SVM classifier. We show that although, individually, one of the adopted scoring functions, the Gradient Direction distance outperforms the other metrics, by fusing different similarity measures using the proposed method, the resulting decision making scheme improves the performance of the system in different conditions.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-89689-0_52", "venue": "SSPR/SPR", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1520646499", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["7162387", "17634672", "32460389"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9074746"}

Thus, the model learns perceptually grounded semantics for natural language spatial terms. ::: Natural languages differ--sometimes dramatically--in the ways in which they structure space. The aim here has been to have the model be able to perform this learning task for terms from any natural language, and to have learning take place in the absence of explicit negative evidence, in order to rule out ad hoc solutions and to approximate the conditions under which children learn. ::: The central focus of this thesis is a connectionist system which has succeeded in learning spatial terms from a number of different languages. The design and construction of this system have resulted in several technical contributions. The first is a very simple but effective means of learning without explicit negative evidence, taking positive instances of other concepts as implicit negative instances of the concept being learned, and deliberately weakening the evidence from these implicit negatives so as to reduce the effect of false implicit negatives in cases where concepts overlap. This method is shown to be effective even in situations involving a high degree of overlap among concepts. In addition, this thesis presents the notion of partially-structured connectionism, a marriage of structured and unstructured network design techniques capturing the flexibility afforded by unstructured networks, and the tractability in learning and improved generalization ability that result from highly structured network design. Finally, the idea of learning within highly specialized structural devices is introduced, with the purpose of restricting the search during learning to a set of options known in advance to be of possible relevance. ::: Scientifically, the primary result of the work described here is a computational model of the acquisition of visually grounded semantics. This model is shown to successfully learn terms for spatial events and relations from a range of languages with widely differing spatial systems, including English, Mixtec (a Mexican Indian language), German, Bengali, and Russian. The model exhibits prototype effects which roughly match human intuitions, and extensions to the core system model the linguistic phenomena of polysemy and deixis. While no claims are made regarding structure-to-structure correspondences between architectural elements of the model and structures in the brain, the model is informed by a number of neuroscientific results. And perhaps most importantly, the model does more than just recapitulate the data; it also generates a number of falsifiable linguistic predictions regarding the sorts of semantic features, and combinations of features, one might expect to find in lexemes for spatial events and relations in the world's natural languages.", "year": 1992, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1239985160", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9325794", "265475", "13982141", "7371049", "6720165", "9164308", "1112564", "276090", "16204864", "16302523", "18118134", "16014185", "5873578", "52989089", "202599232", "8510615", "16197115", "12098732", "46979168", "56103895", "15905139", "16703251", "14822876", "16546207", "12770018", "14876832", "10707474", "17856074", "7029186", "7596863", "16695665", "8477711", "17375441", "6539300", "15915350", "16048387", "2450131"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53881542"}

We aimed to identify a serum miRNA signature to be used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). To account for variations due to the genetic makeup, we enrolled adults from two study settings in Europe and Africa. The following categories of subjects were considered: healthy (H), active pulmonary TB (PTB), active pulmonary TB, HIV co-infected (PTB/HIV), latent TB infection (LTBI), other pulmonary infections (OPI), and active extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB). Sera from 10 subjects of the same category were pooled and, after total RNA extraction, screened for miRNA levels by TaqMan low-density arrays. After identification of \"relevant miRNAs\", we refined the serum miRNA signature discriminating between H and PTB on individual subjects. Signatures were analyzed for their diagnostic performances using a multivariate logistic model and a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model. A leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) approach was adopted for assessing how both models could perform in practice. The analysis on pooled specimens identified selected miRNAs as discriminatory for the categories analyzed. On individual serum samples, we showed that 15 miRNAs serve as signature for H and PTB categories with a diagnostic accuracy of 82% (CI 70.2-90.0), and 77% (CI 64.2-85.9) in a RVM and a logistic classification model, respectively.

The recent advancements offered by deep learning based data-driven approaches for solving inverse problems in biomedical imaging have led to the development of an alternative method for producing high-quality reconstructed images from low-dose CT data. While most of the reconstruction approaches tackle the problem from a post-processing perspective, in this paper, inspired by the idea of unfolding a proximal gradient descent optimization algorithm to finite iterations, and replacing the proximal terms with trainable deep artificial neural networks, we propose an end-to-end solution for reconstructing full-dose tomographic images directly from low-dose measurements. The framework is designed to encapsulate the knowledge of the physical model of CT image formation, and to produce high-quality images that account for human perception through a Generative Adversarial Network with Wasserstein distance and a contextual loss. The proposed method was validated on a clinical dataset, and promising results have been obtained compared to the state-of-the-art mean-squared-error (MSE) based learned iterative reconstruction approach, while also maintaining a runtime suitable for a routine clinical setting.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSTCC.2019.8885947", "venue": "2019 23rd International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)", "journal": "2019 23rd International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2982303615", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2088679", "206491372", "116792670", "206015357", "211227", "1900475", "10514149", "996788", "6200260", "52305483", "2286534", "3964805", "47477094", "46931303", "46752523", "122487", "26897002", "2920686", "46935914", "5334482", "980236", "10894094", "14124313", "5575601", "6287870", "15030358", "67856447"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207829421"}

During the process of the forecast, firstly the model group fits several single forecast approaches are used to form a model group, and a set of data in time sequence. Secondly, the fitted results by different traditional predictive models in time sequence act as the input of the support vector machine regression (SVMR) model, and the changeable weights of the input quantities, which are the important part of the combinational SVMR prediction model, can be obtained by relative SVMR approach based on known input and output samples. Several single prediction approaches are used to build first model group. Then the prediction results of the first model group constitute a multi-dimension vector and act as the input sample of Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. In the paper, the procedure of the combinational prediction based on SVMR is discussed in details. Two examples in time sequence have proven that the proposed model can balance fitting and extrapolation, and make a break through the traditional prediction rules.

Second, they fall short of capturing the concepts of repetition and musical form. In this paper we introduce the recurrent gated autoencoder (RGAE), a recurrent neural network which learns and operates on interval representations of musical sequences. The relative pitch modeling increases generalization and reduces sparsity in the input data. Furthermore, it can learn sequences of copy-and-shift operations (i.e. chromatically transposed copies of musical fragments)---a promising capability for learning musical repetition structure. We show that the RGAE improves the state of the art for general connectionist sequence models in learning to predict monophonic melodies, and that ensembles of relative and absolute music processing models improve the results appreciably. Furthermore, we show that the relative pitch processing of the RGAE naturally facilitates the learning and the generation of sequences of copy-and-shift operations, wherefore the RGAE greatly outperforms a common absolute pitch recurrent neural network on this task.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1806.08686", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2954351205,2886204396", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["65195803", "5201925", "15061411", "124017879", "15858781", "38285817", "21312646", "52204935", "4867172", "49340530", "12589862", "12041147", "19010971", "7778133", "1413690", "6528211", "31333145", "16539702", "56105491", "15999065", "8435923", "17804904"], "inbound_citations": ["49340530", "199405587", "195776369"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49391876"}

However, the conventional literature is usually too focused on only describing the forward input-output transform. Instead, in this work we present the mathematics of such cascades beyond the forward transform, namely the Jacobian matrices and the inverse. The fundamental reason for this analytical treatment is that it offers useful analytical insight into the psychophysics, the physiology, and the function of the visual system. For instance, we show how the trends of the sensitivity (volume of the discrimination regions) and the adaptation of the receptive fields can be identified in the expression of the Jacobian w.r.t. the stimulus. This matrix also tells us which regions of the stimulus space are encoded more efficiently in multi-information terms. The Jacobian w.r.t. the parameters shows which aspects of the model have bigger impact in the response, and hence their relative relevance. The analytic inverse implies conditions for the response and model parameters to ensure appropriate decoding. From the experimental and applied perspective, (a) the Jacobian w.r.t. the stimulus is necessary in new experimental methods based on the synthesis of visual stimuli with interesting geometrical properties, (b) the Jacobian matrices w.r.t. the parameters are convenient to learn the model from classical experiments or alternative goal optimization, and (c) the inverse is a promising model-based alternative to blind machine-learning methods for neural decoding that do not include meaningful biological information. The theory is checked by building and testing a vision model that actually follows a modular Linear+Nonlinear program. Our illustrative derivable and invertible model consists of a cascade of modules that account for brightness, contrast, energy masking, and wavelet masking. To stress the generality of this modular setting we show examples where some of the canonical Divisive Normalization modules are substituted by equivalent modules such as the Wilson-Cowan interaction model (at the V1 cortex) or a tone-mapping model (at the retina).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.00526", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6188639", "pubmed_id": "30321175", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0201326", "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Neurons and Cognition", "mag_id": "2765407761,2953293913", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208617861", "56179094", "195069286", "198986146", "203641840", "195353519", "4898208", "3727282", "53783152", "204575950", "204907395", "198184617"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19464042"}

Although many methods have been developed for protein fold recognition, their accuracies remain low.

Since protein fold recognition can be treated as a protein fold classification problem, we have developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier approach that uses secondary structural state and solvent accessibility state frequencies of amino acids and amino acid pairs as feature vectors. Among the individual properties examined secondary structural state frequencies of amino acids gave an overall accuracy of 65.2% for fold discrimination, which is better than the accuracy by any method reported so far in the literature. Combination of secondary structural state frequencies with solvent accessibility state frequencies of amino acids and amino acid pairs further improved the fold discrimination accuracy to more than 70%, which is ~8% higher than the best available method. In this study we have also tested, for the first time, an all-together multi-class method known as Crammer and Singer method for protein fold classification. Our studies reveal that the three multi-class classification methods, namely one versus all, one versus one and Crammer and Singer method, yield similar predictions. ::: ::: Availability: Dataset and stand-alone program are available upon request. ::: ::: Contact: [email protected] ::: ::: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17989092", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btm527", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2118347512", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9790719", "1591646", "961425", "1077643", "765861", "5934464", "5779282", "11220462", "14718430", "7025749", "14561315", "9284698", "57961414", "6869184", "13742986", "35392780", "9728696", "11983482", "7138354", "62686094"], "inbound_citations": ["22495109", "61717673", "15091249", "4614847", "2970096", "7674124", "1328871", "11148533", "1075340", "14130522", "23316796", "6644489", "7227779", "16709818", "14337765", "17730248", "17390363", "1101053", "15764584", "214884826", "8469410", "2144875", "17743331", "733659", "2270087", "44353739", "6190570", "201060406", "6555149", "17526064", "14366267", "15707135", "25146865", "1130090", "13421613", "1980244", "29874469"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:580801"}

The very well-known applications are safety-health, security, entertainment and billing. Numerous data mining and machine learning algorithms have been proposed for such issue. Equally, many technologies could be used to observe the people activities to identify their gender and activities. However, the existing solutions and applications suffer from privacy and cost to deploy the solution and their obtained accuracy. For example, when the CCTV camera or Kinect sensors technology are used to identify people, such technologies will violate the privacy since most of the people do not want to take their pictures or videos during their daily activities. Therefore, to tackle such issue, this paper presents a new scheme to identify the gender of the people via onboard Smartphone sensors including accelerometer sensor. Such a scheme requires little interaction with the people; individuals would simply have to hold his/her smartphone and walk normally. Four different data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms are used to identify people gender including: Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Deep learning algorithm (recurrent-neural-network long-short-term-memory \u2018RNN-LSTM\u2019). Further, a set of experiments are conducted via Android-based smartphones (to read smartphone accelerometer sensor) and MATALB-2018a packages used to perform the validity of the scheme.

The experimental study was carried on a real-time dataset with diverse tumor sizes, locations, shapes, and different image intensities.

Each of the n(n-1)/2 classifiers was trained using only training cases from two classes at a time. The ensemble was then combined by majority voting. The second strategy was a one-against-all binary approach: if there are n classes, with a = {1,..., n} being one of the classes, then n classifiers were generated, each representing a binary classification of a and non-a. The ensemble was combined using accuracy estimates obtained for each class.

Two multi-source data sets were used: one was prepared for an object-based classification and one for a conventional pixel-based approach.

However, the imbalanced ratio of a large number of variables to a limited sample size in radiation oncology constitutes a major challenge. Therefore, dimensionality reduction methods can be a key to success. The study investigates and contrasts the application of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning approaches for outcome modeling in radiotherapy. In particular, new joint architectures based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for dimensionality reduction are presented and their application is demonstrated for the prediction of lung radiation pneumonitis (RP) from a large-scale heterogeneous dataset. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: A large-scale heterogeneous dataset containing a pool of 230 variables including clinical factors (e.g., dose, KPS, stage) and biomarkers (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), cytokines, and micro-RNAs) in a population of 106 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received radiotherapy was used for modeling RP. Twenty-two patients had grade 2 or higher RP. Four methods were investigated, including feature selection (case A) and feature extraction (case B) with traditional machine learning methods, a VAE-MLP joint architecture (case C) with deep learning and lastly, the combination of feature selection and joint architecture (case D). For feature selection, Random forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were implemented to select relevant features. Specifically, each method was run for multiple times to rank features within several cross-validated (CV) resampled sets. A collection of ranking lists were then aggregated by top 5% and Kemeny graph methods to identify the final ranking for prediction. A synthetic minority oversampling technique was applied to correct for class imbalance during this process. For deep learning, a VAE-MLP joint architecture where a VAE aimed for dimensionality reduction and an MLP aimed for classification was developed. In this architecture, reconstruction loss and prediction loss were combined into a single loss function to realize simultaneous training and weights were assigned to different classes to mitigate class imbalance. To evaluate the prediction performance and conduct comparisons, the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were performed for nested CVs for both handcrafted feature selections and the deep learning approach. The significance of differences in AUCs was assessed using the DeLong test of U-statistics. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: An MLP-based method using weight pruning (WP) feature selection yielded the best performance among the different hand-crafted feature selection methods (case A), reaching an AUC of 0.804 (95% CI: 0.761-0.823) with 29 top features. A VAE-MLP joint architecture (case C) achieved a comparable but slightly lower AUC of 0.781 (95% CI: 0.737-0.808) with the size of latent dimension being 2. The combination of handcrafted features (case A) and latent representation (case D) achieved a significant AUC improvement of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.805-0.863) with 22 features (P-value = 0.000642 compared with handcrafted features only (Case A) and P-value = 0.000453 compared to VAE alone (Case C)) with an MLP classifier. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The potential for combination of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning VAE techniques has been demonstrated for dealing with limited datasets in modeling radiotherapy toxicities.

The latter is the focus of fields such as biogeography and conservation biogeography when applied to inform conservation decision-making. The distribution of a species will be influenced by innumerable factors, from large-scale processes such as dispersal and migration, to the local variability in environmental parameters, inter- and intra-specific interactions and ultimately the effect and intensity of natural and human-induced changes. In the marine realm, currents and wind promote connectivity among sometimes far-spread habitats. While large physical barriers are limited, the distribution of marine species is often influenced by physic-chemical barriers (i.e. thermoclines, photic zone). As a result, marine habitats tend to be highly dynamic in time and space, which in turn influences the diversity and distribution of marine species. ::: ::: In tropical environments and in particular in the tropical shallow waters of the Indo-West Pacific region, habitats are characterised by very high diversity of species with relatively broad geographic ranges. This is particularly true for migratory marine megafauna, such as whales and marine turtles, which can distribute across 100 to 1000s of km. Such large-scale movements pose a great challenge to monitor their movements and identify habitats used by the populations. However, the advancement of tracking technologies (i.e. acoustic and satellite tracking), animal borne-videos, accelerometers and molecular techniques such as stable isotope analysis, have enabled great advances in the understanding of marine megafauna biogeography. ::: ::: The general biogeography of marine turtles has been extensively studied worldwide. The distribution of nesting grounds of all marine turtle species is very well described, and while less is known on their foraging distribution and ecology, there is still an extensive body of work in this field. As migratory species, marine turtles make use of a great variety of coastal and oceanic habitats throughout their life, which vary between and among species and populations. Ontogenic, seasonal and reproductive changes in habitat use have been widely described, and are a common feature in all species. In general, biogeography of marine turtles is influenced by local and oceanic currents, distribution and abundance of prey, presence of predators, availability of shelters and seasonal shifts in water parameters (i.e. temperature). Nevertheless, improving the knowledge on biogeography of local populations, especially on the distribution of non-reproductive turtles, is still one of the global research priorities for marine turtles. ::: ::: In Australia, the foraging distribution and ecology of green, loggerhead and hawksbill turtles has been well described, because these species inhabit shallow coastal habitats, typically with clear water and relatively easy access for research. In contrast, knowledge on the foraging ecology of leatherback, olive ridley and flatback turtles in Australia is limited. Some aspects of the foraging ecology of leatherback and olive ridley turtles can be inferred from studies on other populations in the world, and recent advances have been published on the migration and foraging distribution for flatback turtles in Western Australia. In my thesis, I provide new and novel information on the distribution of non-reproductive flatback turtles in eastern Australia. In particular, the aim of my thesis was to improve our understanding of the biogeography and ecology of flatback turtle across different life-stages, with the intention to generate scientific information to improve the state of knowledge of the species and provide relevant outputs to inform management actions for conservation. ::: ::: First, in Chapter 2, I assessed a key process in understanding the biogeography of marine turtles: the early dispersal of post-hatchlings. In particular, I examined the potential mechanisms that underpins the neritic dispersal of post-hatchlings flatback turtles. Long-term records of post-hatchling flatback turtles are evidence of the neritic dispersal of the species, and studies on hatchling swimming behaviour and particle simulation have provided insights on the evolutionary adaptations of this species to turbid coastal waters. To explain the lack of oceanic dispersal of this species, I employed a hydrodynamic advection-diffusion model (called SLIM) to simulate the dispersal of virtual post-hatchlings under different scenarios of passive drift and active swimming behaviour. The results of my simulations suggest that, under the conditions I tested, the retention of flatback turtles in neritic waters of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) depends on three main factors: (a) the location of the nesting beaches: flatback turtles nest in inshore islands and mainland of eastern Queensland; (b) the local currents, wind-driven waves and the tidal phase when post-hatchlings were released; and (c) swimming behaviour of post-hatchlings, with higher swimming effort dispersing turtles into neritic habitats of the GBR. In this chapter, I also provide future directions for research in the area of early dispersal of marine turtles, and potential approaches to test the cues that induce directional swimming in marine turtles. ::: ::: Next, in chapters 3 and 4, I examined two other key biogeographical processes: migration and habitat use of foraging adult turtles. Chapter 3 focused on describing the spatial distribution of 44 flatback turtles tracked with high accuracy GPS-linked satellite tags, from eight different nesting beaches to their respective foraging grounds. Home ranges of flatback turtles in eastern Australia were relatively larger than other coastal marine turtle species in the region. I also describe common patterns in the migratory and foraging strategies displayed by the tracked turtles. In this sense, flatback turtles in eastern Australia displayed direct and multi-stop migrations, and flexible and dynamic foraging behaviour (i.e. using more than one foraging ground). ::: ::: To supplement the understanding of the spatial ecology of foraging turtles, in Chapter 4 I further examined the distribution of the tracked turtles in relation to the environmental parameters of the seabed habitats which they inhabit. Such studies are not common in marine environments, given the challenge that represents comprehensively surveying the habitat used by individuals. However, data on the biotic (prey) and abiotic characteristics of the seabed habitats used by flatback turtles in the Great Barrier Reef were available and accessible through the GBR Seabed Biodiversity Project. Employing a Random Forest analysis, I was able to assess how the tracked turtles respond to abiotic parameters in the environment, as well as to the distribution and abundance of potential prey groups. The results confirm that flatback turtles inhabit inshore subtidal habitats, with a preference for mud-rich inshore environments. In addition, the tracked flatback turtles were associated with distribution of soft-bodied invertebrates such as sea pens and soft corals; however, flatback turtles might as well be associated with a wider variety of benthic prey than previously reported. The flexibility observed in foraging behaviour, combined with the large size of home ranges and the association of the tracked turtles to multiple habitat types and prey items suggest that flatback turtles in eastern Australia are generalist and opportunistic feeders. Nevertheless, some turtles displayed high affinity for just one of the three habitat types, which might suggest some degree of individual specialisation within the population, a hypothesis that warrants further research. ::: ::: Finally, in chapter 5 focused on quantifying the exposure of flatback turtles to different threats and the level of protection in their foraging habitats within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). To achieve this, I performed a spatial analysis overlapping the foraging area identified for the tracked flatback turtles (Chapter 3) with the distribution of marine protected areas, as well as with two potential threats known to occur in the GBRMP, shipping and trawling. I also considered the cumulative exposure of flatback turtles to the combined threats. The results indicate that half (52.2%) of the foraging area of the tracked turtles is within a marine protected area, 47.3% was located in \"General Use\" areas, and 0.5% were located within ports. In addition, the overall exposure of the tracked turtles to the individual and cumulative effect of shipping and trawling was low, with some foraging locations in the northern section of the GBRMP displaying medium exposure to the threats. I strongly suggest that future research should aim to include the synergistic effect of threats, and include other human-related stressors, such as water quality and marine debris. ::: ::: Overall, my thesis provides detailed and novel information which improves the knowledge base on the spatial distribution of flatback turtles in eastern Australia, including aspects on their dispersal, migratory and foraging behaviour and ecology. My thesis is relevant to several priority action areas required to maintain/recover the eastern Australia flatback stock. In this sense, I have already been able to provide copies of my data, shapefiles and written work to the GBR Marine Park Authority and the Australian Government and my data has informed the revised Marine Turtle Recovery Plan 2017. In conclusion, my study provides a comprehensive baseline on the spatial and movement ecology of flatback turtles at sea, and will hopefully provide the guidelines to address further gaps that need to be addressed to gain a better understanding of the status, vulnerability and adaptive capacity of flatbacks of the eAus stock.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4225/28/5ac5863ce1106", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2801764571", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210702113"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133772109"}

A number of data sources appropriate for land-cover extraction are available.

Over the past two decades, various classification techniques have been developed to extract land-cover features from UAV images, and object-based image analysis OBIA is the preferred technique based on the recent literature. This study presents a novel method that integrates the fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm FURIA into OBIA to achieve accurate land-cover extraction from UAV images. The images were segmented using a multiresolution segmentation algorithm with an optimized scale parameter. The scale parameter was optimized using a novel approach that integrated feature space optimization into the plateau objective function. During the classification stage, significant features were selected via random forest, and rule sets were developed using FURIA. For comparison, result of the proposed approach was compared with those of decision tree DT rules and the Support Vector Machine SVM classification method. The results of this study indicate that the proposed method outperforms DT and SVM with an overall accuracy of 91.23%.

A core issue in transfer learning is to learn a shared feature space in where the distributions of the data from two domains are matched. This learning process can be named as transfer representation learning (TRL). The feature transformation methods are crucial to ensure the success of TRL. The most commonly used feature transformation method in TRL is kernel-based nonlinear mapping to the high-dimensional space followed by linear dimensionality reduction. But the kernel functions are lack of interpretability and are difficult to be selected. To this end, the TSK fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is combined with transfer learning and a more intuitive and interpretable modeling method, called transfer representation learning with TSK-FS (TRL-TSK-FS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, TRL-TSK-FS realizes TRL from two aspects. On one hand, the data in the source and target domains are transformed into the fuzzy feature space in which the distribution distance of the data between two domains is min-imized. On the other hand, discriminant information and geo-metric properties of the data are preserved by linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. In addition, another advantage arises with the proposed method, that is, the nonlinear transformation is realized by constructing fuzzy mapping with the antecedent part of the TSK-FS instead of kernel functions which are difficult to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted on the text and image datasets. The results obviously show the superiority of the proposed method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1901.02703", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2909490525", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["47588", "18121764", "740063", "3654323", "740063", "556999", "407822", "14739721", "4964135", "7263397", "62354027", "10301285", "788838", "1990988", "13798326", "7923833", "44184967", "11015430", "17869017", "8083835", "34670062", "10385189", "23483527", "30862082", "32143103", "59600368", "6953522", "9440223", "14312839", "8548594", "3333100", "22479593", "41449734", "51610779", "51612227", "6742009", "118828957", "14777911", "10900465", "17105302", "2407601", "3077600", "206769089", "10726702"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57759374"}

Besides that, it can't rank the importance of factors. Aiming at the above shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel approach to analyze the influencing factors of online learning, which is based on the combination of decision tree and recursive feature elimination. Firstly, the feature sorting algorithm is based on decision tree to conduct the preliminary screening, which is to form a candidate feature set. Then, recursive feature elimination is used to rank the candidate features by their importance. At this stage, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) models are used separately to obtain each collating sequence of importance. By averaging these collating sequences, the final importance ranking of candidate features is achieved.

To this extend, the paper reviewed different literature to understand the challenges and opportunities of employing big data in DDoS forensics. Multiple simulations were carried out to compare the performance of different models. Two data mining tools WEKA and H2O were used to implement both supervised and unsupervised learning models. The training and testing of the models made use of intrusion dataset from oN-Line System - Knowledge Discovery & Data mining (NSL-KDD). The models are then evaluated according to their efficiency and accuracy. Overall, result shows that supervised learning algorithms perform better than unsupervised learning algorithms. It was found that Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting Machine and Distributed Random Forest are the most suitable model for DDoS detection because of its accuracy and time taken to train.

Both directly applying a learned algorithm or retraining the algorithm on your rather small database is suboptimal. And definitely state-of-the-art sleep staging algorithms based on deep neural networks demand a large amount of data to be trained. This work presents a deep transfer learning approach to overcome the channel mismatch problem and enable transferring knowledge from a large dataset to a small cohort for automatic sleep staging. We start from a generic end-to-end deep learning framework for sequence-to-sequence sleep staging and derive two networks adhering to this framework as a device for transfer learning. The networks are first trained in the source domain (i.e. the large database). The pretrained networks are then finetuned in the target domain, i.e. the small cohort, to complete knowledge transfer. We employ the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) database consisting of 200 subjects as the source domain and study deep transfer learning on four different target domains: the Sleep Cassette subset and the Sleep Telemetry subset of the Sleep-EDF Expanded database, the Surrey-cEEGGrid database, and the Surrey-PSG database. The target domains are purposely adopted to cover different degrees of channel mismatch to the source domain.

Environmental audio scene recognition (EASR) and sound event recognition (SER) for audio surveillance are challenging tasks due to the presence of multiple sound sources, background noises, and the existence of overlapping or polyphonic contexts. We focus on learning robust and compact representations for environmental audio scenes and sound events using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients as basic features, which have proved to be effective in speech and audio-related tasks. In this paper, we propose a common hybrid model-based framework that learns representations with the help of generative models. We explore instance-specific adapted Gaussian mixture models for environmental audio scenes and instance-specific hidden Markov models for sound events to compute a robust, compact, and discriminatory representations. A discriminative model based classifier is then used to recognize these representations as environmental audio scenes and sound events. The performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated using the DCASE2013 scene dataset and TUT-DCASE2016 scene dataset for EASR task. Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-10) and UrbanSound8K datasets are used for SER task. The recognition accuracy of the proposed framework is significantly better than many of the state-of-the-art approaches proposed in the recent literature.

To further improve personalized stroke care, it is essential to accurately predict outcome after EVT.

Methods: We included patients from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) Registry, an observational cohort of LVO patients treated with EVT. We applied the following machine learning algorithms: Random Forests, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Super Learner and compared their predictive value with classic logistic regression models using various variable selection methodologies. Outcome variables were good reperfusion (post-mTICI \u2265 2b) and functional independence (modified Rankin Scale \u22642) at 3 months using (1) only baseline variables and (2) baseline and treatment variables. Area under the ROC-curves (AUC) and difference of mean AUC between the models were assessed. Results: We included 1,383 EVT patients, with good reperfusion in 531 (38%) and functional independence in 525 (38%) patients. Machine learning and logistic regression models all performed poorly in predicting good reperfusion (range mean AUC: 0.53-0.57), and moderately in predicting 3-months functional independence (range mean AUC: 0.77-0.79) using only baseline variables. All models performed well in predicting 3-months functional independence using both baseline and treatment variables (range mean AUC: 0.88-0.91) with a negligible difference of mean AUC (0.01; 95%CI: 0.00-0.01) between best performing machine learning algorithm (Random Forests) and best performing logistic regression model (based on prior knowledge).

Hence, the development of efficient spatial\u2013spectral feature extraction (FE) techniques is very crucial for a proper characterization of the objects on ground. In this paper, an attempt has been made to develop a simple, yet effective spatial\u2013spectral FE algorithm. In the proposed approach, the following steps are performed. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied on the original hyperspectral image (HSI) and the most significant principal component was extracted. Then, the Bilateral Filter (BF), which acts as an edge-preserving filter, was applied on the selected principal component to extract kernel for each pixel in HSI. The extracted kernel bank is then applied on the original HSI. As in general, the principal component image is edge informative, and the BF is an edge-preserving filter; therefore, the extracted kernel bank can be applied on the original HSI to extract spatial\u2013spectral features. Finally, with the help of these features, the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is evaluated. The proposed approach is validated on three popular hyperspectral data sets, namely, Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Botswana. The experimental results reveal that learning the edge information from a reference image (in the present context PCA) is quite essential, rather than applying the edge-preserving filters directly on the HSI. Theoretically, this holds true, as a unique edge (ground) information exists for an HSI, while in reality, the edges have variations due to variation in reflectance over bands.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s41064-019-00078-9", "venue": "PFG \u2013 Journal of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Geoinformation Science", "journal": "PFG \u2013 Journal of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Geoinformation Science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2971811741", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17649981", "7443466", "961425", "65182992", "16744513", "25786794", "28323652", "4630521", "4634412", "21834013", "202503", "21226851", "6869596", "62165049", "14293639", "8587614", "123802210", "6906514", "17548187", "125048377", "14308539", "63520398"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201839140"}

Saccade rate, saccadic duration, and saccade amplitude were picked as parameters and Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied on eye movements to build classifiers.

In this work, we constructed a high-quality structural dataset that contained 679 high-quality protein structures with 2,048 SAVs by collecting the human genetic variant data from multiple resources and dividing them into two categories, i.e., disease-associated and neutral variants. We built a two-stage random forest (RF) model, termed as FunSAV, to predict the functional effect of SAVs by combining sequence, structure and residue-contact network features with other additional features that were not explored in previous studies. Importantly, a two-step feature selection procedure was proposed to select the most important and informative features that contribute to the prediction of disease association of SAVs. In cross-validation experiments on the benchmark dataset, FunSAV achieved a good prediction performance with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.882, which is competitive with and in some cases better than other existing tools including SIFT, SNAP, Polyphen2, PANTHER, nsSNPAnalyzer and PhD-SNP.

The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive (\"wait-and-see\") and active (\"here-and-now\") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps.

It is strongly associated with major adverse events, which in turn leads to increased cost and poor outcomes (e.g.: need for nursing home due to cognitive impairment, stroke, and death). The ability to foresee patients at risk of delirium will guide the timely initiation of multi-modal preventive interventions, which will aid in reducing the burden and negative consequences associated with delirium. Several studies have focused on the prediction of delirium. However, the number of studies in cardiac surgical patients that have used machine learning methods is very limited. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: Hence, we sought to explore the application of several machine learning predictive models that can pre-emptively predict delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and compare their performance. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We investigated a number of machine learning methods to develop models that can predict delirium after cardiac surgery. A clinical dataset comprising over 5000 actual patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a single center was used to develop the models using: Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Belief Networks, Na\u00efve Bayesian, Random Forrest, and Decision Trees. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Since only 11.4% patients developed delirium, we addressed the underlying class imbalance, using random under-sampling, in the training dataset. The final prediction performance was validated on a separate test dataset. Due to the target class imbalance, several measures were used to evaluate algorithms performance for the \"Delirium\" class on the test dataset. Out of the selected algorithms, the Support Vector Machines algorithm had the best F1-Score for positive cases, Kappa, and positive predictive value (40.2%, 29.3%, 29.7%; respectively). The Artificial Neural Networks had the best receiver-operator area-under the curve (78.2%). The Bayesian Belief Networks had the best precision-recall area-under the curve for detecting positive cases (30.4%). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Although, delirium is inherently complex, preventive measures to mitigate its negative effect can be applied proactively if patients at risk are prospectively identified. Our results highlight two important points: 1) addressing class imbalance on the training dataset will enhance machine learning model's performance in identifying patients likely to develop post-operative delirium, 2) When it comes to complex medical problems, like delirium, increasing the complexity by using machine learning methods will improve the prediction, which will lead to reduction of cost by prevention of complications and better patients outcomes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6913743", "pubmed_id": "31558433", "doi": "10.2196/14993", "venue": "JMIR Medical Informatics", "journal": "JMIR Medical Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2975869387", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["45863548", "39640096", "7616330", "25689347", "5254394", "14297818", "32384086", "30146600", "11110444", "24499582", "33452324", "24167587", "707368", "922085", "2096087", "14356173", "25447292", "1390308", "36542256", "60517718", "8160095", "17954799", "1301524", "7545306", "18725830", "206887634", "7375720", "22783651", "4161537", "3314529", "42241023", "7277050", "35984565", "41671527", "23073162", "37670050", "53304214", "89141", "140109802", "7033031", "15273230", "206742563", "8366862", "57146809", "578051", "60411480", "37017036", "4198185", "3292333", "17136646", "74314601", "17793133", "14081058", "27776653", "22610383", "20642531", "535528", "12269294", "84845393", "41461521", "7373959", "9237797", "55821795", "3342225", "207170725", "25295970", "2393525", "36511039", "2247957", "16755428", "2182827", "24709666", "8799827"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203568794"}

The range of an excavation damaged zone (EDZ) changes as the time and space change. These changes bring more difficulties in analyzing the stability of the surrounding rock in deep engineering and determining a reasonable support scheme. In a layered rock mass, the distribution of EDZs is more difficult to identify. In this study, an ultrasonic velocity detector in the surrounding rock was used to monitor the range of EDZs in a deep roadway which was buried in a layered rock mass with a dip angle of 20\u201330\u00b0. The space-time distribution laws of the range of EDZs during the excavation process of the roadway were analyzed. The monitoring results showed that the formation of an EDZ can be divided into the following stages: (1) the EDZ forms immediately after the roadway excavation, which accounts for approximately 82%\u201395% of all EDZs. The main factors that affect the EDZ are the blasting load, the excavation unloading, and the stress adjustment; (2) as the roadway excavation continues, the range of the EDZs increases because of the blasting excavation and stress adjustment; (3) the later excavation zone has a comparatively larger EDZ value; and (4) an asymmetric supporting technology is necessary to ensure the stability of roadways buried in layered rocks. Additionally, the predictive capability of random forest modeling is evaluated for estimating the EDZ.

In this work we modify the long-established Random Forest (RF) algorithm to take into account uncertainties in the measurements (i.e., features) as well as in the assigned classes (i.e., labels). To do so, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) algorithm treats the features and labels as probability distribution functions, rather than deterministic quantities. We perform a variety of experiments where we inject different types of noise to a dataset, and compare the accuracy of the PRF to that of RF.

The SISR has been an attractive research topic over the last two decades and it refers to the reconstruction of a high resolution (HR) image from a single low resolution (LR) observation. Recently, SISR using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) obtained remarkable performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) metrics. Despite this, these methods suffer with a serious drawback in terms of visualization quality of the SR images; the results look overly-smoothed. This is due to the loss function in those methods has a pixel level difference which increases the values of PSNR and SSIM metrics; however the visualization quality is degraded. The GAN has a capability to generate visually appealable solutions. It can also recover the high-frequency texture details due to the discrimination process involved in GAN. Here, we propose improved single image super-resolution using GAN (ISRGAN) with the concept of densely connected deep convolutional networks for image super-resolution. Our proposed method consists two networks: ISRNet and ISRGAN. The ISRNet is trained using MSE based loss function to achieve higher PSNR and SSIM values and ISRGAN is trained by using a combination of VGG based perceptual loss and adversarial loss in order to improve the perceptual quality of the SR images. This training step forces the SR results more towards the natural image manifold. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by conducting experiments on the different benchmark testing datasets and it shows that the proposed method of ISRGAN outperforms in terms of perception when compared to the other state-of-the-art GAN based SISR techniques.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-17795-9_9", "venue": "CVC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2941540921", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215722048"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150254374"}

As a result, each image is composed of large volumes of data, which turns its processing into a challenge, as performance requirements have been continuously tightened. For instance, new HI applications demand real-time responses. Hence, parallel processing becomes a necessity to achieve this requirement, so the intrinsic parallelism of the algorithms must be exploited. In this paper, a spatial-spectral classification approach has been implemented using a dataflow language known as RVCCAL. This language represents a system as a set of functional units, and its main advantage is that it simplifies the parallelization process by mapping the different blocks over different processing units. The spatial-spectral classification approach aims at refining the classification results previously obtained by using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) filtering process, in which both the pixel spectral value and the spatial coordinates are considered. To do so, KNN needs two inputs: a one-band representation of the hyperspectral image and the classification results provided by a pixel-wise classifier. Thus, spatial-spectral classification algorithm is divided into three different stages: a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm for computing the one-band representation of the image, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and the KNN-based filtering algorithm. The parallelization of these algorithms shows promising results in terms of computational time, as the mapping of them over different cores presents a speedup of 2.69x when using 3 cores. Consequently, experimental results demonstrate that real-time processing of hyperspectral images is achievable.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2279613", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2763970259", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1111164", "26985497", "2614253", "17286951", "17865664", "23745472", "63317301", "205290856", "14495716", "6906514", "7664224", "123815316", "40069321"], "inbound_citations": ["172136838"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67145275"}

In the past numerous attempts have been made to design genetic biomarkers for the identification of HCC; unfortunately, most of the studies are based on a small dataset obtained from a specific platform or lack of their reasonable validation performance on the external datasets. In order to identify a universal expression-based diagnostic biomarker panel for HCC that can be applicable across multiple platforms; we have employed large scale transcriptomic profiling datasets containing a total of 2,306 HCC and 1,655 non-tumorous tissue samples. These samples were obtained from 29 studies generated by mainly four types of profiling techniques include Affymetrix, Illumina, Agilent and High-throughput-seq, which implemented a wide range of platforms. Firstly, we scrutinized 26 genes that are differentially expressed or regulated in uniform pattern among numerous datasets. Subsequently, we identified three genes (FCN3, CLEC1B, & PRC1) panel-based HCC biomarker using different machine learning techniques include Simple-threshold based approach, Extra Trees, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K Neighbors Classifier, Logistic Regression etc. Three-genes panel-based HCC biomarker classified HCC samples and non-tumorous samples of training and three external validation datasets with an accuracy between 93 to 98% and AUROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) in a range of 0.97 to 1.0. Furthermore, the prognostic potential of these genes was evaluated on TCGA cohort and GSE14520 cohort using univariate survival analysis revealed that these genes are independent prognostic indicators for various types of the survivals, i.e. OS (Overall Survival), PFS (Progression-Free Survival), DFS/RFS (Disease-Free Survival/Recurrence-Free Survival) and DSS (Disease-Specific Survival) of HCC patients and significantly stratify high-risk and low-risk HCC patients (p-value <0.05). In conclusion, we identified a universal platform-independent three genes-based biomarker that can predict HCC patients with high precision; also possess significant prognostic potential.

This paper proposes a new hybrid method for the multi-step wind speed forecasting based on Wavelet Domain Denoising, Wavelet Packet Decomposition, Empirical Mode Decomposition, Auto Regressive Moving Average, Extreme Learning Machine and Outlier Correction Method. In the proposed hybrid architecture, the Wavelet Domain Denoising is adopted to reduce the noise of the original wind speed series and a secondary decomposing algorithm is presented to reduce the intermittent of the original wind speed series. In the proposed secondary decomposing algorithm, the Wavelet Packet Decomposition is utilized to decompose the wind speed series into a number of non-stationary sub-layers and stationary sub-layers, and the Empirical Mode Decomposition is used to further decompose the obtained non-stationary data into a series of intrinsic mode functions. Finally, the Auto Regressive Moving Average and Extreme Learning Machine models are employed to complete the multi-step forecasting computation for the decomposed stationary sub-layers and intrinsic mode functions, respectively. In addition, the new Outlier Correction Method is proposed to guarantee the robustness of the built Auto Regressive Moving Average and Extreme Learning Machine models during their forecasting computation. To estimate the performance of the proposed new hybrid forecasting method, a series of performance comparing experiments is provided in the study. The involved comparing forecasting models consist of the Auto Regressive Moving Average model, the BP model, the Elman model, the Extreme Learning Machine and the proposed different hybrid models.

However not all siRNAs induce this effect equally. Several heterogeneous kinds of machine learning techniques and feature sets have been applied to modeling siRNAs and their abilities to induce knockdown. There is some growing agreement to which techniques produce maximally predictive models and yet there is little consensus for methods to compare among predictive models. Also, there are few comparative studies that address what the effect of choosing learning technique, feature set or cross validation approach has on finding and discriminating among predictive models. ::: ::: ::: Principal Findings ::: Three learning techniques were used to develop predictive models for effective siRNA sequences including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), General Linear Models (GLMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Five feature mapping methods were also used to generate models of siRNA activities. The 2 factors of learning technique and feature mapping were evaluated by complete 3\u00d75 factorial ANOVA. Overall, both learning techniques and feature mapping contributed significantly to the observed variance in predictive models, but to differing degrees for precision and accuracy as well as across different kinds and levels of model cross-validation. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: The methods presented here provide a robust statistical framework to compare among models developed under distinct learning techniques and feature sets for siRNAs. Further comparisons among current or future modeling approaches should apply these or other suitable statistically equivalent methods to critically evaluate the performance of proposed models. ANN and GLM techniques tend to be more sensitive to the inclusion of noisy features, but the SVM technique is more robust under large numbers of features for measures of model precision and accuracy. Features found to result in maximally predictive models are not consistent across learning techniques, suggesting care should be taken in the interpretation of feature relevance. In the models developed here, there are statistically differentiable combinations of learning techniques and feature mapping methods where the SVM technique under a specific combination of features significantly outperforms all the best combinations of features within the ANN and GLM techniques.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2760777", "pubmed_id": "19847297", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0007522", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1964880336", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4355692", "7760421", "2500175", "40412980", "10041179", "15790930", "21551507", "15718696", "37728746", "32181200", "1924848", "6948360", "13831833", "32603326", "11030533", "25847586", "43356800", "5654543", "4177225", "16892703", "9955275", "31278018", "15316350", "6504124", "43318073", "2831415", "17252021", "12468352", "9440018", "16580276", "5656053", "2277220", "22601664", "3331511", "683036", "2619125", "8390020"], "inbound_citations": ["11739871", "3864017", "15866046", "16536263", "17730248", "1419980", "215008933", "943200", "14238970", "33244430", "8919929", "19054604"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3787766"}

With propels in location advances, CTCs offer the choice for real-time fluid biopsies. Techniques to distinguish CTCs in the bloodstream system by physical or biochemical properties, although feasible, still expect upgrades to advance broad, reproducible utilize. In this examination, address the issue of simultaneous gene selection and robust classification of BC tests by exhibiting two hybrid algorithms, in particular enhanced firefly algorithm (EFA) and adaptive neuro neutrosophic inference system (ANNIS) with chose qualities for CTC identification. It comprises of three noteworthy stages: In the primary stage intends to remove quality marks related with pairwise separation between cell composes. In the second stage, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm in light of EFA is proposed to distinguish prescient qualities for BC prediction. In EFA algorithm, FAs has been altered by utilizing the discrete space as the continuous space. The EFA algorithm adaptively balances the investigation and misuse to rapidly locate the optimal solution. EFA is another developmental computation method, motivated by the blaze lighting procedure of fireflies. The EFA can rapidly look the gene space optimal or near-optimal gene subset amplifying a given fitness work. The proposed fitness work utilized joins both classification precision and feature reduction measure.

Because improvement of the performance of a CNN classifier requires more training data, the creation of new training images -- image augmentation \u2013 could be one solution to this problem. In this study, we applied the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic mammographic images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). From the DDSM, we cropped two sets of regions of interest (ROIs) from the images: normal and abnormal (cancer/tumor) Those ROIs were used to train the GAN, and the GAN then generated synthetic images. To compare the GAN with the affine transformation augmentation methods, such as rotation, shifting, scaling, etc., we used six groups of ROIs (three simple groups: affine augmented, GAN synthetic, real (original), and three mixture groups of each pair of the three simple groups) for each to train a CNN classifier from scratch. And, we used real ROIs that were not used in training to validate classification outcomes. Our results show that, to classify the normal ROIs and abnormal (tumor) ROIs from DDSM, adding GAN-generated ROIs to the training data can reduce overfitting of the classifier. But the affine transformations performed slightly better than GAN. Therefore, GAN could be an optional augmentation approach. The images augmented by GAN or affine transformation cannot substitute entirely for real images to train CNN classifiers because the absence of real images in the training set will cause serious over-fitting with more training.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2318100", "venue": "Other Conferences", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2837492797", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["39756729", "2390912", "9263402", "13666575", "5108612", "207763512", "3333267", "5955557", "1033682", "125696306", "25931462", "1082740", "6704804", "211227", "10804187", "21282813", "13688414", "6389527", "37149", "68362967", "52829548", "15539264", "6628106", "11758569"], "inbound_citations": ["208300095"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52312375"}

Probabilistic distribution information describes the overall distribution of sample data in a training sample that contains different degrees of noise and potential outliers, as well as helping develop a high-accuracy model. To mine and use the probability distribution information of a training sample, a new support vector regression model that incorporates probability distribution information weight SVR (PDISVR) is proposed. In the PDISVR model, the probability distribution of each sample is considered as the weight and is then introduced into the error coefficient and slack variables of SVR. Thus, the deviation and probability distribution information of the training sample are both used in the PDISVR model to eliminate the influence of noise and outliers in the training sample and to improve predictive performance. Furthermore, examples with different degrees of noise were employed to demonstrate the performance of PDISVR, which was then compared with those of three SVR-based methods.

However, we argue that such kind of features suffer from \u201ccategories bias\u201d in target detection tasks, where the scope of the negatives (i.e., backgrounds) is naturally broader than that of the positives (i.e., targets). Technically, the learning of discriminative features aims to maximize positive-negative difference. In this case, the interclass-difference criteria for feature mapping and feature matching would increase model complexity while degrading detection robustness. To address these issues, we construct a generative feature learning framework in this paper. Unlike the discriminative feature representation, generative features tend to cluster the positives from negatives, and in this way, the unique and separable attributes of the positives can be learnt to facilitate the accurate detection of positives (targets). Practically, by exploiting ELM computational advantages, positives clustering oriented feature learning is implemented with a kernel-label alignment function, which guides random features of positives into clusters, while keeping away from the negatives. On the other hand, the density of positives cluster is estimated using a probabilistic model, and thus the likelihood that test samples belonged to the positive category can be approximately inferred.

(2010) in Bioinformatics uses the same permutation scheme to obtain p-values that can be treated as corrected measure of feature importance to rectify the bias of the Gini variable importance in Random Forests. Since then, such method has been used in applied work to also draw statistical conclusions on VIMs from resulting p-values. In this paper, we show that permuting the outcome may produce unexpected results, including p-values with undesirable properties and illustrate how more refined permutation schemes can be appropriate to obtain desirable results, including high power in discovering relevant variables. ::: ::: ::: Supplementary Information ::: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30561510", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1025", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2905206498", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8680614", "27768367"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56173691"}

A functional analysis (Gene Ontology) revealed a clear association of the group of overexpressed genes with the cell components nucleosome, chromatin, and the nuclear envelope-endoplasmatic reticulum network as well as involvement in the biological processes of nucleosome and chromatin assembly, establishment of protein transport and localization, and Notch signaling pathway. In contrast, the cellular processes completely differed when genes were investigated that were significantly underexpressed in NPM1+ cases compared to NPM1\u2212 cases. This group of genes encoded membrane-related proteins (gap junction, intercellular junction, signalosome complex) and proteins involved in cellular morphogenesis and cell communication. The differences in gene expression signatures between NPM1+ and NPM1\u2212 cases permit a robust classification approach by gene expression profiling. Support Vector Machine analysis resulted in >92% prediction accuracy of NPM1 mutation status (10-fold cross-validation). The sensitivity was very high for the positive detection of NPM1+ cases (>97%). Using a 100-fold re-sampling approach and splitting the complete data set into a training set (n=44) and testing set (n=22) the following genes were most frequently selected as top discriminatory genes: HOXA5, HOXB4, HOXB5, HOXB6, MEIS1, PBX3, FGFR1, ADAM17, PRICKLE1, and TMPO. Interestingly, the classification was less accurate when also FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation status was taken into account. The study cohort (n=66) then was distributed as follows: 19 NPM1+/FLT3+, 22 NPM1+/FLT3\u2212, 4 NPM1\u2212/FLT3+, and 21 NPM1\u2212/FLT3\u2212 negative cases. Only 14 of 22 (64%) NPM1+/FLT3\u2013 cases were correctly predicted, with miscalls falling both into the group of NPM1+/FLT3+ and NPM1\u2212/FLT3\u2212 cases. In conclusion, NPM1 mutations are the most frequent mutations in adult AML to date and their central prognostic role is increasingly recognized. Given the fact that they are nearly mutually exclusive with major recurrent genetic abnormalities and that they can be characterized by a distinctive gene expression program these data especially for of NPM1+/FLT3\u2212 AML with better outcome may support to classify this as a separate biological subgroup of AML with normal karyotype.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2572870953", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90564785"}

Some countries offer web-portals for passport renewal, where citizens can upload their face photo. These applications allow the possibility of the photo being altered to beautify the appearance of the data subject or being morphed to conceal the applicant identity. Specifically, if an eMRTD passport is issued with a morphed facial image, two or more data subjects, likely the known applicant and one or more unknown companion(s), can use such passport to pass a border control.

They are an important category of complex networks, but the process of knowledge extraction and relations discovery from these networks are so complicated and time-consuming. Moreover, the scale of these networks is steadily increasing. Thus, scalable and accurate methods are required for efficient knowledge extraction. In this paper, two distributed label propagation algorithms, namely DHLP-1 and DHLP-2, in the heterogeneous networks have been introduced. The Apache Giraph platform is employed which provides a vertex-centric programming model for designing and running distributed graph algorithms. Complex heterogeneous networks have many examples in the real world and are widely used today for modeling complicated processes. Biological networks are one of such networks. As a case study, we have measured the efficiency of our proposed DHLP-1 and DHLP-2 algorithms on a biological network consisting of drugs, diseases, and targets. The subject we have studied in this network is drug repositioning, aimed at saving both time and cost by suggesting new indications for the current drugs.

In addition, specificities of the data available in this study make it challenging to rigorously compare classifiers, and we address methodological issues arising from this situation. Experiments show good classification accuracy that could make these techniques suitable for fielding on autonomous devices. DRBMs appear to yield better accuracy than SVMs, and are less sensitive to the choice of signal preprocessing and model hyperparameters.

Recently, there are also techniques available for explicit outlier removal. But they suffer from high time complexity and cannot guarantee quality of solution. In this paper, we present a new combinatorial approach, called Random Gradient Descent Tree (or RGD-tree), to explicitly deal with outliers; this results in a new algorithm called RGD-SVM.

Networked gauge stations are instrumental to robust floods alerts though they suffer from error and fault. For capturing the anomalous behavior of networked rain gauges, the use of an online anomaly detection methodology, based on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique, has here been investigated and developed. The specific anomaly case of incorrectly zero sensor readings has been efficiently addressed by a centralized architecture and a prior-knowledge free approach based on SVRs that simulate the normality profile of the networked rain gauges, on the basis of the spatial-temporal correlation existing among the observed rainfall data. Real data from the pilot rain gauge network deployed in Calabria (South Italy) have been used for simulating the anomalous sensor readings. As a result, we conclude that SVR-based anomaly detection on networked rain gauges is appropriate, detecting the eventual rain gauge fault effectively during the rainfall event and by passing through increased alert states (green, yellow, orange, red).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-62398-6_30", "venue": "ICCSA", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2735637655", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42690965"}

Sparse Conjugate Directions Pursuit (SCDP) aims to construct a solution using only a small number of nonzero (i.e. nonsparse) coefficients. Motivations of this work can be found in a setting of machine learning where sparse models typically exhibit better generalization performance, lead to fast evaluations, and might be exploited to define scalable algorithms. The main idea is to build up iteratively a conjugate set of vectors of increasing cardinality, in each iteration solving a small linear subsystem. By exploiting the structure of this conjugate basis, an algorithm is found (i) converging in at most D iterations for D-dimensional systems, (ii) with computational complexity close to the classical conjugate gradient algorithm, and (iii) which is especially efficient when a few iterations suffice to produce a good approximation. As an example, the application of SCDP to Fixed-Size Least Squares Support Vector Machines (FS-LSSVM) is discussed resulting in a scheme which efficiently finds a good model size for the FS-LSSVM setting, and is scalable to large-scale machine learning tasks. The algorithm is empirically verified in a classification context.

Autoantibody biomarker performance was evaluated using Random Forest and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Autoantibody biomarkers can differentiate MCI patients from age-matched and gender-matched controls with an overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100.0%. They were also capable of differentiating MCI patients from those with mild-moderate AD and other neurologic and non-neurologic controls with high accuracy. ::: ::: ::: DISCUSSION ::: Autoantibodies can be used as noninvasive and effective blood-based biomarkers for early diagnosis and staging of AD.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4879649", "pubmed_id": "27239548", "doi": "10.1016/j.dadm.2016.03.002", "venue": "Alzheimer's & Dementia : Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring", "journal": "Alzheimer's & Dementia : Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2341006816", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["36344388", "6430293", "25427702", "20159463", "542810", "25879832", "33946205", "20882265", "3717948", "205669512", "20088064", "11904949", "11223574", "40685918", "12115076", "11689710", "23473297", "11395948", "25074653", "46641091", "11393152", "14049777", "910145", "11155827", "38710804", "5809106", "17375555", "11006976", "5744933", "15574596", "205407859", "21037461", "12911483", "9970390", "142515041", "41155149", "52868270", "22394228", "89141", "6644132", "22032682", "21830556", "25952899", "23390950"], "inbound_citations": ["17811439", "30707082", "52914551", "13737790", "204922560", "13661283", "5772857", "77394637", "4891808", "208062431", "89840602", "201758828", "11176263", "3746916"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14241962"}

This paper proposes an automatic presentation generator for a robot guide, which is considered one more cognitive skill. The presentations are made up of groups of paragraphs. The selection of the best paragraphs is based on a semantic understanding of the characteristics of the paragraphs, on the restrictions defined for the presentation and by the quality criteria appropriate for a public presentation. This work is part of the ROBONAUTA project of the Intelligent Control Research Group at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid to create \"awareness\" in a robot guide. The software developed in the project has been verified on the tour-guide robot Urbano. The most important aspect of this proposal is that the design uses learning as the means to optimize the quality of the presentations. To achieve this goal, the system has to perform the optimized decision making, in different phases. The modeling of the quality index of the presentation is made using fuzzy logic and it represents the beliefs of the robot about what is good, bad, or indifferent about a presentation. This fuzzy system is used to select the most appropriate group of paragraphs for a presentation. The beliefs of the robot continue to evolving in order to coincide with the opinions of the public. It uses a genetic algorithm for the evolution of the rules. With this tool, the tour guide-robot shows the presentation, which satisfies the objectives and restrictions, and automatically it identifies the best paragraphs in order to find the most suitable set of contents for every public profile", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "58374873", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["60548132", "51838489", "2618234", "18437989", "16648004", "6203215", "12936750", "14689858", "10951737", "5073927", "60832260", "206468170", "15422965"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107680085"}

Although studies about adaptive T-S fuzzy-neural controllers have been made on some nonaffine nonlinear systems, little is known about the more complicated uncertain nonlinear systems. Because the nonlinear functions of the systems are uncertain, traditional T-S fuzzy control methods can model and control them only with great difficulty, if at all. Instead of modeling these uncertain functions directly, we propose that a T-S fuzzy-neural model approximates a so-called virtual linearized system (VLS) of the system, which includes modeling errors and external disturbances. We also propose an online identification algorithm for the VLS and put significant emphasis on robust tracking controller design using an adaptive scheme for the uncertain systems. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop systems is proven by using strictly positive real Lyapunov theory. The proposed overall scheme guarantees that the outputs of the closed-loop systems asymptotically track the desired output trajectories.

Learning the manifold in which images lie and measuring the proximity distance of the sample points to the clusters in their latent space is non-trivial. Recent deep learning methods have proposed the use of autoencoders for manifold learning and dimensionality reduction in an effort to better cluster image samples. However, offline training of autoencoders is cumbersome and rather tedious to update. Moreover, trained autoencoders tend to be biased towards the training set and are impractical for performing data augmentation. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that uses a triplet network architecture in order to replace autoencoders, thus avoiding the need to pre-train autoencoders offline. Because our framework can be trained online, we can train our network with data augmented pairs which allows us to build a more robust encoder and improve accuracy. In contrast to other clustering methods that require nearest neighbor comparisons at every step, our method introduces a novel and adaptive approach of choosing the samples to train which we call Random Triplet Mining.

In this paper, we introduce a simple but strong negative sampling approach for adversarial knowledge representation learning, named loss adaptive sampling mechanism, which is efficient without an external sampling model. Furthermore, false negative cases are always over-trained in the training stage with efficient negative sampling approaches. We propose a push-up mechanism and verify whether it is feasible to alleviate these over-trained false negative cases. The experimental results show that our adversarial knowledge representation learning approach outperforms the GAN-based sampling method\u2014KBGAN.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2889481", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2906825488", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207846993", "207167677", "1181640", "19135805", "15027084", "2949428", "11202498", "207228784", "12011532", "38485677", "11091552", "9884935", "13614891", "982761", "1157792", "2768038", "6071257", "15150247", "18367155", "19370455", "4328400", "19131678", "3401524", "3674574", "3674574", "3087701", "5458500", "205692", "1743664", "1969092", "10596592", "16160185", "31606602", "7958862", "8535487", "14178327", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57762587"}

It also helps to accurately identify the spatial facies distribution to perform an accurate reservoir model for optimal future reservoir performance. In this paper, comparative conditional posterior probabilities of continuous well facies distribution has been estimated through Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) and Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM) given the well log interpretations in a well within sandstone formation in South Rumaila Oil Field, located in Iraq. The explanatory variables are depth, neutron porosity, water saturation, shale volume. The multinomial response factor is the vertical discrete Lithofacies sequence that only encompasses of sand, shaly sand, and shale. The Lithofacies were modeled given the well logs data through LDA and KSVM and comparisons were done between the measured and predicted Lithofacies distribution in order to determine the best classification method to be considered for Lithofacies prediction at other wells in the reservoir.The LDA was chosen to estimate the maximum likelihood and minimize the standard error for the relationships between lithofacies and well logs data. The Linear discriminate Analysis seeks a linear transformation (discriminate function) of both the independent and dependent variables in order to produce a new set of transformed values that provides a more accurate discrimination concerning dimensionality reduction. Beta distribution of facies has been considered as prior knowledge and the resulted predicted probability (posterior) distribution has been estimated from LDA based on Bayes theorem that represents the relationship between predicted probability (posterior) with the conditional probability and the prior knowledge. The linear discriminant analysis has been accomplished considering the cross-validation in addition to splitting the data into train and test process. Through assessing the LDA models, the cross-validation was adopted as an optimal solution to estimate the continuous lithofacies distribution because the total true correct summation is more valuable than the splitting data method. Then, the KSVM has been adopted to estimate the continuous predicted probability Distribution of Lithofacies. KSVM is a supervised statistical learning algorithm that recognizes the discrete classes for the given data based on maximizing the margin around the separating hyperplane and the decision function is fully specified by a subset of the supporting vectors. The posterior distribution has been validated using the true and predicted facies counts matrix that estimated by KSVM. In comparison between the LDA and KSVM, it was prominent that KSVM is better than LDA because it has more total true correct summation than LDA. Also, nonlinear separations of components is handled well by using KSVM. In addition and after depicting the vertical well sand, shale, and shaly sand posterior distribution from both LDA and KSVM, it was shown that KSVM prediction is more compatible between the sand posterior values with the high records of neutron porosity along with low intervals of shale volume. Consequently, the KSVM was considered for Lithofacies prediction in the other wells in the reservoir to be a solid basis for the geospatial modeling.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4043/25806-MS", "venue": "Offshore Technology Conference", "journal": "Offshore Technology Conference", "mag_id": "1992359303", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["125534983", "133122448"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128889697"}

Unlike the SVM, the MKL-SVM used a convex combination of basic kernel functions instead of a single basic kernel function to construct an adaptive SVM model. This adaptive model could improve average performance in traffic incident detection just by randomly selecting the kernel function and parameters. As a result, the MKL-SVM avoided the burden of choosing the appropriate kernel function and parameters. The SVM ensemble algorithm trained many individual SVM classifiers to construct the classifier ensemble and then used this classifier ensemble to detect traffic incidents. Consequently, training occurred many times. Compared with the SVM ensemble algorithm, the training time cost of the MKL-SVM was much lower because training occurred only once. Extensive experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of three algorithms: standard SVM, SVM ensemble, and MKL-SVM.

Different from existing works, which use all SCs to construct feature vectors so as to determine the security of applications, CSCdroid first introduces a concept named contribution to quantitatively evaluate SCs relevance for malware identification. Based on the contribution level, CSCdroid can categorize SCs into two types, determinate SCs and normal SCs. Eventually, CSCdroid builds a Markov chain by replacing all normal SCs with one specific SC in the SC sequence. Then it constructs the target feature vector from the probability matrix and use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect Android malware. Such way can effectively reduce the state number of Markov chains, and cut down the dimension of the feature vectors into the SVM classifier.

From the viewpoint of pattern recognition, the task of cancer class ification based on gene expression data is a pattern classif ication problem, and the feature vector for the classification is the gene expression vector. However, this problem is an extremely difficult one for many methods, since the feature dimension is usually very high (usually several thousands), and the training samples (samples whose correct classification is known and thus plays the role as supervisors) are usually very scarce (say, around 100 known samples or less). If directly working in this high dimensional space with limited samples, most conventional pattern recognition algorithms may not work well. Some algorithm (algorithms that involve matrix inversion operation) may not be able to arrive at a solution when the number of samples is less than the dimensionality. For others that can achieve a solution, it may not be able to work well on samples other than that used for training. This is called the generalization problem in pattern recognition and machine learning. Thus, most previous methods for cancer classification based on gene expression data starts with a feature selection procedure. For example, Golub et al defined a metric for evaluating the correlation of a gene with a classification scheme, thus determining whether the gene is relevant or not (Golub et al, 1999; Slonim et al, 2000). Obviously, this kind of strategy does not take possible correlation and co-action among the genes into consideration. Unless it can be proven that the genes are statistically independent with each other (or orthogonal to each other), the result is far from optimal. We believe that due to the complex (and unknown) relationship among the genes, it should be better to start with the analysis of the full data set. For this purpose, we should be able to design a good classifier with all the candidate genes. Then the most relevant genes for this classification can be discovered by evaluating the subset of genes that contributes mostly in this classifier.

However, their performance improvement becomes very limited, especially when the resolution becomes very low.

Comparison of experimental results conducted on public and our newly created WIDER-SHIP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL-GAN, which improves the classification results significantly, with 10\u201315% gain on average, compared with benchmark solutions.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2978980", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3009845929", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206594692", "9433631", "140309863", "32378562", "4560536", "8880161", "61148756", "59276672", "53755369", "3033210", "16011190", "3619954", "127852189", "3683267", "201058451", "57541847", "52846727", "6704804", "52285314", "35396200", "207906713", "52154773", "19154167", "51609927", "211227", "10716717", "9039901", "90262749", "52825087", "203221188", "54443651", "57861420", "206769850", "21027625", "5085777", "52895837", "201668904", "565409", "9688096", "3862933", "36448150", "4319595", "11758569", "1033682", "18268744", "4246903", "38814373", "4555207", "167217261", "362467"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214691735"}

It is also better than CNN models using only the OFM features, the Magpie features, or the basic one-hot encodings.

However, current methods have limitations that 1) generated images are oftentimes blurry and 2) models can only learn and produce one target font at a time. To address these problems, we have developed a brand-new model to perform Chinese font transformation. First, font information is attached to images to tell the generator the fonts that we want to transform. Then, the generator extracts and learns feature mappings through convolutional networks and generates photo-realistic images using transposed convolutional networks. The ground truth images are then used as supervisory information to ensure that characters and fonts generated are consistent with themselves.

The reason behind using such a model is that Deep CNNs used for image classification take a very long time to train. Even with pre-trained models, the fully connected layers need to be trained with backpropagation, which can be very slow. In contrast, we propose to employ the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the final classifier trained on pre-trained Deep CNN feature extractor. We apply this hybrid model on the problem of fire detection in images. We use state of the art Deep CNNs: VGG16 and Resnet50 and replace the softmax classifier with the ELM classifier. For both the VGG16 and Resnet50, the number of fully connected layers is also reduced. Especially in VGG16, which has 3 fully connected layers of 4096 neurons each followed by a softmax classifier, we replace two of these with an ELM classifier. The difference in convergence rate between fine-tuning the fully connected layers of pre-trained models and training an ELM classifier are enormous, around 20x to 51x speed-up. Also, we show that using an ELM classifier increases the accuracy of the system by 2.8% to 7.1% depending on the CNN feature extractor. We also compare our hybrid architecture with another hybrid architecture, i.e. the CNN-SVM model. Using SVM as the classifier does improve accuracy compared to state-of-the-art deep CNNs.

In this paper, a multilayer architecture is proposed to increase the performance of multiclass classification. The framework includes data-preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classifier building. The framework is a two-layer classification, choosing from Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression as base models, and using a voting scheme to obtain the final predicted class. The proposed model is applied to more than 1.3 million restaurant reviews from the Yelp Challenge dataset. We have achieved a high accuracy of 86% for cross validation, and using real-world online review data as test data, we have achieved an accuracy of 80%.

A hybrid forecasting technique is proposed based on recurrence plot (RP) and optimized support vector regression (SVR). Wind caused by the interaction of meteorological systems makes itself extremely unsteady and difficult to forecast. To understand the wind system, the wind speed series is analyzed using RP. Then, the SVR model is employed to forecast wind speed, in which the input variables are selected by RP, and two crucial parameters, including the penalties factor and gamma of the kernel function RBF, are optimized by various optimization algorithms. Those optimized algorithms are genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA). Finally, the optimized SVR models, including COA-SVR, PSO-SVR, and GA-SVR, are evaluated based on some criteria and a hypothesis test. The experimental results show that (1) analysis of RP reveals that wind speed has short-term predictability on a short-term time scale, (2) the performance of the COA-SVR model is superior to that of the PSO-SVR and GA-SVR methods, especially for the jumping samplings, and (3) the COA-SVR method is statistically robust in multi-step-ahead prediction and can be applied to practical wind farm applications.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2015/619178", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2146314856", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["108962795", "122367569", "110437214", "14250368", "109200041", "33880689", "104078262", "13492371", "30445946", "27773289", "1677340", "27328072", "108576971", "109966548", "22785785", "24719604", "16961790", "18667537", "67753909", "73672764", "111167248", "1968874", "32368599", "25494551", "206787478", "19196574", "12851040", "109143497", "7367791", "206491725", "56378754", "122704969", "122456338", "125446433", "12574646"], "inbound_citations": ["117614208", "73567601", "44114480", "55851478", "128106050", "32507392", "56143656", "196137695", "52151684", "46036472", "71150078", "43319111", "24423691", "200161146"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14330241"}

Although several sensing techniques have been proposed for human activity identification, they require either the user instrumentation or additional infrastructure, that are inconvenient, privacy-intrusive, and expensive. To address these issues, a WiFi-enabled device-free human activity recognition system, namely SmartSense, is proposed in this paper. By upgrading commercial WiFi routers with our designed firmware, fine-grained channel state information (CSI) from PHY layer can be directly extracted from the existing WiFi traffic. In this paper, we propose SmartSense, a device-free human activity recognition system that only leverages existing commercial off-the-shelf WiFi routers. By exploiting the prevalence of WiFi infrastructure in buildings, we developed a novel CSI-enabled Internet of Things platform to collect the CSI measurements from regular data frames. To identify different human activities, a novel machine learning tool, namely multiple kernel semi-representation learning (MKSRL) method is established. MKSRL allows the input of expert domain knowledge in a flexible way and conducts automatic and effective multikernel representation learning for the activity recognition task. Each stage of MKSRL is computationally efficient and theoretically guaranteed, and they can be integrated seamlessly within the reproducing kernel framework for the overall information extraction, representation, and fusion. We conducted experiments to comprehensively evaluate the performance of SmartSense in three common indoor environments. Experimental results validate that SmartSense can provide an activity recognition accuracy of 98%, which achieves significant performance gain over the existing methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JIOT.2019.2901927", "venue": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "journal": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2919295266", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52303689", "116717088", "17252478", "15990410", "206930087", "5660418", "215609151", "8876435", "29212582", "36864073", "31976323", "1028754", "15402866", "14433451", "36158184", "7644967", "6014101", "155084204", "1955977", "2321381", "14470726", "1667579", "8223102", "19227805", "13561174", "14391542", "11176616", "2552688", "38468637", "117080627", "9001901", "12921275", "54040858", "41680909"], "inbound_citations": ["146022741", "203702737", "201876701", "198918103"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86425599"}

Though numerous studies have been reported on aeration with a single plunging jet, very few studies are available in open literature on multiple plunging jet aeration systems. The present work is the result of an extensive laboratory study carried out on single and multiple water jets in vertical and inclined orientations, and different possible configurations of the number and diameter of jets. The effect of single and multiple jets on overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KLa) is studied by correlating it with kinetic jet power per unit volume (P/V). It was found that KLa increases with an increase in the number of jets, and also the performance of multiple jets improves with increasing kinetic jet power per unit volume. Neural Network and Support Vector Machine modelling techniques have been applied on the experimental data to determine the significant jet parameters that govern the performance of multiple plunging jets aeration system. Based on these parameters, an empirical relationship for predicting the KLa has been proposed for which the correlation coefficient and root mean square error are 0.96 and 3.27 respectively. Both the modelling techniques have also been used for the prediction of KLa and have been found to work well.

Method and Materials: The approach combines interactive expert user guidance through a probabilistic framework and a fast graph partition algorithm for volumetric image segmentation. With an intuitive graphical interface, the user indicates samples of object and background tissue by loosely drawing a few brush strokes on the image, which provide statistical input for a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based segmentation. We show that boundary statistics provided on a few 2D slices can be propagated through the entire 3D stack of images without using the geometric correspondence between images. In addition, CRF based segmentation can be formulated as a graph partition problem which has a solution that is both globally optimal and fast. We compare our proposed method and other segmentation methods in analytical phantom and with manual expert segmentations (ground truth) in a clinical liver case. Results: The phantom study shows the method to be less sensitive to imagenoise and requiring less human input than previous graph partition methods. In liver, our method achieves 98% precision (=TP/(TP+FP) where TP (true positive) is the number of segmented liver voxels in ground truth liver, and FP=false positive) and 90% recall rate (sensitivity) compared to 90% precision and 90% recall rate using level\u2010sets and 96% precision and 89% recall using region growing. Average computation time per slice is 6 seconds. Conclusion: The liveranalysis shows that boundary statistics from a single slice can be reused for the entire image stack without retraining to achieve high accuracy. Compared to the earlier graph cut method, time required for manual interaction is significantly reduced.

This leads to two significant shortcomings: (1) the need to train exponential number of pairwise models, and (2) the inability to leverage data from other domains when training a particular pairwise mapping. Inspired by recent work on module networks, this paper proposes ModularGAN for multi-domain image generation and image-to-image translation. ModularGAN consists of several reusable and composable modules that carry on different functions (e.g., encoding, decoding, transformations). These modules can be trained simultaneously, leveraging data from all domains, and then combined to construct specific GAN networks at test time, according to the specific image translation task. This leads to ModularGAN's superior flexibility of generating (or translating to) an image in any desired domain.

To evaluate the performance of our method, CRF is compared with other related RF methods and support vector machine on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets, and experimental results show that CRF can provide competitive solutions for hyperspectral image classification.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2809781", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2790275230", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["58374281", "4860875", "55302928", "494909", "1143794", "24725735", "9558600", "36411993", "15637777", "5825773", "22259362", "19165248", "131528125", "89141", "35536329", "23708470", "60784628", "5707430", "121049522", "7361444", "7179160", "39861849", "6644398", "45825131", "120135390", "22714760", "5883609", "60610282", "11481774", "206420153", "59814698", "61093833", "11883992", "6226926", "26590971", "5872472", "7330769", "29258521", "32237244", "3478850", "45341971", "12796195", "207115115", "22438068", "32812674", "2096643", "12977648", "523085", "120219784", "52831439", "15880372", "683036"], "inbound_citations": ["199669259", "126842097", "169937355", "184488430", "57762697", "213526481", "208039675"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4875462"}

However, current approaches only take advantage of the output of the encoder's final layer when fine-tuning the downstream tasks. We argue that only taking single layer's output restricts the power of pre-trained representation. Thus we deepen the representation learned by the model by fusing the hidden representation in terms of an explicit HIdden Representation Extractor (HIRE), which automatically absorbs the complementary representation with respect to the output from the final layer. Utilizing RoBERTa as the backbone encoder, our proposed improvement over the pre-trained models is shown effective on multiple natural language understanding tasks and help our model rival with the state-of-the-art models on the GLUE benchmark.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.01940", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3023676446,2985981836", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["858065", "14604520", "4421747", "5590763", "52967399", "16639476", "7200347", "6628106", "6826032", "202888986", "15710851", "59523594", "198953378", "52098907", "47018994", "11816014", "990233", "13756489", "5034059", "44072099", "3432876", "195069387", "158046772", "202539891", "6866988"], "inbound_citations": ["211532403"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207780480"}

In this paper, for the two-class problem, we propose a bagging-based algorithm with Xgboost classifier (Gradient Boosting Machine) and under-sampling approaches to overcome the challenge. To avoid model misspecification caused by imbalanced data, random sampling with replacement is employed to obtain several balanced training sets; and to mitigate the problem of misleading information produced by noise, Tomek Link method is introduced to eliminate the cross-class overlapped instances, which are the primal sources of noise. And to obtain robust individual learners, we utilize Xgboost, a novel Gradient Boosting Machine-based classifier with convenient parameter tuning interface, to fit each component of the bagging ensemble. The performance of the proposed method is tested with Mandarin radio records (MFCC features) with the task of keywords recognition, and experimental results show that the new method could outperform single Xgboost classifier, verified the rationality and effectiveness of the bagging scheme. The method proposed in the paper could offer a novel solution to the challenge of noisy imbalanced data classification, and the implementation of Xgboost in this area could also serve as an innovative work.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1757-899x/428/1/012004", "venue": "IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering", "journal": "IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "2895390821", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199442360"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69986086"}

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them.

In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot learning method based on discriminative sparse non-negative matrix factorization. The proposed approach aims to identify a set of common high-level semantic components across the two domains via non-negative sparse matrix factorization, while enforcing the representation vectors of the images in this common component-based space to be discriminatively aligned with the attribute-based label representation vectors. To fully exploit the aligned semantic information contained in the learned representation vectors of the instances, we develop a label propagation based testing procedure to classify the unlabeled instances from the unseen classes in the target domain. We conduct experiments on four standard zero-shot learning image datasets, by comparing the proposed approach to the state-of-the-art zero-shot learning methods. The empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2017.542", "venue": "2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2748618181", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11617315", "6314150", "1580181", "17384705", "14940757", "261138", "18734348", "10337178", "11418612", "12009862", "5937669", "166607", "1865113", "195908774", "10301835", "7016601", "14149995", "9119671", "5959482", "14256825", "1926319", "7490338", "8724974", "8181220", "5891792", "14959172", "14124313", "2808203", "16119123", "16140390", "16728786", "13451577", "446581", "229339"], "inbound_citations": ["199489188", "102351182", "214728248", "19131547", "56895387", "56895387", "4852047", "13690062", "212736968", "202558574", "204960111", "52288797", "102350540", "119186616", "199465935", "53721837", "210931162", "85502844", "60441082", "204915925", "34240712", "53086367", "155099902", "67872061", "3752773", "53043104", "53044617", "195584205", "53046237", "52148376", "208612459", "59337593", "54552992", "59291909", "4103993", "207998211", "195783814", "204800546", "52282846", "26207150", "52964790", "174801490"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24433423"}

State-of-the-art approaches use neural networks for this task. As a loss function during training, they employ the mean squared error between true and estimated wideband spectra. This, however, comes with the drawback of over-smoothing, which expresses itself in strongly underestimated dynamics of the upper frequency band. We previously proposed to tackle this problem by discriminative training, i.e., a modification of the loss function that is designed to improve the separation between fricatives and vowels.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of two one-class user behavior profiling techniques: one-class Support Vector Machines (ocSVMs) and a Hellinger distance-based user behavior profiling technique. Both techniques model bags of words or commands and do not model sequences of commands. We use both techniques for masquerade detection and compare the experimental results. The objective is to evaluate which modeling technique is most suitable for use in an operational monitoring system, hence our focus is on accuracy and operational performance characteristics.

This paper describes experiments with a system to assign automatically keyword metadata descriptors to unlabelled images. Learning to automatically match low level image features, like colour or texture to high level concepts (the so called semantic-gap problem) is very challenging. The usual approach is to design a learning machine or classifier to learn low-level feature vectors for high-level concept classification as a single-step (direct) mapping function. These systems often do not perform well for large numbers of classes. We present a two-level supervised learning framework for effective image annotation. In the first level induction stage, colour and texture feature vectors are classified individually into their corresponding outputs, i.e. colour and texture terms. Then, the colour and texture terms as middlelevel features are classified into the target high-level conceptual classes during the second level induction stage. Three experimental studies are described in this paper. Experimental results using vocabularies of 60 and 150 keywords are reported, based on single step Support Vector Machines, two step Support Vector Machines, and k Nearest Neighbour.

Considering the mutual influence in multi-vehicle routing, we propose an edge-assisted distributed routing framework, which enables virtual agents on behalf of vehicles to interact with others to make real-time routing decisions. In the framework, we model the agent interaction as a population game and propose a scalable multiagent learning algorithm to efficiently find the Nash equilibria. Specifically, the multiagent learning algorithm takes the bounded rationality of individuals into account and uses a stage learning algorithm based on best-response dynamics to plan a route for vehicles.

Real-time galloping data are important in the mechanism and effect analysis of conductor dancing prevention; moreover, they are critical for verifying anti-galloping designs and developing galloping prevention plans. However, owing to the limitations of using sensors on cables, obtaining complete galloping data is an ill-posed and challenging problem. In this study, a novel curve reconstruction method using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN), CR-CGAN, is proposed for fully synthesizing transmission line galloping curves. We use the modeling capabilities of the recently introduced GAN by imposing additional constraints to achieve full reconstruction of the galloping curves. Moreover, we introduce a novel design in the generator-discriminator pair for improved results and a new refined loss function to enhance details. The generator uses an autoencoder with skip connections, and the inception module is used to capture different scales of spatiotemporal correlation. The discriminator is designed to use global information to determine the reliability and smoothness of the reconstructed curve.

This paper presents a novel semiautomatic segmentation and tracking method for single VO extraction. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed method formulates the separation of the VO from the background as a classification problem. Each frame is divided into small blocks of uniform size, which are called object blocks if the centering pixels belong to the object, or background blocks otherwise. After a manual segmentation of the first frame, the blocks of this frame are used as the training samples for the object-background classifier. A newly developed learning tool called /spl psi/-learning is employed to train the classifier which outperforms the conventional Support Vector Machines in linearly nonseparable cases. To deal with large and complex objects, a multilayer approach constructing a so-called hyperplane tree is proposed. Each node of the tree represents a hyperplane, responsible for classifying only a subset of the training samples. Multiple hyperplanes are thus needed to classify the entire set. Through the combination of the multilayer scheme and /spl psi/-learning, one can avoid the complexity of nonlinear mapping as well as achieve high classification accuracy. During the tracking phase, the pixel in the center of every block in a successive frame is classified by a sequence of hyperplanes from the root to a leaf node of the hyperplane tree, and the class of the block is identified accordingly. All the object blocks thus form the object of interest, whose boundary unfortunately is stair-like due to the block effect. In order to obtain the pixel-wise boundary in a cost efficient way, a pyramid boundary refining algorithm is designed, which iteratively selects a few informative pixels for class label checking, and reduces uncertainty about the actual boundary of the object.

Far-infrared or thermal night vision is a technology well suited for automatic detection of pedestrians at night as they generally appear warmer than the background. However, the appearance of a pedestrian in IR video can vary dramatically depending on the physical properties of the clothing they wear, the time spent adjusting to the outside environment, and the ambient temperature. We highlight the difficulties of detection in low temperatures (below 8 \u00b0C) when pedestrians typically wear highly insulating clothing, which can lead to distortion of the IR signature of the pedestrian. A pre-processing step is presented, which compensates for this clothing-based distortion using vertically-biased morphological closing. Potential pedestrians (Regions of Interest) are then segmented using feature-based region-growing with high intensity seeds. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are extracted from candidates and utilised for Support Vector Machine classification. Positively classified targets are tracked between frames using a Kalman filter, adding robustness and increasing performance. The proposed system adapts not just to variations between images or video frames, but to variations in appearance between different pedestrians in the same image or frame.

Due to the increasing number of cores in Systems on Chip (SoCs), bus architectures have suffered with limitations regarding performance. As applications demand higher bandwidth and lower latencies, buses have not been able to comply with such requirements due to longer wires and increased capacitance. Facing this scenario, Networks on Chip (NoCs) emerged as a way to overcome the limitations found in bus-based systems. Fully exploring all possible NoC characteristics settings is unfeasible due to the vast design space to cover. Therefore, some methods which aim to speed up the design process are needed. In this work, we propose the use of machine learning techniques to optimise NoC architecture components during the design phase. We have investigated the performance of several different ML techniques and selected the Random Forest one targeting audio/video applications. The results have shown an accuracy of up to 90% and 85% for prediction involving arbitration and routing protocols, respectively, and in terms of applications inference, audio/video achieved up to 99%. After this step, we have evaluated other classifiers for each application individually, aiming at finding the adequate one for each situation. The best class of classifiers found was the Tree-based one (Random Forest, Random Tree, and M5P) which is very encouraging, and it points to different approaches from the current state of the art for NoCs latency prediction.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11227-019-02971-x", "venue": "The Journal of Supercomputing", "journal": "The Journal of Supercomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2969716288", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14709164", "8385583", "9938173", "7260781", "16314727", "14437352", "8817875", "18030647", "16989393", "5625864", "7855671", "3063316", "9447890", "13373725", "53720874", "14540391", "1072557", "16443574", "55615161", "10455640", "9077617", "9020034", "967004", "11592182", "40844583", "58820603", "13631376", "36341849"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201058174"}

As an important technique in community detection, label propagation has shown the advantage of finding a good community structure with nearly linear time complexity. However, despite the progress that has been made, there are still several important issues that have not been properly addressed. First, the label propagation typically proceeds over the lower order structure of the network and only the direct one-hop connections between nodes are taken into consideration. Unfortunately, the higher order structure that may encode design principle of the network and be crucial for community detection is neglected under this regime. Second, the stability of the identified community structure may also be seriously affected by the inherent randomness in the label propagation process. To tackle the above issues, this article proposes a Motif-Aware Weighted Label Propagation method for community detection. We focus on triangles within the network, but our technique extends to other kinds of motifs as well. Specifically, the motif-based higher order structure mining is conducted to capture structural characteristics of the network. First, the motif of interest (locally meaningful pattern) is identified, and then, the motif-based hypergraph can be constructed to encode the higher order connections. To further utilize the structural information of the network, a re-weighted network is designed, which unifies both the higher order structure and the original lower order structure. Accordingly, a novel voting strategy termed NaS (considering both Number and Strength of connections) is proposed to update node labels during the label propagation process. In this way, the random label selection can be effectively eliminated, yielding more stable community structures.

The GA-SVR models are developed and tested using the available data sets, and consecutive predicted results are compared in terms of Efficiency Coefficient and Correlation Coefficient. Obtained results show that the GA-SVR models with Exponential Radial Basis Function (ERBF) kernel present higher accuracy than the other applied GA-SVR models. Furthermore, testing data sets are predicted by Einstein and Meyer-Peter and Muller (MPM) formulas. The GA-SVR models demonstrate a better performance compared to the traditional bed load formulas.

We incorporated vegetation vertical structure information obtained from Lidar with ground-measured biomass data, allowing us to scale shrub biomass from small field sites (1 m subplots and 1 ha plots) to a larger landscape. A series of airborne Lidar-derived vegetation metrics were trained and linked with the field-measured biomass in Random Forests (RF) regression models. A Stepwise Multiple Regression (SMR) model was also explored as a comparison. Our results demonstrated that the important predictors from Lidar-derived metrics had a strong correlation with field-measured biomass in the RF regression models with a pseudo R2 of 0.76 and RMSE of 125 g/m2 for shrub biomass and a pseudo R2 of 0.74 and RMSE of 141 g/m2 for total biomass, and a weak correlation with field-measured herbaceous biomass. The SMR results were similar but slightly better than RF, explaining 77\u201379% of the variance, with RMSE ranging from 120 to 129 g/m2 for shrub and total biomass, respectively. We further explored the computational efficiency and relative accuracies of using point cloud and raster Lidar metrics at different resolutions (1 m to 1 ha). Metrics derived from the Lidar point cloud processing led to improved biomass estimates at nearly all resolutions in comparison to raster-derived Lidar metrics. Only at 1 m were the results from the point cloud and raster products nearly equivalent. The best Lidar prediction models of biomass at the plot-level (1 ha) were achieved when Lidar metrics were derived from an average of fine resolution (1 m) metrics to minimize boundary effects and to smooth variability. Overall, both RF and SMR methods explained more than 74% of the variance in biomass, with the most important Lidar variables being associated with vegetation structure and statistical measures of this structure (e.g., standard deviation of height was a strong predictor of biomass).

This paper is to resolve this dilemma by answering two questions: (1) provided with a limited number of reliable labels, can we use them to generate more synthetic labels; (2) Can we use those synthetic labels to improve the detectability? Among all the existing generative models, the generative adversarial network (GAN) shows its supreme capability in generating high-quality synthetic samples in multiple domains. We designed our model based on GAN. In particular, we studied several different network structures. By comparing the generated results, our GAN-based generative model yields the highest quality.

In plants, citrus is used as a major source of nutrients like vitamin C throughout the world. However, \u2018Citrus\u2019 diseases badly effect the production and quality of citrus fruits. From last decade, the computer vision and image processing techniques have been widely used for detection and classification of diseases in plants. In this article, we propose a hybrid method for detection and classification of diseases in citrus plants. The proposed method consists of two primary phases; (a) detection of lesion spot on the citrus fruits and leaves; (b) classification of citrus diseases. The citrus lesion spots are extracted by an optimized weighted segmentation method, which is performed on an enhanced input image. Then, color, texture, and geometric features are fused in a codebook. Furthermore, the best features are selected by implementing a hybrid feature selection method, which consists of PCA score, entropy, and skewness-based covariance vector. The selected features are fed to Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (M-SVM) for final citrus disease classification. The proposed technique is tested on Citrus Disease Image Gallery Dataset, Combined dataset (Plant Village and Citrus Images Database of Infested with Scale), and our own collected images database. We used these datasets for detection and classification of citrus diseases namely anthracnose, black spot, canker, scab, greening, and melanose.

For this reason, detection of this altered stress response can be used as an indicator for future health. To date, there is no study that utilized this information to indicate future health. In order to detect the altered stress response, biomarkers that represent both Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocorticol (HPA) is proposed. Among the available biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been proven as a powerful biomarker that represents ANS. Meanwhile, salivary cortisol has been suggested as a biomarker that reflects the HPA. Even though many studies used multiple biomarkers to measure the stress response, the results for each biomarker were analysed separately. Therefore, this study fuses the biomarker that represents both ANS and HPA as a single measure, proposes a new method to classify the stress response based on adverse childhood experience in the form of stress response index as a future health indicator. Electrocardiograph, blood pressure, pulse rate and Salivary Cortisol (SCort) were collected from 23 participants, 12 participants who had adverse childhood experience while the remaining 11 act as the control group. The recording session was done during a Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). HRV features were then extracted from the electrocardiograph (ECG) using time, frequency, time-frequency analysis, and wavelet transform. Following this, genetic algorithm was implemented to select a subset of 12 HRV features from 83 features. Next, the selected HRV features were combined with other biomarkers using parallel and serial fusion for performance comparison. Using Support Vector Machine (SVM), results showed that fused feature of the parallel fusion, so-called Euclidean distance (ed), demonstrated the highest performance with 80.0% accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity and 78.3% specificity. Finally, the fused feature of the Euclidean distance was fed into SVM in order to model the stress response index as an indicator for future health. This index was validated using all samples and achieved 91.3% accuracy. From this study, a new method based on HRV-SCort biomarker using Euclidean distance and SVM named as ed-SVM was proven to be an effective method to classify the stress response and could further be used to model a stress response index.

This has implied the growing demand of Computer Vision algorithms for automatic diet assessment to treat or prevent food related diseases. However, the intrinsic variability of food, makes the research in this field incredibly challenging. Although many papers about classification or recognition of food images have been published in recent years, the literature lacks of works which address volume and calories estimation problem. Since an ideal food understanding engine should be able to provide information about nutritional values, the knowledge of the volume is essential. Differently from the state-of-art works, in this paper we address the problem of volume estimation through Learning to Rank algorithms. Our idea is to work with a predefined set of possible portion size and exploit a ranking approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to sort food images according to the volume. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first work where food volume analysis is treated as a raking problem. To validate the proposed methodology we introduce a new dataset of 99 food images related to 11 food plates.

This study investigates the performance of a novel neural network technique called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in the price forecasting problem. Keeping in view the risk associated with electricity markets with highly volatile prices, relying on a single technique is not so profitable. Therefore ELM has been coupled with the Wavelet technique to develop a hybrid model termed as WELM (wavelet based ELM) to improve the forecasting accuracy as well as reliability. In this way, the unique features of each tool are combined to capture different patterns in the data. The robustness of the model is further enhanced using the ensembling technique.

To overcome this we proposed two techniques for feature reduction based on word clustering and selection. A number of word similarity measures are proposed for clustering words for the Named Entity Recognition task. A few corpus based statistical measures are used for important word selection. The feature reduction techniques lead to a substantial performance improvement over baseline Maximum Entropy technique.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "P08-1056", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Annual Meeting Of The Association For Computational Linguistics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2132903501", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1085832", "115174", "60779558", "14087384", "11664683", "15548439", "17145806"], "inbound_citations": ["2674066", "215155569", "31186457", "17559511", "8845638", "58026898", "24695530", "4650241", "18086628", "18331113", "214887414"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5125030"}

Nonetheless, FAME analysis has a limited resolution for discrimination of bacteria at the species level. In this paper, we approach the species classification problem from a taxonomic point of view. Such a taxonomy or tree is typically obtained by applying clustering algorithms on FAME data or on 16S rRNA gene data. The knowledge gained from the tree can then be used to evaluate FAME-based classifiers, resulting in a novel framework for bacterial species classification. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In view of learning in a taxonomic framework, we consider two types of trees. First, a FAME tree is constructed with a supervised divisive clustering algorithm. Subsequently, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, phylogenetic trees are inferred by the NJ and UPGMA methods. In this second approach, the species classification problem is based on the combination of two different types of data. Herein, 16S rRNA gene sequence data is used for phylogenetic tree inference and the corresponding binary tree splits are learned based on FAME data. We call this learning approach 'phylogenetic learning'. Supervised Random Forest models are developed to train the classification tasks in a stratified cross-validation setting. In this way, better classification results are obtained for species that are typically hard to distinguish by a single or flat multi-class classification model. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: FAME-based bacterial species classification is successfully evaluated in a taxonomic framework. Although the proposed approach does not improve the overall accuracy compared to flat multi-class classification, it has some distinct advantages. First, it has better capabilities for distinguishing species on which flat multi-class classification fails.

To maintain the performance level of these models, models should adapt to handle the existence of adrift.

Once a drift is detected, new retraining data is composed from the old and new concept. IKCD is tested using synthetic and real benchmark datasets from various domains, which demonstrate the different drift types and with different rate of change.

In this paper, we show a simple but fast method for modeling a linear granular support vector machine by splitting the feature space to two smaller subspaces and then building a SVM for each of them. The hyperplane used to halve the feature space is searched by applying the extended statistical margin maximization principle along the direction orthogonal to the first principle component.

The experimental results show that finding the splitting hyperplane is not a trivial task and the linear GSVM is even a little better than the optimized RBF-SVM in terms of testing accuracy, but the linear GSVM is more robust against noises, more stable to model parameters, and runs much faster.
