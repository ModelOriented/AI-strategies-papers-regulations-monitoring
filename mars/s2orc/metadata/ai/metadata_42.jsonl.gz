The algorithm mimics the principles of bat sonar in finding its targets. The algorithm introduces three search approaches. The first search approach considers a single sonar unit (SSU) with a fixed beam length and a single starting point. In this approach, although the results converge toward the optimum fitness, it is not guaranteed to find the global optimum solution especially for complex problems; it is satisfied with finding 'acceptably good' solutions to these problems. The second approach considers multisonar units (MSU) working in parallel in the same state space. Each unit has its own starting point and tries to find the optimum solution. In this approach the probability that the algorithm converges toward the optimum solution is significantly increased. It is found that this approach is suitable for complex functions and for problems of wide state space. In the third approach, a single sonar unit with a moment (SSM) is used in order to handle the problem of convergence toward a local optimum rather than a global optimum. The momentum term is added to the length of the transmitted beams. This will give the chance to find the best fitness in a wider range within the state space. In this paper a comparison between the proposed algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) has been made. It showed that both of the algorithms can catch approximately the optimum solutions for all of the testbed functions except for the function that has a local minimum, in which the proposed algorithm's result is much better than that of the GA algorithm. On the other hand, the comparison showed that the required execution time to obtain the optimum solution using the proposed algorithm is much less than that of the GA algorithm.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": "1211.0730", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1871942156", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["30303951", "67706417", "11748145", "13195964", "23682892", "60504238", "36824634", "17497285"], "inbound_citations": ["214794831", "5823445"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18609179"}

Crop mapping and time series analysis of agronomic cycles are critical for monitoring land use and land management practices, and analysing the issues of agro-environmental impacts and climate change. Multi-temporal Landsat data can be used to analyse decadal changes in cropping patterns at field level, owing to its medium spatial resolution and historical availability. This study attempts to develop robust remote sensing techniques, applicable across a large geographic extent, for state-wide mapping of cropping history in Queensland, Australia. In this context, traditional pixel-based classification was analysed in comparison with image object-based classification using advanced supervised machine-learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). For the Darling Downs region of southern Queensland we gathered a set of Landsat TM images from the 2010\u20132011 cropping season. Landsat data, along with the vegetation index images, were subjected to multiresolution segmentation to obtain polygon objects. Object-based methods enabled the analysis of aggregated sets of pixels, and exploited shape-related and textural variation, as well as spectral characteristics. SVM models were chosen after examining three shape-based parameters, twenty-three textural parameters and ten spectral parameters of the objects. We found that the object-based methods were superior to the pixel-based methods for classifying 4 major landuse/land cover classes, considering the complexities of within field spectral heterogeneity and spectral mixing. Comparative analysis clearly revealed that higher overall classification accuracy (95%) was observed in the object-based SVM compared with that of traditional pixel-based classification (89%) using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Object-based classification also resulted speckle-free images. Further, object-based SVM models were used to classify different broadacre crop types for summer and winter seasons. The influence of different shape, textural and spectral variables, and their weights on crop-mapping accuracy, was also examined. Temporal change in the spectral characteristics, specifically through vegetation indices derived from multi-temporal Landsat data, was found to be the most critical information that affects the accuracy of classification. However, use of these variables was constrained by the data availability and cloud cover.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B7-185-2012", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2098242727", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["129641942", "54741771", "207165665", "89141", "109089316", "961425", "131353635", "29447617", "129770830", "62638056", "84755822", "121796943", "21946226", "11625727", "3093707", "2357415", "129382994", "17377572", "128773930", "16597488", "7820046", "117643475", "45006688"], "inbound_citations": ["42342266", "204838392", "18433816", "91693324", "5647576", "59232689", "59232054", "197447719", "213682343", "16560581"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11820803"}

The majority of current approaches are non-parametric, learning the metric space directly through the supervision of similar (pairs) or relatively similar (triplets) sets of images. A difficult challenge for training these approaches is mining informative samples of images as the metric space is learned with only the local context present within a single mini-batch. Alternative approaches use parametric metric learning to eliminate the need for sampling through supervision of images to proxies. Although this simplifies optimization, such proxy-based approaches have lagged behind in performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a standard classification network can be transformed into a variant of proxy-based metric learning that is competitive against non-parametric approaches across a wide variety of image retrieval tasks. We address key challenges in proxy-based metric learning such as performance under extreme classification and describe techniques to stabilize and learn higher dimensional embeddings. We evaluate our approach on the CAR-196, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Online Product, and In-Shop datasets for image retrieval and clustering.

However, in many applications, large-scale applications embedded in high-dimensional feature space may induce both computation and storage requirements to grow quadratically. In order to tackle these challenges, in this paper, we intend to establish a robust metric learning formulation with the expectation that online metric learning and parallel optimization can solve large-scale and high-dimensional data efficiently, respectively. Specifically, based on the matrix factorization strategy, the first step aims to learn a similarity function in the objective formulation for similarity measurement; in the second step, we derive a variational trace norm to promote low-rankness on the transformation matrix. After converting this variational regularization into its separable form, for the model optimization, we present an parallel block coordinate descent method to learn the optimal metric parameters, which can handle the high-dimensional data in an efficient way. Crucially, our method shares the efficiency and flexibility of block coordinate descent method, and it is also guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution.

In contrast, many domains of interest are inherently multi-relational, consisting of entities connected by a rich set of relations. For example, the participants in a social network are linked by friendships, collaborations, and shared interests. Likewise, the users of a search engine are related by searches for similar items and clicks to shared sites. The ability to model and reason about such relations is essential not only because better predictive accuracy is achieved by exploiting this additional information, but also because frequently the goal is to predict whether a set of entities are related in a particular way. This thesis falls within the area of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL), which combines ideas from two traditions within artificial intelligence, first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models, to address the challenge of learning from multi-relational data. We build on one particular SRL model, Markov logic networks (MLNs), which consist of a set of weighted first-order-logic formulae and provide a principled way of defining a probability distribution over possible worlds. We develop algorithms for learning of MLN structure both from scratch and by transferring a previously learned model, as well as an application of MLNs to the problem of Web query disambiguation. The ideas we present are unified by two main themes: the need to deal with limited training data and the use of bottom-up learning techniques. ::: Structure learning, the task of automatically acquiring a set of dependencies among the relations in the domain, is a central problem in SRL. We introduce BUSL, an algorithm for learning MLN structure from scratch that proceeds in a more bottom-up fashion, breaking away from the tradition of top-down learning typical in SRL. Our approach first constructs a novel data structure called a Markov network template that is used to restrict the search space for clauses. Our experiments in three relational domains demonstrate that BUSL dramatically reduces the search space for clauses and attains a significantly higher accuracy than a structure learner that follows a top-down approach. ::: Accurate and efficient structure learning can also be achieved by transferring a model obtained in a source domain related to the current target domain of interest. We view transfer as a revision task and present an algorithm that diagnoses a source MLN to determine which of its parts transfer directly to the target domain and which need to be updated. This analysis focuses the search for revisions on the incorrect portions of the source structure, thus speeding up learning. Transfer learning is particularly important when target-domain data is limited, such as when data on only a few individuals is available from domains with hundreds of entities connected by a variety of relations. We also address this challenging case and develop a general transfer learning approach that makes effective use of such limited target data in several social network domains. ::: Finally, we develop an application of MLNs to the problem of Web query disambiguation in a more privacy-aware setting where the only information available about a user is that captured in a short search session of 5\u20136 previous queries on average. This setting contrasts with previous work that typically assumes the availability of long user-specific search histories. To compensate for the scarcity of user-specific information, our approach exploits the relations between users, search terms, and URLs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the presence of noise and show that it outperforms several natural baselines on a large data set collected from the MSN search engine.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1849811180", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60807799"}

RVM is a state-of-the-art soft computing technique that has been rarely utilized in joint shear strength assessment. To establish the hybrid intelligent model, three-dimensional scanning tests and direct shear tests on 36 granite joint specimens were conducted. The peak shear strength ratio () is perceived as an explanation of four types of influencing factors, including joint surface roughness, strength of rock material, basic friction angle, and normal stress. In particular, the compressive strength and tensile strength of rock material are first considered together. A total of 36 experimental data were used in this study to train the RVM model to predict the peak shear strength of rock joints. The performance of the RVM model was assessed using the direct shear test data of rock joints collected from previous researches.

We investigate photometric classification techniques on stars and galaxies with intrinsic FWHM<0.2 arcsec. We consider unsupervised spectral energy distribution template fitting and supervised, data-driven Support Vector Machines (SVM). For template fitting, we use a Maximum Likelihood (ML) method and a new Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method, which learns the prior distribution of template probabilities from the data. SVM requires training data to classify unknown sources; ML and HB don't. We consider i.) a best-case scenario (SVM_best) where the training data is (unrealistically) a random sampling of the data in both signal-to-noise and demographics, and ii.) a more realistic scenario where training is done on higher signal-to-noise data (SVM_real) at brighter apparent magnitudes. Testing with COSMOS ugriz data we find that HB outperforms ML, delivering ~80% completeness, with purity of ~60-90% for both stars and galaxies, respectively. We find no algorithm delivers perfect performance, and that studies of metal-poor main-sequence turnoff stars may be challenged by poor star-galaxy separation. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, we find a best-to-worst ranking of SVM_best, HB, ML, and SVM_real.

Our ML approach uses a predictive model to generate accurate energy demand forecasts and automated analyses that can guide optimization of building operations. In parallel, an automated online evaluation system monitors efficiency at multiple stages in the system workflow and provides building operators with continuous feedback. We implemented a prototype of this application in a large commercial building in Manhattan. Our predictive machine learning model applies Support Vector Regression (SVR) to the building's historical energy use and temperature and wet-bulb humidity data from the building's interior and exterior in order to model performance for each day. This predictive model closely approximates actual energy usage values, with some seasonal and occupant-specific variability, and the dependence of the data on day-of-the-week makes the model easily applicable to different types of buildings with minimal adjustment. In parallel, an automated online evaluator monitors the building's internal and external conditions, control actions and the results of those actions. Intelligent real-time data quality analysis components quickly detect anomalies and automatically transmit feedback to building management, who can then take necessary preventive or corrective actions.

Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting provides a promising solution to localize an object in indoor environments. Among the factors challenging the RSS fingerprinting based algorithms are the site survey cost and the time-varying environment, given the unreliable signal qualities. Here we present a novel approach to indoor object positioning using the manifold assumption on the radio map in RSS-location space. Thinking the measured RSS from one access point (AP) in different locations are randomly drawn from a nonlinear manifold (ground truth), we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) style algorithm to reconstruct the sparse representation of this manifold from the noisy RSS observations. Motivated by the observation that the radio map has a strong local correlation in the RSS-location space, we introduce a multi-scale constrained quadratic programming to approximate the manifold. Within limited iterations, we can estimate the ground truth RSS values and parameters simultaneously. As a result, the learned manifold is exploited to predict the object's position: we develop a positioning algorithm by minimizing the manifold distortion effort which integrates both measurement error and manifold shape preservation.

As a test case, we consider the flooding event of the Richelieu River that occurred in the Monteregie region of Quebec (Canada) from April to June 2011. Experimental results highlight the potential of the bistatic InSAR coherence for more accurate flood mapping in a complex landscape with urban and vegetation areas. The classification results of the SAR-derived flood map with respect to the LISFLOOD-FP flood map reach an OA of 78.65% and a Precision of 82.08% when integrating the bistatic InSAR coherence.

Generally, these partitions are called communities. Detecting community structure helps data scientists to extract meaningful information from networks and analyze them. In the last decades, various algorithms have been proposed to detect communities in graphs, and each one has examined this issue from a different perspective. Yet, most of these algorithms have a significant time complexity and costly calculations that make them unsuitable to detect communities in large graphs with millions of edges and nodes. Label propagation algorithm (LPA), a fast random-based algorithm, can easily detect communities in big graphs, but its accuracy compared to other algorithms is low. In this paper, we have improved LPA accuracy, and to achieve this goal, we propagate label based on the Local Edge Betweenness score. The proposed algorithm, named Weighted Label Propagation based on Local Edge Betweenness, is able to identify distinct communities in both the real-world and artificial networks.

Feature Selection (FS) is an important pre-processing step in machine learning and it reduces the number of features/variables used to describe each member of a dataset. Such reduction occurs by eliminating some of the non-discriminating and redundant features and selecting a subset of the existing features with higher discriminating power among various classes in the data. In this paper, we formulate the feature selection as a bi-objective optimization problem of some real-valued weights corresponding to each feature. A subset of the weighted features is thus selected as the best subset for subsequent classification of the data. Two information theoretic measures, known as relevancy and redundancy are chosen for designing the objective functions for a very competitive Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) algorithm called Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). We experimentally determine the best possible constraints on the weights to be optimized. We evaluate the proposed bi-objective feature selection and weighting framework on a set of 15 standard datasets by using the popular k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. As is evident from the experimental results, our method appears to be quite competitive to some of the state-of-the-art FS methods of current interest.

After this optimization, investigation of the relevancy of SVR to superresolution proceeds with the possibility of using a single and general support vector regression for all image content, and the results are impressive for small training sets. This idea is improved upon by observing structural properties in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain to aid in learning the regression. Further improvement involves a combination of classification and SVR-based techniques, extending works in resolution synthesis. This method, termed kernel resolution synthesis, uses specific regressors for isolated image content to describe the domain through a partitioned look of the vector space, thereby yielding good results.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17547137", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2007.896644", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1981199328", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15995703", "122425788", "1196087", "62542931", "8566998", "120600643", "14301177", "16375380", "6627072", "967444", "5107363", "5497081", "6890377", "15542893", "40287029", "11209184", "7138354", "60486887", "54131298", "984304", "7562645", "15477997", "12498991", "3049471", "5344737", "37925315", "12725766", "5909190", "5239913", "2692398", "43158592", "8789453"], "inbound_citations": ["215548025", "815930", "5007122", "120516158", "6429725", "767288", "17580448", "17952606", "42633720", "17411917", "10982194", "15627449", "43929874", "9478502", "86424869", "4303964", "11153429", "32763911", "3707987", "54206477", "9029253", "1080934", "22324150", "8459668", "53095990", "203581380", "2126140", "12431215", "688000", "1190504", "1621779", "15050446", "4485419", "15764304", "1427091", "21494681", "3469261", "1011911", "14029377", "86604131", "34973203", "17985993", "198229444", "13578335", "5727028", "4860965", "53875082", "14531536", "204801078", "16217141", "14465504", "214753476", "125089364", "3707471", "3241205", "33862364", "1348491", "15096052", "148572603", "5882953", "1675333", "15043590", "13294738", "9476140", "12713070", "4234951", "23995366", "16815357", "38206070", "2731788", "16019728", "14925285", "4899565", "13808488", "16101021", "11377745", "207973326", "14368346", "8020509", "53243615", "342781", "5703421", "23249750", "10210184", "18317416", "73640614", "5897618", "36054153", "4919199", "4880928", "15897521", "3523061", "7217848", "11267516", "15512799", "2446147", "9465365", "1275833", "17513644", "1385790", "36397451", "3708483", "73441624", "25121719", "8010572", "811324", "2635022", "18228257", "6270983", "10374159", "34767335", "207946945", "17624312", "14191835", "14268437", "19226243", "7508745", "208827658", "7857731", "9090498", "2187266", "21019897", "14710664", "12839666", "5962847", "14070228", "40860520", "46685011", "17225498", "6194422", "62769970", "7634910", "59455480", "14806479", "55038592", "4925175", "206770119", "9852946", "34514035", "90260156"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10298565"}

However, these methods require visual quality control and manual localization of the region of interest (ROI) of ascending (AA) and proximal descending (PDA) aorta, which limit the analysis in large-scale population-based studies. Using 5100 scans from UK Biobank, this study sought to develop and validate a fully automated method to 1) detect and locate the ROIs of AA and PDA, and 2) provide a quality control mechanism. Methods The automated AA and PDA detection-localization algorithm followed these steps: 1) foreground segmentation; 2) detection of candidate ROIs by Circular Hough Transform (CHT); 3) spatial, histogram and shape feature extraction for candidate ROIs; 4) AA and PDA detection using Random Forest (RF); 5) quality control based on RF detection probability. To provide the ground truth, overall image quality (IQ = 0\u20133 from poor to good) and aortic locations were visually assessed by 13 observers. The automated algorithm was trained on 1200 scans and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was used to calculate the agreement between ground truth and automatically detected ROIs. Results The automated algorithm was tested on 3900 scans. Detection accuracy was 99.4% for AA and 99.8% for PDA. Aorta localization showed excellent agreement with the ground truth, with DSC \u2265 0.9 in 94.8% of AA (DSC = 0.97 \u00b1 0.04) and 99.5% of PDA cases (DSC = 0.98 \u00b1 0.03). AA\u00d7PDA detection probabilities could discriminate scans with IQ \u2265 1 from those severely corrupted by artefacts (AUC = 90.6%). If scans with detection probability < 0.75 were excluded (350 scans), the algorithm was able to correctly detect and localize AA and PDA in all the remaining 3550 scans (100% accuracy). Conclusion The proposed method for automated AA and PDA localization was extremely accurate and the automatically derived detection probabilities provided a robust mechanism to detect low quality scans for further human review.

Methods We predicted its potential distribution in Hawaii using five biophysical variables derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as predictors, presence/absence data collected from Puerto Rico and Hawaii and three classification methods \u2010 Classification Trees (CT), Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Results Models developed separately using data from the native range and the invaded range predicted potential coqui habitats in Hawaii with high performance.

Main conclusions Our results showed that the potential distribution of coquis on the island of Hawaii is much larger than its current distribution, with RF predicting up to 49% of the island as suitable coqui habitat. Predictions also show that most areas with an elevation between 0 and 2000 m are suitable coqui habitats, whereas the cool and dry high elevation areas beyond 2000 m elevation are unsuitable.

Our classification approach uses a novel combination of Support Vector Machines and Adaboost which exploits the strong structure of faces to select and train on the optimal set of features for each attribute. We show state-of-the-art classification results compared to previous works, and demonstrate the power of our architecture through a functional, large-scale face search engine.

Given the small di-jet invariant mass separation between the W and the Z resonances, the production of WW events where one W decays leptonically and the second W decays into an heavy flavor jet (e.i.

This search uses data collected with the CDF II detector at the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 7.5 fb^-1. Events consistent with the signature of a charged lepton (electron or muon), large missing transverse energy and exactly two jets, of which at least one is required to contain a secondary vertex displaced from the jet origin, are selected.

Recently, text-to-speech synthesis using STFT spectra has been investigated since it can avoid quality degradation caused by the vocoder-based parameterization in conventional SPSS using a vocoder. In conventional SPSS using a vocoder, we previously proposed a training algorithm for integrating generative adversarial network (GAN)-based distribution compensation. To extend the algorithm to vocoder-free SPSS, we propose low- and multi-resolution GAN-based training algorithms for vocoder-free SPSS. In our algorithm that uses the low-resolution GAN, acoustic models are trained to minimize the weighted sum of the mean squared error between natural and generated spectra in the original resolution and adversarial loss to deceive discriminative models in the lower resolution. Since the low-resolution spectra are close to filter banks and their distribution becomes simpler, GAN-based distribution compensation works well. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm using multi-resolution GANs, which uses both the low-resolution GAN and original-resolution GAN. Experimental results demonstrate that 1) the low-resolution GAN works robustly to the setting of its frequency resolution and hyperparameter, and 2) compared the low-, original-, and multi-resolution GANs, the low-resolution GAN works the best to improve synthetic speech quality.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461714", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2807065297", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62244548", "3232238", "16664621", "15120427", "18151124", "3570465", "33895269", "8528062", "6254678", "14254027", "206602390", "3211811", "20317421", "19888176", "1033682", "14206014", "12597237", "9718310", "20082504", "1237347", "2239473", "538820", "1915014", "1463476", "2132511"], "inbound_citations": ["73729172", "197935177", "208548410", "145024804", "211126750", "49671039", "53102801"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52285310"}

In doing so, we do not require a CAD model of the object but rather rely on a point cloud object model (PCOM). Our approach involves learning motion models that are specific to contact models. Contact models encode the contacts seen during training time and allow generating similar contacts at prediction time. Predicting on familiar ground reduces the motion models' sample complexity while using local contact information for prediction increases their transferability. In extensive experiments in simulation, our approach is capable of transfer learning for various test objects, outperforming a baseline predictor.

However, the UAV communication environments are not only harsh, but are also confronted with the threats of smart attackers, which pose great barriers in maintaining the links unblocked. In this paper, we leverage the paradigm of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to formulate an attack-resilient connectivity game between a pair of neighboring UAVs and an attacker. In the three-agent adversary game, the attacker acts as the generator, which attempts to generate highly approximate information as the UAVs so as to maximize its jamming capability; while the pairwise UAVs act as the discriminators, which attempt to enhance the capability of refusing the fake information (i.e., the opponent's attack). As the state-of-the-art GAN learning algorithms suffer from the instability dilemma (i.e., either with the unsuccessful convergence or with the low generation/discrimination performance), we incorporate the conditional GAN with the least square objective loss function as well as the mean square error such that the attacker can improve the detection capability from UAVs' historical activity patterns and the UAVs can accordingly adjust the connectivity strategy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through extensive evaluations.

Staphylococci are one of the most frequently found bacteria in food industry and hospitals. However, an expert is needed for such count. He needs to perform at least 10 visual counts, which cause eye strain and are time consuming. This research proposes the developed software, namely Micros-Staph, to aid in the microscopic count of these bacteria as well as the size measurement of the individual cell using extracted features from image processing techniques. These features are used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) to differentiate the bacterial colony from noises in the images. Therefore, the number of colony can be easily counted. The cell size is obtained by comparing the number of pixels on the stage micrometer with the cell bounding box at the smallest area found after angle rotation. The experimental results show that the extracted features can be used to count the number of colony effectively. The number of colony counted by SVM provides a linear relationship with those counted by the experts at the correlation value (r 2 ) of 0.99 and 0.98 for the images captured with 400 and 1,000 times of magnification, respectively. Additionally, the time of microscopic count spent by the Micros-Staph software is reduced by more than half.

The isometric mapping algorithm (Isomap) is an important algorithm for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, which originates from the traditional dimensionality reduction algorithm MDS. The MDS algorithm is based on maintaining the distance between the samples in the original space and the distance between the samples in the lower dimensional space; the distance used here is Euclidean distance, and the Isomap algorithm discards the Euclidean distance, and calculates the shortest path between samples by Floyd algorithm to approximate the geodesic distance along the manifold surface. Compared with the previous nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, the Isomap algorithm can effectively compute a global optimal solution, and it can ensure that the data manifold converges to the real structure asymptotically.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4236/jcc.2019.712002", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Computational Chemistry", "mag_id": "2992760655", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214483331"}

In other words, in practice the diversity of resources generating objects have imposed several challenges for decision maker to determine informative data in terms of time, model capability, scalability and knowledge discovery. ::: Thus, it is highly desirable to be able to extract patterns of interest that support the decision of data management. Clustering, among other machine learning approaches, is an important data engineering technique that empowers the automatic discovery of similar object\u2019s clusters and the ::: consequent assignment of new unseen objects to appropriate clusters. In this context, the majority of current research does not completely address the true structure and nature of data for particular application at hand. In contrast to most previous research, our proposed work focuses on the modeling and classification of spherical data that are naturally generated in many data mining and knowledge discovery applications. Thus, in this thesis we propose several estimation and feature selection frameworks based on Langevin distribution which are devoted to spherical patterns in offline and online settings. ::: In this thesis, we first formulate a unified probabilistic framework, where we build probabilistic kernels based on Fisher score and information divergences from finite Langevin mixture for Support Vector Machine. We are motivated by the fact that the blending of generative and discriminative approaches has prevailed by exploring and adopting distinct characteristic of each approach ::: toward constructing a complementary system combining the best of both. ::: Due to the high demand to construct compact and accurate statistical models that are automatically adjustable to dynamic changes, next in this thesis, we propose probabilistic frameworks for high-dimensional spherical data modeling based on finite Langevin mixtures that allow simultaneous clustering and feature selection in offline and online settings. To this end, we adopted finite mixture models which have long been heavily relied on deterministic learning approaches such as maximum likelihood estimation. Despite their successful utilization in wide spectrum of areas, these approaches have several drawbacks as we will discuss in this thesis. An alternative approach is the adoption of Bayesian inference that naturally addresses data uncertainty while ensuring good generalization. To address this issue, we also propose a Bayesian approach for finite Langevin mixture model estimation and selection. ::: When data change dynamically and grow drastically, finite mixture is not always a feasible solution. ::: In contrast with previous approaches, which suppose an unknown finite number of mixture components, we finally propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach which assumes an infinite ::: number of components.

Principal component analysis was used in the entire wavelength range to reduce the dimension of Raman spectroscopy data. The Mahalanobis distance between reduced-dimension spectra was calculated and discrimination analysis models were established based on ward's calculation. The entire wavelength range was used as the input of LS-SVM, to select a kernel radial basis function(RBF) that could alleviate non-linear issues. The kernel RBF was optimized at the same time via interactive authentication. The LS-SVM discrimination model was established based on the optimized kernel RBF function. The result showed that Raman spectroscopy coupled with LS-SVM could 100% accurately identify both production origin and wine age. The correction rates of Raman spectroscopy coupled with DA to discriminate Chinese rice wines from among Jiashan, Shaoxing, and Shanghai origins were 100%, 80%, and 80%, respectively, while that to determine wine age was 100% for all samples.

{"paper_id": "59926855", "title": "Indian Theories of Knowledge Compared with Western Theories and Artificial Intelligence", "authors": [{"first": "Girish", "middle": ["Nath"], "last": "Jha", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "ABSTRACT The paper while surveying the Western and Indian epistemological theories, presents a comparison of the Nyaya (NN) treatment of knowledge with that of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Looking for newer definitions of knowledge with matching representation techniques has been the main concern of AI and Cognitive Science (Cog-Sci) researchers. Since most efforts in knowledge modeling have resulted in disappointments, there has been a shift in the major goals and approaches towards AI and Cog-Sci. On the goals side, there are now smaller objectives than high flying ones. On the approach side, there is a growing realization that traditional wisdom in ancient philosophies might have an answer to the complex problem. Therefore, the present paper is trying to put together the Indian views on knowledge in general and compare the NN techniques with those of the AI to see if the former can benefit the latter. I. INTRODUCTION In the era of Fifth generation computing, there has been a tremendous effort to simulate intelligent behavior in machines. There are two ways in which the researchers are trying to solve this problem--by the grammar based computing in which the Knowledge of Language (KOL) is sought to be given to machines for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) or Processing (NLP), and by way of knowledge based computing in which the background/contextual or Real World Knowledge (RWK) is sought to be represented in machine for understanding real world situations and problem solving. There is a growing realization that for simulating intelligence in machines RWK representation is essential. However, so far no single framework applicable to all knowledge types, identities of the locus, object, and instrument of cognition could be evolved. Growing skepticism on these counts has led many AI researchers wonder whether * knowledge can be represented * computers can en/de-code knowledge in ordinary language * computers can think and understand * computers need knowledge to interact with people or other machines In India, particularly in the Sanskrit language, there are definitive accounts of both the KOL and RWK. Panini's grammar, though definitely relevant for RWK., is actually an account of KOL which can serve as a model for other languages as well. The NN system provides one of the earliest accounts of RWK which is not very dissimilar to those of the AL philosophers. In this light, it is imperative to see what the NN system has to offer. Therefore, the paper attempts to juxtapose the Indian epistemological tradition, the NN in particular with that of the Artificial Intelligence 2. WESTERN EPISTEMOLOGY The western view on knowledge has centered round where knowledge is given (a priori--\"from what is before\") or acquired (posteriori--\"from what is after\"). While the former evolved into rationalistic mode of inquiry, the latter evolved into the empiricist mode. Plato argues that there is an awareness of absolute, universal ideas or forms, existing independent of any subject try in; to apprehend to them. Aristotle puts more emphasis on logical and empirical methods for gathering knowledge. He also accepts the view that knowledge is an apprehension of necessary and universal principles. The early rationalists--Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz--considered deductive reasoning based on axioms as the main source of knowledge. For the early empiricists--Francis Bacon and John Locke--the main source and Final test of knowledge was sense perception. While Berkeley agreed with Locke's views on sourcing knowledge to ideas, he rejected the separation of ideas from objects. Hume, an empiricist, disagreed with Berkeley's conclusion that knowledge can be sourced from ideas only. Hume divided all knowledge into two kinds (Distante 2003): relations of ideas * the knowledge found in mathematics and logic * this knowledge is exact and certain but provides no information about the world. \u2026", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "182291288", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59926855"}

To perform load balancing techniques in cloud computing environments, various challenges such as data security, and proper distribution exist which requires serious attention. The most important challenge posed by cloud applicationsis the provision of Quality of Service (QoS) provision as it develops the problem of resource allocation to the application so as to guarantee a service level along dimensions such as performance, availability and reliability. A centralized hierarchical Cloud-based Multimedia System (CMS) consisting of a resource manager, cluster heads, and server clusters is being considered by which the resource manager assigns clients' requests to server clusters for performing multimedia service tasks based on the job features after which each the job is assigned to the servers within its server cluster by the cluster head. Designing an effective load balancing algorithm for CMS however being a complicated and challenging task, enables spreading of multimedia service job load on servers at the minimal cost for transmitting multimedia data between server clusters and clients without exceeding the maximal load limit of each server cluster. In the present work, the Multiple Kernel Learning with Support Vector Machine (MKL-SVM) approach is proposed to quantify the disturbance in the utilization of multiple resources on a resource manager at client side and then verifying at the server side in the each cluster. Also, Fuzzy Simple Additive Weighting (FSAW) method is introduced for QoS provision for improving the system performance. The proposed model CMSdynMLB serves as the multiservice load balancing while considering the integer linear programming problem having unevenness measurement. In order to solve the problem of dynamic load balancing, Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HSPO) is proposed as it holds well for dynamic problems.

Cycling data of Li-ion batteries under different operating conditions are analyzed, and the critical features are extracted from the voltage and temperature profiles. The classification and regression models for RUL are built based on the critical features using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification model provides a gross estimation, and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used to predict the accurate RUL if the battery is close to the end of life (EOL). By the critical feature extraction and the multistage approach, accurate RUL prediction of multiple batteries is accomplished simultaneously, making the proposed method generic in nature.

Recent internal studies at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulstion Laboratory (JPL) estimate approximately 1\u20135 Terabytes per day of raw data (uncompressed) are expected, for example, from spectroscopy instruments. Implementations of on\u2013board processing algorithms to perform lossless data reduction are required to drastically reduce data volumes to within the downlink capabilities of the spacecraft and existing ground stations. Reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) such as the XilinxTM Virtex\u20134 and Virtex\u20135 series devices can include dual core PowerPC processors thereby providing a flexible hardware and software co\u2013design architecture to meet the on\u2013board processing challenges of these missions while reducing the essential resources of mass and volume of earlier generation flight\u2013qualified computing platforms such as the BAE Rad750 single board computer (SBC). Reconfigurable FPGAs also offer unique advantages over one\u2013time programmable (OTP) FPGAs with flexible prototype development platforms that provide an important \u201cpath\u2013to\u2013flight\u201d for spaceborne instruments. Reconfigurable FPGA technologies also provide in\u2013flight flexibility with the ability to update processing algorithms as needed post\u2013launch. This chapter will discuss these comparative technologies and present the benefits of commercially available FPGA development platforms from Xilinx for the development of NASA\u2019s future on-board processing capabilities. Additionally, commercially available tools such as Impulse CTM have been used to adapt legacy C\u2013code into Verilog or VHDL for implementation in FPGA fabric to achieve hardware acceleration. Key features and requirements of future NASA missions proposed within the National Research Council\u2019s Decadal Survey will be described with ideas on how these reconfigurable FPGA technologies and development tools can combine to achieve breakthrough on\u2013board processing performance to meet their science objectives. To provide specific demonstrations of these ideas, three unique and recent design implementations on the Xilinx V4FX60 and Virtex\u20135 FPGAs targeted to enable future NASA missions will be presented.

Developments in the ensuing decades have solidly established galaxy surveys as a crucial probe of cosmology. In this thesis, I describe my work related to preparations for the next generation of galaxy surveys. ::: ::: In the first part of the thesis, we present catalogs of calibrated photometry and spectroscopic redshifts in the Extended Groth Strip, intended for studies of photometric redshifts (photo-z's). The data includes ugriz photometry from CFHTLS and Y-band photometry from the Subaru Suprime camera, as well as spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2, DEEP3 and 3D-HST surveys. These catalogs incorporate corrections to produce effectively matched-aperture photometry across all bands. We test this catalog with a simple machine learning-based photometric redshift algorithm based upon Random Forest regression, and find that the corrected aperture photometry leads to significant improvement in photo-z accuracy compared to the original SExtractor catalogs from CFHTLS and Subaru. The deep ugrizY photometry and spectroscopic redshifts are well-suited for empirical tests of photometric redshift algorithms for LSST. ::: ::: In the second part of the thesis, we model the redshift-dependent clustering of a DESI-like LRG sample in the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework using photometric redshifts (photo-z's). The LRG sample contains 2.7 million objects over a 5655 square degree area and spans the redshift range of 0.4 < z < 0.9. Highly accurate photo-z's are computed using DECam and WISE photometry. We measure the galaxy clustering with the projected correlation function, rather than the angular correlation function, to make optimal use of the photo-z's. We find that there is little evolution in the host halo properties except at the high-redshift end. The bias evolution is mostly consistent with the simple prescription of constant clustering amplitude.

Working with large volumes of high-dimensio nal acoustic features, the researchers confront the problem of dimensionality reduction. Unlike classical techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a new approach, named Enhanced Lipschitz Embedding (ELE) is proposed in the paper to discover the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie the emotional speech corpus. ELE adopts geodesic distance to preserve the intrinsic geometry at all scales of speech corpus. Based on geodesic distance estimation, ELE embeds the 64-dimensional acoustic features into a six-dimensional space in which speech data with the same emotional state are generally clustered around one plane and the data distribution feature is beneficial to emotion classification. The compressed testing data is classified into six emotional states (neutral, anger, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) by a trained linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) system. Considering the perception constancy of humans, ELE is also investigated in terms of its ability to detect the intrinsic geometry of emotional speech corrupted by noise.

In fact, there have been two recent competitions hosted by internationally prominent search companies to encourage research on ranking web site documents. Recent literature on learning to rank has focused on three approaches: point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Many different kinds of classifiers, including boosted decision trees, neural networks, and SVMs have proven successful in the field. This thesis surveys traditional pointwise techniques that use regression trees for web-search ranking. The thesis contains empirical studies on Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, with novel augmentations to them on real world data sets.

Some recent work has integrated federated and multi-task learning, but such approaches may be impractical and inefficient in the online scenario, e.g., when new mobile devices keep joining the mobile computing system. To address this challenge, we propose OFMTL, an online federated multi-task learning algorithm, which learns the model parameters for the new device without revisiting the data of existing devices. The model parameters are derived by an effective way that combines the information inferred from local data and information borrowed from existing models.

RCNN-CTC is an end-to-end system which can exploit temporal and spectral structures of speech signals simultaneously.

The basic subsystems adopted in the combination are different types and thus mutually complementary to each other. Experimental results show that our proposed single system RCNN-CTC can achieve the lowest word error rate (WER) on WSJ and Tencent Chat data sets, compared to several widely used neural network systems in ASR.

To demonstrate this, we show that boundary statistics provided on a few 2D slices of volumetric medical data, can be propagated through the entire 3D stack of images without using the geometric correspondence between images. In addition, the image segmentation from the CRF can be formulated as a minimum s-t graph cut problem which has a solution that is both globally optimal and fast.

In this paper we present an approach that guides the search of a state-space planner, such as A*, by learning an action-sampling distribution that can generalize across different instances of a planning problem. The motivation is that, unlike typical learning approaches for planning for continuous action space that estimate a policy, an estimated action sampler is more robust to error since it has a planner to fall back on. We use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and address an important issue: search experience consists of a relatively large number of actions that are not on a solution path and a relatively small number of actions that actually are on a solution path.

Based on a linear model, classical Independent Component Analysis (ICA) provides a method of representing data as independent components. In contrast to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which decorrelates the data based on its covariance matrix, ICA uses higher-order statistics of the data to minimize the dependence between the components of the system output. An important application of ICA is blind source separation. However, classical ICA algorithms do not work well for separation in the presence of noise or when performed on-line. Inspired by the psychoacoustic discovery that humans perceive and process acoustic signals in different frequency bands independently, we propose a new algorithm, subband-based ICA, that integrates ICA with time-frequency analysis to separate mixed signals. In subband-based ICA, the separations are performed in parallel in several frequency bands.

In response to the growing information needs of modern water systems, advanced computational models and tools have been devised to identify and extract relevant information from the mass of data that is now available. This chapter presents innovative applications from computational learning science within the fields of hydrology, hydrogeology, hydroclimatology, and water management. The success of machine learning is evident from the growing number of studies involving the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Relevance Vector Machines (RVM), and Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) to address various issues in hydrologic sciences. The applications that will be discussed within the chapter employ the abovementioned machine learning techniques for intelligent modeling of reservoir operations, temporal downscaling of precipitation, spatial downscaling of soil moisture and evapotranspiration, comparisons of various techniques for groundwater quality modeling, and forecasting of chaotic time series behavior. Combinatorial algorithms to capture the intrinsic complexities in the modeled phenomena and to overcome disparate scales are developed; for example, learningmore \u00bb machines have been coupled with geostatistical techniques, non-homogenous hidden Markov models, wavelets, and evolutionary computing techniques.

This disease is caused by an adverse immune response towards chemical haptens, and leads to a substantial economic burden for society. Current test of sensitizing chemicals rely on animal experimentation. New legislations on the registration and use of chemicals within pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries have stimulated significant research efforts to develop alternative, human cell-based assays for the prediction of sensitization. The aim is to replace animal experiments with in vitro tests displaying a higher predictive power.ResultsWe have developed a novel cell-based assay for the prediction of sensitizing chemicals. By analyzing the transcriptome of the human cell line MUTZ-3 after 24 h stimulation, using 20 different sensitizing chemicals, 20 non-sensitizing chemicals and vehicle controls, we have identified a biomarker signature of 200 genes with potent discriminatory ability. Using a Support Vector Machine for supervised classification, the prediction performance of the assay revealed an area under the ROC curve of 0.98. In addition, categorizing the chemicals according to the LLNA assay, this gene signature could also predict sensitizing potency. The identified markers are involved in biological pathways with immunological relevant functions, which can shed light on the process of human sensitization.ConclusionsA gene signature predicting sensitization, using a human cell line in vitro, has been identified. This simple and robust cell-based assay has the potential to completely replace or drastically reduce the utilization of test systems based on experimental animals.

To solve this problem, we first propose a new SVM based approach with a supplementary Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)-like constraint. With this heuristic, source and target data are projected onto a common subspace of a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) where both data distributions are expected to become similar. Therefore, a classifier trained on source data might perform well on target data, if the conditional probabilities of labels are similar for source and target data, which is the main assumption of this paper. We demonstrate that adding this constraint does not change the quadratic nature of the optimization problem, so we can use common quadratic optimization tools. Secondly, using the same idea that rendering source and target data similar might ensure efficient transfer learning, and with the same assumption, a Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) based transfer learning method is proposed. Different from the first heuristic, this second method ensures other higher order moments to be aligned in the RKHS, which leads to better performances. Here again, we select MMD as the similarity measure. Then, a linear transformation is also applied to further improve the alignment between source and target data.

This problem in diagnosis, has attracted researchers to design medical decision support systems with higher accuracy. In this paper, a clinical decision support system, based on Genetic Algorithm and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed for the diagnosis of diabetes disease using Pima Indian Diabetes dataset of UCI machine learning repository with improved accuracy. Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used for the selection of the most significant feature set of the dataset. Classification is performed using ELM. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed based on several parameters such as classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using 10-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix. The accuracy of the proposed system is found to be superior to that of the other existing systems in the literature. Diabetes is one of the major health challenges which is highly complex and complicated to diagnose for the past few decades. It is caused due to the improper production of insulin in the human body. Insulin is the key parameter responsible to regulate glucose. It leads to many other risks, including kidney disease, blindness, heart disease and never damages. Diagnosis of Diabetes can be done through routine blood checkup. Diabetes can be controlled by proper food habits and exercise program in order to reduce the given risks. Still there is no permanent cure for Diabetes. Diagnosis of diabetes needs special effort for any physician with prior knowledge of the symptoms and deep analysis of the patient\"s history. Thus to make the diagnosis easier and faster, many machine learning techniques are designed for the automatic diagnosis of Diabetes. Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as Synthetic Intelligence, is a branch of engineering associated with the computational behavior or intelligent behavior. Essential part of AI in recent years is to simulate human intelligence. Machine Learning is a branch of AI which aims in providing knowledge to such intelligent systems. Machine learning consists of a huge number of algorithms to design and analyze any kind of datasets. Machine Learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In Supervised learning, data are trained and predicted based on the training. Here, the function is created based on training samples and test on unknown samples. In unsupervised learning, system remains untrained. Decision support systems in the field of medical diagnosis have increased in recent decades. Design of medical expert systems has created more interest among researchers all over the world. Medical expert systems use machine learning techniques for the prediction of any disease based on their existence. Pattern recognition and data mining provide useful retrieval of medical data with the combination of such techniques. Most common data mining technique for decision making from real world data is classification. Usage of data directly could affect the system performance.

Method/Analysis: A model of hybrid face recognition system based on CBIR and SVM is proposed. The feature vectors from the face image database are generated by using Gabor wavelet (GW), wavelet Transformation (WT), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For the face image retrieval purpose, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is adopted and its performance on the retrieval process is evaluated with PCA, WT, GW and their fusion as a feature vector. The query image is recognized from the faces returned by retrieval process by using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results indicate that the fusion of PCA, WT and GW features as a feature vector performs reasonably well for retrieval and recognition process. The experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach for face recognition over existing methods when considering different performance measures such as system running time, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and recognition accuracy. The proposed model was evaluated with two face databases viz. Unconstrained Facial Image (UFI) and Oracle Research Laboratory (ORL) face database with a recognition accuracy of 95.42% and 98.75% respectively. Finding: The proposed system has been tested for retrieval and recognition and found with reasonable retrieval time and high recognition rate. Novelty/Improvement: The conventional model-based face recognition systems are limited in several aspects, like (1) It is usually time-consuming and expensive to collect a large amount of training facial images, (2) It is usually difficult to generalize the models when new training data or new persons are added, in which an intensive retraining process is usually required and (3) The recognition performance often scales poorly when the number of persons/ classes are very large.

Most biological, chemical and physical interactions take place in the CZ, and it is here that most terrestrial life is found. Being able to predict the thickness of the pedosphere (i.e. soil thickness, from the mineral soil surface down to bedrock) in the CZ can lead to a better understanding of rates of physical/chemical change, such as carbon sequestration, soil erosion, and water storage. The objective of this study was to accurately map the thickness of the pedosphere on a landscape scale for a ca. 3400 km 2 landscape in Southern British Columbia (BC). The data inputs used were exposed bedrock (EB) points identified from orthophotos, well record (WR) data, and in-situ observations of soil thickness, for which conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) was used to define a set of locations where soil thickness was determined. Four methods were then used to model soil thickness as a function of environmental data layers derived from a digital elevation model and satellite imagery: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), GLM Residual Kriging (GLMRK) and RF Residual Kriging (RFRK). An equal weighted random sampling scheme of 100 EB, WR, and in-situ soil thickness points was used with each model. A second sampling scheme was used with the same WR and in-situ soil thickness points and an additional 5000 randomly sampled EB points, used to improve prediction accuracy with limited data sources. Of the modelling methods used, GLMRK proved to be the best method for shallow thicknesses (0 to 2 m) as assessed by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values (1.87 m) with the equal weighted sample scheme. The addition of the 5000 EB points substantially improved predictions for shallow soil thickness (RMSE 0.9 m) as well as soil thickness in the 2\u20135 m range, while having negligible impact on predictions of thicker soils. This demonstrates that an exposed bedrock layer can help constrain shallow soil thickness predictions when used in conjunction with geostatistical approaches such as GLMRK and RFRK for mapping soil thickness.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.07.012", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "2488674625", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["67863803", "55275573", "215322318", "38903873"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132814924"}

Therefore, the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop \u201csensor based\u201d approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly, 10min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit) granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model. Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In addition to implications for the development of residential energy forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices.

The load and location of WMHs are important clinical measures that may indicate the presence of small vessel disease in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Manually segmenting WMHs is time consuming and prone to inter-rater and intra-rater variabilities. Automated tools that can accurately and robustly detect these lesions can be used to measure the vascular burden in individuals with AD or the elderly population in general. Many WMH segmentation techniques use a classifier in combination with a set of intensity and location features to segment WMHs, however, the optimal choice of classifier is unknown. Methods We compare 10 different linear and nonlinear classification techniques to identify WMHs from MRI data. Each classifier is trained and optimized based on a set of features obtained from co-registered MR images containing spatial location and intensity information. We further assess the performance of the classifiers using different combinations of MRI contrast information. The performances of the different classifiers were compared on three heterogeneous multi-site datasets, including images acquired with different scanners and different scan-parameters. These included data from the ADC study from University of California Davis, the NACC database and the ADNI study. The classifiers (naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, bagging, and boosting) were evaluated using a variety of voxel-wise and volumetric similarity measures such as Dice Kappa similarity index (SI), Intra-Class Correlation (ICC), and sensitivity as well as computational burden and processing times. These investigations enable meaningful comparisons between the performances of different classifiers to determine the most suitable classifiers for segmentation of WMHs. In the spirit of open-source science, we also make available a fully automated tool for segmentation of WMHs with pre-trained classifiers for all these techniques. Results Random Forests yielded the best performance among all classifiers with mean Dice Kappa (SI) of 0.66\u00b10.17 and ICC=0.99 for the ADC dataset (using T1w, T2w, PD, and FLAIR scans), SI=0.72\u00b10.10, ICC=0.93 for the NACC dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans), SI=0.66\u00b10.23, ICC=0.94 for ADNI1 dataset (using T1w, T2w, and PD scans) and SI=0.72\u00b10.19, ICC=0.96 for ADNI2/GO dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans). Not using the T2w/PD information did not change the performance of the Random Forest classifier (SI=0.66\u00b10.17, ICC=0.99). However, not using FLAIR information in the ADC dataset significantly decreased the Dice Kappa, but the volumetric correlation did not drastically change (SI=0.47\u00b10.21, ICC=0.95). Conclusion Our investigations showed that with appropriate features, most off-the-shelf classifiers are able to accurately detect WMHs in presence of FLAIR scan information, while Random Forests had the best performance across all datasets. However, we observed that the performances of most linear classifiers and some nonlinear classifiers drastically decline in absence of FLAIR information, with Random Forest still retaining the best performance.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6469398", "pubmed_id": "28602597", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.06.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Neuroimage", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2732197575", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["30719191", "28984556", "4665437", "5720209", "31679396", "15956118", "10949042", "18422964", "23573457", "2508256", "42563234", "207165665", "207738357", "89141", "215703877", "16506898", "19554954", "27491506", "8026836", "29314428", "1415018", "202590023", "3519727", "6472932", "53335638", "1939828", "207168758", "2397450", "21725411", "54376879", "2912111", "9621074", "15746661", "12587862", "207003674", "13922926", "7205602", "3041749", "19544094", "7784995", "206393950", "24033250", "41774419", "5329072", "6383289", "1723146", "32800624", "43919854", "15037717", "32451987", "34948139", "123244804", "5503771", "11774751", "19920250", "10659969", "29495563", "19897467", "13252401", "23607559", "21708379", "17408528", "9332828", "1936875", "2995286", "13988000", "2691951", "42144084", "24282559", "865248", "24216736", "6410761"], "inbound_citations": ["167221304", "211128071", "207755757", "53219807", "4924116", "91599113", "208576686", "208595540", "89989532", "64753040"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26813979"}

We consider variants of the proposed architecture and perform an ablation study to show the importance of specific components.

The location of this study on a global scale is in Middle Eastern Countries. We compared the mechanistic model CLIMEX (CL) with the correlative models MaxEnt (MX), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Random Forests (RF) to project current and future distributions of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.). The Global Climate Model (GCM), the CSIRO-Mk3.0 (CS) using the A2 emissions scenario, was selected for making projections. Both indigenous and alien distribution data of the species were utilized in the modeling process. The common areas predicted by MX, BRT, RF, and CL from the CS GCM were extracted and compared to ascertain projection uncertainty levels of each individual technique. The common areas identified by all four modeling techniques were used to produce a map indicating suitable and unsuitable areas for date palm cultivation for Middle Eastern countries, for the present and the year 2100. The four different modeling approaches predict fairly different distributions. Projections from CL were more conservative than from MX. The BRT and RF were the most conservative methods in terms of projections for the current time. The combination of the final CL and MX projections for the present and 2100 provide higher certainty concerning those areas that will become highly suitable for future date palm cultivation. According to the four models, cold, hot, and wet stress, with differences on a regional basis, appears to be the major restrictions on future date palm distribution. The results demonstrate variances in the projections, resulting from different techniques. The assessment and interpretation of model projections requires reservations, especially in correlative models such as MX, BRT, and RF. Intersections between different techniques may decrease uncertainty in future distribution projections. However, readers should not miss the fact that the uncertainties are mostly because the future GHG emission scenarios are unknowable with sufficient precision.

Reconstructing the 3D molecular shape starts with the removal of image outliers, the estimation of the orientation of the biomolecule that has produced the given 2D image, and the estimation of camera parameters to correct for intensity defects.

Based on the premise that subject indexing approaches or conceptions with semantic sources are important for automatic subject term assignment through TC, this study proposed an indexing conception-based framework. For the purpose of this study, two research questions were explored: To what extent are semantic sources effective? To what extent are indexing conceptions effective? The experiments were conducted using a Support Vector Machine implementation in WEKA (I.H. Witten & E. Frank, [2000]). Using F-measure, the experiment results showed that cited works, source title, and title were as effective as the full text while a keyword was found more effective than the full text. In addition, the findings showed that an indexing conception-based framework was more effective than the full text. The content-oriented and the document-oriented indexing approaches especially were found more effective than the full text. Among three indexing conception-based approaches, the content-oriented approach and the document-oriented approach were more effective than the domain-oriented approach. In other words, in the context of a typical scientific journal article dataset, the objective contents and authors' intentions were more desirable for automatic subject term assignment via TC than the possible users' needs.

Hummel (jhummel@psych.ucla.edu) Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles 405 Hilgard Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563 Abstract Relations are Hard to Learn Relational reasoning is central in human cognition. Numerous computational models address the component processes of relational reasoning, however these models require the modeler to hand-code the vocabulary of relations on which the model operates. The acquisition of relational concepts remains poorly understood. We present a theory of relation discovery instantiated in a symbolic-connectionist model, which learns structured representations of attributes and relations from unstructured distributed representations of objects by a process of comparison, and subsequently refines these representations through a process of mapping-based schema induction. Keywords: relations, learning, neural network, symbolic processing, structured representations Relational Reasoning Virtually every conscious thought you have expresses a relation. From the mundane, like \u201cI\u2019m late for work\u201d, to the sublime, like Cantor\u2019s proof that the cardinal number of the real numbers is greater than that of the integers, we are constantly representing and reasoning with relations. Relational thinking is so commonplace it is easy to take for granted, but the ability to form and manipulate relational representations appears late in human development (Gentner & Rattermann, 1991; Smith, 1989), and is a late evolutionary development that appears to distinguish human cognition from that of other animals (Holyoak & Thagard, 1995; Thompson & Oden, 2000). An important theme that has emerged from the study of relational thinking \u2013 both empirical and theoretical \u2013 is that the kinds of problems a person (or model) can solve depend critically on what the person (or model) can and does represent. However, little empirical work, and almost no theoretical work, has addressed the problem of how we acquire relational concepts. Models based on relational representations (e.g., Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989; Hummel & Holyoak, 1997, 2003) have made important strides elucidating the nature of relational thought. However, these models are all granted a vocabulary of relational representations by the modeler; they do not learn the relations they need for themselves. Although they address our capacity to manipulate relational representations, they do not address the question of where these representations come from in the first place. Learning relational concepts is difficult for two reasons. The first begins with the very definition of a relation: A relation is a property that holds over a collection of arguments; it is never observable in a single object, so learning relations is vastly underconstrained by the examples from which we learn them. Take, for example, the relation same-shape (x, y). When universally quantified it takes any shape as input, and therefore its truth-value (i.e., whether x and y are the same shape) is completely uncorrelated with the specific visual features of any shapes (or any pair of shapes for that matter). As a result, it cannot be learned from the simple covariation of visual features. The second difficulty stems from the properties of relational representations. Relational representations are structure sensitive and semantically rich (Hummel & Holyoak, 1997). In a relational expression the meaning of the individual relational roles and their fillers is invariant with their arrangement in the expression (i.e., they are independent), but the meaning of the expression as a whole is a function of both the elements that compose the expression and their arrangement (i.e., the bindings of fillers to relational roles). Consider the statements chase (Bill, Joe) and chase (Joe, Bill). We can appreciate that they mean different things (even though they are composed of the same elements) because we can appreciate that the bindings of objects to relational roles is reversed in the two statements. We can also appreciate that the individual elements chase, Joe, and Bill, mean the same things in both statements (despite the fact that they are in different compositions). Additionally, we can cast these elements in novel configurations, for example generalizing the chase relation to novel arguments (e.g. chase (spoon, sprocket)). Thus, a relational concept must be represented independently of the examples from which it is learned, must be able to take arguments from both within and outside the set on which it was learned (i.e., we must be able to extrapolate the relation to novel values), and must specify the bindings of its arguments to its relational roles explicitly. Relational representations also explicitly specify the semantic content of objects and relational roles (e.g., the lover and beloved roles of love (x, y) or the liker and liked roles of like (x, y)): We know what it means to be a lover, and that knowledge is part of our representation of the relation itself. Consequently, it is easy to appreciate that the patient (i.e., killed) role of murder (x, y) is like the patient manslaughter (x, y), even though the agent roles differ (i.e.,", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2765949246", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125619532"}

This paper presents four advantages and contributions over previous research. First, in order to capture both face and iris image at fast speed and simultaneously, we use a built-in conventional mega pixel camera in mobile phone, which is revised to capture the NIR (Near-InfraRed) face and iris image. Second, in order to increase the authentication accuracy of face and iris, we propose a score level fusion method based on SVM (Support Vector Machine). Third, to reduce the classification complexities of SVM and intra-variation of face and iris data, we normalize the input face and iris data, respectively. For face, a NIR illuminator and NIR passing filter on camera are used to reduce the illumination variance caused by environmental visible lighting and the consequent saturated region in face by the NIR illuminator is normalized by low processing logarithmic algorithm considering mobile phone. For iris, image transform into polar coordinate and iris code shifting are used for obtaining robust identification accuracy irrespective of image capturing condition. Fourth, to increase the processing speed on mobile phone, we use integer based face and iris authentication algorithms.

We use supervised machine learning algorithms to train the proposed system in classifying various patterns of spatiotemporal data. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree learning are trained with human labeled feature vectors that mathematically summarize how an MPO interacts with a landmark over time. Our feature vector incorporates a variety of geometric and temporal measurements such as the variable distances of the MPO to different points on the landmark, rate of change with time of variables such as distances and angles that are formed by the MPO with respect to the landmark. Simulated data created through graphical user interaction and agent-based modeling techniques are used to simulate MPO patterns over a representation of a real-world road network.

The experimental results show the superiority of cross-model UNIT over multi-model StarGAN on generating age and eye glasses attributes, and the equivalent performance to synthesize other attributes.

A common empirical strategy involves the application of predictive modeling techniques to \"mine\" variables of interest from available data, followed by the inclusion of those variables into an econometric framework, with the objective of estimating causal effects. Recent work highlights that, because the predictions from machine learning models are inevitably imperfect, econometric analyses based on the predicted variables are likely to suffer from bias due to measurement error. We propose a novel approach to mitigate these biases, leveraging the ensemble learning technique known as the random forest. We propose employing random forest not just for prediction, but also for generating instrumental variables to address the measurement error embedded in the prediction. The random forest algorithm performs best when comprised of a set of trees that are individually accurate in their predictions, yet which also make \"different\" mistakes, i.e., have weakly correlated prediction errors. A key observation is that these properties are closely related to the relevance and exclusion requirements of valid instrumental variables. We design a data-driven procedure to select tuples of individual trees from a random forest, in which one tree serves as the endogenous covariate and the other trees serve as its instruments.

We formulate the depth-induced saliency detection as a CNN-based cross-modal transfer problem to bridge the gap between the \"data-hungry\" nature of CNNs and the unavailability of sufficient labeled training data in depth modality. In the proposed approach, we leverage the auxiliary data from the source modality effectively by training the RGB saliency detection network to obtain the task-specific pre-understanding layers for the target modality. Meanwhile, we exploit the depth-specific information by pre-training a modality classification network that encourages modal-specific representations during the optimizing course.

The main purpose of automatic speech recognition (ASR) is to convert speech waveform signals into text. Acoustic model is the main component of ASR, which is used to connect the observation features of speech signals with the speech modeling units. In recent years, deep learning has become the mainstream technology in the field of speech recognition. In this paper, a convolutional neural network architecture composed of VGG and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function was proposed for speech recognition acoustic model. Traditional acoustic model training is based on frame-level labels with cross-entropy criterion, which requires a tedious label alignment procedure. The CTC loss was adopted to automatically learn the alignments between speech frames and label sequences, such that the training process is end-to-end. The architecture can exploit temporal and spectral structures of speech signals simultaneously. Batch normalization (BN) technique was used for normalizing each layers input to reduce internal covariance shift. To prevent overfitting, dropout technique was used during training to improve network generalization ability. The speech signal was transformed into a spectral image through a series of processing to be the input of the neural network. The input feature is 200 dimensions, and output labels of acoustic mode is 415 Chinese pronunciation without pitch.

In this paper, an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) has been proposed to detect the thermal and Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies around the time of the Varzeghan, Iran, ( M w = 6.4) earthquake jolted in 11 August 2012 NW Iran. ANFIS is the famous hybrid neuro-fuzzy network for modeling the non-linear complex systems. In this study, also the detected thermal and TEC anomalies using the proposed method are compared to the results dealing with the observed anomalies by applying the classical and intelligent methods including Interquartile, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods. The duration of the dataset which is comprised from Aqua-MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) night-time snapshot images and also Global Ionospheric Maps (GIM), is 62 days. It can be shown that, if the difference between the predicted value using the ANFIS method and the observed value, exceeds the pre-defined threshold value, then the observed precursor value in the absence of non seismic effective parameters could be regarded as precursory anomaly. For two precursors of LST and TEC, the ANFIS method shows very good agreement with the other implemented classical and intelligent methods and this indicates that ANFIS is capable of detecting earthquake anomalies. The applied methods detected anomalous occurrences 1 and 2 days before the earthquake. This paper indicates that the detection of the thermal and TEC anomalies derive their credibility from the overall efficiencies and potentialities of the five integrated methods.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asr.2013.05.024", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Space Research", "mag_id": "2019845332", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55845596", "60442951", "136258115"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120603130"}

In order to prevent further influx of illegal immigrants, the police are physically searching incoming vehicles at national boundaries aiming at finding those who are hiding inside.

HOLBROOK Physical Biosciences Division Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Berkeley, CA USA E-mail: rfmeraz@gmail.com, srholbrook@lbl.gov Some genes produce transcripts that function directly in regulatory, catalytic, or structural roles in the cell. These non-coding RNAs are prevalent in all living organisms, and methods that aid the understanding of their functional roles are essential. RNA secondary structure, the pattern of base-pairing, contains the crit- ical information for determining the three dimensional structure and function of the molecule. In this work we examine whether the basic geometric and topolog- ical properties of secondary structure are su\ufb03cient to distinguish between RNA families in a learning framework. First, we develop a labeled dual graph represen- tation of RNA secondary structure by adding biologically meaningful labels to the dual graphs proposed by Gan et al [1]. Next, we de\ufb01ne a similarity measure di- rectly on the labeled dual graphs using the recently developed marginalized kernels [2]. Using this similarity measure, we were able to train Support Vector Machine classi\ufb01ers to distinguish RNAs of known families from random RNAs with similar statistics. For 22 of the 25 families tested, the classi\ufb01er achieved better than 70% accuracy, with much higher accuracy rates for some families. Training a set of clas- si\ufb01ers to automatically assign family labels to RNAs using a one vs. all multi-class scheme also yielded encouraging results. From these initial learning experiments, we suggest that the labeled dual graph representation, together with kernel machine methods, has potential for use in automated analysis and classi\ufb01cation of unchar- acterized RNA molecules or e\ufb03cient genome-wide screens for RNA molecules from existing families. \u2217 to whom correspondence should be addressed.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "15759609", "doi": "10.1142/9789812702456_0002", "venue": "Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "306611029,2073175807", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["1252355", "5129873", "376559", "35295924", "38608429", "29301373", "38530601", "5243194", "543931", "2789165", "4912390", "194951", "18968671", "3108865", "13927076", "7116536", "13391792", "6923178"], "inbound_citations": ["53365207", "1514538", "215214848", "22048723", "2487117", "17428559", "49652482", "1038736", "3919130", "15191324", "3821809", "39895917", "29526436", "5375177", "6780847", "12652711", "6596293", "11435867", "5943581", "7127377", "11496056", "26317412", "88520239"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14072618"}

To improve the forecasting model accuracy, it is a key to predict the weather conditions of input variables. In particular, daily predicted maximum temperature is one of the most important input variables. In this paper, an SVR-based method is proposed for maximum temperature forecasting in short-term load forecasting. It is an extension of SVM that makes use of the kernel trick to maximize a margin between different data sets. SVR corresponds to the regression version of SVM. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of maximum temperature in Tokyo. A comparison is made between the proposed and the conventional ANN methods.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371109", "venue": "2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "journal": "2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2087058869", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9876424", "21441484", "110171893", "61873232", "16896980", "17180886", "7138354", "206787478", "1900499", "194951", "60486887", "743542", "15480929", "18344260", "5371243", "6509416", "12683197", "15810887", "117643475", "5667586", "31831024"], "inbound_citations": ["12900968", "5829540", "37540293", "8571990", "21596207"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18473308"}

A modified interaction prediction method is developed using a fuzzy model. This model provides the co-ordination parameters on the basis of imprecise data and an approximate reasoning.

These connection layers facilitate the feature learning procedure by combining low-level and high-level information for generating multiple sets of self-expressive and informative representations at different levels of the encoder. Moreover, we introduce a novel loss minimization problem which leverages an initial clustering of the samples to effectively fuse the multi-level representations and recover the underlying subspaces more accurately.

Thus, to address this issue, this paper presents the design and implementation of a device capable of detecting electricity theft by identifying the small changes between the real-time measurements and that of a trained model. The energy metering system consists of a voltage and current sensing circuits while the theft detection algorithm consists of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained and used to classify users as either a clean or fraudulent user. The data that was used to train the SVM model was obtained from a test bench. The test bench consisted of 100 appliances that were emulated using purely resistive loads. Each appliance has its own probability function which consists of a PRNG that generates pseudorandom numbers according to a chosen distribution type.

Such a scenario requires a classifier that is able to rapidly adapt itself to concept drift and displays robustness to class imbalance problem. We propose to use online version of Extreme Learning Machine that is enhanced by an efficient drift detector and method to alleviate the bias towards the majority class. We investigate three approaches based on undersampling, oversampling and cost-sensitive adaptation.

Our objectives were to predict and map the climatic niche for A. religiosa for contemporary and future (2030, 2060 and 2090) climates, suggest management strategies to accommodate climate changes, and discuss implications for conservation of monarch butterfly overwintering sites in Mexico. A bioclimate model predicting the presence or absence of A. religiosa was developed by using the Random Forests classification tree on forest inventory data. The model used six predictor variables and was driven primarily by the mean temperature of the warmest month, an interaction between summer precipitation to and winter temperatures, and the ratio of summer to annual precipitation. Projecting the contemporary climate niche into future climates provided by three General Circulation Models and two scenarios suggested that the area occupied by the niche should diminish rapidly over the course of the century: a decrease of 69.2% by the decade surrounding 2030, 87.6% for that surrounding 2060, and 96.5% for 2090.

It is either caused by pancreatic malfunctioning or the body cells being inactive to insulin production. Prolonged diabetes results in severe complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, cardiomyopathy and cardiovascular diseases. DM is an incurable disorder. Thus, diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes is essential to prevent the body organs from severe damage. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signal processing can be used as one of the methods for the diagnosis of DM. Our paper introduces a noninvasive technique of automated diabetic diagnosis using HRV signals. The R-R interval signals are decomposed using Shearlet transforms integrated with Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), and their characteristic features are extracted by using Shannon\u2019s, Renyi\u2019s, Kapur entropies, energy and Higher Order Spectra (HOS). Then, Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) is employed to remove insignificant features and reduce the number of employed features. These redundant features are eliminated by using six feature selection algorithms: Student\u2019s t-test, Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Bhattacharyya distance, Information entropy and Fuzzy Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (MRMR). This step is followed by classification of normal and diabetic signals using different classifiers, such as discriminant classifiers, Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Fuzzy Sugeno (FSC), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), AdaBoost and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. In these classifiers, the selected features are employed to distinguish diabetic signals from normal signals. These classifiers are trained and then tested to validate their accuracy to make accurate diagnosis. The FSC classifier is shown to have the highest (100%) accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: This study explores whether the differential diagnostic analysis of doctor-patient interactions in a memory clinic can be automated. METHODS: Verbatim transcripts of conversations between neurologists and patients initially presenting with memory problems to a specialist clinic were produced manually (15 with FMD, and 15 with ND). A range of automatically detectable features focusing on acoustic, lexical, semantic, and visual information contained in the transcripts were defined aiming to replicate the diagnostic qualitative observations. The features were used to train a set of five machine learning classifiers to distinguish between ND and FMD. RESULTS: The mean rate of correct classification between ND and FMD was 93% ranging from 97% by the Perceptron classifier to 90% by the Random Forest classifier.Using only the ten best features, the mean correct classification score increased to 95%.

Finally, only a small number of features is needed to achieve the highest performance using each classifier. This study emphasizes the benefits of rigorous FS for maximizing performance, as well as for minimizing model complexity and interpretation.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2278482", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2763857326", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["60965782", "28559299", "129221037", "17585741", "14327502", "252810", "129434024", "14844797", "17371657", "131528125", "2550973", "16841725", "10713898", "44672699", "40859737", "37213770", "129355819", "89141", "5322427", "2371388", "379259"], "inbound_citations": ["4243939"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134140438"}

We performed some experiments using two regression algorithms (Random Forests and Ordinary Least Squares). We compared the real poll values with the predicted values of our regression models. The lower absolute error we could obtain was 0.50 using only buzz aggregators. It means that our prediction model has a small predictive error.

Despite the efforts of their designers, APIs may suffer from a number of issues (such as incomplete or erroneous documentation, poor performance, and backward incompatibility). To maintain a healthy client base, API designers must learn these issues to fix them. Question answering sites, such as Stack Overflow (SO), have become a popular place for discussing API issues. These posts about API issues are invaluable to API designers, not only because they can help to learn more about the problem but also because they can facilitate learning the requirements of API users. However, the unstructured nature of posts and the abundance of non-issue posts make the task of detecting SO posts concerning API issues difficult and challenging. In this paper, we first develop a supervised learning approach using a Conditional Random Field (CRF), a statistical modeling method, to identify API issue-related sentences. We use the above information together with different features collected from posts, the experience of users, readability metrics and centrality measures of collaboration network to build a technique, called CAPS, that can classify SO posts concerning API issues. In total, we consider 34 features along eight different dimensions. Evaluation of CAPS using carefully curated SO posts on three popular API types reveals that the technique outperforms all three baseline approaches we consider in this study. We then conduct studies to find important features and also evaluate the performance of the CRF-based technique for classifying issue sentences. Comparison with two other baseline approaches shows that the technique has high potential. We also test the generalizability of CAPS results, evaluate the effectiveness of different classifiers, and identify the impact of different feature sets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10664-019-09743-4", "venue": "Empirical Software Engineering", "journal": "Empirical Software Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2963079908", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7826786", "4596370", "8993699", "4596370", "22053430", "692204", "13770479", "13886408", "4004627", "722134", "13252554", "13126241", "17535443", "5405152", "3177797", "6834823", "19708400", "18405524", "144565557", "144250124", "1275124", "17049614", "13243922", "53356703", "39344661", "9277109", "17906351", "145838278", "14388876", "13861754", "17869763", "37925379", "10623194", "61131325", "24640836", "9571753", "12590620", "14068874", "59921147", "1353923", "12606689", "3987114", "8659161", "16594616", "7916235", "16320921", "4509026", "12034478", "14394765", "17432092", "1226606", "33966447", "27166937", "16044605", "15232332", "342976", "14835360", "21525229", "10910725", "207189055", "12146618", "9085049", "8104643", "10262993", "657762", "36197502"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198191091"}

Accurate foreign object intrusion detection is particularly important. As a result of the lack of intruding foreign object samples during the operational period, artificially generated ones will greatly benefit the development of the detection methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate railway intruding object images based on an improved conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (C-DCGAN). It consists of a generator and multi-scale discriminators. Loss function is also improved so as to generate samples with a high quality and authenticity. The generator is extracted in order to generate foreign object images from input semantic labels. We synthesize the generated objects to the railway scene. To make the generated objects more similar to real objects, on scale in different positions of a railway scene, a scale estimation algorithm based on the gauge constant is proposed. The experimental results on the railway intruding object dataset show that the proposed C-DCGAN model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher quality (the pixel-wise accuracy, mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), and mean average precision (mAP) are 80.46%, 0.65, and 0.69, respectively) and diversity (the Frechet-Inception Distance (FID) score is 26.87) of generated samples.

Learning knowledge from users' raw GPS data can provide rich context information for both geographic and mobile applications. However, so far, raw GPS data are still used directly without much understanding. In this paper, an approach based on supervised learning is proposed to automatically infer transportation mode from raw GPS data. The transportation mode, such as walking, driving, etc., implied in a user's GPS data can provide us valuable knowledge to understand the user. It also enables context-aware computing based on user's present transportation mode and design of an innovative user interface for Web users. Our approach consists of three parts: a change point-based segmentation method, an inference model and a post-processing algorithm based on conditional probability. The change point-based segmentation method was compared with two baselines including uniform duration based and uniform length based methods. Meanwhile, four different inference models including Decision Tree, Bayesian Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) are studied in the experiments.

However, the existing review-based methods mainly derive the latent features for the users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is used for a user to identify her preference on all candidate items without considering the particular characteristics of each item. In this paper, we propose a fused context-aware neural model for rating prediction by using reviews and rating scores simultaneously, named FCAN. FCAN consists of two learning components: context-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In context-based feature learning, the dynamic user latent features and item latent features are extracted through the convolution operations and nonlinearities supercharged by the neural treatment. In this sense, the relevant features from both the user review and item review on the basis of the user-item pair are identified for rating prediction. Moreover, introducing context-based features increases interpretability in rating prediction. However, the features learnt in context-based learning component is only review-driven and may not be comprehensive. We further extract complementary latent features by using the user-item rating scores in interaction-based feature learning component. With a dynamic linear fusion mechanism, FCAN can better capture the user preference for rating prediction using both the reviews and the rating scores. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that FCAN achieves significantly better predication accuracy than state-of-the-art review-based alternatives.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2774132622", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196007323"}

We propose an efficient training methodology and incrementally growing DCNN to learn new tasks while sharing part of the base network. Our proposed methodology is inspired by transfer learning techniques, although it does not forget previously learned tasks.

We employed a \u2018clone-and-branch\u2019 technique with calibration, which allows the network to learn new tasks (containing classes with similar features as old tasks) one after another without any performance loss in old tasks.

In this manifesto I outline an approach to consciousness based on distinctions developed by connectionists. Two core identities are central to a connectionist theory of consciouness: conscious states of mind are identical to occurrent activation patterns of processing units; and the variable dispositional strengths on connections between units store latent and unconscious information. Within this broad framework, a connectionist model of consciousness succeeds according to the degree of correspondence between the content of human consciousness (the world as it is experienced) and the interpreted content of the network. Constitutive self-awareness and reflective self-awareness can be captured in a model through its ability to respond to self-reflexive information, identify self-referential categories, and process information in the absence of simultaneous input. The qualitative \u201cfeel\u201d of sensation appears in a model as states of activation that are not fully discriminated by later processing. Connectionism also uniquely explains several specific features of experience. The most important of these is the superposition of information in consciousness \u2014 our ability to perceive more than meets the eye, and to apprehend complex categorical and temporal information in a single highly-cognized glance.

It allows us to learn a category transformation and an ELM classifier with random projection by minimizing the -norm of the network output weights and the learning error simultaneously. The unlabeled target data, as useful knowledge, is also integrated as a fidelity term to guarantee the stability during cross domain learning. It minimizes the matching error between the learned classifier and a base classifier, such that many existing classifiers can be readily incorporated as base classifiers. The network output weights cannot only be analytically determined, but also transferrable. Additionally, a manifold regularization with Laplacian graph is incorporated, such that it is beneficial to semi-supervised learning. Extensively, we also propose a model of multiple views, referred as MvEDA. Experiments on benchmark visual datasets for video event recognition and object recognition, demonstrate that our EDA methods outperform existing cross-domain learning methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28113624", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2016.2598679", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2517537544", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13609995", "5879717", "10136206", "5696618", "6321201", "951494", "12365014", "206597309", "15536375", "206769604", "6211336", "2541381", "53304422", "1083317", "6490626", "195678450", "70831", "3081764", "1283257", "1283257", "4553188", "357078", "888650", "10361983", "15037168", "116858", "623918", "17976032", "12450925", "7166661", "1740642", "15036406", "5360764", "7419723", "14627863", "4908577", "8548594", "15044501", "10360019", "6742009", "14591650", "7263397", "62354027", "15474528", "4962044", "461853", "6161478", "9747411", "16171043", "10337178", "195908774", "1275465", "13936498", "13897721"], "inbound_citations": ["51610252", "5031707", "54442722", "46858234", "27717239", "3456398", "202416205", "5348786", "52155059", "125483908", "204509398", "38805728", "167210933", "13448631", "202737793", "43938211", "3488860", "67856389", "28218084", "195325895", "3674977", "208355706", "125453005", "49315552", "210930581", "195697746", "49420622", "116760690", "85499473", "51876501", "116401133", "4772268", "36334718", "207952882", "51612227", "52917000", "5028009", "75137541", "54469772", "73495188", "119606410", "46963735", "46810049", "189998852", "44255052", "211119901"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10906016"}

To alleviate the first problem, we propose a simple yet effective regularization loss term called variance loss. The proposed variance loss allows a network to predict output scores for each frame with high discrepancy which enables effective feature learning and significantly improves model performance. For the second problem, we design a novel two-stream network named Chunk and Stride Network (CSNet) that utilizes local (chunk) and global (stride) temporal view on the video features. Our CSNet gives better summarization results for long-length videos compared to the existing methods. In addition, we introduce an attention mechanism to handle the dynamic information in videos.

We consulted ancient texts to determine this pheasant\u2019s historical distribution from 25 to 1947 CE. Based on this species\u2019 habitat selection criteria, the history of the forests, ancient climate change records, and fossil data, we determined that the brown-eared pheasant\u2019s historical distribution included the three provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei. It once inhabited an area of about 320,000 km 2 , as calculated by the minimum convex polygon method (MCP) in ArcGIS 10.0. The current species distribution covers 46,800 km 2 of the Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces, as well as Beijing city, while Shanxi remains the center of the distribution area. This pheasant\u2019s distribution range has decreased by 85% over the past 2,000 years. We used the Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) index to assess the importance of the evaluation of 13 environmental factors using the Random Forests (RF) measure from the R 3.0.2 software platform. The results showed that vegetation is the most important determinant influencing distribution. We built a corresponding correlative relationship between the presence/absence of brown-eared pheasant and forest coverage and found that forest coverage in the north, northeast, central, and southeast areas of the Shanxi province were all less than 10% at the end of the Qing Dynasty (1911 CE). Our MaxEnt model indicated that the brown-eared pheasant had retreated to the western regions of Shanxi (AUC = 0.753) and that the historical distribution area had reduced synchronously with the disappearance of local forest cover in Shanxi. Wild brown-eared pheasant populations are stable in the Luliang Mountains, where forest coverage reached 13.2% in 2000. Consequently, we concluded that the distribution of this species is primarily determined by vegetation conditions and that forest cover was the most significant determining factor.

This paper proposes an adversarial learning model (ALM) that includes the generative model and discriminative model. The ALM uses the original image as an input of the generative model to extract the high-level features and forms an initial salient map. Then, the discriminative model is utilized to compare differences in the features between the initial salient map and the ground truth, and the obtained differences are sent to the convolutional layers of the generative model to adjust the parameters for the generative model updating. Due to the serial-iterative adjustment, the salient map of the generative model becomes more similar to the ground truth. Lastly, the ALM forms the salient map fused with the super-pixels by enhancing the color and texture features, so the final salient map is obtained. The ALM is not limited to the color and texture features; on the contrary, it fuses multiple features and achieves good results in the salient target extraction. The experimental results show that ALM performs better than the other ten state-of-the-art models on three different datasets.

What are the visual causes of be- havior? Can we identify such causes from raw image data? If the visual features are causes, how can we manipulate them? Here we provide a rigorous definition of the visual cause of a behavior that is broadly applicable to the visually driven behavior in humans, animals, neurons, robots and other per- ceiving systems. Our framework generalizes standard accounts of causal learning to settings in which the causal variables need to be constructed from microvariables (raw image pixels in this case). We prove the Causal Coarsening Theorem, which allows us to gain causal knowledge from observational data with minimal experimental effort. The theorem provides a connection to standard inference techniques in machine learning that identify features of an image that correlate with, but may not cause, the target behavior.

LS-OC-SVM extracts a hyperplane as an optimal description of training objects in a regularized least squares sense. The online LS-OC-SVM learns a training set with a limited number of samples to provide a basic normal model, then updates the model through remaining data. In the sparse online scheme, the model complexity is controlled by the coherence criterion. The online LS-OC-SVM is adopted to handle the abnormal event detection problem. Each frame of the video is characterized by the covariance matrix descriptor encoding the moving information, then is classified into a normal or an abnormal frame.

Firstly KPCA is exploited to reduce the dimension of input vectors and to denoise speech signal by extracting the nonlinear principal components of feature vectors. Since LS-SVM simplifies the computation by solving a set of linear equations instead of the quadratic programming problems involved by the standard SVM, LS-SVM classification algorithm has been run in our identification system.

Therefore, there is a high importance of utilizing automated techniques for the purpose of pre-detection of AD symptoms from such data. We report an experimental approach to evaluate the best pre-detection method of AD. Our study consists of two main experiments. Those two experiments were implemented using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Prior to our first experiment we have stated an assumption which is, if there is a successful AD detection method that will be successful in AD pre-detection also. Different studies have used different data sets and different diagnosing methods. Therefore we have verified the existing and the most successful detection method which is Support Vector Machine (SVMs) as the first experiment. According to the results obtained from the initial experiment (detection study) the sensitivity is 95.3%, the specificity is 71.4% and the accuracy is 84.4% with use of a SVM. Since those results were not successful, a deep learning based technique (Convolutional Neural Network) was proposed as the second experiment. The proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was being tested using different image segmentation methods and different datasets. Finally the best image segmentation method obtained a high accuracy around 96% (sensitivity \u2014 96%, specificity \u2014 98%). And the CNN model remains unbiased to the dataset.

In view of the unique characteristics of the measurement data and the ML challenges thereof, we propose a non-intrusive human activity recognition system that only uses existing commodity WiFi routers.

Then it performs information fusion from diverse perspectives based on multi-view kernel learning.

Even dexterous, multi-fingered commercial prostheses are controlled via surface electromyography (EMG) in a way that enforces a few fixed grasping postures, or a very basic estimate of force. Control is not natural, meaning that the amputee must learn to associate, e.g., wrist flexion and hand closing. Nevertheless, recent literature indicates that much more information can be gathered from plain, old surface EMG. To check this issue, we have performed an experiment in which three amputees train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using five commercially available EMG electrodes while asked to perform various grasping postures and forces with their phantom limbs. In agreement with recent neurological studies on cortical plasticity, we show that amputees operated decades ago can still produce distinct and stable signals for each posture and force. The SVM classifies the posture up to a precision of 95% and approximates the force with an error of as little as 7% of the signal range, sample-by-sample at 25Hz. These values are in line with results previously obtained by healthy subjects while feed-forward controlling a dexterous mechanical hand.

We used 2010 census blocks to extract LST and various explanatory variables for use in Random Forest models evaluating the relative importance of land cover composition, LiDAR-derived vertical structure variables, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on LST patterns. We found that land cover, vertical structure, and LST varied between areas with different land use and neighborhood age. Older neighborhoods supported significantly higher tree cover and mean tree height, but differences in LST were inconsistent between Landsat image dates. NDVI had the highest variable importance in Random Forests models, followed by tree height and the mean height difference between trees and buildings. Models incorporating NDVI, vertical structure, and land cover had the highest predictive accuracy but did not perform significantly better than models using just vertical structure and NDVI. Developed areas were cooler on average than shortgrass steppe reference areas, likely due to the influence of supplemental irrigation in urbanized areas.

Many clues indicated that in the past olive cultivation limits moved northward or southward in the Northern Hemisphere according to warmer or cooler climate, respectively. This makes the olive tree cultivation area a possible biological indicator of changes in climate and the identification of the climatological parameters that limit its cultivation plays an important role for climate change impact assessment. In this work, three different approaches were compared, with the aim to compare methodologies suited to predict olive tree distribution over the Mediterranean basin: two classifiers (Random Forest, RF and an Artificial Neural Network, ANN) and a spatial model to infer climatic limiters of plant distribution (CLPD). These methodologies were applied within a framework including a geographical information system (GIS), which spatially defined olive tree cultivated area, and climatological informative layers (average temperature and cumulated rainfall, 50 km \u00d7 50 km), which were used as predictor variables. The results indicated that RF achieved on the whole, the lowest classification error (113 misclassified cases on 1906 test cases) followed by ANN (128 cases) and CLPD (153 cases). A validation test, performed over areas out of the Mediterranean basin where olive tree is cultivated (i.e. California and Southern Australia), confirmed the goodness of the RF fitted model in predicting olive tree suitable areas. In general, climatic predictor variables of the coldest and warmest periods of the year were the most significant in determining the limits of suitable olive cultivation area for these methodologies. In particular, temperature of January and July and rainfall of October and July were the climatic predictor variables having highest significance for both RF and ANN. Temperature of January >2 \u00b0C, of July >20 \u00b0C and cumulated annual rainfall >240 mm were the bounds found in the spatial model.

In blind deblurring we have no information regarding the blur kernel. As deblurring can be considered as an image to image translation task, deep learning based solutions, including the ones which use GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), have been proven effective for deblurring. Most of them have an encoder-decoder structure. Our objective is to try different GAN structures and improve its performance through various modifications to the existing structure for supervised deblurring. In supervised deblurring we have pairs of blurred and their corresponding sharp images, while in the unsupervised case we have a set of blurred and sharp images but their is no correspondence between them. Modifications to the structures is done to improve the global perception of the model. As blur is non-uniform in nature, for deblurring we require global information of the entire image, whereas convolution used in CNN is able to provide only local perception. Deep models can be used to improve global perception but due to large number of parameters it becomes difficult for it to converge and inference time increases, to solve this we propose the use of attention module (non-local block) which was previously used in language translation and other image to image translation tasks in deblurring. Use of residual connection also improves the performance of deblurring as features from the lower layers are added to the upper layers of the model. It has been found that classical losses like L1, L2, and perceptual loss also help in training of GANs when added together with adversarial loss.

Therefore, it is desirable to remove from the training set the data that is irrelevant to the final decision function. In this paper we propose two new methods that select a subset of data for SVM training. Using real-world datasets, we compare the effectiveness of the proposed data selection strategies in terms of their ability to reduce the training set size while maintaining the generalization performance of the resulting SVM classifiers.

The methods which are utilized by attackers to collect confidential information vary, when online banking systems continue to be the main goal of these attacks. Nowadays most widespread approach to protect against phishing attack is using blacklists in antiviruses and browser toolbars. Unfortunately, blacklist method fails in responding to newly emanating phishing attacks since registering new domain names has become easier, no comprehensive blacklist can ensure a perfect up-to-date database. Therefore it requires another approach to counter phishing attack which is more accurate and efficient than blacklist method. The purpose of this work is to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms such as an Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machines and K-nearest Neighbor to website phishing detection. The datasets of phishing and non-phishing websites were gathered in order to train, test machine learning algorithm models, compare evaluative metrics of algorithms between each other. In addition, the final dataset was divided into three datasets with different ratios to see whether or not the trained models will show constant performance in testing results and whether these proportions have a good or bad influence on the ability of trained models to classify website. After all the analysis of the performance of each machine learning algorithm was made. This project suggests the Support Vector Machines algorithm as the best one to be used in phishing detection regardless of dataset proportion, because it showed almost the same performance throughout all test phases which is 98.5% on average.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2280560759", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113001848"}

A relational analysis of features that discriminate its species and contribute to niche adaptation and survival remains to be fully described. In this study, an interspecies, whole-genome comparative analysis of 21 Staphylococcus species was performed based on their orthologues. Three well-defined multi-species groups were identified: group A (including aureus/epidermidis); group B (including saprophyticus/xylosus) and group C (including pseudintermedius/delphini). The machine learning algorithm Random Forest was applied to identify variable orthologues that drive formation of the Staphylococcus species groups A-C. Orthologues driving staphylococcal infrageneric diversity comprised regulatory, metabolic and antimicrobial resistance proteins. Notably, the BraSR (NsaRS) two-component system (TCS) and its associated BraDE transporters that regulate antimicrobial resistance distinguish group A Staphylococcus species from others in the genus that lack the BraSR TCS. Divergence of BraSR and GraSR antimicrobial peptide survival TCS and their associated transporters was observed across the staphylococci, likely reflecting niche specific evolution of these TCS/transporters and their specificities for AMPs. Experimental evolution, with selection for resistance to the lantibiotic nisin, revealed multiple routes to resistance and differences in the selection outcomes of the BraSR- positive species S. hominis and S. aureus. Selection supported a role for GraSR in nisin survival responses of the BraSR-negative group B species S. saprophyticus. Our study reveals diversification of antimicrobial-sensing TCS across the staphylococci and hints at differential relationships between GraSR and BraSR in those species positive for both TCS. Importance The genus Staphylococcus includes species that are commensals and opportunist pathogens of humans and animals. Identifying the features that discriminate species of staphylococci is relevant to understanding niche selection and the structure of their microbiomes. Moreover, the determinants that structure the community are relevant for strategies to modify the frequency of individual species associated with dysbiosis and disease. In this study, we identify orthologous proteins that discriminate genomes of staphylococci. In particular, species restriction of a major antimicrobial survival system, BraSR (NsaRS), to a group of staphylococci dominated by those that can colonize human skin. The diversity of antimicrobial sensing loci was revealed by comparative analysis and experimental evolution with selection for nisin resistance identified the potential for variation in antimicrobial sensing in BraRS-encoding staphylococci.

It is very important to quickly and effectively classify and identify the vibration signals collected by optical fiber sensors. In this paper, a neural network transfer learning method combined with combined feature based on optical fiber sensing signal classification is proposed. The method identifies intrusion signals by traditional manual features combined with deep features. First, time domain and frequency domain manual features extraction are performed on the intrusion signals. At the same time, the signal is decomposed by wavelet packet and the energy of each node is calculated. Then the feature vectors are normalized and fed into the improved CNN to generate deep features under the condition of small samples. After that these deep features are combined with traditional features such as time domain features and frequency domain features to identify the intrusion vibration signal. This paper uses three different intrusion events for experimental verification. The method of combining deep features with manual features is applied to the classification experiments of these three intrusion signals, and the feature extraction methods using only time domain features, frequency domain features, wavelet packet features and single deep features are applied to the same example experiment.

Currently, there are no sensors or equipment that can detect the alumina concentration on line. Most companies acquire the alumina concentration from the electrolyte samples which are analyzed through an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. To solve the problem, the paper proposes a soft sensing model based on a kernel extreme learning machine algorithm that takes the kernel function into the extreme learning machine.

We show that this distillation framework incurs no loss in performance on recent BNN applications including anomaly detection, active learning, and defense against adversarial attacks.

Since foundational work in Natural Language Understanding has shown that a deep semantic approach is still not feasible, current research is focused on shallow methods combining linguistic models and machine learning techniques. The latter aim at learning semantic models, like those that can detect the entailment between the meaning of two text fragments, by means of training examples described by specific features. These are rather difficult to design since there is no linguistic model that can effectively encode the lexico-syntactic level of a sentence and its corresponding semantic models. Thus, the adopted solution consists in exhaustively describing training examples by means of all possible combinations of sentence words and syntactic information. The latter, typically expressed as parse trees of text fragments, is often encoded in the learning process using graph algorithms. In this paper, we propose a class of graphs, the tripartite directed acyclic graphs (tDAGs), which can be efficiently used to design algorithms for graph kernels for semantic natural language tasks involving sentence pairs. These model the matching between two pairs of syntactic trees in terms of all possible graph fragments. Interestingly, since tDAGs encode the association between identical or similar words (i.e. variables), it can be used to represent and learn first-order rules, i.e. rules describable by first-order logic. We prove that our matching function is a valid kernel and we empirically show that, although its evaluation is still exponential in the worst case, it is extremely efficient and more accurate than the previously proposed kernels.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3233/FI-2011-400", "venue": "Fundam.

Since the knowledge base is huge, it is not possible to manually detect the errors. Therefore, in this paper we use Machine Learning techniques to automatically detect the errors. With the observation that the main jobs posted by an employer often relate to the employer industry, e.g., truck driver jobs often correspond to employers belonging to the transportation industry, we develop a system that classifies the industry of an employer using job posting data. We aggregate job postings from an employer and use job titles and employer names as features for predicting the industry of the employer. We used two models for classification: (1) Support Vector Machine, and (2) Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, and observed that while both the models perform similarly in classifying job employers that were correctly computed, GBDT is more effective than SVM in identifying job employers that were wrongly computed.

Certi\ufb01cation of these classi\ufb01ers plays a crucial role in their selection for a speci\ufb01c task. Current certi\ufb01cation approaches utilize the Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) as a standard tool that provides graphically the performance of classi\ufb01ers. Beside the ratio of Detection Rate and False Alarm Rate (combined as ROC), other properties related to process parameters are not considered. In this paper, a new evaluation method based on the Probability of Detection (POD) reliability measure is developed discussing the effect of further process parameters on the classi\ufb01cation results. Probability of Detection (POD) serves as a performance measure for quantifying the reliability of conventional Nondestructive Testing (NDT) procedures and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems. The approach considers statistical variability of sensor-based measurements. In this publication for the \ufb01rst time the signal-response and the binary (hit/miss) approaches are implemented in combination with a process parameter. As example in this publication, the prediction of driving behavior classi\ufb01cation is used as process parameter. The signal response approach is applied to compare the driving behavior prediction capabilities of Fuzzy Logic-Hidden Markov Model (FL-HMM), Arti\ufb01cial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with respect to the reliability of the prediction for driver behavior related to prediction time. The hit/miss approach is also applied on FL-HMM as example for predicting an upcoming driving maneuver. To account for data uncertainty and variability, con\ufb01dence bounds are established. A typical and useful criteria for detection at a 90 % probability of detection level with 95 % con\ufb01dence level is successfully implemented as a new reliability measure and certi\ufb01cation standard for classi\ufb01ers.

We propose here an in-depth comparison of classifications by assessing the potential of SVM (often the \u201cwinner\u201d in the previously mentioned studies) versus a range of the machine learning algorithms developed during the last decade: Naive Bayes, C4.5 algorithm, Random Forest, Regression Tree and kNearest Neighbor. They were tested over different ecosystems across Moorea Island (French Polynesia) using various sensors. Our results show that SVM outperforms other classifiers in 75% of the situations. We point out that SVM has a successful ability to deal with complex pixel-by-pixel classification problems (with high level of details, speckle noise and few bands).

Classifying an applicant as good or bad debtor helps lender to make a wise decision. The modern data mining and machine learning techniques have been found to be very useful and accurate in credit risk predictive capability and correct decision making. Classification is one of the most widely used techniques in machine learning. To increase prediction accuracy of standalone classifiers while keeping overall cost to a minimum, feature selection techniques have been utilized , as feature selection removes redundant and irrelevant attributes from dataset .This paper initially introduces Bolasso(Bootstrap- Lasso) which selects consistent and relevant features from pool of features. The consistent feature selection is defined as robustness of selected features with respect to changes in dataset Bolasso generated shortlisted features are then applied to various classification algorithms like Random Forest(RF), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Naive Bayes(NB) and K-Nearest Neighbours(K-NN) to test its predictive accuracy.It is observed that Bolasso enabled Random Forest Algorithm(BS-RF) provides best results forcredit risk evaluation. The classifiers are built on training and test data partition(70:30) of three datasets(Lending Club\u2019s peer to peer dataset , Kaggle\u2019s \u201cBank Loan Status Dataset\u201d and German Credit dataset obtained from UCI). The performance of Bolasso enabled various classification algorithms is then compared with that of other baseline feature selection methods like Chi Square, Gain Ratio, ReliefF and stand-alone classifiers (no feature selection method applied). The experimental results shows that Bolasso provides phenomenal stability of features when compared with stability of other algorithms . Jaccard Stability Measure(JSM) is used to assess stability of feature selection methods. Moreover BS-RF have good classification accuracy and is better than other methods in terms of AUC and Accuracy resulting in effectively improving the decision making process of lenders.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105936", "venue": "Appl.

We study problems in both domains; presenting mathematical programming models and developing efficient solution approaches. Consequently, the thesis is divided into two main parts, each of which is devoted to problems in one of the two mentioned domains. ::: The first part of the thesis is focused on location theory. Specifically, we introduce models that try to extend or to generalize the p-center problem and covering problems. The well known discrete p-center problem is a minimax location problem that aims to locate a certain number of facilities such that the largest allocation distance between a client and a facility is minimized. We consider a stochastic version of the p-center problem, called the probabilistic p-center problem, where each client could require a service following an independent probability distribution. We propose and rigorously compare three exact approaches for this problem as well as a fast-performing heuristic approach. ::: We further consider another extension of the p-center problem where the clients are divided into different strata depending on the type of demand they require. The objective is, thus, to minimize the weighted sum of the largest allocation distance within each stratum. We propose five different formulations for this problem. We strengthen the formulations through valid inequalities and present preprocessing techniques to reduce the number of variables in the solution process. Besides, this second model allows providing an efficient alternative heuristic approach to solve the above mentioned stochastic model. ::: The third type of location model addressed in this dissertation is related to covering problems. In particular, a general model that tries to unify classic discrete covering location problems is introduced. This model includes also two important features that provide a more realistic framework: uncertainty and time-dependency. With this purpose, a Mathematical Programming model and a Lagrangian relaxation based heuristic solution procedure are proposed. To see the potentials and limits of the model, extensive computational experiments are carried out. ::: The second part of the thesis is devoted to supervised classification. In the classification domain, Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are known to be one of the most effective classification models. Classical SVM models determine an optimal hyperplane that separates two classes of a dataset. An important aspect in SVM is the adequate selection of a small number of features to be involved in the classification process. A correct feature selection can yield to a better interpretation of the model among other advantages. ::: We propose an SVM model with feature selection. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation, that includes feature selection constraints. Besides a MILP formulation, two strategies for improving the performance of the model are developed. Exact and heuristic approaches are also analyzed for this model. To conclude, we present extensive computational experiments reporting the results of well-known datasets in the literature of supervised classification. The objectives of these experiments are to compare this model with other models in the literature and to show the results of the presented heuristic and exact approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2917396377", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86500302"}

More recently, a few automated surveillance systems have been developed to monitor cashier lanes and detect non-compliant activities such as fake item checkouts or scans done with the intention of deriving monetary benefit. These systems use data from surveillance video cameras and transaction logs (TLog) recorded at the Point-of-Sale (POS). In this paper, we present a pattern discovery based approach to detect fraudulent events at the POS. Our approach is based on mining time-ordered text streams, representing retail transactions, formed from a combination of visually detected checkout related activities called primitives and barcodes from TLog data. Patterns representing single item checkouts, i.e. anchored around a single barcode, are discovered from these text streams using an efficient pattern discovery technique called Teiresias. The discovered patterns are used to build models for true and fake item scans by retaining or discarding the anchoring barcodes in those patterns respectively. A pattern matching and classification scheme is designed to robustly detect non-compliant cashier activities in the presence of noise in either the TLog or the video data. Different weighting schemes for quantifying the relative importance of the discovered patterns are explored: Frequency, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Frequency+SVM. Using a large scale dataset recorded from retail stores, our approach discovers semantically meaningful cashier scan patterns.

In more recent works however, CRF post-processing has fallen out of favour. We argue that this is mainly due to the slow training and inference speeds of CRFs, as well as the difficulty of learning the internal CRF parameters. To overcome both issues we propose to add the assumption of conditional independence to the framework of fully-connected CRFs. This allows us to reformulate the inference in terms of convolutions, which can be implemented highly efficiently on GPUs. Doing so speeds up inference and training by a factor of more then 100. All parameters of the convolutional CRFs can easily be optimized using backpropagation. To facilitating further CRF research we make our implementation publicly available.

The calculations were performed for a set of 18 sydnone-alkyne reactions with a help of a semi-automatized workflow involving reagent preparation and generation of starting structures for a plausible transition state. Reconstructed reaction path supported two-step mechanism: cycloaddition followed by retro-Diels-Alder reaction. Since the latter had a tiny barrier, the cycloaddition step was predicted to be the rate-limiting. For the ensemble of reactions, calculations reproduce activation free energies extracted from experimental reaction rates (k) with the accuracy of 2 kcal/mol. Accounting for solvation effects didn't change the overall trend of activation free energies as a function of substituents. A series of statistical model linking logk and sydnones structure was built using Support Vector Regression and Multiple Linear Regression machine-learning methods coupled with different types of molecular descriptors; none of them demonstrated a good performance at cross-validation stage. Detailed analysis of different factors affecting reaction rate variation as a function of substituents revealed particular role of the charge on C3 atom in the sydnone moiety as well as of the size of the substituent at C3.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.molstruc.2019.126897", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Molecular Structure", "mag_id": "2965650256", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201228766"}

This inability can lead to monetary problems for individuals and in worst-case economic crises for whole societies.In this master thesis paper we present how a predictive model constructed from a multilayer perceptron can predict the price of a condominium in the centre of Stockholm using objective data from sources publicly available. The value produced by the model is enriched with a predictive interval using the Inductive Conformal Prediction algorithm to give a clear view of the quality of the prediction. In addition, the Multilayer Perceptron is compared with the commonly used Support Vector Regression algorithm to underline the hallmark of neural networks handling of a broad spectrum of features.The features used to construct the Multilayer Perceptron model are gathered from multiple \u201cOpen Data\u201d sources and includes data as: 5,990 apartment sales prices from 2011- 2013, interest rates for condominium loans from two major banks, national election results from 2010, geographic information and nineteen local features.

There are 7 classes of short epileptic discharges, identification of which is often considered an effective screening of epileptic seizure patients. In this study, we consider classification of these short epileptic discharges. For this purpose, we analyzed 422 multi-channel EEG segments, each 4 $s$ long.

We incorporated features of physicochemical/biochemical properties, sequence conservation, residual disorder, secondary structure and solvent accessibility. We also included five 3D structural features to predict protein-protein interaction sites and achieved an overall accuracy of 0.672997 and MCC of 0.347977. Feature analysis showed that 3D structural features such as Depth Index (DPX) and surface curvature (SC) contributed most to the prediction of protein-protein interaction sites. It was also shown via site-specific feature analysis that the features of individual residues from PPI sites contribute most to the determination of protein-protein interaction sites.

Cheryl Fantuzzi University of California, Los Angeles Although purely empiricist, or environment-based, theories of language acquisition suffered some serious setbacks with the rise of generative grammar, they have very recently come into vogue again with a new brand of cognitive modeling known as connectionism. Connectionism represents the strongest form of empiricism: radical connectionists typically argue that all learning is based on the processing of input, and that there is no need to posit any a priori internal structure to the processing system at all. What linguists describe as rule-governed behavior, radical connectionists say is only a description of the emergent behavior of the processor. Learning is simply a matter of strengthening and weakening neural connections in response to the statistical frequency of patterns in the input, and the abstract symbols and rules that are so crucial to current linguistic theory have no place at all in a connectionist system. There have been varied responses to these strong claims. Some have been wildly enthusiastic about the new approach (e.g., Sampson, 1987) while others have severely Mehler, criticized many of its claims (e.g., the papers in Pinker extensive middle ground between the two 1989). There is also an extremes however. While pure Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models seem to work best with problems involving motor control or the earliest stages of visual processing, connectionists working with more complex cognitive processes such as language or problem solving have often incorporated symbols into their connectionist architectures (e.g., the papers in Hinton, 1991). There has recendy been some interest in the applicability of connectionist models to Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory and research (Schmidt, 1988; Gasser, 1990; Sokolik, 1990).

Model selection for kernel machines is commonly performed via optimisation of a suitable model selection criterion, often based on cross-validation or theoretical performance bounds. However, if there are a large number of kernel parameters, as for instance in the case of automatic relevance determination (ARD), there is a substantial risk of over-fitting the model selection criterion, resulting in poor generalisation performance. In this paper we investigate the possibility of learning the kernel, for the Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier, at the first level of inference, i.e. parameter optimisation. The kernel parameters and the coefficients of the kernel expansion are jointly optimised at the first level of inference, minimising a training criterion with an additional regularisation term acting on the kernel parameters. The key advantage of this approach is that the values of only two regularisation parameters need be determined in model selection, substantially alleviating the problem of over-fitting the model selection criterion. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated using a suite of synthetic and real-world binary classification benchmark problems, where kernel learning at the first level of inference is shown to be statistically superior to the conventional approach, improves on our previous work (Cawley and Talbot, 2007) and is competitive with Multiple Kernel Learning approaches, but with reduced computational expense.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24561452", "doi": "10.1016/j.neunet.2014.01.011", "venue": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2140554171", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35737200", "14710132", "685382", "5671899", "2837879", "1157797", "37925315", "14814125", "10786968", "13958427", "10448015", "10219459", "16394436", "1858029", "961425", "60100229", "14607075", "59640222", "59640222", "206787478", "7553535", "120581754", "5593513", "16373924", "14215320", "2552688", "1386002", "15787913", "10137788", "60835229", "116281095", "8473401", "17793133", "39274936", "60809283", "2208295", "59860283", "3144723", "13391792", "10445998", "60488836", "12986077", "7099687", "64543020", "35730151", "53940663", "12003790", "36198911", "198489576", "27423901", "43711678", "53662922", "426619", "17753685", "8186581"], "inbound_citations": ["52158779"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12610029"}

Protein databases, combined with functional annotations and machine learning (ML) techniques, offer many potential benefits, including significantly facilitating rapid pharmacological target identification. The main objective of this study is to identify, for the problem of enzyme classification, the most powerful combinations of descriptors taken from different protein representations. To achieve this objective, four approaches for representing the Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) combined with three methods for representing the Amino Acid Sequence (AAS) are evaluated with the aim of experimentally producing a powerful ensemble of descriptors for enzyme function prediction. Each protein descriptor is classified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the set of SVMs finally combined by sum rule. Cross-validation experiments using these descriptors on single-functional enzymes (n=44,661) extracted from the PDB database demonstrate that the ensemble proposed here achieves superior classification rates compared to state-of-the-art ML techniques reported in the literature on the same dataset. Although the proposed ensemble strongly outperforms these other techniques, it is computationally much heavier, mainly because the PSSM extraction process is time consuming.

The problems essentially arise from the two-player formulation, where a single discriminator shares incompatible roles of identifying fake samples and predicting labels and it only estimates the data without considering the labels. To address the problems, we present triple generative adversarial net (Triple-GAN), which consists of three players---a generator, a discriminator and a classifier. The generator and the classifier characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels, and the discriminator solely focuses on identifying fake image-label pairs. We design compatible utilities to ensure that the distributions characterized by the classifier and the generator both converge to the data distribution. Our results on various datasets demonstrate that Triple-GAN as a unified model can simultaneously (1) achieve the state-of-the-art classification results among deep generative models, and (2) disentangle the classes and styles of the input and transfer smoothly in the data space via interpolation in the latent space class-conditionally.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1703.02291", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950957598,2596763562,2964218010", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["8018433", "5002792", "1282515", "84591", "9127770", "1033682", "10742222", "15816723", "5808102", "18268744", "17413181", "536962", "1972072", "9398766", "16852518", "16173204", "11758569", "16895865", "1687220"], "inbound_citations": ["53115393", "1267737", "204949877", "182952301", "208013823", "208202137", "57573840", "44157730", "203605394", "211532294", "49901205", "155100140", "207887988", "4903028", "207930611", "58671548", "3601869", "52284769", "198315054", "125381778", "47011860", "49868925", "208039701", "203902798", "6314431", "199405343", "195455514", "1300420", "46973147", "3709547", "69394576", "55703209", "214605902", "52958532", "49665361", "210692260", "26509757", "169035129", "72940796", "208359638", "199489059", "208057984", "53282572", "146807628", "209376451", "198229709", "195513473", "139103323", "55726047", "9208866", "52816759", "4504215", "202565949", "4406617", "201876701", "57378601", "3699386", "201094334", "914501", "196203095", "53323289", "54444904", "212628529", "174799416", "49862308", "36011704", "209439622", "198169514", "53432553", "203593595", "52157913", "202537756", "58028736", "121186345", "4397268", "33391968", "3631901", "164637600", "19482640", "4381935", "202790101", "208910107", "119308874", "2220097", "25380616", "195513844", "7448250", "211836243", "202763547", "210839653", "202578080", "69801758", "70349915", "3843342", "52046547", "202765745", "67752793", "209318784", "3555851", "210693404", "198168672", "19134828", "44122339", "52286209", "204800620", "13748858", "213261339", "214728063", "67855874", "173188748", "50773731", "53976534", "52296788", "4393506", "209376612", "59606217", "211069239", "51865118"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17579179"}

The aim of this work is to develop a framework using natural language processing and machine learning to build information extraction algorithms to identify data elements in a new primary publication, without having to go through the expensive task of manual annotation to build gold standards for each data element type. The system is developed in two stages. Initially, it uses information contained in existing systematic reviews to identify the sentences from the PDF files of the included references that contain specific data elements of interest using a modified Jaccard similarity measure. These sentences have been treated as labeled data.A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on this labeled data to extract data elements of interests from a new article. We conducted experiments on Cochrane Database systematic reviews related to congestive heart failure using inclusion criteria as an example data element. The empirical results show that the proposed system automatically identifies sentences containing the data element of interest with a high recall (93.75%) and reasonable precision (27.05% - which means the reviewers have to read only 3.7 sentences on average). The empirical results suggest that the tool is retrieving valuable information from the reference articles, even when it is time-consuming to identify them manually. Thus we hope that the tool will be useful for automatic data extraction from biomedical research publications.

This is done by comparisons of transmitted and scattered light at various wavelengths using a Machine Learning Algorithm. Smoke was introduced in the paths of light of different wavelengths, simultaneously. The wavelengths were chosen from widest spectrum of radiation, for which LEDs and photodiodes were available commercially. These include UVC 275 nm, UVA 365 nm, Blue 405 nm, Red 620 nm and IR 960 nm. At least one photodiode was used to sense transmitted and at least one photodiode to sense scattered light from each wavelength of light. Each smoke or aerosol, from a single material, was tested many times to create large datasets. After a selection process, a Machine Learning Algorithm, namely Random Forest, was trained with the data from all materials burnt. It was found that a number of materials that are commonly involved in building fires can be identified with high accuracy using this model. The materials were identified with an accuracy of 99.6%\u201359%, which are N-Heptane, polyester carpet, Can smoke, PVC insulated wire, polyurethane foam, cotton fabric, cardboard, cigarette and polystyrene foam.

Although association mapping has the potential to improve our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of climatically relevant traits, the utility of adaptive polymorphisms uncovered by such studies would be greatly enhanced by the development of integrated models that account for the phenotypic effects of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their interactions simultaneously. We previously reported the results of association mapping in the widespread conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). In the current study we used the recursive partitioning algorithm 'Random Forest' to identify optimized combinations of SNPs to predict adaptive phenotypes. After adjusting for population structure, we were able to explain 37% and 30% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, in two locally adaptive traits--autumn budset timing and cold hardiness. For each trait, the leading five SNPs captured much of the phenotypic variation. To determine the role of epistasis in shaping these phenotypes, we also used a novel approach to quantify the strength and direction of pairwise interactions between SNPs and found such interactions to be common. Our results demonstrate the power of Random Forest to identify subsets of markers that are most important to climatic adaptation, and suggest that interactions among these loci may be widespread.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3429923", "pubmed_id": "22973546", "doi": "10.1534/g3.112.002733", "venue": "G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics", "journal": "G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2061576695", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["90440593", "11478723", "18812656", "89141", "12715698", "14874382", "7529644", "24721205", "17230318", "22600350", "12208080", "18401995", "16007893", "22379946", "10447007", "21791471", "19536622", "18332212", "84621666", "567856", "22564104", "3379276", "18957897", "1861097", "17455870", "35546484", "9997512", "205364696", "15880873", "25735701", "16463441", "526282", "1852783", "3064162", "10759276", "1474548", "2585218", "1359030", "10095994", "9134834", "20123363", "45934533", "206508912", "2397530", "42511732", "26333959", "12064878", "52871542", "2315362", "25776992", "15588516", "2013990", "22711217", "85843417", "205607235", "8507433", "1210670"], "inbound_citations": ["4502519", "90137205", "21618897", "206179911", "4701110", "18214078", "18042024", "215197107", "3307253", "22515818", "51614499", "202159571", "132665106", "11351474", "7307687", "36458165", "7219481", "96435670", "205108145", "8924055", "16602518", "17439458", "23934699", "211058720", "51966180", "214983530", "7433506", "215584756", "49321143"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1746430"}

Then all the image glyphs are considered for recognition using Unicode mapping. Each image glyph is passed through various routines which extract the features of the glyph.

They're image pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification of carcinoma as benign or malignant.

Sabourin, F. Craik, & M. Robert (Eds.), Advances in psychological science, Volume 2: Biological and cognitive aspects. Hove, East Sussex; Psychology Press, 1998. (633 + xxii pages). D. J. K. MEWHORT, Queen's University The volume arose from the International Congress of Psychology held in Montreal, August 1996. It is a collection of papers, predominantly on biological aspects of psychology. Although the title promises a discussion of cognition, like the dog that did not bark in the Sherlock Holmes story, reference to much of current cognitive psychology is conspicuously missing. In the section on Cognition, Perception, and Memory, for example, only three papers (Hatano on comprehension, Bertelson on perception of multimodal events, and Koria on metamemory) have an experimentalbehavioural focus. Moreover, such icons of cognitive psychology as J. R. Anderson, A. Baddeley, C. Burgess, M. Coltheart, D. Hintzman, M. Humphreys, P. Johnson-Laird, H. Pashler, D. Kahneman, W. Kintsch, T. Landauer, B. Murdock, G. McKoon, D. Medin, J. Nairne, R. Nosofsky, A. Newell, R. Ratcliff, R. Schank, R. Shiffrin, A. Treisman, and A. Tversky are not cited anywhere. Connectionist thinking is considered only in Plunkett's paper on cognitive development. In short, the psychological science advanced in the book is a very different psychology than the one I know. As I read the book, I felt like an outsider looking in on a psychology that has been untouched by the revolution in computational modelling and, indeed, untouched by much of current behavioural work. But first, let me turn to sex and mayhem. Roubertoux, Mortaud, Torjman, Le Roy, and Degrelle discuss genetic aspects of aggression using the mouse as an animal model. It is a fascinating example of basic science and, importantly, of good methodology. The genetic contribution to aggression is complex and indirect. As Roubertoux et al. note, it is not a story that lends itself to simple-minded excursions into social policy: It \"should discourage any eugenic temptation and disgrace eugenics itself' (p. 24). But, as they also note, mayhem results if the lesson is ignored. Their example concerns a dispute within the Behavior Genetics Association leading to the resignation of the President Elect both from office and from the society itself. But, with eugenic and racist views waiting in the wings, even among academics who ought to know the science better, it takes little imagination to project mayhem to a larger social stage. Corballis provides an elegantly written speculation on the mind's evolution. The paper ranges over a wide set of issues from bipedalism, language in nonhuman primates, the development of human language, to specialization of the cerebral hemispheres. It is a delightful romp through anthropology and natural history. But, the speculation is based on indirect correlational evidence. The history of experimental design, from Claude Bernard forward, shows that there is no substitute for manipulative control (a like concern led the Societe Linguistique de Paris in 1866 to ban papers on the origins of language). However delightful and colourful the prose, it is difficult to imagine a practical way to test the idea that the inhabitants of the Great Rift valley adopted bipedal walking because \"knuckle-walking may have been simply less efficient than upright walking, especially over long distances\" (p. 39). I raise the methodological issue not because I disliked Corballis's paper but because it was fun and because I felt guilty for liking it: Methodology is the core of science. The topic, the evolution of the mind, is unlikely to engender the emotional response given to sex, race, and criminal aggression, but, as Roubertoux et al. document, once one weakens the rules of evidence, the door is open to mayhem. Kanwisher reviews studies of human brain imaging to illuminate the processing of visual shape, the what-where issue, and face perception. \u2026", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1037/h0092591", "venue": null, "journal": "Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology", "mag_id": "2000720591", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["173989453"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143719279"}

One, E-GAN, at each batch, injects mutation diversity by training the (replicated) generator with three independent objective functions then selecting the resulting best performing generator for the next batch. The other, Lipizzaner, injects population diversity by training a two-dimensional grid of GANs with a distributed evolutionary algorithm that includes neighbor exchanges of additional training adversaries, performance based selection and population-based hyper-parameter tuning. We propose to combine mutation and population approaches to diversity improvement. We contribute a superior evolutionary GANs training method, Mustangs, that eliminates the single loss function used across Lipizzaner's grid.

Within Latin American and the Caribbean region (LAC), many studies have documented extensive deforestation, but there are also many local studies reporting forest recovery. These contrasting dynamics have been largely attributed to demographic and socio-economic change. For example, local population change due to migration can stimulate forest recovery, while the increasing global demand for food can drive agriculture expansion. However, as no analysis has simultaneously evaluated deforestation and reforestation from the municipal to continental scale, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of these processes. We overcame this limitation by producing wall-to-wall, annual maps of change in woody vegetation and other land-cover classes between 2001 and 2010 for each of the 16,050 municipalities in LAC, and we used nonparametric Random Forest regression analyses to determine which environmental or population variables best explained the variation in woody vegetation change. Woody vegetation change was dominated by deforestation (541,835 km 2 ), particularly in the moist forest, dry forest, and savannas/shrublands biomes in South America. Extensive areas also recovered woody vegetation (+362,430 km 2 ), particularly in regions too dry or too steep for modern agriculture. Deforestation in moist forests tended to occur in lowland areas with low population density, but woody cover change was not related to municipality-scale population change.

Fuzzy Integrals (FIs) are widely used aggregation operators, which combine information in respect to a Fuzzy Measure (FM) which captures the worth of both the individual sources and all their possible combinations.

The latter is particularly relevant when a FM has been defined using external information (e.g. experts). In order to address this and provide an alternative to the FI, the Recursive Average (RAV) aggregation operator was recently proposed which enables intuitive data fusion in respect to a given FM. With an alternative fusion operator in place, in this paper, we define the concept of \u2018A Priori\u2019 FMs which are generated based on external information (e.g. classification accuracy) and thus provide an alternative to the traditional approaches of learning or manually specifying FMs. We proceed to develop one specific instance of such an a priori FM to support the decision level fusion step in ensemble classification.

Mind arises from a complex dynamics of the modular and hierarchical brain structures. Approximations to this dynamics lead to a set of concepts [1] helpful in description of the mind, such as the concepts of mind events taking place in feature spaces, called at the highest level of hierarchy \u201cconceptual spaces\u201d or \u201cmind spaces\u201d. Among many other aspects mind models should be capable of recognition, classification and reasoning. Cognitive modeling may not always be faithful to neurobiology, but tries to preserve essential functions simplifying the underlying structures and dynamics. Neurofuzzy networks are natural implementations of such models. In this paper we present one particular realization of general cognitive modeling ideas [1] and apply the resulting neurofuzzy network to classification problems. We will assume that the incoming signals I(t) are subject to preprocessing (accomplished in the brain by various topographic maps and population coding mechanisms) that defines features of internal representations Xi(t) suitable for classification. A coordinate system based on these features {Xi} defines a multidimensional feature space. Since these features may be of different types (for example, coming from different sensory modalities) partial classifications are performed in local feature spaces while the final classification is performed in the space that is higher in the hierarchy, called here \u201cthe mind space\u201d.

To analyze human motion with micro-Doppler signatures measured by radar, a deep learning algorithm is one of the most effective approaches. Because deep learning requires a large data set, the high cost involved in measuring large amounts of human data is an intrinsic problem. The objective of this study is to augment human motion micro-Doppler data employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve the accuracy of human motion classification. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: To test data augmentation provided by GANs, authentic data for 7 human activities were collected using micro-Doppler radar. Each motion yielded 144 data samples. Software including GPU driver, CUDA library, cuDNN library, and Anaconda were installed to train the GANs. Keras-GPU, SciPy, Pillow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Git were used to create an Anaconda environment. The data produced by GANs were saved every 300 epochs, and the training was stopped at 3,000 epochs.

Moreover, the density of the powder compact is very influent in thermal transformations and in the global densification rate. Consequently, dilatometry curves are difficult to explain by analytical methods due to the complex response of porcelain and due to the cost and time required to conduct many experiments, which lead to sparse data sets. In this article, Support Vector Regression (SVR) was applied to predict the behavior of porcelain during sintering from a small set of experiments of densification against time, green density, and applied pressure. The SVR method was used to reconstruct any two-dimensional densification\u2013temperature curves at any applied pressure, from the experimental data.

The key idea of the model is a weighting of the sum-of-squares error function, which is inspired by the AdaBoost algorithm. As in SVM, the hardness of the margin can be controlled, so that this model can be also used for the non-linearly separable case. In addition, it is not restricted to the use of kernel functions, and it allows to deal with multiclass and multilabel problems as FNN usually do. Finally, it is independent of the particular algorithm used to minimize the error function. Theoretic and experimental results on synthetic and real-world problems are shown to con=rm these claims.

We aimed to automatically detect subtle or visually-unidentifiable FCDs by building a classifier based on an optimized cortical surface sampling of combined MRI and PET features. Methods Cortical surfaces of 28 patients with histopathologically-proven FCDs were extracted. Morphology and intensity-based features characterizing FCD lesions were calculated vertex-wise on each cortical surface, and fed to a 2-step (Support Vector Machine and patch-based) classifier.

Results show that the accuracy, error rate, sensitivity and prevalence at first 6ordered features are the best for ILPD dataset compared to BUPA dataset. This can be attributed to a number of useful attributes like Total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, Albumin, Gender, Age and Total proteins are available in the ILPD liver dataset compared to the BUPA dataset which can help in diagnosis of liver disease.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "American Journal of Intelligent Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "39179355", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["4221715", "205490610", "79618132", "23226526", "21584810", "28274548", "205918107", "1831347", "207720429", "16964665", "194951", "207753020", "28637672", "64266140", "15059183", "13936540", "196661845", "206567837"], "inbound_citations": ["67779650", "52844130", "196700825", "56053425", "195796097", "59305304"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16787076"}

With increasing pressure of degradation and deforestation, these forests have been prioritized for conservation and carbon offset through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanisms. We provide the first regional assessment of forest structure and aboveground biomass using measurements from a combination of ground tree inventories and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar). More than 80,000 ha of lidar samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling to provide a regionally unbiased quantification of forest structure of Choc\u00f3 across gradients of vegetation structure, disturbance and elevation. We developed a model to convert measurements of vertical structure of forests into aboveground biomass (AGB) for terra firme, wetlands, and mangrove forests. We used the Random Forest machine learning model and a formal uncertainty analysis to map forest height and AGB at 1-ha spatial resolution for the entire pacific coastal region using spaceborne data, extending from the coast to higher elevation of Andean forests. Upland Choc\u00f3 forests have a mean canopy height of 21.8 m and AGB of 233.0 Mg/ha, while wetland forests are characterized by a lower height and AGB (13.5 m and 117.5 Mg/a). Mangroves have a lower mean height than upland forests (16.5 m), but have a similar AGB as upland forests (229.9 Mg/ha) due to their high wood density. Within the terra firme forest class, intact forests have the highest AGB (244.3 \u00b1 34.8 Mg/ha) followed by degraded and secondary forests with 212.57 \u00b1 62.40 Mg/ha of biomass. Forest degradation varies in biomass loss from small-scale selective logging and firewood harvesting to large-scale tree removals for gold mining, settlements, and illegal logging. Our findings suggest that the forest degradation has already caused the loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon.

Though the inclusion of morphology into the lexicon-based system improves the performance of the word-level emotion tagging, the Conditional Random Field-based machine-learning framework was employed for the word-level emotion-tagging system, and it outperforms both the baseline- and lexicon-based systems. Six separate sense scores for six emotion types are calculated from the SentiWordNet and applied to word-level emotion tagged constituents for identifying sentential emotion scores. Three emotion scoring methods followed by a post-processing technique were employed for identifying the sentence-level emotion tags. In addition to that, the best two emotion tags corresponding to the maximum obtained sense scores are assigned to the sentences, whereas the sentence-level valence is identified based on the total sense scores of the word-level emotion tags along with their polarity.

Popular dimensionality reduction techniques usually assume a Gaussian distribution, which may not be in accordance with real life. Metric learning methods, which explore the global data structure of the labeled training samples, have proved to be very efficient in hyperspectral fields. However, we can go further by utilizing locally adaptive decision constraints for the labeled training samples per class to obtain an even better performance. In this paper, we present the locally adaptive dimensionality reduction metric learning (LADRml) method for hyperspectral image classification. The aims of the presented method are: 1) first, to utilize the limited training samples to reduce the dimensionality of data without a certain distribution hypothesis; and 2) second, to better handle data with complex distributions by the use of locally adaptive decision constraints, which can assess the similarity between a pair of samples based on the distance changes before and after metric learning. The experimental results obtained with a number of challenging hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that the proposed LADRml algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction and metric learning methods.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2587747", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2494628060", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["6906514", "10533950", "2614253", "7771801", "5415861", "205907253", "117710212", "62165049", "56804707", "18338127", "27931890", "37655527", "122725444", "33162734", "10726702", "61399356", "14532880", "19587242", "2627705", "207020771", "4641916", "14283441", "8714672", "9922877", "17234861", "13053338", "740063", "206787478", "59076046", "6906514", "2643381", "27453746", "15514193", "8616518", "47325215", "7231714", "1150049", "118174561", "4644484", "18960570", "18040001", "1490356", "53306004", "207168225", "5155714", "42785894", "195681114", "14310638", "42792444", "13536642", "15252304", "7419723", "15258679", "5246200", "20253244", "7740276", "40128189", "7993309", "10707042", "43846694", "33630661"], "inbound_citations": ["54456746", "210693549", "3754543", "145864476", "52927586", "9781946"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12127638"}

In this proposed method, CEEMD, a current extension from the competitive decomposition family of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), is first applied to divide the original data (i.e., difficult task) into a number of components (i.e., relatively easy subtasks). Then, EELM, a recently developed, powerful, fast and stable intelligent learning technique, is implemented to predict all extracted components individually. Finally, these predicted results are aggregated into an ensemble result as the final prediction using simple addition ensemble method. With the crude oil spot prices of WTI and Brent as sample data, the empirical results demonstrate that the novel CEEMD-based EELM ensemble model statistically outperforms all listed benchmarks (including typical forecasting techniques and similar ensemble models with other decomposition and ensemble tools) in prediction accuracy.

Firstly, we convert raw functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a matrix to represent activity of 90 brain regions. Secondly, to represent the functional connectivity between different brain regions, a correlation matrix is obtained by calculating the correlation between each pair of brain regions. In the next, a targeted autoencoder network is built to classify the correlation matrix, which is sensitive to AD. Finally, the experiment results show that our proposed method for AD prediction achieves much better effects than traditional means. It finds the correlations between different brain regions efficiently, provides strong reference for AD prediction.

Unfortunately, the link between coasts and user has not been stayed in balance due to growing pressure from increasingly diverse human activities. Anthropogenic pressure on coastal areas is rising because of the fact that people are tend to settle by the coast for some reasons such as better transportation, nutrition and commerce. Many conflicts were observed during the establishment of mega cities on coastal zones. Unfortunately, sustainability is generally neglected through the solution process of the coastal problems. Even though, it is a relatively late step, the recent initiatives have a potential to decrease the anthropogenic pressure on coastal zones in Turkey. To achieve the best management strategy, there should be a well established connection between science and policy. Therefore novel technologies should be used for better monitoring and mapping the coastal zones. Coastline mapping is one of the fundamental steps of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) planning. In this study, coastal zone of the Trabzon city which comprises approximately 110 km length including central district and 9 coastal counties was investigated in terms of decadal coastline changes and associated land use/cover (LULC) types. Automatic extraction of the coastline was achieved by applying proposed methodology on multispectral Landsat TM/ETM images. To obtain the LULC classes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was implemented and four classes, water, vegetation, impervious surface and bare soil were identified. Finally all graphical data was transferred and analyzed within GIS environment. The coastline changes were evaluated by using a GIS tool of Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). DSAS results revealed that, the net coastline change was reached up to 88.2 m in central region of Trabzon. It was found that during the time span (1984\u20132011) coastal agricultural lands were intentionally converted to impervious surfaces. The ratio analyses of the study area showed that impervious surface area was doubled for the last 27 years. The coastal zone of the region can be characterized with \u201caccretion\u201d type zone. The geomorphologic character, linear-littoral development of the city and recently completed North Anatolian highway might be dominant effects in shaping the coastal zone character.

We test the effect of data sampling using three data sampling techniques coupled with two post-sampling class distribution ratios. Additionally, we built inductive models with Random Forest when no data sampling technique was applied, so we can observe the true effect of the data sampling. Lastly, we utilize three feature selection techniques, four feature subset sizes, and fifteen imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. Our results show that, in general, data sampling does improve the classification performance of Random Forest.

Both groups were matched according to their cognitive status. The study aims at evaluating neurophysiological features of elderly participants suffering from depression and neurodegeneration. The current work focuses on the identification of depression symptoms that coexist with cognitive decline, the correlation of the examined neurophysiological features with geriatric depression combined with cognitive impairment and the investigation of the role of data mining techniques in the analysis of EEG data. The EEG features were estimated through synchronization analysis (Orthogonal Discrete Wavelet Transform). Depressive patterns were detected through data mining techniques.

The similarity functions used in the graphs are intentionally chosen to be very simple and language-independent to make our methods as generic as possible, and to show that significant improvements can be achieved even by starting with such similarity functions.

This paper investigates robot learning in a lifelong learning framework. In lifelong learning, the learner faces an entire collection of learning tasks, not just a single one. Thus, it provides the opportunity for synergy among multiple tasks. To obtain this synergy, the central question in lifelong learning is how can the learner transfer knowledge across multiple tasks. In this paper we describe a selective approach to lifelong learning, the task clustering (TC) algorithm. TC transfers knowledge across multiple tasks by adjusting the distance metric in nearest neighbour generalization. To increase robustness to unrelated tasks, TC arranges all learning tasks hierarchically. When a new learning task arrives, TC relates it to the task hierarchy, in order to transfers knowledge selectively from the most related tasks only. As a result, TC is more robust than its unselective counterpart. Thus far, TC has been successfully applied to perception tasks involving visual and ultrasonic input, using our mobile robot XAVIER.

A group let is defined as a set of audio and/or visual code words that are grouped together according to their strong correlations in videos. By using the entire group lets as building elements, concepts can be more robustly detected than using discrete audio or visual code words. Compared with the traditional method of generating aggregated group let-based features for classification, our group let-based distance metric learning approach directly learns distances between data points, which better preserves the group let structure. Specifically, our algorithm uses an iterative quadratic programming formulation where the optimal distance metric can be effectively learned based on the large-margin nearest-neighbor setting. The framework is quite flexible, where various types of distances can be computed using individual group lets, and through the same distance metric learning algorithm the distances computed over individual group lets can be combined for final classification. We extensively evaluate our method over the large-scale Columbia Consumer Video set. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve consistent and significant performance improvements.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICME.2012.123", "venue": "2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo", "journal": "2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2051521096", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12365014", "7677566", "11788802", "828465", "130535382", "206590483", "17135730", "14388693", "6495092", "1352308", "5217956", "47325215", "10315527", "2261947", "64543020", "2785490", "15199783", "124075845", "18764978", "8172552"], "inbound_citations": ["18675766"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29140865"}

However, they also generate a large amount of irrelevant or redundant data for a specific task. This causes a number of issues including significantly increased computation time, complexity and scale of prediction models mapping the data to semantics (e.g., classification), and the need of a large amount of labelled data for training. Particularly, it is generally difficult and expensive for experts to acquire sufficient training samples in many applications. This paper addresses these issues by exploring a number of classical dimension reduction algorithms in machine learning communities for HSI classification. To reduce the size of training dataset, feature selection (e.g., mutual information, minimal redundancy maximal relevance) and feature extraction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA) are adopted to augment a baseline classification method, Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed algorithms are evaluated using a real HSI dataset. It is shown that PCA yields the most promising performance in reducing the number of features or spectral bands. It is observed that while significantly reducing the computational complexity, the proposed method can achieve better classification results over the classic SVM on a small training dataset, which makes it suitable for real-time applications or when only limited training data are available. Furthermore, it can also achieve performances similar to the classic SVM on large datasets but with much less computing time.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5750527", "pubmed_id": "29186846", "doi": "10.3390/s17122726", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2770641139", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2078144", "7403371", "8569776", "1061919", "18205773", "18330985", "52106580", "16008390", "30989494", "2357415", "40020155", "379259", "95289", "38916788", "13366994", "3396506", "61649919", "252810", "130308916", "14004541", "202503", "207165665", "15943670", "1455429", "21266356", "2583079", "17392198", "206764015", "7831590", "15688865"], "inbound_citations": ["208035910", "52192069", "91188575", "202672295", "197863371", "56594386", "52296981", "52182020", "125134660", "52928651", "53749851"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3616879"}

Here we use a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to create an effective non-Gaussian statistical model for intensity of emission by interstellar dust. For training data we use a set of dust maps inferred from observations by the Planck satellite.

The seven species and groups included sand live oak (Quercus geminata), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), live oak (Q. virginiana), pine (species group), palm (species group), camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), and magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). A multi-level classification system was adopted to classify image objects of the tree species and groups. Species classification performance was compared between the five individual seasonal Pleiades images, between two combined dry-wet season images, and between the optimal single season and combined dry-wet season image data. Shade image objects were spectrally normalized to similar sunlit image objects. The tree species fraction features were extracted from the seasonal images using the Mixture Tuned Matching Filtering approach and used as additional features to a set of spectral and spatial/textural features.

Extracting fault-sensitive features from multi-sensor time series is a daunting task for both traditional data-driven methods and current deep learning models. A novel hybrid end-to-end deep learning framework named Time-distributed ConvLSTM model (TDConvLSTM) is proposed in the paper for machine health monitoring, which works directly on raw multi-sensor time series. In TDConvLSTM, the normalized multi-sensor data is first segmented into a collection of subsequences by a sliding window along the temporal dimension. Time-distributed local feature extractors are simultaneously applied to each subsequence to extract local spatiotemporal features. Then a holistic ConvLSTM layer is designed to extract holistic spatiotemporal features between subsequences. At last, a fully-connected layer and a supervised learning layer are stacked on the top of the model to obtain the target. TDConvLSTM can extract spatiotemporal features on different time scales without any handcrafted feature engineering.

A relative comparison specifies, for a data point triplet $(x_i,x_j,x_k)$, that instance $x_i$ is more similar to $x_j$ than to $x_k$. Such constraints, when available, have been shown to be useful toward defining appropriate distance metrics. In real-world applications, acquiring constraints often require considerable human effort. This motivates us to study how to select and query the most useful relative comparisons to achieve effective metric learning with minimum user effort. Given an underlying class concept that is employed by the user to provide such constraints, we present an information-theoretic criterion that selects the triplet whose answer leads to the highest expected gain in information about the classes of a set of examples. Directly applying the proposed criterion requires examining $O(n^3)$ triplets with $n$ instances, which is prohibitive even for datasets of moderate size. We show that a randomized selection strategy can be used to reduce the selection pool from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n)$, allowing us to scale up to larger-size problems.

We show that this method outperforms other machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, C4.5 decision tree, and k-nearest neighbour classifier) in predicting positive/negative abnormal stock returns. Thus, this neural network seems to be well suited for text classification tasks working with sparse high-dimensional data.

This target article illustrates some of the benefits of localist modelling. Localist models are characterized by the presence of localist representations rather than the absence of distributed representations. A general- ized localist model is proposed that exhibits many of the properties of fully distributed models. It can be applied to a number of prob- lems that are difficult for fully distributed models, and its applicability can be extended through comparisons with a number of classic mathematical models of behaviour. There are reasons why localist models have been underused, though these often misconstrue the lo- calist position. In particular, many conclusions about connectionist representation, based on neuroscientific observation, can be called into question.

The basic block of the model is a certain type of astable multivibrator comprising excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Many of these blocks are laterally coupled on a medium range to provide a two-dimensional layer. Our model, like others, needs noise to reproduce typical stochastic oscillations. Due to its spatial extension, the noise has to be laterally correlated. When the contrast ratio of the pictures varies, their share of the perception time changes in a way that is known from comparable experimental data (Levelt, 1965; Mueller & Blake, 1989). This is a result of the lateral coupling and not a property of the single model block. The presentation of simple and suitable inhomogeneous stimuli leads to an easily describable perception of periodically moving pictures like propagating fronts or breathing spots.

However, credit card fraud is still a major concern for financial security. Credit card fraud detection is a typical imbalanced classification problem, in which fraudulent cardholders are far less than non-fraudulent cardholders. The training on imbalanced samples will cause that the classifier ignores the minor fraudulent samples. To solve this problem, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based classification method is proposed for credit card fraud detection. GAN consists of a generative model and a discriminative model, and the two models are trained in a competitive way to get the Nash equilibrium. Specifically, the generative model tries to fit the real distribution of the non-fraudulent samples. The discriminative model determines the probability of a sample belongs to the distribution of non-fraudulent samples. To improve the discrimination performance, the fraudulent samples are also used in the training of discriminative model, which is different from the traditional GAN training scheme.

Predicting cognitive performance of subjects from their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures and identifying relevant imaging biomarkers are important research topics in the study of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, the multitask learning (MTL) methods with sparsity-inducing norm (e.g., \u21132,1-norm) have been widely studied to select the discriminative feature subset from MRI features by incorporating inherent correlations among multiple clinical cognitive measures. However, these previous works formulate the prediction tasks as a linear regression problem. The major limitation is that they assumed a linear relationship between the MRI features and the cognitive outcomes. Some multikernel-based MTL methods have been proposed and shown better generalization ability due to the nonlinear advantage. We quantify the power of existing linear and nonlinear MTL methods by evaluating their performance on cognitive score prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we extend the traditional \u21132,1-norm to a more general \u2113q\u21131-norm (q \u2265 1).

Most often, cardiac dynamic is globally analized from two particular phases of the cardiac cycle. In this paper, we propose an automated method to classify regional wall motion in LV function based on spatio-temporal pro les and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This approach allows to obtain a binary classi cation between normal and abnormal motion, without the need of pre-processing and by exploiting all the images of the cardiac cycle. In each short- axis MRI slice level (basal, median, and apical), the spatio-temporal pro les are extracted from the selection of a subset of diametrical lines crossing opposites LV segments. Initialized at end-diastole phase, the pro les are concatenated with their corresponding projections into the succesive temporal phases of the cardiac cycle. These pro les are associated to di erent types of information that derive from the image (gray levels), Fourier, Wavelet or Curvelet domains.

Currently, various gesture recognition techniques are described in the technical literature; however, the validation studies of these techniques are usually performed isolatedly, which complicates comparisons between them. To reduce this gap, this work presents a comparison between three well-established techniques for static gesture recognition, using Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines as classifiers. These classifiers evaluate a common dataset, acquired from an instrumented glove, and generate results for precision and performance measurements. The results obtained show that the classifier implemented as a Support Vector Machine presented the best generalization, with the highest recognition rate.

The recent release of annotated training sets of de-identified clinical narratives has contributed to the development and refinement of concept extraction methods. However, as the annotation process is labor-intensive, training data are necessarily limited in the concepts and concept patterns covered, which impacts the performance of supervised machine learning applications trained with these data. This paper proposes an approach to minimize this limitation by combining supervised machine learning with empirical learning of semantic relatedness from the distribution of the relevant words in additional unannotated text. The approach uses a sequential discriminative classifier (Conditional Random Fields) to extract the mentions of medical problems, treatments and tests from clinical narratives. It takes advantage of all Medline abstracts indexed as being of the publication type ''clinical trials'' to estimate the relatedness between words in the i2b2/VA training and testing corpora. In addition to the traditional features such as dictionary matching, pattern matching and part-of-speech tags, we also used as a feature words that appear in similar contexts to the word in question (that is, words that have a similar vector representation measured with the commonly used cosine metric, where vector representations are derived using methods of distributional semantics). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort exploring the use of distributional semantics, the semantics derived empirically from unannotated text often using vector space models, for a sequence classification task such as concept extraction. Therefore, we first experimented with different sliding window models and found the model with parameters that led to best performance in a preliminary sequence labeling task. The evaluation of this approach, performed against the i2b2/VA concept extraction corpus, showed that incorporating features based on the distribution of words across a large unannotated corpus significantly aids concept extraction. Compared to a supervised-only approach as a baseline, the micro-averaged F-score for exact match increased from 80.3% to 82.3% and the micro-averaged F-score based on inexact match increased from 89.7% to 91.3%. These improvements are highly significant according to the bootstrap resampling method and also considering the performance of other systems. Thus, distributional semantic features significantly improve the performance of concept extraction from clinical narratives by taking advantage of word distribution information obtained from unannotated data.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3272090", "pubmed_id": "22085698", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2011.10.007", "venue": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2046844528", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2809360", "2354804", "54084367", "117959553", "2208119", "9271158", "14187105", "992853", "10891556", "17754569", "397872", "45091191", "45471371", "17634723", "9950183", "38196941", "26960782", "7168991", "3992511", "14434529", "629094", "5662850", "1500900", "6473756", "60140915", "1144461", "15698938", "7605995", "5509836", "10969169", "3177797", "7747235", "117819162", "8473401", "17182082", "7819391", "16937916", "4589433", "14189476", "12317655", "7666100", "30029552", "62143887", "14468566", "143763229", "9606998", "180055386"], "inbound_citations": ["25541624", "1093327", "16351996", "16233108", "4396122", "10580655", "16293716", "155024", "210930995", "14700403", "5418779", "64311025", "18163988", "4756413", "17829414", "49563790", "13857339", "46974569", "1873417", "4750944", "57191487", "23270770", "16955319", "13989566", "8548694", "8059514", "11988190", "18215786", "3309840", "199509985", "58666808", "46452104", "17344815", "8835458", "13785283", "53029378", "215192185", "9741222", "16079725", "6440056", "8396963", "215032146", "51867532", "16456703", "2916629", "25136315", "12786118", "4227178", "8298634", "12976647", "8980686", "28564704", "12696250", "2113251", "15902587", "203641957", "3932007", "40154426", "208050220"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32098300"}

Nevertheless, these existing methods are designed for the centralized learning case, in which all the data and constraints are supposed to be gathered together in one source, and the algorithms utilize the whole data and constraints information during the learning process. However, in many real applications, large amounts of data (constraints) are dispersedly generated/stored in geographically distributed nodes over networks. Thus, it might be impractical to centralize the whole data information to one fusion node. Besides, in such cases, it is often hard to have every data pair labeled due to the huge data-pair amounts, resulting in numerous unlabeled data pairs. Given these situations, in this paper, we propose two types, namely, a diffusion type and an alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers type, of distributed semi-supervised metric learning frameworks, which make use of both labeled and unlabeled data pairs. The proposed frameworks can be easily used to extend centralized metric learning methods of different objective functions to distributed cases. In particular, we apply our frameworks on a well-behaved centralized semi-supervised metric learning method called SERAPH and yield two new distributed semi-supervised metric learning algorithms.

Our approach is based on modern statistical discrimination methods and is shown to be very effective in removing systematic biases present in a previously published breast tumor cDNA microarray data set. The new method of 'Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD)' is shown to be better than Support Vector Machines and Singular Value Decomposition for the adjustment of systematic microarray effects. In addition, it is shown to be of general use as a tool for the discrimination of systematic problems present in microarray data sets, including the merging of two breast tumor data sets completed on different microarray platforms. ::: ::: Availability: Matlab software to perform DWD can be retrieved from https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/ ::: ::: Supplementary information: The complete figures that represent the cluster diagrams in Figure 6 and other figures are available at https://genome.unc.edu/pubsup/dwd/", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "14693816", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btg385", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2139345901", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14290622", "194951", "60486887", "8655931", "1280204", "15549055", "1105917", "5540354", "117643475"], "inbound_citations": ["195190932", "18560080", "8313600", "8973631", "52803499", "4151634", "1182304", "39337735", "12164329", "44136090", "15754717", "15185328", "3243977", "804853", "1935997", "18124869", "10755838", "6429466", "17932955", "1553760", "4841003", "6840956", "1791704", "14212262", "13624613", "3783868", "18032268", "209149661", "6728809", "47121812", "15633108", "22658663", "1980616", "199630269", "214853189", "13488587", "14907063", "15307974", "15809447", "23119708", "23430841", "17628858", "1362488", "15629986", "1590315", "158046707", "11191204", "7264431", "10762408", "5185546", "17764114", "10796561", "8424051", "10050034", "17736832", "12695881", "53032251", "14918442", "12824486", "5552886", "27170147", "3444572", "14389580", "10152624", "1883925", "8069108", "10148923", "29136925", "2983884", "17462952", "9650894", "11173423", "3496662", "2307117", "52256520", "29948771", "214725383", "5241541", "12470615", "215202773", "13689796", "15929969", "36411818", "215284844", "7620219", "2801098", "10927232", "427219", "25636811", "2783186", "11285098", "149388", "26134044", "332619", "59606736", "7225941", "35825271", "215648385", "10440024", "7566258", "14754730", "14631694", "4707297", "39805201", "15336964", "1657728", "11534888", "14589387", "930575", "17715044", "2407007", "10601514", "6391807", "10916659", "16659441", "8540320", "17005143", "56010335", "51975216", "6625017", "1837372", "10434399", "208498348", "16299739", "24439682", "18575167", "22032519", "42219225", "2417123", "215157156", "3919049", "16774947", "215065228", "3737437", "18785160", "196654941", "179572", "215707686", "59269124", "32947897", "14124966", "206536462", "6031709", "8470648", "12189204", "673458", "36448161", "20744652", "11401747", "14791297", "53092137", "2724559", "13669580", "1976451", "13052360", "14680591", "53995719", "49671306", "22198704", "6479375", "12537386", "722896", "88516815", "44518796", "27313718", "1804808", "4388398", "209169294", "215664903", "12411096", "9546276", "378921", "51940105", "3029955", "215626841", "24790372", "166222288", "4359658", "3220943", "206675454", "11289896", "2509225", "26736022", "13856936", "56265204", "1094520", "14297870", "59222765", "10168337", "1909733", "14175903", "17537435", "4641245", "13602308", "55095246"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3115693"}

These tasks are a crucial step to many natural language understanding applications in the biomedical domain. Automatic medical coding of electronic medical records, automated summarizing of patient records, automatic cohort identification for clinical studies, text simplification of health documents for patients, early detection of adverse drug reactions or automatic identification of risk factors are only a few examples of the many possible opportunities that the text analysis can offer in the clinical domain. In this work, our efforts are primarily directed towards the improvement of the pharmacovigilance process by the automatic detection of drug-drug interactions (DDI) from texts. Moreover, we deal with the semantic analysis of texts containing health information for patients. Our two-stage approach is based on Deep Learning architectures. Concretely, NER is performed combining a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and a Conditional Random Field (CRF), while RE applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Since our approach uses very few language resources, only the pre-trained word embeddings, and does not exploit any domain resources (such as dictionaries or ontologies), this can be easily expandable to support other languages and clinical applications that require the exploitation of semantic information (concepts and relationships) from texts. During the last years, the task of DDI extraction has received great attention by the BioNLP community. However, the problem has been traditionally evaluated as two separate subtasks: drug name recognition and extraction of DDIs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides an evaluation of the whole pipeline.

This rapid growth has given access for certain parties to make it as a crime target through malware spreading. Various efforts are needed to be taken to minimize the number of Android users, which are victimized by these malware activities. The encountered problem is that there is increasing the ability of malware that causes difficulties in the malware detection process. In general, the usual solution taken to handle this issue is by doing the malware detection using a signature-based method. However, this method can be easily avoided by polymorphic-ability kind of malware. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a dynamic behavioral-based malware detection through observing the use of System Call. Considering the large number of malware that have to be detected and the system call that should be observed, the help of machine learning is needed for the classification process purpose, one of which is Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. This study shows that the observation towards system call with its classification using SVM yields 90% accuracy for polynomial kernel and 86% for the RBF kernel. This proves that the system call can be used to make polymorphic malware detection. In this research, however, the use of the system call is not able to distinctly distinguish between malware and nonmalware. This has something to do with the use of the same accustomed data with the experimental data. The classification result could reach a quite high level of accuracy because the experimental data used are the observation result from the same application with the accustomed data. This is considered a weakness since this method is unable to identify new applications in which its system call frequency has never been observed and trained with SVM.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CyberSec.2015.21", "venue": "2015 Fourth International Conference on Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare, and Digital Forensic (CyberSec)", "journal": "2015 Fourth International Conference on Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare, and Digital Forensic (CyberSec)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2439951656", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["222181", "4430630", "695305", "13019483", "115080828", "34027244", "18511461", "6544618", "39932452", "14242198", "9128783", "110539891", "18589431", "6534036", "63393799", "73664627", "4680791", "2216347"], "inbound_citations": ["174817565", "209457834", "67865821"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8407557"}

Feature selection is frequently used to deal with this problem. The goal of feature selection is to choose the most relevant and important attributes from the raw dataset. Another major challenge to building effective classification models from binary datasets is class imbalance, where the minority class has far fewer instances than the majority class. Data sampling (altering the dataset to change its balance level) and boosting (building multiple models, with each model tuned to work better on instances misclassified by previous models) are common techniques for resolving this problem. In particular, ensemble boosting, which integrates sampling with AdaBoost, has been shown to improve classification performance, especially for imbalanced training datasets. In this paper, we investigate approaches for combining feature selection with this ensemble learning (boosting) process. Six feature selection techniques and two forms of the ensemble learning method are examined. We focus on two different scenarios: feature selection performed prior to the ensemble learning process and feature selection performed inside the ensemble learning process. The experimental results demonstrate that performing feature selection inside of ensemble boosting generally performs better than using feature selection prior to ensemble boosting.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "FLAIRS Conference", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2293820727", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["940458", "1554582", "2391953", "1836349", "60577818", "207154860", "62678524", "33296374", "17691725", "206778457", "39515", "140109802", "15743653", "15180749"], "inbound_citations": ["204775403", "211298466", "210692800", "70175375", "7686622", "201045457", "44223903"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16360321"}

LncPred-IEL builds base predictors based on different groups of features, and employs a supervised iterative way to combine base predictors and build ensemble models. Our studies demonstrate that supervised iterative way can learn the representations that help to separate lncRNA and protein-coding transcripts, and further improve the performances.

This paper presents a novel extreme gradient boosting-based misfire fault diagnosis approach utilizing the high-accuracy time\u2013frequency information of vibration signals. First, diesel engine misfire tests were conducted under different spindle speeds, and the corresponding vibration signals were acquired via a triaxial accelerometer. The time-domain features of signals were extracted by using a time-domain statistics method, while the high-accuracy time\u2013frequency domain features were obtained via the high-resolution multisynchrosqueezing transform. Thereafter, considering the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the original characteristic data sets, the locally linear embedding method was employed for feature dimensionality reduction. Eventually, to avoid model overfitting, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm was utilized for diesel engine misfire fault diagnosis. Experiments under different spindle speeds and comprehensive comparisons with other evaluation methods were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed extreme gradient boosting-based misfire diagnosis method. The results verify that the highest classification accuracy of the proposed extreme gradient boosting-based algorithm is up to 99.93%.

To avoid the inversion of large matrix, the recursive algorithm of the parameters is given, which makes the online algorithm of LS-SVR practical. Since the computing time increases with the number of training samples, the sparseness is studied based on the projection of online LS-SVR. The residual of projection less than a threshold is omitted, so that a lot of samples are kept out of the training set and the sparseness is obtained. The standard LS-SVR, nonsparse online LS-SVR and sparse online LS-SVR with different threshold are used for modeling the isomerization of C 8 aromatics.

The Random Forest algorithm has proved its efficiency in mining applications. In this study we use it to estimate a key geochemical element, sodium, using a multivariate chemo-physical dataset measured on drill cores in the Matagami mining district of Quebec, Canada. Sodium is important to characterize hydrothermal alteration in volcanogenic massive sulfide settings, since Na depletion can be used to vector towards ore, but this element is not readily measured by portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF). We first test the algorithm on a database of over 8000 traditional laboratory geochemistry analyses and find a correlation of 0.95 between estimated and measured Na. We then test the algorithm on the multi-sensor core logging data, including density, magnetic susceptibility, and 15 geochemical elements by pXRF, but borrowing Na from traditional geochemistry (n = 260). This yields correlations of 0.66 to 0.75 depending on the training and testing sets. Finally the algorithm is applied to the whole multiparameter database (n = 9675) to estimate Na downcore. There is a good general correspondence with the downcore Na patterns seen through traditional geochemistry, and the estimated Na which has much greater spatial resolution. Random Forest appears to be a very good estimation tool when using large amounts of data and variables, as it uses all variables and automatically prioritizes the most useful.

Genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and environment. Multivariate methods, which analyse many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these data as they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods and five univariate and differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations, particularly redundancy analysis (RDA), showed a superior combination of low false-positive and high true-positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes and weak population structure tested here. The value of combining detections from different methods was variable and depended on the study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Re-analysis of genomic data from grey wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could be identified using RDA. Although additional testing is needed, this study indicates that RDA is an effective means of detecting adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29633402", "doi": "10.1111/mec.14584", "venue": "Molecular ecology", "journal": "Molecular ecology", "mag_id": "2797449804", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210812337", "181879041", "182730499", "215471120", "215458079", "213341014", "191139307", "215435792", "164719709", "67862683", "215368847", "51614499", "212431838", "212406901", "52055899", "202008520", "202026436", "212748341", "215377526", "51701346", "51706020", "108293699", "195066318", "201202689", "182223773", "215481560", "204149583", "208596881", "91378011", "196669905", "195804667", "191155050", "204029203", "208573404", "214039773", "215440557", "54469000", "195894407", "215080593", "102340498"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4759391"}

It can be used to diagnose pathological conditions of the eye, and for developing pre-operative surgical plans. In contrast to the posterior retina, imaging the anterior tissue structures, such as the limbus and cornea, results in B-scans that exhibit increased speckle noise patterns and imaging artifacts. These artifacts, such as shadowing and specularity, pose a challenge during the analysis of the acquired volumes as they substantially obfuscate the location of tissue interfaces. To deal with the artifacts and speckle noise patterns and accurately segment the shallowest tissue interface, we propose a cascaded neural network framework, which comprises of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and a Tissue Interface Segmentation Network (TISN). The cGAN pre-segments OCT B-scans by removing undesired specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns just above the shallowest tissue interface, and the TISN combines the original OCT image with the pre-segmentation to segment the shallowest interface. We show the applicability of the cascaded framework to corneal datasets, demonstrate that it precisely segments the shallowest corneal interface, and also show its generalization capacity to limbal datasets. We also propose a hybrid framework, wherein the cGAN pre-segmentation is passed to a traditional image analysis-based segmentation algorithm, and describe the improved segmentation performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to remove severe specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns (prior to the shallowest interface) that affects the interpretation of anterior segment OCT datasets, thereby resulting in the accurate segmentation of the shallowest tissue interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show the potential of incorporating a cGAN into larger deep learning frameworks for improved corneal and limbal OCT image segmentation.

Support vector machines belong to the group of semiparametric classifiers. The selection of appropriate parameters, formally known as model selection, is crucial to obtain accurate classification results for a given task. Striving to automate model selection for support vector machines we apply a meta-strategy utilizing genetic algorithms to learn combined kernels in a data-driven manner and to determine all free kernel parameters. The model selection criterion is incorporated into a fitness function guiding the evolutionary process of classifier construction. We consider two types of criteria consisting of empirical estimators or theoretical bounds for the generalization error. We evaluate their effectiveness in an empirical study on four well known benchmark data sets to find that both are applicable fitness measures for constructing accurate classifiers and conducting model selection. However, model selection focuses on finding one best classifier while genetic algorithms are based on the idea of re-combining and mutating a large number of good candidate classifiers to realize further improvements.

Furthermore, we devise a learning algorithm to train the DPDCM. Cloud computing is used to improve the training efficiency of the learning algorithm by crowdsourcing the data on cloud. To protect the private data, a privacy-preserving DPDCM (PPDPDCM) is proposed based on the BGV encryption scheme. Finally, experiments are carried on Animal-20 and NUS-WIDE-14 to estimate the performance of DPDCM and PPDPDCM by comparing with DCM.

Simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides a significant improvement in localization performance by using high level extracted features by autoencoder and increasing the number of training data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/LSENS.2017.2787651", "venue": "IEEE Sensors Letters", "journal": "IEEE Sensors Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2776252545", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["4438360", "12388708", "43340213", "40677704", "28130396", "6995317", "6816078", "1970913", "11549422", "34067748", "2098713", "206757279", "207102170", "16616938", "15947919", "36864073", "52837019", "23110607", "3661452", "14208692", "15589402", "23350737"], "inbound_citations": ["202766617", "211208084", "204973611", "207957061", "201142322", "189987229", "209778068", "171096602", "195775692", "59621081", "174820077", "58675083", "203993657", "59600511", "208880241", "202406460", "54118067", "201067632", "189824650", "208882255", "73508564", "109932311", "189800937", "54442098", "85501981", "211677827", "211242833", "208649251", "54443177", "212618166"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13154503"}

In this paper, we present a novel approach for robust and selective STIP detection, by applying surround suppression combined with local and temporal constraints. This new method is significantly different from existing STIP detection techniques and improves the performance by detecting more repeatable, stable and distinctive STIPs for human actors, while suppressing unwanted background STIPs. For action representation we use a bag-of-video words (BoV) model of local N-jet features to build a vocabulary of visual-words. To this end, we introduce a novel vocabulary building strategy by combining spatial pyramid and vocabulary compression techniques, resulting in improved performance and efficiency. Action class specific Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are trained for categorization of human actions. A comprehensive set of experiments on popular benchmark datasets (KTH and Weizmann), more challenging datasets of complex scenes with background clutter and camera motion (CVC and CMU), movie and YouTube video clips (Hollywood 2 and YouTube), and complex scenes with multiple actors (MSR I and Multi-KTH), validates our approach and show state-of-the-art performance. Due to the unavailability of ground truth action annotation data for the Multi-KTH dataset, we introduce an actor specific spatio-temporal clustering of STIPs to address the problem of automatic action annotation of multiple simultaneous actors. Additionally, we perform cross-data action recognition by training on source datasets (KTH and Weizmann) and testing on completely different and more challenging target datasets (CVC, CMU, MSR I and Multi-KTH).

With the vast amount of studies that investigated this premise, the modeling approaches differ from each study and only use a single statistical technique. It raises the question of whether which technique would be robust and reliable. Hence, our study aims to compare the predictive accuracy of the temporal pattern of Dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila as influenced by meteorological factors from four modeling techniques, (a) General Additive Modeling, (b) Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous variables (c) Random Forest and (d) Gradient Boosting. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Dengue incidence and meteorological data (flood, precipitation, temperature, southern oscillation index, relative humidity, wind speed and direction) of Metropolitan Manila from January 1, 2009 - December 31, 2013 were obtained from respective government agencies. Two types of datasets were used in the analysis; observed meteorological factors (MF) and its corresponding delayed or lagged effect (LG). After which, these datasets were subjected to the four modeling techniques. The predictive accuracy and variable importance of each modeling technique were calculated and evaluated. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Among the statistical modeling techniques, Random Forest showed the best predictive accuracy. Moreover, the delayed or lag effects of the meteorological variables was shown to be the best dataset to use for such purpose. Thus, the model of Random Forest with delayed meteorological effects (RF-LG) was deemed the best among all assessed models. Relative humidity was shown to be the top-most important meteorological factor in the best model. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The study exhibited that there are indeed different predictive outcomes generated from each statistical modeling technique and it further revealed that the Random forest model with delayed meteorological effects to be the best in predicting the temporal pattern of Dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila. It is also noteworthy that the study also identified relative humidity as an important meteorological factor along with rainfall and temperature that can influence this temporal pattern.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5905126", "pubmed_id": "29665781", "doi": "10.1186/s12879-018-3066-0", "venue": "BMC Infectious Diseases", "journal": "BMC Infectious Diseases", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2801974413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3256459", "16352932", "19873595", "1283813", "17890324", "150524898", "5547398", "24358200", "34991770", "26537556", "28237011", "35240493", "17289171", "206484311", "16268209", "215157909", "6237798", "5519303", "2732263", "214904117", "40311262", "36096928", "10498868", "10845531", "16919478", "9417065", "14543768", "14772479", "18917546", "18937909", "29296560", "78416845", "205233560", "14982444", "131178532", "121668340", "25753356", "4362862", "41919870", "52083889", "49530389", "7955044", "54695460", "8905702", "14128173", "129071685", "65401481", "89141", "14215320", "21559847", "154502530", "20686096", "31197281", "17387164", "18632613", "24158528", "29349712", "33897960", "12386250", "39667036", "1928183", "16098589", "3137589", "130661845", "1017942"], "inbound_citations": ["53305840", "203650057", "209424831", "215473259", "198985705", "214692651", "198194885", "201142598", "207824403", "174800204", "58652349"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4950935"}

It is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) like algorithm, which explicitly considers the locality correlation within each class in the margin and the penalty term of the optimization function. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used to reveal the hidden correlations between two datasets, and a variant of correlation analysis model which implements locality preserving has been proposed by integrating local information into the objective function of CCA. Inspired by the idea used in canonical correlation analysis, we propose a locality correlation preserving within-class scatter matrix to replace the within-class scatter matrix in minimum class variance support machine (MCVSVM). This substitution has the property of keeping the locality correlation of data, and inherits the properties of SVM and other similar modified class of support vector machines. LCPSVM is discussed under linearly separable, small sample size and nonlinearly separable conditions, and experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2014.04.004", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "mag_id": "2089549033", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["39890910", "5026281", "46792196", "88492983", "51721473", "56480718", "198190524", "55806503", "53223081", "46955292", "69802249", "9352153", "91189259", "70290628", "9695088", "202729188", "22606802", "46759423", "3774371", "207667345", "51603249", "51706249", "197665062", "195847777"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27131964"}

Our solution mainly focuses on two aspects: (1) we propose a new graph construction technique by fusing local and global structural similarity (FLGSS).

To alleviate this problem, we propose RAN, a representation-based network alignment model that couples both structure and node attribute information.

Models based on machine learning and natural language processing provide a way to detect this hate speech in web text in order to make discussion forums and other media and platforms safer. The main difficulty, however, is annotating a sufficiently large number of examples to train these models. In this paper, we report on developing automated text analytics methods, capable of jointly learning a single representation of hate from several smaller, unrelated data sets. We train and test our methods on the total of $37,520$ English tweets that have been annotated for differentiating harmless messages from racist or sexists contexts in the first detection task, and hateful or offensive contents in the second detection task. Our most sophisticated method combines a deep neural network architecture with transfer learning. It is capable of creating word and sentence embeddings that are specific to these tasks while also embedding the meaning of generic hate speech. Its prediction correctness is the macro-averaged F1 of $78\\%$ and $72\\%$ in the first and second task, respectively. This method enables generating an interpretable two-dimensional text visualization --- called the Map of Hate --- that is capable of separating different types of hate speech and explaining what makes text harmful.

These peptide stretches are often found in unstructured regions of proteins, and contain a consensus motif complementary to the interaction surface displayed by their binding partners. While most current methods for the de novo discovery of such motifs exploit their tendency to occur in disordered regions, our work here focuses on another observation: upon binding to their partner domain, motifs adopt a well-defined structure. Indeed, through the analysis of all peptide-mediated interactions of known high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structure, we found that the structure of the peptide may be as characteristic as the consensus motif, and help identify target peptides even though they do not match the established patterns. Our analyses of the structural features of known motifs reveal that they tend to have a particular stretched and elongated structure, unlike most other peptides of the same length. Accordingly, we have implemented a strategy based on a Support Vector Machine that uses this features, along with other structure-encoded information about binding interfaces, to search the set of protein interactions of known 3D structure and to identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions among them. We have also derived consensus patterns for these interactions, whenever enough information was available, and compared our results with established linear motif patterns and their binding domains. Finally, to cross-validate our identification strategy, we scanned interactome networks from four model organisms with our newly derived patterns to see if any of them occurred more often than expected.

These 3D views are then processed by a Convolutional Neural Network to produce a probability distribution function (pdf) over the set of the semantic classes for each vertex. These pdfs are then re-projected on the original 3D shape and postprocessed using contextual information through Conditional Random Fields.

One prominent tradition argues that to explain the systematicity of thought we must posit syntactically structured representations inside the cognitive system which can be operated upon by structure sensitive rules similar to those employed in systems of natural deduction. I have argued elsewhere that the systematicity of human thought might better be explained as resulting from the fact that we have learned natural languages which are themselves syntactically structured. According to this view, symbols of natural language are external to the cognitive processing system and what the cognitive system must learn to do is produce and comprehend such symbols. In this paper I pursue that idea by arguing that ability in natural deduction itself may rely on pattern recognition abilities that enable us to operate on external symbols rather than encodings of rules that might be applied to internal representations. To support this suggestion, I present a series of experiments with connectionist networks that have been trained to construct simple natural deductions in sentential logic.

According to the cross-correlation function, there is a significant peak between the measured signals, which are decomposed into a number of PFs.

Different indices were used to characterize ionospheric diurnal and seasonal variations and their dependence on solar and geomagnetic activity. These indices, together with the current observed foF2 value, were input into the prediction model and the foF2 value at one hour ahead was output. We analyzed twenty-two years\u2019 foF2 data from nine ionosonde stations in the East-Asian sector in this work. The first eleven years\u2019 data were used as a training dataset and the second eleven years\u2019 data were used as a testing dataset. The results show that the performance of AdaBoost-BP is better than those of BP Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the IRI model. For example, the AdaBoost-BP prediction absolute error of foF2 at Irkutsk station (a middle latitude station) is 0.32 MHz, which is better than 0.34 MHz from BPNN, 0.35 MHz from SVR and also significantly outperforms the IRI model whose absolute error is 0.64 MHz. Meanwhile, AdaBoost-BP prediction absolute error at Taipei station from the low latitude is 0.78 MHz, which is better than 0.81 MHz from BPNN, 0.81 MHz from SVR and 1.37 MHz from the IRI model.

The algorithm is based on the traditional latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model and assumes a linear relationship between user tags and potential topics. Therefore, a relational matrix is introduced in the LDA model to describe the corresponding relationship between the tag and the topic, so that the probability distribution of the tag on the word can be inferred from the probability distribution of the topic on the word. The algorithm first learns the probability distribution table of label words by Gibbs sampling method, then infers the probability distribution of new documents on labels according to the model parameters, so as to realize the purpose of predicting the corresponding multiple labels of documents. In order to improve the ability of the algorithm to deal with massive data, the parallel algorithm has been improved. Since the bottleneck of the algorithm lies mainly in the serial nature of global variable updating and communication, the core idea of our parallelization is that in massive text training, global delay updating and asynchronous communication will not affect the final training results. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has greatly improved the training efficiency. The classification accuracy is higher than that of Naive Bayesian algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm proposed in other literatures. The average classification accuracy can achieve at about 95%, and it can be used as a general parallel framework of supervised LDA algorithm.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-019-08253-1", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2994011446", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["44336963", "49344236", "108831648", "63156868", "57697336", "3719648", "52976382", "23874049", "44118951", "35088747", "65024828", "125711498", "158840431", "1562837", "4352209", "30880819", "10540776", "69452094", "25371456", "25806340"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208744086"}

To reduce the effect of sample heterogeneity, we clustered data samples using K-means algorithm and applied modified PageRank to functional interaction (FI) networks weighted using gene expression values of samples in each cluster. Hub genes among resulting prioritized genes were selected as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of samples. This process outperformed traditional feature selection methods as well as several network-based prognostic gene selection methods when applied to Random Forest. We were able to find many cluster-specific prognostic genes for each dataset. Functional study showed that distinct biological processes were enriched in each cluster, which seems to reflect different aspect of tumor progression or oncogenesis among distinct patient groups.

To verify the feasibility of the gray-box modeling method, we conducted both simulation experiments and real dataset symmetry experiments.

Rebalancing class distributions (such as over-sampling or under-sampling of learning datasets) has been popular due to its ease of implementation and relatively good performance. For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm, research efforts have focused on reducing the size of learning sets because of the algorithm's sensitivity to the size of the dataset. In this dissertation, we propose a metaheuristic approach (Genetic Algorithm) for under-sampling of an imbalanced dataset in the context of a SVM classifier. The goal of this approach is to find an optimal learning set from imbalanced datasets without empirical studies that are normally required to find an optimal class distribution. Experimental results using real datasets indicate that this metaheuristic under-sampling performed well in rebalancing class distributions. Furthermore, an iterative sampling methodology was used to produce smaller learning sets by removing redundant instances. It incorporates informative and the representative under-sampling mechanisms to speed up the learning procedure for imbalanced data learning with a SVM. When compared with existing rebalancing methods and the metaheuristic approach to under-sampling, this iterative methodology not only provides good performance but also enables a SVM classifier to learn using very small learning sets for imbalanced data learning.

The proposes approach in this paper uses color features and bag of visual word for classifying oil palm fruit ripeness stages. Experiments conducted in this paper consisted of smartphone camera for image acquisition, python and matlab software for image pre processing and Support Vector Machine for classification. A total of 400 images is taken in a few plant in north Malaysia. Experiments involved on a dataset of 360 images for training for four classes and 40 images for testing. The average accuracy for the 4 classes of the FFB by color features is 57% while the accuracy for ripeness classification by using bag of visual word is 70%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.11113/elektrika.v18n3.192", "venue": "ELEKTRIKA- Journal of Electrical Engineering", "journal": "ELEKTRIKA- Journal of Electrical Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2994690931", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["111631461", "97837084", "55861669", "109956450", "221112", "195817779", "10106358", "171087530", "109401907", "18052069", "41568496", "41568496"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210124270"}

Increasingly, electronic phenotyping is performed via supervised learning. We investigate the effectiveness of multitask learning for phenotyping using electronic health records (EHR) data. Multitask learning aims to improve model performance on a target task by jointly learning additional auxiliary tasks and has been used in disparate areas of machine learning. However, its utility when applied to EHR data has not been established, and prior work suggests that its benefits are inconsistent. We present experiments that elucidate when multitask learning with neural nets improves performance for phenotyping using EHR data relative to neural nets trained for a single phenotype and to well-tuned logistic regression baselines. We find that multitask neural nets consistently outperform single-task neural nets for rare phenotypes but underperform for relatively more common phenotypes. The effect size increases as more auxiliary tasks are added. Moreover, multitask learning reduces the sensitivity of neural nets to hyperparameter settings for rare phenotypes. Last, we quantify phenotype complexity and find that neural nets trained with or without multitask learning do not improve on simple baselines unless the phenotypes are sufficiently complex.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1808.03331", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6662921", "pubmed_id": "30864307", "doi": "10.1142/9789813279827_0003", "venue": "Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

Meanwhile, a set of manufactured data for a specific lithography configuration is only valid for the training of one single model, indicating low data efficiency. Due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, obtaining enough data for acceptable accuracy becomes very expensive in terms of both time and cost, especially during the evolution of technology generations when the design space is intensively explored. In this work, we propose a new resist modeling framework for contact layers that utilizes existing data from old technology nodes to reduce the amount of data required from a target lithography configuration. Our framework based on residual neural networks and transfer learning techniques is effective within a competitive range of accuracy, i.e., 2-10X reduction on the amount of training data with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art learning approach.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3177540.3178242", "venue": "ISPD '18", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2792824541", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["58027971", "58027678", "88492212", "202699518", "150123656", "58027801", "49650875", "195657816", "53426516"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:174793748"}

This has several advantages over other approaches, such as reducing costs by avoiding the need for experts to be present in the area of interest. A current problem with performing analyses of environmental recordings is interference from noise that can mask vocalisations of interest. This makes detecting these vocalisations more difficult and can require additional resources. While some work has been done to remove stationary noise from environmental recordings, there has been little effort to remove noise from non-stationary sources, such as rain, wind, engines, and animal vocalisations that are not of interest. This work addresses the challenge of filtering noise from rain and cicada choruses from recordings containing bird sound. The use of acoustic indices and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) with machine learning classifiers is investigated to find the most effective filters. Hyperparameters for several classification approaches are investigated to fine tune models to achieve the best results. The approach used enables users to set thresholds to increase or decrease the sensitivity of classification, based on the prediction probability outputted by classifiers. A novel approach to remove cicada choruses using bandpass filters is also proposed. A threshold-based approach (Multi-Layer Perceptron with Acoustic Indices and MFCCs) for rain detection is derived which achieves an AUC of 0.9911 and is more accurate than existing approaches when set to the same sensitivities. Cicada choruses are classified in the training set used with 100% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with MFCCs. The cicada filtering approach greatly increased the median signal to noise ratios of affected recordings from 0.53 for unfiltered audio to 1.86 to audio filtered by both the cicada filter and a common stationary noise filter.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1804.05502", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2019.105501", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963380161,2953065156,2797160267", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["90221107", "27766922", "2828886", "9052322", "6275630", "12541177", "15293547", "17975361", "18027698", "89991303", "159323", "3835905", "28366792", "206601864", "10467693", "84405498", "18213351", "107719584", "11669489", "5262555", "13900622", "667586", "44971656", "6492502", "1536643", "89141", "13861754", "7794824", "694371", "59776165", "44519346", "3451192", "2320019"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4896425"}

Among the three runs of results we submitted, the one using the ensemble classifier Random Feature Subspace (HITSZ_Run1) gained the best performance, with an optimal F1 of 0.6648 for the detection level and 0.2675 for the identification level.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "W15-4415", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18653/v1/W15-4415", "venue": "NLP-TEA@ACL/IJCNLP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2252093957", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19005325", "196102811", "15991124", "13861754", "64299202", "660745", "17613201", "4666234"], "inbound_citations": ["21057530", "39984436", "10726920", "49907944", "21696747", "17690968", "8129545", "4649502", "195799966", "49656687", "11762088", "3936688", "4649208", "73638483", "2058661"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3769580"}

Due to iron deposition during aging, image contrast in the brainstem is very low in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. Hence, the ambiguity of patch-wise similarity makes the recently successful multi-atlas patch-based label fusion methods have difficulty to perform as competitive as segmenting cortical and sub-cortical regions from MR images. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-atlas brainstem nuclei segmentation method using deep hyper-graph learning. Specifically, we achieve this goal in three-fold. First, we employ hyper-graph to combine the advantage of maintaining spatial coherence from graph-based segmentation approaches and the benefit of harnessing population priors from multi-atlas based framework. Second, besides using low-level image appearance, we also extract high-level context features to measure the complex patch-wise relationship. Since the context features are calculated on a tentatively estimated label probability map, we eventually turn our hyper-graph learning based label propagation into a deep and self-refining model. Third, since anatomical labels on some voxels (usually located in uniform regions) can be identified much more reliably than other voxels (usually located at the boundary between two regions), we allow these reliable voxels to propagate their labels to the nearby difficult-to-label voxels. Such hierarchical strategy makes our proposed label fusion method deep and dynamic. We evaluate our proposed label fusion method in segmenting substantia nigra (SN) and red nucleus (RN) from 3.0 T MR images, where our proposed method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art label fusion methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5868975", "pubmed_id": "29594262", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-47118-1_7", "venue": "Patch-based techniques in medical imaging : Second International Workshop, Patch-MI 2016, held in conjunction with MICCAI 2016, Athens, Greece, October 17, 2016 : proceedings.

In this report, support vector machines (SVM) are used for the prediction of O-glycosylation for each Ser or Thr site in the protein sequences. 99 mammalian protein sequences are selected from UniProt8.0. A certain length of a protein subsequence with Ser or Thr site at the center is used as input data to SVM, after the encoding in three ways. That is, sparse encoding, 5-letter encoding, and multiple encoding which uses both sparse and 5-letter encodings. The results of prediction experiments show that multiple encoding is most effective. The effective prediction requires the detailed information on amino acid residues in the nearest neighbors of the prediction target site, and the relatively rough information of biochemical characteristics on amino acid residues within approximately the 15th nearest neighbors of the target site.

Recently, increasing efforts on transfer learning have employed deep neural networks (DNN) to learn more robust and higher level feature representations to better tackle cross-media disparities. However, only a few articles consider the correction and semantic matching between multi-layer heterogeneous domain networks. In this article, we propose a deep semantic mapping model for heterogeneous multimedia transfer learning (DHTL) using co-occurrence data. More specifically, we integrate the DNN with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to derive a deep correlation subspace as the joint semantic representation for associating data across different domains. In the proposed DHTL, a multi-layer correlation matching network across domains is constructed, in which the CCA is combined to bridge each pair of domain-specific hidden layers. To train the network, a joint objective function is defined and the optimization processes are presented. When the deep semantic representation is achieved, the shared features of the source domain are transferred for task learning in the target domain. Extensive experiments for three multimedia recognition applications demonstrate that the proposed DHTL can effectively find deep semantic representations for heterogeneous domains, and it is superior to the several existing state-of-the-art methods for deep transfer learning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3241055", "venue": "TOMM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2913283038", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2495132", "10686834", "17311373", "2680388", "4908577", "207108571", "18235792", "202473", "10172006", "16092984", "7419723", "4553188", "407822", "352650", "14256825", "59566327", "740063", "9253851", "6692382", "114125", "207223936", "8454173", "14386978", "4357800", "15654728", "5838380", "16197334", "993917", "13828880", "7038503", "14293105", "14814410", "3412895", "19166727", "15921357", "15260040", "196536", "15019934"], "inbound_citations": ["211054165", "85549711", "212410685", "210699975", "211054108", "215466788"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59337374"}

Supervised classifications of a SPOT scene by Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm were employed. GDVI3 showed the widest dynamic range in all land use types, while GDVI2 also exhibited evidently wider dynamic ranges for arid to semi-arid Al-Qara than NDVI, MSAVI and SAVI. GDVI3 reported the highest accuracies in delineating natural vegetation (dense \u2013 74.80 %, medium-dense- 43.19 %), except for low-dense vegetation (40.51 %). It also performs the best in delineating bare soil and dry grass with over 80 % and 60 % accuracies. The attenuated reflectance created by the shadows results in VI signals in the range of dry grass to bare soil, enabling us to neglect the shadow effect on natural vegetation delineation due to below 9.50 % omissions from the shadows class. GDVI3 also limits shadow delineation better than the other indices, which will enable us to analyze spectral information recovery by the VI with the help of ground truth information under the shadows. For applications such as land degradation assessments, GDVI3 has better prospects over the other indices explored. Saturation at high-vigor vegetation is an issue in GDVI3, GDVI2 and NDVI. Our study also points to a dependency of a VI\u2019s capability to weaken shadows on the number of training data pixels to be utilized in a supervised classification.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26093893", "doi": "10.1007/s10661-015-4662-8", "venue": "Environmental Monitoring and Assessment", "journal": "Environmental Monitoring and Assessment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1873099593", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["85316002", "140551761", "129830460", "13334402", "42013423", "128503378", "29434787", "32216977", "5673226", "9719990"], "inbound_citations": ["36869298"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22149867"}

This problem can be handled by Feature Subset Selection (FSS) methods and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The FSS methods can manage the redundancy by removing redundant spectral bands. Moreover, kernel based methods, especially SVM have a high ability to classify limited-sample data sets. This paper mainly aims to assess the capability of a FSS method and the SVM in curse of dimensional circumstances and to compare results with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), when they are used to classify alteration zones of the Hyperion hyperspectral image acquired from the greatest Iranian porphyry copper complex. The results demonstrated that by decreasing training samples, the accuracy of SVM was just decreased 1.8% while the accuracy of ANN was highly reduced i.e. 14.01%. In addition, a hybrid FSS was applied to reduce the dimension of Hyperion. Accordingly, among the 165 useable spectral bands of Hyperion, 18 bands were only selected as the most important and informative bands. Although this dimensionality reduction could not intensively improve the performance of SVM, ANN revealed a significant improvement in the computational time and a slightly enhancement in the average accuracy. Therefore, SVM as a low-sensitive method respect to the size of training data set and feature space can be applied to classify the curse of dimensional problems. Also, the FSS methods can improve the performance of non-kernel based classifiers by eliminating redundant features.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ejrs.2017.02.003", "venue": null, "journal": "The Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science", "mag_id": "2593397548", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195795515", "44142281", "204939803", "210183901"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126350438"}
