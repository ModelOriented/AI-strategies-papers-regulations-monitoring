However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with an image appearance model, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm, auto-context. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps created by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates until convergence. Auto-context integrates low-level and context information by fusing a large number of low-level appearance features with context and implicit shape information. The resulting discriminative algorithm is general and easy to implement. Under nearly the same parameter settings in training, we apply the algorithm to three challenging vision applications: foreground/background segregation, human body configuration estimation, and scene region labeling. Moreover, context also plays a very important role in medical/brain images where the anatomical structures are mostly constrained to relatively fixed positions. With only some slight changes resulting from using 3D instead of 2D features, the auto-context algorithm applied to brain MRI image segmentation is shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for this domain. Furthermore, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond image analysis and it has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems for structured prediction problems.", "year": 2010,

Taatgen (niels@ai.rug.nl) Artificial Intelligence, University of Groningen Grote Kruisstraat 2/1, 9712 TS Groningen, the Netherlands Abstract One of the phenomena that has been studied extensively in cognitive science is learning the English past tense. Many models have been made of the characteristic U-shape in per- formance on irregular verbs during development. An important test case for such models is whether they can be extended to other examples of inflection. A case that is often quoted as par- ticularly tough is the German plural. In the present study, an ACT-R model of the past tense is applied to the German plural. The model not only successfully learns the default rule, but also exhibits some other characteristics of the German plural. Introduction Learning the English past tense has been one of the central topics of debate in cognitive science since McClelland and Rumelhart published their original neural network model in 1986. The phenomenon is very simple. English verbs can be broken down into two categories: regular and irregular verbs. The past tense of a regular verb can be obtained by simply adding -ed to the stem. Irregular verbs on the other hand are unsystematic: each verb has a unique inflection. When chil- dren have to learn the inflection of the past tense, they go through three stages. In the first stage their use of the past tense is infrequent, but when they use the past tense they do so correctly. In the second stage they use the past tense more often, but they start overregularizing the irregular verbs. So instead of saying broke, they now say *breaked. On the other hand, inflection of regular verbs increases dramatically, indi- cating that the child has somehow learned the general regular pattern. In the third stage, they inflect irregular verbs cor- rectly again. This pattern of learning is often referred to as U-shaped learning. Although learning the past tense seems to be a rather sim- ple problem, it nevertheless encompasses a number of issues in language acquisition and learning in general. Apparently the past tense has two aspects: on the one hand there is a gen- eral rule, and on the other hand there is set of exceptions. Children are able to learn both aspects, and the phenomenon of U-shaped learning seems to implicate that children learn the general rule in stage 2. The important point McClelland and Rumelhart make is that this does not necessarily imply that this knowledge is actually represented as a rule in the cognitive system: their neural network model has no separate store for rules, but it nevertheless exhibits rule-like behavior in the form of U-shaped learning. Ever since their original model, the neural network approach has been challenged (e.g., Pinker & Prince, 1988), improved (e.g., Plunkett & Marchman, 1991), challenged again (e.g., Marcus, 1995) and improved again (e.g., Plunkett & Juola, 1999). I would like to highlight two unresolved issues in this debate, because they will be addressed here. The first issue is feedback. A well-known fact in language acquisition is that children do not rely on feedback on their own production of language (at least with respect to syntax), simply because they do not receive any (Pinker, 1984). Although this problem is addressed by some modelers (e.g., Plunkett & Juola, 1999), its resolution is not entirely satisfactory: the assumption is that learning takes place while children perceive past tenses, and not while they actually produce past tenses. This idea is at odds with the picture of skill acquisition in general, where practice is considered as a main means of learning. A second issue is the frequency of the regular cases. In English, most verbs are regular. This fact is essential for neural network models, as they need to be presented with regular cases at least 50% of the time (Marcus, 1995). This is already slightly problematic in English, as the token-frequency of regular verbs, how often a verb is actually used in language, is only around 30% (irregular verbs are just used much more often than regulars). Connectionist modelers have therefore intro- duced the input/uptake distinction: not every word that is perceived is presented to the network. This assumption becomes especially problematic if regular forms are much more rare. An example of inflection where the regular form is very rare is the German plural. The German Plural German has five different suffixes to mark plurality of a noun: zero (no suffix), -(e)n, -e, -er and -s. Moreover, the stem-vowel sometimes receives an Umlaut (\u00a8), something we will ignore for the present. The plural is almost always indi- cated by suffixation: there are only a few exceptions, mainly words derived from Latin (e.g., Thema-Themen). Careful analysis of these suffixes has revealed that the -s suffix is actually the default rule (Marcus, Brinkmann, Clahsen, Wiese & Pinker, 1995). Interestingly enough, this suffix is also the least frequent of all five, both in type-frequency (how many words are there) and token-frequency (how often are they used). Marcus et al. estimate the type frequency of nouns ending in -s at 4%, and the token frequency at only 2%. It appears however that at least some of the other suf-", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In: Proceedings of the", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "39312808,2765313604", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["142733964", "38287428", "62166684", "210157400", "23789004", "1327840"], "inbound_citations": ["1734598", "21619838", "828026", "14352715", "9017502", "12356424", "7843608"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12081367"}

Typically, this has come to mean the identification of quantitative models expressed as differential equations. Quantitative modelling works best when the structure of the model (i.e., the form of the equations) is known; and the primary concern is one of estimating the values of the parameters in the model. For complex biological systems, the model-structure is rarely known and the modeler has to deal with both model-identification and parameter-estimation. In this paper we are concerned with providing automated assistance to the first of these problems. Specifically, we examine the identification by machine of the structural relationships between experimentally observed variables. These relationship will be expressed in the form of qualitative abstractions of a quantitative model. Such qualitative models may not only provide clues to the precise quantitative model, but also assist in understanding the essence of that model. Our position in this paper is that background knowledge incorporating system modelling principles can be used to constrain effectively the set of good qualitative models. Utilising the model-identification framework provided by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) we present empirical support for this position using a series of increasingly complex artificial datasets. The results are obtained with qualitative and quantitative data subject to varying amounts of noise and different degrees of sparsity. The results also point to the presence of a set of qualitative states, which we term kernel subsets, that may be necessary for a qualitative model-learner to learn correct models.

It is well known that these algorithms when executed on a classical computer do not scale well with the size of the feature space both in terms of data points and dimensionality. One of the most significant limitations of classical algorithms using non-linear kernels is that the kernel function has to be evaluated for all pairs of input feature vectors which themselves may be of substantially high dimension. This can lead to computationally excessive times during training and during the prediction process for a new data point. Here, we propose using both canonical and generalized coherent states to rapidly calculate specific nonlinear kernel functions. The key link will be the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) property for SVMs that naturally arise from canonical and generalized coherent states. Specifically, we discuss the fast evaluation of radial kernels through a positive operator valued measure (POVM) on a quantum optical system based on canonical coherent states.

This adaptive technique represents the integration of the Fuzzy Logic and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms in the field of fault diagnosis. Using this adaptive technique health monitoring of aircraft fuel system is discussed. In an aircraft fuel tank, the fault is effectively located by assessing and contrasting the actual parameters and set point parameters related to the system for various time-frames.

It relies on the aircraft fuel system parameters like the fuel flow rate, level of fuel in the tank, fuel temperature, and fuel pressure. From the logical rules, the control signals related to the aircraft fuel system are derived by the SVM technique.

The developed method is the first in the literature to apply the quadtree for the SVM parameters optimization. The SVM is a machine-learning technique for pattern recognition whose performance relies on its parameters determination. Thus, the model selection problem for SVM is an important field of study and requires expert and intelligent systems to solve it. Real classification data sets involve a huge number of instances and features, and the greater is the training data set dimension, the larger is the cost of a recognition system. The grid search (GS) is the most popular and the simplest method to select parameters for SVM. However, it is time-consuming, which limits its application for big-sized problems. With this in mind, the main idea of this research is to apply the quadtree technique to the GS to make it faster. Hence, this may lower computational time cost for solving problems such as bio-identification, bank credit risk and cancer detection. Based on the asymptotic behaviors of the SVM, it was noticeably observed that the quadtree is able to avoid the GS full search space evaluation. As a consequence, the GQ carries out fewer parameters analysis, solving the same problem with much more efficiency. To assess the GQ performance, ten classification benchmark data set were used. The obtained results were compared with the ones of the traditional GS. The outcomes showed that the GQ is able to find parameters that are as good as the GS ones, executing 78.8124% to 85.8415% fewer operations. This research points out that the adoption of quadtree expressively reduces the computational time of the original GS, making it much more efficient to deal with high dimensional and large data sets.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113172", "venue": "Expert Syst.

This competition is based on pre-processed sets of T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) to be classified in four categories: stable AD, individuals with MCI who converted to AD, individuals with MCI who did not convert to AD and healthy controls. New method In this work, we propose a method to perform early diagnosis of AD, which is evaluated on MLNeCh dataset. Since the automatic classification of AD is based on the use of feature vectors of high dimensionality, different techniques of feature selection/reduction are compared in order to avoid the curse-of-dimensionality problem, then the classification method is obtained as the combination of Support Vector Machines trained using different clusters of data extracted from the whole training set.

In particular, Hadley has proposed that a network exhibits strong semantic systematicity when, as a result of training, it can assign appropriate meaning representations to novel sentences (both simple and embedded) which contain words in syntactic positions they did not occupy during training. The experience of researchers indicates that strong systematicity in any form is difficult to achieve in connectionist systems.Herein we describe a network which displays strong semantic systematicity in response to Hebbian, connectionist training. During training, two-thirds of all nouns are presented only in a single syntactic position (either as grammatical subject or object). Yet, during testing, the network correctly interprets thousands of sentences containing those nouns in novel positions. In addition, the network generalizes to novel levels of embedding. Successful training requires a, corpus of about 1000 sentences, and network training is quite rapid.

We investigated several hemodynamic parameters measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography and evaluated which parameter has the most pronounced effect on maximal exercise capacity determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). 132 patients with ToF-like hemodynamics were tested during routine follow-up with CMR, echocardiography and CPET.

An approach called the local SVR approach was proposed in the literature to cope with this problem. Although the local SVR approach can indeed model local behavior of models better than the global SVR approach does, the local SVR approach still has the problem of boundary effects, which may generate a large bias at the boundary and also need more time to calculate. In this paper, the fuzzy weighted SVR with a fuzzy partition is proposed. Because the concept of locally weighted regression is not used in the proposed approach, the boundary effects will not appear. The proposed method first employs the fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm to split training data into several training subsets.

Firstly, the extrema symmetry expansion EEMD, which can effectively restrain the mode mixing and end effects, is used to decompose the energy price into simple modes. Secondly, by using the fine\u2010to\u2010coarse reconstruction algorithm, the high\u2010frequency, low\u2010frequency and trend components are identified. Furthermore, autoregressive integrated moving average is applicable to predicting the high\u2010frequency components. LSSVM is suitable for forecasting the low\u2010frequency and trend components. At the same time, a universal kernel function prototype is introduced for making up the drawbacks of single kernel function, which can adaptively select the optimal kernel function type and model parameters according to the specific data using the PSO algorithm. Finally, the prediction results of all the components are aggregated into the forecasting values of energy price time series. The empirical results show that, compared with the popular prediction methods, the proposed method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of energy prices, with high accuracy both in the level and directional predictions.

However, insufficient work has been done in incorporating prior structural knowledge onto the learning of underlying graphical models from data. Learning a graph with a specific structure is essential for interpretability and identification of the relationships among data. Useful structured graphs include the multi-component graph, bipartite graph, connected graph, sparse graph, and regular graph. In general, structured graph learning is an NP-hard combinatorial problem, therefore, designing a general tractable optimization method is extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce a unified graph learning framework lying at the integration of Gaussian graphical models and spectral graph theory. To impose a particular structure on a graph, we first show how to formulate the combinatorial constraints as an analytical property of the graph matrix. Then we develop an optimization framework that leverages graph learning with specific structures via spectral constraints on graph matrices. The proposed algorithms are provably convergent, computationally efficient, and practically amenable for numerous graph-based tasks. Extensive numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The code for all the simulations is made available as an open source repository.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.09792", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "3008016835,2937507957", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195584409", "214761106", "174802427", "212646531", "202750032"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127950724"}

Association studies look for both direct and indirect associations with disease loci. In a Random Forest (RF) analysis, correlation between a true risk SNP and SNPs in LD may lead to diminished variable importance for the true risk SNP. One approach to address this problem is to select SNPs in linkage equilibrium (LE) for analysis. Here, we explore alternative methods for dealing with SNPs in LD: change the tree-building algorithm by building each tree in an RF only with SNPs in LE, modify the importance measure (IM), and use haplotypes instead of SNPs to build a RF.ResultsWe evaluated the performance of our alternative methods by simulation of a spectrum of complex genetics models. When a haplotype rather than an individual SNP is the risk factor, we find that the original Random Forest method performed on SNPs provides good performance. When individual, genotyped SNPs are the risk factors, we find that the stronger the genetic effect, the stronger the effect LD has on the performance of the original RF. A revised importance measure used with the original RF is relatively robust to LD among SNPs; this revised importance measure used with the revised RF is sometimes inflated. Overall, we find that the revised importance measure used with the original RF is the best choice when the genetic model and the number of SNPs in LD with risk SNPs are unknown. For the haplotype-based method, under a multiplicative heterogeneity model, we observed a decrease in the performance of RF with increasing LD among the SNPs in the haplotype.ConclusionOur results suggest that by strategically revising the Random Forest method tree-building or importance measure calculation, power can increase when LD exists between SNPs. We conclude that the revised Random Forest method performed on SNPs offers an advantage of not requiring genotype phase, making it a viable tool for use in the context of thousands of SNPs, such as candidate gene studies and follow-up of top candidates from genome wide association studies.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2666661", "pubmed_id": "19265542", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-10-78", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2013577952", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "60993494", "207738357", "14723701", "8397120", "38750178", "13498219", "11343012", "15245447", "2827580", "26383737", "25882654"], "inbound_citations": ["215108471", "8675513", "117952", "15711501", "1945848", "2130307", "53579607", "6205944", "215396313", "23788924", "40560873", "2746910", "2732950", "7041850", "18401995", "17140149", "86770118", "6258394", "53208154", "215181586", "145813518", "21014710", "203650014", "12019872", "12049799", "13915933", "30071511", "59600290", "9320626", "18335107", "54081695", "5472126", "8689706", "2047716", "18377491", "90873604", "6568475", "23190538", "13966489", "13284214", "21029222", "7836437", "15834850", "1117445", "12454277", "15583323", "12140952", "17414329", "6378121", "2232165"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55311"}

All the plausible dependencies are kept in a Syntactic Dependency Graph (SDG). Then, structural disambiguation is carried out by a constraint satisfaction process, in which various constraints on dependency structure are propagated through SDG to filter out inconsistent dependencies.

Existing approaches to handling concept drift are overwhelmingly reliant on the assumption that it is possible to obtain the true label of an instance shortly after classification at a negligible cost. The aim of this thesis is to examine, and attempt to address, some of the problems related to handling concept drift when the cost of obtaining labels is high. This thesis presents Decision Value Sampling (DVS), a novel concept drift handling approach which periodically chooses a small number of the most useful instances to label. The newly labelled instances are then used to re-train the classifier, an SVM with a linear kernel, to handle any change in concept that might occur. In this way, only the instances that are required to keep the classifier up-to-date are labelled. The evaluation of the system indicates that a classifier can be kept up-to-date with changes in concept while only requiring 15% of the data stream to be labelled. In a data stream with a high throughput this represents a significant reduction in the number of labels required. The second novel concept drift handling approach proposed in this thesis is Confidence Distribution Batch Detection (CDBD). CDBD uses a heuristic based on the distribution of an SVM\u2019s confidence in its predictions to decide when to rebuild the classifier. The evaluation shows that CDBD can be used to reliably detect when a change in concept has taken place and that concept drift can be handled if the classifier is rebuilt when CDBD signals a change in concept. The evaluation also shows that CDBD obtains a considerable labels saving as it only requires labelled data when a change in concept has been detected. The two concept drift handling approaches deal with concept drift in a different manner, DVS continuously adapts the classifier, whereas CDBD only adapts the classifier when a sizeable change in concept is suspected. They reflect a divide also found in the literature, between continuous rebuild approaches (like DVS) and triggered rebuild approaches (like CDBD). The final major contribution in this thesis is a comparison between continuous and triggered rebuild approaches, as this is an underexplored area. An empirical comparison between representative techniques from both types of approaches shows that triggered rebuild works slightly better on large datasets where the changes in concepts occur infrequently, but in general a continuous rebuild approach works the best.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21427/D7HP48", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2181753876", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["19209698"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61297238"}

The number of parameters to optimize grows with space complexity of order O (p 2), making storage infeasible, interpretability poor, and causing the model to have a high tendency to overfit. Additionally, optimization while maintaining feasibility of the solution becomes prohibitively expensive, requiring a projection onto the positive semi-definite cone after every iteration. In addition to the obvious space and computational challenges, vanilla distance metric learning is unable to model complex and multi-modal trends in the data. Inspired by the recent resurgence of Frank-Wolfe style optimization, we propose a new method for sparse compositional local Mahalanobis distance metric learning. Our proposed technique learns a set of distance metrics which are composed of local and global components. We capture local interactions in the feature space, while ensuring that all metrics share a global component, which may act as a regularizer. We optimize our model using an alternating pairwise Frank-Wolfe style algorithm.

To cope with this problem, we have heretofore developed and applied a Case Based Genetic Algorithm (CBGALO) that contains a Local Optimizer, which is a Support Vector Machine (SVM). However, the prediction performance significantly depends on input data for learning. Hereupon, CBGALO is further extended by a Case Based automatically restartable Good combination searching GA for both learning features and input data (CBRsGcmbGA). Even the powerful but computationally expensive Deep Learning cannot automatically (evolutionarily, in our approach) search the learning data. Our approach solved this problem a little better by the case-based approach. However, it became obvious that even this work suffers from the typical GA effect in falling into local optima. To improve the results, we hence developed newly a diversity maintenance approach that inserts good individuals with large Hamming distance into the case base as elite individuals in GA\u2019s population. In 2 out of 3 classes of solar flares, the performance of our new approach became as high as the best ones among the conventional world top records. Namely, even in those \u2265 C class solar flares, our approach applying the Hamming distance to increase diversity had as high a performance 0.662 as compared with the conventional world top record 0.650.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9003127", "venue": "2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)", "journal": "2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3008759490", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121065556", "122849725", "123279130", "119111009", "121148516", "123231921", "121535969", "122621437", "59555156", "120870269", "119300214", "14516773", "120285562", "7755495", "55457359", "55085158", "6175357", "122217405", "961425", "17497682", "45239269", "122928825"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211243832"}

The LM algorithm is capable of training networks with 100 to 1000 fewer iterations, but the size of the problems are significantly limited. Also, the LM algorithm was adopted primarily for traditional MLP architectures. More recently two new revolutionary concepts were developed: Support Vector Machine and Extreme Learning Machines.

The aim of pansharpening (PNN) is to fuse the spatial in panchromatic (PAN) with the spectral information in multispectral (MS). Recently, deep learning has drawn much attention, and in the field of remote sensing, several pioneering attempts have been made related to PNN. However, the big size of remote sensing data will produce more training samples, which require a deeper neural network. Most current networks are relatively shallow and raise the possibility of detail loss. In this letter, we propose a residual encoder-decoder conditional generative adversarial network (RED-cGAN) for PNN to produce more details with sharpened images. The proposed method combines the idea of an autoencoder with generative adversarial network (GAN), which can effectively preserve the spatial and spectral information of the PAN and MS images simultaneously. First, the residual encoder-decoder module is adopted to extract the multiscale features from the last step to yield pansharpened images and relieve the training difficulty caused by deepening the network layers. Second, to further enhance the performance of the generator to preserve more spatial information, a conditional discriminator network with the input of PAN and MS images is proposed to encourage that the estimated MS images share the same distribution as that of the referenced HRMS images.

However, with the high variety issue under big data environments, this assumption violates the scenario of many real-world applications like activity recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for transfer learning on activity recognition with the new concept of transfer learning on high variety domains.

Their abnormal expression may lead to cancer. Therefore, analysis of such data may discover potential biological insight for cancer diagnosis. In this regard, recently many feature selection methods have been developed to identify such miRNAs. These methods have their own merits and demerits as the task is very challenging in nature. Thus, in this article, we propose a novel wrapper based feature selection technique with the integration of Rough and Fuzzy sets, Random Forest and Particle Swarm Optimization, to identify putative miRNAs that can solve the underlying biological problem effectively, i.e. to separate tumour and control samples. Here, Rough and Fuzzy sets help to address the vagueness and overlapping characteristics of the dataset while performing clustering. On the other hand, Random Forest is applied to perform the classification task on the clustering results to yield better solutions. The integrated clustering and classification tasks are considered as an underlying optimization problem for Particle Swarm Optimization method where particles encode features, in this case, miRNAs. The performance of the proposed wrapper based method has been demonstrated quantitatively and visually on next-generation sequencing data of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Finally, the selected miRNAs are validated through biological significance tests.

We introduce our implementation of fuzzy forests in the R package, fuzzyforest. Fuzzy forests works by taking advantage of the network structure between features. First, the features are partitioned into separate modules such that the correlation within modules is high and the correlation between modules is low. The package fuzzyforest allows for easy use of the package WGCNA (weighted gene coexpression network analysis, alternatively known as weighted correlation network analysis) to form modules of features such that the modules are roughly uncorrelated. Then recursive feature elimination random forests (RFE-RFs) are used on each module, separately. From the surviving features, a final group is selected and ranked using one last round of RFE-RFs.

This technique builds ensembles by assigning each individual predictor in the ensemble a distinct feature subset from the pool of available features. Extensive comparisons are carried out to compare FSE with other approaches. In addition, several novel variations to the basic FSE are added. The introduced FSE variants outperformed the other methods. Experiments were carried out using three different predictor types: least square error (LSE), artificial neural networks (ANN), and CART regression trees. A case study, the video traffic flow prediction, is investigated. This is a very important application that can improve the efficiency and playback quality of video streaming over the internet. We tried two approaches in order to tackle this important problem. The first is an adaptive algorithm using Sparse Basis Selection technique.

Case grammar is used for canonical conceptual representation with constraints. Domain-specific templates represent knowledge about specific applications as patterns of the form used in logic programming.

Human emotions can be recognized through the analysis of several modalities, which include speech, facial appearance, gestures, and human physiology.

The main aim of this research is to improve the classification accuracy of physiological-based emotion recognition systems by proposing a feature-based dual-layer ensemble classification method.

A standard pattern recognition system ::: can be divided into two main components, feature extraction and pattern classification. During the process of feature extraction, the information relevant to the problem is extracted from raw data, prepared as features and passed to a classifier for assignment of a label. Generally, the extracted feature vector has fairly large number of dimensions, from the order of hundreds to thousands, increasing the computational complexity significantly. Feature generation is introduced to handle this problem which filters out the unwanted features. The functionality ::: of feature generation has become very important in modern pattern recognition systems as it not only reduces the dimensions of the data but also increases the classification accuracy. ::: ::: A genetic programming (GP) based framework has been utilised in this thesis for feature generation. GP is a process based on the biological evolution of features in which combination of original features are evolved.

The process of evolution is optimised in a way to improve the discriminatory power of features in every new generation.

Although SVM is a classification method, we show its applicability to the localization problem and prove that the localization error can be upper bounded by any small threshold given an appropriate training data size. Third, LSVM addresses the border and coverage-hole problems effectively. Last but not least, LSVM offers fast localization in a distributed manner with efficient use of processing and communication resources. We also propose a modified version of mass-spring optimization to further improve the location estimation in LSVM. The promising performance of LSVM is exhibited by our simulation study.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TPDS.2007.70800", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2111336388", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6356060", "252999", "209399974", "15379285", "17825532", "2269436", "9421993", "7957382", "1796185", "18232672", "179324", "3102406", "62627663", "18959190", "61822837", "6956208", "8539161", "571135", "28637672", "961425", "14727192"], "inbound_citations": ["18730020", "33997812", "5024538", "711806", "15527015", "19484050", "112138370", "18033190", "32318192", "32480123", "16803519", "122497595", "26201683", "15805362", "56096192", "12950319", "7679667", "197409140", "1262135", "33416288", "16978811", "49302516", "19014286", "38879931", "125113536", "14262825", "16277962", "206975516", "8449688", "18611086", "24742926", "9642721", "55120198", "10280748", "13116461", "17212350", "3371671", "17404615", "8099605", "86249", "31431002", "58672791", "15694919", "61070278", "8475881", "17382018", "1482668", "23668684", "53949804", "210877142", "40167690", "29361141", "54118067", "53779959", "215614729", "550323", "52304541", "36400251", "14441006", "60937771", "11076784", "3435148", "204833136", "9337929", "106463", "10229920", "960815", "36557670", "4470927", "14272869", "39253194", "9573242", "215062165", "27469831", "32775207", "4950111", "9994691", "1986226", "21419117", "53428277", "23604925", "17675729", "17405578", "30466108", "198899441", "38584779", "34779524", "7710166", "52900311", "7481221", "19027765", "16801200", "3550683", "195740290", "36736861", "41317277", "6736508", "39760910", "10688639", "31949616", "964893", "199440935", "8004875"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10073761"}

SVMs are variational-calculus based methods that are constrained to have structural risk minimization (SRM), i.e., they provide noise tolerant solutions for pattern recognition. The SVM approach encapsulates a significant amount of model-fitting information in the choice of its kernel. In work thus far, novel, information-theoretic, kernels have been successfully employed for notably better performance over standard kernels. Currently there are two approaches for implementing multiclass SVMs. One is called external multi-class that arranges several binary classifiers as a decision tree such that they perform a single-class decision making function, with each leaf corresponding to a unique class. The second approach, namely internal-multiclass, involves solving a single optimization problem corresponding to the entire data set (with multiple hyperplanes).ResultsEach SVM approach encapsulates a significant amount of model-fitting information in its choice of kernel. In work thus far, novel, information-theoretic, kernels were successfully employed for notably better performance over standard kernels. Two SVM approaches to multiclass discrimination are described: (1) internal multiclass (with a single optimization), and (2) external multiclass (using an optimized decision tree). We describe benefits of the internal-SVM approach, along with further refinements to the internal-multiclass SVM algorithms that offer significant improvement in training time without sacrificing accuracy. In situations where the data isn't clearly separable, making for poor discrimination, signal clustering is used to provide robust and useful information \u2013 to this end, novel, SVM-based clustering methods are also described. As with the classification, there are Internal and External SVM Clustering algorithms, both of which are briefly described.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC1683575", "pubmed_id": "17118147", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-7-S2-S4", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2071859591", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "194951", "10151608", "14561315", "7066611", "301365", "285178", "15477515", "12888428", "14561524", "13020249", "6365615", "58130983", "16784483", "95566744", "17942346", "28610806", "18487371", "124257313", "118787942", "148640146", "2110475", "16651286", "6644398", "573509", "23304227", "2852254", "1536643"], "inbound_citations": ["16769813", "16099489", "1853183", "53339029", "46290538", "15015125", "2156913", "25444162", "18817825", "55681670", "40258618", "29058493", "16437502", "2494153", "10948019", "2234213", "25444849", "11936585", "15250672", "10981946", "7497940", "56475415"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:760235"}

Many IoT devices are closely physically approachable by the crowd, making cryptographic key-based security protocols vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) are emerging as a promising keyless solution by utilizing inherent variations of integrated circuits (ICs) to produce different responses from different devices. While physically unclonable, some PUFs were reported to be mathematically clonable by machine learning (ML) methods. XOR PUFs are a group of PUFs mathematically clonable when a large number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) are available to attackers. Double Arbiter PUFs (DAPUFs) were developed for increased security against machine learning attacks over XOR PUFs, and studies showed that DAPUFs are highly secure against attacks using Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this paper, we investigate how secure DAPUFs are against neural network-based attack methods and compare the DAPUFs\u2019 performance with that of XOR PUFs. The results confirm with existing studies on DAPUFs\u2019 higher security when compared with XOR PUFs, but also discovered that DAPUFs are not secure against neural network-based attacks if attackers can obtain a large number of CRPs, revealing a security vulnerability of those DAPUFs we examined in this study.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006041", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3008113484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["25361787", "34005878", "1788365", "12953675", "2239473", "1070145", "1938970", "6628106", "11325408", "9821233", "15880097", "10659969", "13961278", "51694594", "6757181", "207164146", "16933664", "7479553"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211297488"}

Extraction of features for classifying built-up areas that are more robust and abstract is a leading research topic from past many years. Although, various studies have been carried out where spatial information along with spectral features has been utilized to enhance the accuracy of classification. Still, these feature extraction techniques require a large number of user-specific parameters and generally application specific. On the other hand, recently introduced Deep Learning (DL) techniques requires less number of parameters to represent more abstract aspects of the data without any manual effort. Since, it is difficult to acquire high-resolution datasets for applications that require large scale monitoring of areas. Therefore, in this study Sentinel-2 image has been used for built-up areas extraction. In this work, pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) i.e. Inception v3 and VGGNet are employed for transfer learning. Since these networks are trained on generic images of ImageNet dataset which are having very different characteristics from satellite images. Therefore, weights of networks are fine-tuned using data derived from Sentinel-2 images. To compare the accuracies with existing shallow networks, two state of art classifiers i.e. Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BP-NN) are also implemented. Both SVM and BP-NN gives 84.31 % and 82.86 % overall accuracies respectively. Inception-v3 and VGGNet gives 89.43 % of overall accuracy using fine-tuned VGGNet and 92.10 % when using Inception-v3.

Strategic forest inventories are difficult to compile over large areas and are often quickly outdated or spatially incomplete as a function of their long production cycle. As a consequence, automated approaches supported by remotely sensed data are increasingly sought to provide exhaustive spatial coverage for a set of core attributes in a timely fashion. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the integration of current remotely-sensed data products and pre-existing jurisdictional inventory data to map four forest attributes of interest (stand age, dominant species, site index, and stem density) for a 55 Mha study region in British Columbia, Canada. First, via image segmentation, spectrally homogenous objects were derived from Landsat surface-reflectance pixel composites. Second, a suite of Landsat-based predictors (e.g., spectral indices, disturbance history, and forest structure) and ancillary variables (e.g., geographic, topographic, and climatic) were derived for these units and used to develop predictive models of target attributes. For the often difficult classification of dominant species, two modelling approaches were compared: (a) a global Random Forests model calibrated with training samples collected over the entire study area, and (b) an ensemble of local models, each calibrated with spatially constrained local samples. Accuracy assessment based upon independent validation samples revealed that the ensemble of local models was more accurate and efficient for species classification, achieving an overall accuracy of 72% for the species which dominate 80% of the forested areas in the province. Results indicated that site index had the highest agreement between predicted and reference (R2 = 0.74, %RMSE = 23.1%), followed by stand age (R2 = 0.62, %RMSE = 35.6%), and stem density (R2 = 0.33, %RMSE = 65.2%). Inventory attributes mapped at the image-derived unit level captured much finer details than traditional polygon-based inventory, yet can be readily reassembled into these larger units for strategic forest planning purposes.

We developed recommendation domains with common degree of impact requiring incremental, systemic or incremental adaptation effort to provide decision support for interventions to scale out adaptive practices. We used Random Forests to divide the cocoa production belt into four zones with distinct climatic features under current and future climate conditions. To make model results actionable we used an expert validation approach. Cocoa experts evaluated and verified cocoa occurrence data for model input, prioritized climate and soil variables for modeling use and confirmed the validity of the distribution of climate zones. Climate change will reduce the available area for cocoa production in the north due to a shift of the northern transition to the Savanna zone. The current area for cocoa in central Ashanti will remain suitable but will face uncertain climatic conditions. Areas in the Western, Central and Eastern regions will likely become hotter and wetter. Each of these projected impacts will require site-specific adaptation strategies matching the degree of impacts. Failing to prepare may subject rural communities to high risks of losing their livelihoods.

Re-identification requires solving two fundamental problems: 1) determining a distance measure between features extracted from different cameras that cope with illumination changes (metric learning) and 2) ensuring that matched features refer to the same body part (correspondence). Most metric learning approaches focus on finding a robust distance measure between bounding box images, neglecting the alignment aspects. In this paper, we propose to learn appearance measures for patches that are combined using deformable models. Learning metrics for patches avoids strong dimensionality reduction, thus keeping more information. Additionally, we allow patches to change their locations, directly addressing the correspondence problem. As patches from different locations may share the same metric, our method effectively multiplies the amount of training data and allows patch metrics to be learned on the smaller amounts of labeled images. Different metric learning approaches (KISSME, XQDA, and LSSL) together with different deformable models (spring constraints and one-to-one matching constraints) are investigated and compared. For describing patches, we propose to learn a deep feature representation with convolutional neural networks, thus obtaining highly effective features for re-identification.

One essential point of label propagation is that the performance is heavily affected by incorporating underlying manifold of given data into the input graph. The other more important point is that in many recent real-world applications, the same instances are represented by multiple heterogeneous data sources. A key challenge under this setting is to integrate different data representations automatically to achieve better predictive performance. In this paper, we address the issue of obtaining the optimal linear combination of multiple different graphs under the label propagation setting. For this problem, we propose a new formulation with the sparsity (in coefficients of graph combination) property which cannot be rightly achieved by any other existing methods. This unique feature provides two important advantages: 1) the improvement of prediction performance by eliminating irrelevant or noisy graphs and 2) the interpretability of results, i.e., easily identifying informative graphs on classification. We propose efficient optimization algorithms for the proposed approach, by which clear interpretations of the mechanism for sparsity is provided.

{"paper_id": "118559477", "title": "VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT Hybrid Genetic Relational Search for Inductive Learning", "authors": [{"first": "Federico", "middle": [], "last": "Divina", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "An important characteristic of all natural systems is the ability to acquire knowledge through experience and to adapt to new situations. Learning is the single unifying theme of all natural systems. One of the basic ways of gaining knowledge is through examples of some concepts.For instance, we may learn how to distinguish a dog from other creatures after that we have seen a number of creatures, and after that someone (a teacher, or supervisor) told us which creatures are dogs and which are not. This way of learning is called supervised learning. Inductive Concept Learning (ICL) constitutes a central topic in machine learning. The problem can be formulated in the following manner: given a description language used to express possible hypotheses, a background knowledge, a set of positive examples, and a set of negative examples, one has to find a hypothesis which covers all positive examples and none of the negative ones. This is a supervised way of learning, since a supervisor has already classified the examples of the concept into positive and negative examples. The so learned concept can be used to classify previously unseen examples. In general deriving general conclusions from specific observation is called induction. Thus in ICL, concepts are induced because obtained from the observation of a limited set of training examples. The process can be seen as a search process. Starting from an initial hypothesis, what is done is searching the space of the possible hypotheses for one that fits the given set of examples. A representation language has to be chosen in order to represent concepts, examples and the background knowledge. This is an important choice, because this may limit the kind of concept we can learn. With a representation language that has a low expressive power we may not be able to represent some problem domain, because too complex for the language adopted. On the other side, a too expressive language may give us the possibility to represent all problem domains. However this solution may also give us too much freedom, in the sense that we can build concepts in too many different ways, and this could lead to the impossibility of finding the right concept. We are interested in learning concepts expressed in a fragment of first--order logic (FOL). This subject is known as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), where the knowledge to be learn is expressed by Horn clauses, which are used in programming languages based on logic programming like Prolog. Learning systems that use a representation based on first--order logic have been successfully applied to relevant real life problems, e.g., learning a specific property related to carcinogenicity. Learning first--order hypotheses is a hard task, due to the huge search space one has to deal with. The approach used by the majority of ILP systems tries to overcome this problem by using specific search strategies, like the top-down and the inverse resolution mechanism. However, the greedy selection strategies adopted for reducing the computational effort, render techniques based on this approach often incapable of escaping from local optima. An alternative approach is offered by genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs have proved to be successful in solving comparatively hard optimization problems, as well as problems like ICL. GAs represents a good approach when the problems to solve are characterized by a high number of variables, when there is interaction among variables, when there are mixed types of variables, e.g., numerical and nominal, and when the search space presents many local optima. Moreover it is easy to hybridize GAs with other techniques that are known to be good for solving some classes of problems. Another appealing feature of GAs is represented by their intrinsic parallelism, and their use of exploration operators, which give them the possibility of escaping from local optima. However this latter characteristic of GAs is also responsible for their rather poor performance on learning tasks which are easy to tackle by algorithms that use specific search strategies. These observations suggest that the two approaches above described, i.e., standard ILP strategies and GAs, are applicable to partly complementary classes of learning problems. More important, they indicate that a system incorporating features from both approaches could profit from the different benefits of the approaches. This motivates the aim of this thesis, which is to develop a system based on GAs for ILP that incorporates search strategies used in successful ILP systems. Our approach is inspired by memetic algorithms, a population based search method for combinatorial optimization problems. In evolutionary computation memetic algorithms are GAs in which individuals can be refined during their lifetime.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1570400458", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118559477"}

However, while vemurafenib is FDA-approved for BRAF-V600E melanomas, the non-melanoma basket trial was unsuccessful, suggesting mutation status is insufficient to predict response. We hypothesized that proteomic data would complement mutation status to identify vemurafenib-sensitive tumors and effective co-treatments for BRAF-V600E tumors with inherent resistance. Reverse Phase Proteomic Array (RPPA, MD Anderson Cell Lines Project), RNAseq (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) and vemurafenib sensitivity (Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal) data for BRAF-V600E cancer cell lines were curated. Linear and nonlinear regression models using RPPA protein or RNAseq were evaluated and compared based on their ability to predict BRAF-V600E cell line sensitivity (area under the dose response curve). Accuracies of all models were evaluated using hold-out testing. CausalPath software was used to identify protein-protein interaction networks that could explain differential protein expression in resistant cells. Human examination of features employed by the model, the identified protein interaction networks, and model simulation suggested anti-ErbB co-therapy would counter intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib. To validate this potential co-therapy, cell lines were treated with vemurafenib and dacomitinib (a pan-ErbB inhibitor) and the number of viable cells was measured. Orthogonal partial least squares (O-PLS) predicted vemurafenib sensitivity with greater accuracy in both melanoma and non-melanoma BRAF-V600E cell lines than other leading machine learning methods, specifically Random Forests, Support Vector Regression (linear and quadratic kernels) and LASSO-penalized regression. Additionally, use of transcriptomic in place of proteomic data weakened model performance. Model analysis revealed that resistant lines had elevated expression and activation of ErbB receptors, suggesting ErbB inhibition could improve vemurafenib response. As predicted, experimental evaluation of vemurafenib plus dacomitinb demonstrated improved efficacy relative to monotherapies.

Most classifiers work in a closed world setting where the classifier is trained on a known corpus, and then it is tested on unseen examples that belong to one of the classes seen during training. Despite the usefulness of this design, often there is a need to classify unseen examples that do not belong to any of the classes on which the classifier was trained. This paper describes the open set scenario where unseen examples from previously unseen classes are handled while testing. This further examines a process of enhanced open set classification with a deep neural network that discovers new classes by clustering the examples identified as belonging to unknown classes, followed by a process of retraining the classifier with newly recognized classes. Through this process the model moves to an incremental learning model where it continuously finds and learns from novel classes of data that have been identified automatically.

This approach, however, does not always work in practice as these algorithms require that we have somewhat ideal data. Unfortunately, most data sets either have missing entries or unacceptably noisy values.

Some techniques, such as matrix completion, can be used to fill in missing data but these methods do not capture the non-linear structure of the manifold.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by running three different experiments.

Random Forests is a well-known statistical learning tool that maps a list of input parameters onto a predicted response. A constructed Random Forests model ranks these input parameters efficiently even for highly nonlinear data. The aim of this study is to investigate the capability of Random Forests in assisted/automatic production history matching in reservoir engineering. A history matching case study has been chosen to rigorously compare the capability of Random Forests and one-parameter-at-time (OPAT) in sensitivity analysis. The capability of Random Forests as a sensitivity analysis tool was investigated and compared with OPAT. By implementing the optimal number of decision trees, which the Random Forests' configuration parameters, and the appropriate design of experiments method Fractional Factorial Design (FFD), the Random Forests-based history matching results have shown to be relatively better than OPAT-based results in this case. Here, Random Forests combined with FFD helped in improving the average error by 23.1%, along with the reduction of the standard deviation of errors by 28.9% relative to OPAT. Combining Random Forests with FFD is relatively better than OPAT because of the rigorous permutation tests of each parameter. In addition, this combination requires only 16 samples, where OPAT requires 21 samples. The combination of Random Forests and FFD as a sensitivity analysis tool successfully selected the top parameters which are horizontal permeability-related. Such parameters are well known in their direct relationship with water production as described by the well-known fractional flow theory.

To identify the owner driver from thieves, previous works applied various algorithms toward driving data. Such data mining methods utilized supervised learning, thus required labeled data set. However, it is unrealistic to gather and apply the thief's driving pattern. To overcome this problem, we propose driver identification method with GAN.

The cell size for which total ice concentration can be estimated also will be reduced. However, estimates of multi-year ice concentration, of thin ice types, and the character of ice in the marginal ice zone will not be improved over SMMR estimates by virtue of these higher frequency data. Enhanced estimates of these parameters must come from development of improved ice classification algorithms. Improved ground truth information from which satellite data can be interpreted and verified is critical if classification algorithms are to be improved. Specifically, data that document radiometric signatures of wet and snow-covered ice surfaces that occur during summer and autumn months are needed to improve estimates of multi- year concentrations during melt and freeze-up. Brightness temperature data that describe the transition from open water to thick first-year ice are required for improved discrimination of thin ice types.

Firstly, on analysing a medical dataset providing visualisations together with invaluable information on dataset\u2019s variables. Secondly, it emphasizes on implementing the appropriate algorithms to execute binary classification in order to determine whether a person is labelled as infected or not infected based on feature values of the sample set. Choosing the most suitable approach is crucial as it could potentially improve the clinical decisions as well as patients\u2019 survival time when applied to real world problems. ::: The research is based on the mesothelioma disease dataset, allocated on the UCI repository, containing 324 examples with 35 attributes. Regarding the unsupervised learning part, in order to deduct results and conclusions, various ML classification algorithms are used to perform the analysis such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, k Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ::: Concerning the techniques for evaluation, the reader can expect several methods as for example statistical measures like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, f1-score, confusion matrix, AUC (Area Under Curve), and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2984662742", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209083241"}

In this scenario, peptidoglycan hydrolases can be used as alternate antibacterial agents due to their unique property of cleaving peptidoglycan cell wall present in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Along with a role in maintaining overall peptidoglycan turnover in a cell and in daughter cell separation, peptidoglycan hydrolases also play crucial role in bacterial pathophysiology requiring development of a computational tool for the identification and classification of novel peptidoglycan hydrolases from genomic and metagenomic data.ResultsIn this study, the known peptidoglycan hydrolases were divided into multiple classes based on their site of action and were used for the development of a computational tool \u2018HyPe\u2019 for identification and classification of novel peptidoglycan hydrolases from genomic and metagenomic data. Various classification models were developed using amino acid and dipeptide composition features by training and optimization of Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. Random Forest multiclass model was selected for the development of HyPe tool as it showed up to 71.12 % sensitivity, 99.98 % specificity, 99.55 % accuracy and 0.80 MCC in four different classes of peptidoglycan hydrolases. The tool was validated on 24 independent genomic datasets and showed up to 100 % sensitivity and 0.94 MCC. The ability of HyPe to identify novel peptidoglycan hydrolases was also demonstrated on 24 metagenomic datasets.ConclusionsThe present tool helps in the identification and classification of novel peptidoglycan hydrolases from complete genomic or metagenomic ORFs. To our knowledge, this is the only tool available for the prediction of peptidoglycan hydrolases from genomic and metagenomic data.Availability: http://metagenomics.iiserb.ac.in/hype/ and http://metabiosys.iiserb.ac.in/hype/.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4882796", "pubmed_id": "27229861", "doi": "10.1186/s12864-016-2753-8", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2404737370", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["94216608", "38655697", "1464727", "13235184", "28367348", "17108591", "41337030", "6140056", "20383182", "24498770", "19822446", "37911610", "84107523", "1070860", "39616152", "22381011", "23839940", "1673681", "35526347", "22915207", "2576901", "7613984", "11407597", "33930140", "43742678", "10866531", "3603672", "38383142", "25185093", "46726926", "1193825", "17167473", "13283421", "16132430", "46071829", "21654168", "6010725", "1575382", "1818957", "6353106", "14441902", "4426541", "11906282", "13139777", "14396993", "37780198", "13861754", "961425", "8320296", "89141", "12035831", "7161110"], "inbound_citations": ["209169661", "198239611", "18549001", "215363064", "85542252"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18736689"}

As industrial processes are time-varying, on-line learning algorithms should be adaptive to capture process changes. On-line ensemble methods have been shown to provide better generalization performance than single models in changing environments. However, most on-line ensembles do not include and exclude models during on-line operation. As a result, the ensembles have limited adaptation capability. Moreover, a higher performance can be obtained by combining a selected set of most relevant models of the ensemble for the current situation, rather than combining all the models. This paper proposes a new on-line learning ensemble of regressor models using an ordered aggregation (OA) technique which is able to provide on-line predictions of variables in changing environments. OA dynamically selects an optimal size and composition of a subset of models based on the minimization of the ensemble error on the newest sample. The proposed strategy overcomes the problem of defining the optimal ensemble size, and in most cases it obtains better performance than aggregating all the models. Models are added or removed for assuring adaptation of the ensemble in changing environments. Furthermore, this paper proposes and integrates a new on-line Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) neural network model with variable forgetting factor (FF) using the directional FF method which shows superior performance in industrial applications when compared to the well-known On-line Sequential ELM (OS-ELM) algorithm.

In some dangerous situations, Vehicle to Vehicle communication of TS information is required to prevent approaching drivers from a possible crash. In this paper, a novel system based on the detection, recognition and transmission of TSs is investigated. Hence, two main modules have been developed: Vision-Module (VM) and Transmission-Module (TM). In the VM, an efficient algorithm for the detection and recognition of TS is presented. A modified version of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is used to detect and recognize TSs through a set of multi-level Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers.

In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a recently developed evolutionary-based algorithm called Social-Spider Optimization (SSO), as well as we introduce SSO for feature selection purposes. The model selection task has been handled in three distinct scenarios: (i) feature selection, (ii) tuning parameters and (iii) feature selection+tuning parameters. Such extensive set of experiments against with some state-of-the-art evolutionary optimization techniques (i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization and Novel Global-best Harmony Search) demonstrated SSO is a suitable approach for SVM model selection, since it obtained the top results in 8 out 10 datasets employed in this work (considering all three scenarios).

We call this approach \u201cMachine Learning Based Clinical Research (MLBCR)\u201d. We performed a pilot project in non\u2010small cell lungcancer(NSCLC) patients for which clinical TNM stage is highly inaccurate for the prediction of survival of non\u2010surgical patients and alternatives are currently lacking. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a prediction model for survival of NSCLC patients, treated with (chemo) radiotherapy, using clinical factors. Patients and Methods: Three interconnected databases were mirrored into a data warehouse using a disease based, cohort\u2010specific data model. The three data sources were a) electronic medical records, b) imaging and DICOM\u2010RT objects in a RT\u2010PACS and c) treatment information in a record and verify database. Data from 403 consecutive inoperable NSCLC patients, stage I\u2010IIIB, treated radically with (chemo) radiation were selected. In 82 patients data from blood samples were available. The 2\u2010norm Support Vector Machines were used to build the prognostic models. Performance of the models was expressed as the AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and assessed using leave\u2010one\u2010out (LOO) cross\u2010validation. The prognostic model, using clinical factors only, was validated using two external, independent datasets with 36 and 65 patients, respectively. In addition, a risk score was calculated and a nomogram, which is in fact a graphical representation of the risk score, was made for practical use. Results: The model, based on 403 patients and using clinical factors, consisted of gender, WHO performance status, forced expiratory volume (FEV1), number of positive lymph node stations on PET and gross tumor volume (on PET\u2010CT). The AUC, assessed by LOO cross\u2010validation, was 0.75 (95% CI 0.70\u20130.82), while application of the model to the external datasets yielded an AUC of 0.75 and 0.76 respectively. Splitting the MAASTRO cohort into 3 subgroups, based on the risk score, resulted in the identification of a high, medium and low risk group. The 2\u2010year survival was 66% (95% CI 54%\u201378%) for the low risk group, 29% (95% CI 21%\u201337%) for the medium risk group and 14% (95% CI 5%\u201323%) for the high risk group. If blood biomarkers were available, based on the 82 patients the prognostic model consisted of three additional biomarkers factors: OPN, IL8 and CEA. The LOO AUC was 0.83 (95% CI 0.76\u20130.94), which is significantly better than the prognostic model using only clinical factors based on the same 82 patients (AUC 0.71, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.87). Conclusion, the model, using clinical factors, successfully estimates 2\u2010year survival of NSCLC patients and the performance, assessed internally as well as in two independent datasets, is good. Combining blood biomarkers with clinical factors yielded a significantly better performance than using clinical factors only (AUC: 0.83 vs 0.71). We concluded that MLBCR is feasible. The bottle neck is the availability of external data sets. Therefore, we need to invest in international standards as well in multicentric approaches allowing to recruit more patients, preferably having had different type of treatments, and to have quick access to external validation data sets.Conflict of Interest: This project has been partially funded by Siemens IKM.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1118/1.2962571", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical Physics", "mag_id": "2060751460", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:72514518"}

Despite its popularity, SVM has a serious drawback, that is sensitivity to outliers in training samples. The penalty on misclassification is defined by a convex loss called the hinge loss, and the unboundedness of the convex loss causes the sensitivity to outliers. To deal with outliers, robust variants of SVM have been proposed, such as the robust outlier detection algorithm and an SVM with a bounded loss called the ramp loss. In this paper, we propose a robust variant of SVM and investigate its robustness in terms of the breakdown point. The breakdown point is a robustness measure that is the largest amount of contamination such that the estimated classifier still gives information about the non-contaminated data. The main contribution of this paper is to show an exact evaluation of the breakdown point for the robust SVM. For learning parameters such as the regularization parameter in our algorithm, we derive a simple formula that guarantees the robustness of the classifier. When the learning parameters are determined with a grid search using cross validation, our formula works to reduce the number of candidate search points. The robustness of the proposed method is confirmed in numerical experiments.

The algorithm is trained and tested on the VidTimit database to recognise sequences of phonemes as well as visemes (visual speech units). Furthermore, the system is extended with the training on phoneme or viseme pairs (biphones) to counteract the human speech ambiguity of co-articulation. The test set accuracy for the recognition of phoneme sequences is 20%, and the accuracy of viseme sequences is 39%. Both results improve the best values reported in other papers by approximately 2%. The contribution of the result is three-fold: Firstly, this paper is the first to show that 3D feature extraction methods can be applied to continuous sequence recognition tasks despite the unknown start positions and durations of each phoneme. Secondly, the result confirms that 3D feature extraction methods improve the accuracy compared to 2D features extraction methods.

The problem becomes even more challenging when the camera is mobile, and thus, the background is not static. In this case, the traditional approach of background subtraction cannot be employed. Methods based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) have been introduced and widely used for human detection due to reliable performance. Yet, these sliding window-based algorithms are computationally expensive to run on embedded platforms. In order to address this problem, we present a significantly faster moving human detection method that is based on fast motion segmentation, and uses HOG as the feature descriptor. First, edges are detected on two consecutive frames, and the difference between the edge images is computed. Then, a new edge-based frame alignment method is used to find the global minimum for motion compensation, and segment the motion region of interest (ROI). Instead of searching for the human(s) in the whole frame, the HOG features in sliding windows are calculated only in the ROI. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify human and non-human regions. Compared to the traditional method of using HOG and searching the whole frame, the proposed method significantly reduces the search region by motion segmentation, and speeds up the detection process. Experiments have been performed on three different scenarios, and the results show that the reduction in execution time of a frame can reach as high as 95.83%.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDSC.2013.6778215", "venue": "2013 Seventh International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras (ICDSC)", "journal": "2013 Seventh International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras (ICDSC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2535085576", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15274236", "4284659", "27455089", "206590483", "12995651", "10933125", "3198903", "1179359", "7616980", "26765947", "17268119", "6013298", "7605374", "30411676", "4590326"], "inbound_citations": ["196049548", "21725082", "24358537"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206786178"}

Yet, the naturally occurring non-stationarity entrenched within the rainfall time series lowers the model performances and is an ongoing research endeavour for practicing hydrologists and drought-risk evaluators. In this paper, an attempt is made to resolve the non-stationarity challenges faced by rainfall forecasting models via a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) combined with Random Forest (RF) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) algorithms in designing a hybrid CEEMD-RF-KRR model in forecasting rainfall at Gilgit, Muzaffarabad, and Parachinar in Pakistan at monthly time scale. The rainfall time-series data are simultaneously factorized into respective intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual element using CEEMD. Once the significant lags of each IMF and the residual are identified, both are forecasted using the RF algorithm. Finally, the KRR model is adopted where the forecasted IMFs and the residual components are combined to generate the final forecasted rainfall. The CEEMD-RF-KRR model shows the best performances at all three sites, in comparison to the comparative models, with maximum values of correlation coefficient (0.97\u20130.99), Willmott\u2019s index (0.94\u20130.97), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (0.94\u20130.97) and Legates-McCabe\u2019s index (0.74\u20130.81). Furthermore, the CEEMD-RF-KRR model generated the most accurate results for Gilgit station considering the Legate-McCabe\u2019s index as base assessment criteria in addition to obtaining the lowest magnitudes of RMSE = 2.52 mm and MAE = 1.98 mm.

The performance results of a set of experiments conducted using binary and multi-class SVM with increasing training data sizes are examined. The NER domain chosen for these experiments is the biomedical publications domain, especially selected due to its importance and inherent challenges. A simple machine learning approach is used that eliminates prior language knowledge such as part-of-speech or noun phrase tagging thereby allowing for its applicability across languages. No domain-specific knowledge is included. The accuracy measures achieved are comparable to those obtained using more complex approaches, which constitutes a motivation to investigate ways to improve the scalability of multi- class SVM in order to make the solution more practical and useable. Improving training time of multi-class SVM would make support vector machines a more viable and practical machine learning solution for real-world problems with large datasets. An initial prototype results in great improvement of the training time at the expense of memory requirements. In previous work (11), a simple architecture that eliminates language and domain-specific knowledge from the named entity recognition process is applied to the English biomedical entity recognition task, as a baseline for other languages and domains. The biomedical field NER remains a challenging task due to growing nomenclature, ambiguity in the left boundary of entities caused by descriptive naming, difficulty of manually annotating large sets of training data, strong overlap among different entities, to cite a few of the NER challenges in this domain. The approach used reduces the pre- and post-processing of the textual data to a minimum and capitalizes on SVM's strong generalization ability to classify the named entities. The accuracy measures achieved are comparable to those obtained using more complex techniques, which encourage us to explore ways to improve the scalability of multi-class support vector machines. In this paper, the results of a set of scalability experiments are reported. These experiments use binary and multi-class SVM with a large set of real-world data from the biomedical literature. In Section II, the theory of binary and multi-class support vector machines is briefly introduced. Section III describes the experiments' design and summarizes the results of a baseline experiment conducted during the previous work (11) in order to assess the feasibility of our language and domain- independent machine learning NER approach using SVM and high-dimensional features. The baseline experiment design reduces pre-processing to feature extraction and eliminates the use of prior language or domain knowledge. The results of the baseline experiment are a motivation to explore ways to address the scalability issues of the All-Together multi-class SVM approach. Improving scalability of multi-class SVM would provide the research community with a practical and powerful machine learning solution for named entity recognition that promotes the use of high-dimensional features in place of more complex labor and time expensive pre- and post-processing tasks, and simplifies the NER process while achieving good accuracy and performance measures.

By spatially quantifying ecological components driving functional connectivity, we can understand why some locally suitable habitats are unoccupied, resulting in observed discontinuities in distribution. However, estimating connectivity may be difficult due to population stochasticity and violations of assumptions of parametric statistics. To address these issues, we present a novel application of Random Forests to landscape genetic data. We address the effects of three key ecological components on Bufo boreas connectivity in Yellowstone National Park: ecological process, scale, and hierarchical organization. Habitat permeability, topographic morphology, and temperature-moisture regime are all significant ecological processes associated with B. boreas connectivity. Connectivity was influenced by growing-season precipitation, 1988 Yellowstone fires, cover, temperature, impervious surfaces (roads and development), and topographic complexity (56% variation explained). We found that habitat permeability generally operates on fine scales, while topographic morphology and temperature-moisture regime operate across multiple scales, thus demonstrating the importance of cross-scale analysis for ecological interpretation. In a hierarchical analysis, we were able to explain more variation within genetic clusters as identified using Structure (a Bayesian algorithm) (74%; dispersal cover, growing-season precipitation, impervious surfaces) as opposed to between genetic clusters (45%; ridgelines, hot, dry slopes, length of hot season, and annual precipitation). Finally, the analytical methods we developed are powerful and can be applied to any species or system with appropriate landscape and genetic data.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20380214", "doi": "10.1890/08-0879.1", "venue": "Ecology", "journal": "Ecology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1971271947", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["23948022", "23537344", "62667012", "16869345", "89141", "44993205", "21026592", "86386213", "3626971", "16036351", "200062551", "14165126", "32775223", "82595997", "88418191", "24180377", "11316863", "15594012", "10523988", "86257852", "85674550", "12826680", "12081817", "6395771", "21539255", "27171692", "52871542", "129993913", "86076699", "54033902", "85794236", "24881351", "44048546", "52229932", "16111011", "20329581", "44412454"], "inbound_citations": ["13457650", "211208241", "52818262", "55188432", "24596318", "18567191", "16435893", "3769332", "131148037", "4650219", "91109478", "85735125", "131508909", "14625636", "14248094", "20144240", "8133190", "5754770", "16333607", "85428998", "53231286", "366410", "4495354", "212675619", "56171658", "215655835", "18022056", "15032777", "15352341", "17844440", "5709417", "43151461", "8629204", "485957", "9240355", "89794593", "4860420", "18202209", "4992985", "17970452", "2963728", "37966051", "54952164", "91889338", "204842291", "53607885", "52913931", "88755307", "203383148", "26011443", "57373498", "215426218", "951189", "21303391", "13739507", "15102426", "16045713", "5043822", "39088150", "1701028", "51965762", "129864719", "91471270", "10957191", "134015136", "195187708", "74871425", "12582397", "9123830", "92117726", "210698614", "82575217", "18469653", "206180556", "14301520", "901360", "214851667", "519825", "1779429", "44283449", "22508202", "5981495", "1083795", "205363477", "53059335", "84429609", "89770575", "128410266", "146179282", "3422572", "644977", "215323616", "53237959", "203530289", "49420377", "85776913", "46547141", "18086320", "15675211", "7142242", "133064798", "6805770", "89002885", "16098349", "18456583", "13821884", "134134300", "18092318", "5879550", "14240345", "7265", "18015523", "215158296", "198186406", "23005644", "2046951", "88881136", "215206563", "214831831", "215196218", "215604303", "25390790", "210172795", "33233071", "202853675", "56323852", "18520698", "149576463", "1352428", "22744312", "27792452"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39361255"}

To solve this problem, an approach of 3D space handwriting character recognition based on elimination of connected stroke is represented. 3D space characters are flattened. Feature extraction of turning points and direction of strokes is performed. To avoid eliminating the wrong strokes, Support Vector Machine(SVM) is adopted to divide the unknown characters into 2 sections: connected-stroke characters and non-connected-stroke characters. The connected strokes are eliminated by using stroke writing features which put the trajectory of a 3D space character into a flat trajectory of the character. Character recognition is performed by using flat character classifier directly. Experimental results show that the effect of eliminating connected stroke using this approach is remarkable and a higher recognition rate can be obtained by using existed character library.

Based on the results of clustering, a classifier, i.e., an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to classify a driver during driving in one of the four discovered clusters (profiles). The performance of ANN is compared with that of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Comparison of the clustering techniques shows that different subsets of the recorded dataset with a diverse combination of attributes provide approximately the same number of profiles, i.e., four.

In this paper, we present an extensive review on cloud computing with the main focus on gaps and security concerns. We identify the top security threats and their existing solutions. We also investigate the challenges/obstacles in implementing threat remediation. To address these issues, we propose a proactive threat detection model by adopting three main goals: (i) detect an attack when it happens, (ii) alert related parties (system admin, data owner) about the attack type and take combating action, and (iii) generate information on the type of attack by analyzing the pattern (even if the cloud provider attempts subreption). To emphasize the importance of monitoring cyber attacks we provide a brief overview of existing literature on cloud computing security. Then we generate some real cyber attacks that can be detected from performance data in a hypervisor and its guest operating systems. We employ modern machine learning techniques as the core of our model and accumulate a large database by considering the top threats. A variety of model performance measurement tools are applied to verify the model attack prediction capability. We observed that the Support Vector Machine technique from statistical machine learning theory is able to identify the top attacks with an accuracy of 97.13%. We have detected the activities using performance data (CPU, disk, network and memory performance) from the hypervisor and its guest operating systems, which can be generated by any cloud customer using built-in or third party software.

A kernel recursive least-squares- support vector machine is used to realized a mapping from state-action pair to Q-value function.

Simulation result of two-link robot manipulator show that the proposed method has high learning efficiency - better accuracy measured in terms of mean square error, and lesser computation time compare to the least-squares support vector machine. I. I NTRODUCTION Support vector machine (SVM), which is based on Vapnik's structural risk minimization (SRM) (1), has become one of the most popular methods in solving classification and regression problems. Conventional SVMs have properties of global optimization, and good adaptability. However, the optimal solutions are obtained by solving standard quadratic programming which results in high computational cost. In order to reduce the computational cost, a least square support vector (LS-SVM) was proposed in (2) by converting inequality constraints to linear equations. LS-SVM has been successfully applied to reinforcement learning (RL) problems (3). A RL problem is converted into a regression problem, wherein the observed states and actions are considered as inputs and Q-value functions as output. All the training samples may be support vectors in LS-SVM, and thus the support vectors are no longer sparse. It may lead to poor generalization. In addition, with the number of the input training pairs increasing, the number of equations will increase which may result in higher computational cost. Our focus in this paper is on reinforcement learning problems. The objective in hand is to explore the use of a support vector machine with sparse support vectors, low computational cost and satisfactory accuracy. The kernel recursive least-squares (KRLS) - SVM (4), is a strong candidate to achieve this objective. We develop a KRLS-SVM algorithm for reinforcement learning and demonstrate its potential through case study - two-link robot manipulator.

Such studies rarely explicitly evaluate potential conflicts with native species should the range of introduced species expand. Two snake species native to eastern North America, Nerodia fasciata and Nerodia sipedon, have been introduced to California where they represent a new stressor to declining native amphibians, fish, and reptiles. To project the potential distributions of these non-native watersnakes in western North America, we built ensemble SDMs using MaxEnt, Boosted Regression Trees, and Random Forests and habitat and climatic variables. We then compared the overlap between the projected distribution of invasive watersnakes and the distributions of imperiled native amphibians, fish, and reptiles that can serve as prey or competitors for the invaders, to estimate the risk to native species posed by non-native watersnakes. Large areas of western North America were projected to be climatically suitable for both species of Nerodia according to our ensemble SDMs, including much of central California. The potential distributions of both N. fasciata and N. sipedon overlap extensively with the federally threatened Giant Gartersnake, Thamnophis gigas, which inhabits a similar ecological niche. N. fasciata also poses risk to the federally threatened California Tiger Salamander, Ambystoma californiense, whereas N. sipedon poses risk to some amphibians of conservation concern, including the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog, Rana boylii. We conclude that non-native watersnakes in California can likely inhabit ranges of several native species of conservation concern that are expected to suffer as prey or competing species for these invaders. Action should be taken now to eradicate or control these invasions before detrimental impacts on native species are widespread. Our methods can be applied broadly to quantify the risk posed by incipient invasions to native biodiversity.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4070932", "pubmed_id": "24964204", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0100277", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2146662219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["205485713", "84750475", "205059118", "59356227", "1445506", "86503726", "85321502", "18640855", "11314484", "56357459", "84105595", "86134646", "20548371", "83479747", "53491032", "23888896", "43960845", "6928578", "85333048", "85747726", "126849894", "130681512", "13629426", "56066771", "85019796", "84339718", "5729038", "84371146", "11071184", "14545656", "7992104", "46046106", "29375694", "7955044", "89141", "10285111", "53348390", "86683487", "8667013", "22163380", "9417065", "86213325", "3626971", "14327012", "53609562", "84424608", "82267083", "15206363", "45754575", "84645867", "85256524", "84589252", "56408774", "7130036", "85342484", "26309203", "85693236", "84328187", "56455582", "26864034", "87874993", "27385585", "25086409"], "inbound_citations": ["20195615", "215223694", "86871733", "3804296", "15044362", "53381548", "198151566", "10214855"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2819256"}

To solve this problem, a phase space multi-scale principle manifold learning noise reduction method based on double tree complex wavelets was proposed. Firstly, the noisy signal was orthogonally decomposed into each scale band by the double-tree complex wavelet transform. Then according to the spatial distribution of signal and noise in each scale band, the wavelet coefficients in each scale were respectively identified by the phase space principle manifold learning algorithm, which could remove noise by projecting the scale coefficients from the high dimensional phase space to the intrinsic dimensional space projection.

Spinal cord segmentation plays a significant part in analyzing the neurological disease. In this paper here, an approach on the basis of the automatic spinal cord segmentation is proposed. This automatic technique presented performs the segmentation of the spinal cord with the help of MRI datasets. This new segmentation follows the interactive Random-Walk solvers (RW) along with Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm in order to be an entirely automatic flow pipeline. The initialization of the automatic segmentation pipeline is then done with a reliable voxel-wise classification employing features similar to Haar and supervised machine learning technique i.e. Probabilistic Boosting Tree (PBT) along with Support Vector Machine (SVM) so named as PBTSVM. Thereafter, the extraction of the refinement topology of the spinal cord is then done from the temporary segmentation and it is fine-tuned for the further next random-walk solver with ABC. The refined topology results in the spinal cord\u2019s boundary conditions from the MRI that permits the following random-walk solver with ABC for improving the segmentation result.

In this study, Back Propagation (BP) neural network Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods were applied to MPM in the Hatu region of Xinjiang, northwestern China.

Then, the processes of selecting samples and parameters were described. For the BP model, the parameters of the network were 9\u201310 \u2212 1; for the SVM model, a radial basis function was selected as the kernel function with best C = 1 and \u03b3 = 0.25. MPM models using these parameters were constructed, and threshold values of prediction results were determined by the concentration-area (C-A) method. Finally, prediction results from the BP neural network and SVM model were compared with that of a conventional method that is the weight- of- evidence (W- of- E). The prospectivity efficacy was evaluated by traditional statistical analysis, prediction-area (P-A) plots, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. Given the higher intersection position (74% of the known deposits were within 26% of the total area) and the larger AUC values (0.825), the result shows that the model built by the BP neural network algorithm has a relatively better prediction capability for MPM.

We used news articles captured from Google\u2019s GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) table at various timestamps as a medium to study the factors and events in society that lead to large scale unrest at both State and County levels in the United States of America. In being able to identify and predict social unrest at the county level, programs/applications can be deployed to counteract its adverse effects. This paper attempts to address this task of identifying, understanding, and predicting when social unrest might occur.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-96133-0_8", "venue": "MLDM", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2868496215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203152977", "214693662"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51604033"}

In order to resolve sample features at smaller length scales, however, a higher radiation dose is required. Therefore, the limitation on the achievable resolution is set primarily by noise at these length scales. We present TomoGAN, a denoising technique based on generative adversarial networks, for improving the quality of reconstructed images for low-dose imaging conditions. We evaluate our approach in two photon-budget-limited experimental conditions: (1) sufficient number of low-dose projections (based on Nyquist sampling), and (2) insufficient or limited number of high-dose projections. In both cases, the angular sampling is assumed to be isotropic, and the photon budget throughout the experiment is fixed based on the maximum allowable radiation dose on the sample. Evaluation with both simulated and experimental datasets shows that our approach can significantly reduce noise in reconstructed images, improving the structural similarity score of simulation and experimental data from 0.18 to 0.9 and from 0.18 to 0.41, respectively. Furthermore, the quality of the reconstructed images with filtered back projection followed by our denoising approach exceeds that of reconstructions with the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique, showing the computational superiority of our approach.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1902.07582", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32118926", "doi": "10.1364/JOSAA.375595", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2922185717,2998779578", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["86820543", "16506022", "10145792", "21342173", "666956", "16783211", "23524562", "5123366", "4417820", "16283808", "3964805", "56486500", "3289047", "3074096", "207763512", "5808102", "6844431", "206594692", "211227", "6200260", "12209503", "3283965", "2286534", "207761262", "8296673", "6561660", "206885392", "49671009", "3719281", "10894094", "206593506", "14124313", "69258212", "126394036", "20587279", "17267081", "12210411", "6287870", "588535", "22849249", "214924390", "30525281", "13227362", "7006182", "6789015"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67769522"}

While there exists a large body of literature on the embeddability of canonical graphs, such as lattices or trees, the heterogeneity of the relational data typically encountered in practice limits the applicability of these classical methods. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial approach to evaluating embeddability, i.e., to decide whether a data set is best represented in Euclidean, Hyperbolic or Spherical space. Our method analyzes nearest-neighbor structures and local neighborhood growth rates to identify the geometric priors of suitable embedding spaces. For canonical graphs, the algorithm's prediction provably matches classical results. As for large, heterogeneous graphs, we introduce an efficiently computable statistic that approximates the algorithm's decision rule.

The parameter selection of SVMs must be done before solving the QP Quadratic Programming problem. The PSO Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is applied in the course of SVM parameter selection. Due to the sensitivity and frequency of the initial value of the chaotic motion, the PSO algorithm is also applied to improve the particle swarm optimization, so as to improve the global search ability of the particles.

Traditional computational models like CAMB that are used for generating CMB temperature anisotropy maps are extremely resource intensive and act as a bottleneck in cosmology experiments that require a large amount of CMB data for analysis. In this paper, we present a new approach to the generation of CMB temperature maps using a specific class of neural networks called Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We train our deep generative model to learn the complex distribution of CMB maps and efficiently generate new sets of CMB data in the form of 2D patches of anisotropy maps without losing much accuracy. We limit our experiment to the generation of 56$^{\\circ}$ and 112$^{\\circ}$ square patches of CMB maps. We have also trained a Multilayer perceptron model for estimation of baryon density from a CMB map, we will be using this model for the performance evaluation of our generative model using diagnostic measures like Histogram of pixel intensities, the standard deviation of pixel intensity distribution, Power Spectrum, Cross power spectrum, Correlation matrix of the power spectrum and Peak count. We show that the GAN model is able to efficiently generate CMB samples of multiple sizes and is sensitive to the cosmological parameters corresponding to the underlying distribution of the data. The primiary advantage of this method is the exponential reduction in the computational time needed to generate the CMB data, the GAN model is able to generate the samples within seconds as opposed to hours required by the CAMB package with an acceptable value to error and loss of information. We hope that future iterations of this methodology will replace traditional statistical methods of CMB data generation and help in large scale cosmological experiments.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.04682", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2968330758", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["118384146", "30368873", "14913885", "207763512", "3475375", "9302801", "11758569", "10894094"], "inbound_citations": ["215548969", "211132837"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199552192"}

To improve the anti-noise ability and detect incipient fault, a novel fault detection method based on a short-time matching method and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed. In this paper, the mechanism of roller bearing is discussed and the impact time frequency dictionary is constructed targeting the multi-component characteristics and fault feature of roller bearing fault vibration signals. Then, a short-time matching method is described and the simulation results show the excellent feature extraction effects in extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Predicting and mapping understory is a critical need for forest management and conservation planning, but it has proved difficult with available methods to date. LiDAR has the potential to generate remotely sensed forest understory structure data, but this potential has yet to be fully validated. Our objective was to examine the capacity of LiDAR point cloud data to predict forest understory cover. We modeled ground-based observations of understory structure in three vertical strata (0.5 m to < 1.5 m, 1.5 m to < 2.5 m, 2.5 m to < 3.5 m) as a function of a variety of LiDAR metrics using both mixed-effects and Random Forest models. We compared four understory LiDAR metrics designed to control for the spatial heterogeneity of sampling density. The four metrics were highly correlated and they all produced high values of variance explained in mixed-effects models. The top-ranked model used a voxel-based understory metric along with vertical stratum (Akaike weight = 1, explained variance = 87%, cross-validation error = 15.6%). We found evidence of occlusion of LiDAR pulses in the lowest stratum but no evidence that the occlusion influenced the predictability of understory structure. The Random Forest model results were consistent with those of the mixed-effects models, in that all four understory LiDAR metrics were identified as important, along with vertical stratum. The Random Forest model explained 74.4% of the variance, but had a lower cross-validation error of 12.9%. We conclude that the best approach to predict understory structure is using the mixed-effects model with the voxel-based understory LiDAR metric along with vertical stratum, because it yielded the highest explained variance with the fewest number of variables. However, results show that other understory LiDAR metrics (fractional cover, normalized cover and leaf area density) would still be effective in mixed-effects and Random Forest modelling approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6881062", "pubmed_id": "31774813", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0220096", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2991577183", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["85081647", "83843748", "86456071", "52083444", "54932163", "59395723", "54017578", "92489937", "33832665", "86511668", "797940", "129048928", "84306555", "15763020", "86287800", "52085815", "129791512", "17820750", "140657176", "134293982", "3626971", "89856408", "131328838", "16036351", "120911987", "129306281", "73685665", "87057897", "140563727", "14657265", "62229412", "122266405", "88518170", "85675072", "13137512", "21196012", "73685665", "14460926", "82206879", "85089652", "4599193", "54801038", "55973514", "87609085", "128542144", "128494151", "17793954", "88595756"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208337098"}

This increases system efficiency but may badly affect the accuracy. To balance this tradeoff, we use asymmetric support vector machines (ASVM) that are more accurate Though it is expensive, we implement the layered approach to improve overall system performance. ASVM is an asymmetric extension of a support vector machine (SVM). The main aim is to reduce the false positive rate while detecting the attacks.

Spatial-temporal information of heart valves are extracted by microphone array recording and recursively sound source localization with high resolution.

Passive stereo is a simple solution for capturing dynamic scenes at underwater environment, however the shape with textureless surfaces or irregular reflections cannot be recovered. Recently, the stereo camera pair with a pattern projector for adding artificial textures on the objects is proposed. However, to use the system for underwater environment, several problems should be compensated, i.e., disturbance by fluctuation and bubbles. Simple solution is to use convolutional neural network for stereo to cancel the effects of bubbles and/or water fluctuation. Since it is not easy to train CNN with small size of database with large variation, we develop a special bubble generation device to efficiently create real bubble database of multiple size and density.

In this work, we focus on the exploitation of the discriminative information from different views, and propose an end-to-end method to learn semantic-preserving and discriminative binary representation, dubbed Discriminative Cross-View Hashing (DCVH), in light of learning multitasking binary representation for various tasks including cross-view retrieval, image-to-image retrieval, and image annotation/tagging. The proposed DCVH has the following key components. First, it uses convolutional neural network (CNN) based nonlinear hashing functions and multilabel classification for both images and texts simultaneously. Such hashing functions achieve effective continuous relaxation during training without explicit quantization loss by using Direct Binary Embedding (DBE) layers. Second, we propose an effective view alignment via Hamming distance minimization, which is efficiently accomplished by bit-wise XOR operation.

Secondly, 200 vehicle\u2019s test results are used as training samples, with sensitive features and fuel consumption of type approve test as the input parameters, and the actual vehicle fuel consumption as output parameters. Then, a vehicle fuel consumption prediction model, which is based on least squares support vector machine, is established.

To obtain automatic features, we experiment with multiple CNN architectures, pre-trained models and training procedures, e.g. Dense-Sparse-Dense. After fusing the two types of features, we employ a local learning framework to predict the class label for each test image. The local learning framework is based on three steps. First, a k-nearest neighbors model is applied in order to select the nearest training samples for an input test image. Second, a one-versus-all Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is trained on the selected training samples. Finally, the SVM classifier is used to predict the class label only for the test image it was trained for. Although we have used local learning in combination with handcrafted features in our previous work, to the best of our knowledge, local learning has never been employed in combination with deep features. The experiments on the 2013 Facial Expression Recognition (FER) Challenge data set, the FER+ data set and the AffectNet data set demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.

However, the capability of these models to simulate thermodynamically driven warm-season rainfall events, such as afternoon airmass thunderstorm formation in subtropical summers, is highly limited. Current methods of addressing this issue have included ensemble numerical weather prediction simulations, where an ensemble mean of multiple simulations with varied model physics is used as an improved prediction over any individual ensemble member. These approaches still yield only modest skill primarily due to inherent biases in each ensemble member. As such, the current research will utilize machine learning to combine logically ensemble members into a single prediction of warm-season rainfall. In particular, a support vector machine classification scheme that employs members of a 30 member ensemble as predictors and observed rainfall patterns as a predictand will be formulated on multiple warm-season rainfall days in an effort to develop an improved prognosis of warm-season rainfall that can be implemented in operational meteorology forecasts.

Firstly, EEG signals were filtered with FIR bandpass filter 8-30HZ. Secondly, relative frequency band signals (i.e. \u03bc and \u03b2 rhythm) were decomposed into independent components to obtain the solution matrix by ICA, and the EEG signals were reconstructed by the main components for improving the signal-to-noise ratio. In order to capture the essential structure of the data, OVR-CSP was used to extract the feature of EEG signals and reduce data dimensions. Finally, using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the feature.

A new feature extraction scheme in wavelet transform is presented in this paper. It is based on the adaptation of Zipf\u2019s law to wavelet transform to extract new features obtained from the statistical distributions of wavelet pattern subbands that are represented by a graphical representation called a curve of Zipf. The originality of this work can be shown through two perspectives: the adaptation of Zipf\u2019s law to wavelet subbands, which involves the determination of the pattern size used to count the frequency of pattern appearance, and an encoding model, which makes the distribution of pattern frequencies more significant. Moreover, this novel scheme proposes a new feature set extracted from the curve of Zipf of the wavelet subband coefficients, which is the first such attempt in DWT and the field of steganalysis. A Random Forest classifier (RF) is then used to model the resulting features.

One of the important is human age, but accurately extracting human age from his face is not easy. Facial aging process is different on early growth (child to adult) and adult aging (adult to senior). On early growth and development of the face, from birth to adulthood, the greatest change is the shape change. But on adult aging the most significant change is on the skin (textural change), the shape change still continue but much less dramatic compared to early growth. In our research we develop a two stage facial age classification system to classify human age into age classes. This paper is the first part of our two stage facial age classification. In this paper we develop facial age classification system for the early growth stage, we classify human age into six classes which are 0-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-10, 11-16, and 17+. Because the early growth have grater impact on shape change, we only use geometrical feature to classify the human face. We use Haar-like cascade to perform the face detection and then we use Active Shape Model to extract the geometrical features on human face. For the classifier we use Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. This system is developed with OpenCV library and C++ language. The results of classification based on geometrical features achieved an accuracy rate of 71.25% using FG-NET dataset. \u00a9 2015 Published by ISICO and/or peer-review under responsibility of Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2197043007", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15044843", "10018418", "8340106", "64392665", "11867827", "8793137", "42281583", "117867321", "2715202", "30192655", "123525290", "15384064"], "inbound_citations": ["6111278"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62346055"}

Distinguishing those responses is important for understanding side effects of drugs and for elucidating molecular mechanisms of toxic chemicals.ResultsWe explored this problem by exposing cells to the environmental contaminant benzo-[a]-pyrene (B[a]P). B[a]P exposure activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and causes toxic stress resulting in transcriptional changes that are not regulated through Ahr. We sought to distinguish these two types of responses based on a time course of expression changes measured after B[a]P exposure. Using Random Forest machine learning we classified 81 primary Ahr responders and 1,308 genes regulated as side effects. Subsequent weighted clustering gave further insight into the connection between expression pattern, mode of regulation, and biological function. Finally, the accuracy of the predictions was supported through extensive experimental validation.ConclusionUsing a combination of machine learning followed by extensive experimental validation, we have further expanded the known catalog of genes regulated by the environmentally sensitive transcription factor Ahr.

However, existing methods largely assume that KGs are complete when transferring knowledge from them, which may lead to suboptimal performance for those KGs, can be hardly complete in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we present a robustly co-learning model (RCoLM) that takes the incompleteness nature of KGs into consideration when incorporating them into recommendation. The RCoLM aims at transferring knowledge between recommendation task and knowledge graph completion (KG completion) task by utilizing a transfer learning model. An earlier version of this paper appeared in KDD 2019. This version is an extension of the previous submission and two major innovations are presented here. At first, distinct from previous knowledge-aware recommendation methods, which mainly focus on transferring knowledge from KGs to item recommendations, the RCoLM attempts to exploit user-item interactions from recommendations for KG completion, and unifies the two tasks in a joint model for mutual enhancements. Second, the RCoLM provides a general task-oriented negative sampling strategy on KG completion task, which further improves the adaptive ability of the proposed algorithm and plays an essential role for obtaining superior performance in various sub-tasks of the KG completion. The extensive experiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate that RCoLM outperforms not only state-of-the-art knowledge-aware recommendation methods but also existing KG completion methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932466", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2964737815", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19135805", "6401679", "363954", "53285250", "1849689", "10211220", "11884399", "10499585", "13870086", "196204964", "207206865", "20401422", "4889971", "7062707", "3766110", "207209998", "3335889", "28369494", "53079158", "3081080", "1969092", "207167677", "4557963", "15027084", "2949428", "11202498", "6348464", "2768038", "6071257", "15150247", "9095914", "638838", "10537313", "207170378", "3346047", "1637394", "16572331", "16160185"], "inbound_citations": ["211677665", "210693238"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201142785"}

By reporting our preliminary results and open-sourcing our implementation, we hope to accelerate future research on the training of GANs.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2004.03335", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3015366916", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2057420", "52889459", "6755881", "1033682", "10894094", "326772", "3568073", "211022860", "209202273", "153312609", "206771128", "2349418", "3366315", "8424807", "1099052", "19119291", "1563370", "1687220", "13803015", "4357800", "46898260"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:215238500"}

Many researchers have worked on permeability measurement methods, but there is no universal method yet which can predict permeability in the whole field and in all intervals of the wells. So artificial intelligence methods have been used to predict permeability by using well log data in all field areas. In this research, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Support Vector Machine techniques have been employed to predict permeability of Mesaverde tight gas sandstones located in Washakie basin in USA. Multilayer Perceptrons are the most used neural networks in regression tasks. Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System is a method which combines fuzzy model and neural network in a manner to produce accurate results. Support Vector Machine is a relatively new intelligence method with great capabilities in regression and classification tasks. Each method has advantages and disadvantage and here their capability in predicting permeability has been evaluated. In this study, data from three wells were used and two different dataset patterns were constructed to evaluate performances of the models in predicting permeability by using either previously seen data or unseen data. The most important aspect of this research is investigation of capability of these methods to generalize the training patterns to previously unseen data. Results showed that all methods have acceptable performance in predicting permeability but Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Support Vector Machine performs so better than Multilayer Perceptron and predict permeability more accurate.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jngse.2014.09.037", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2048820530", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["62593245", "159505", "39804674", "110492845", "29814499", "108584222", "110233322", "31556307", "17958705", "97831532", "40912496", "95666766", "109280006", "52874011", "42974822", "63229305", "18280772", "20134355", "2757547", "62209591", "39909028", "95418136", "110510062", "110702216", "209396626", "110673600", "7815250", "134837091", "5191646", "128753511", "144124486", "121543383", "128899719", "62568231", "121969169", "119813750", "110062838", "117643475", "59834983", "127532932", "62554656", "119554375"], "inbound_citations": ["54570408", "202706535", "125920030", "11042477", "134569380", "211010318", "204330095", "3869538", "133706484", "27527246", "1810777"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110872990"}

In order to identify the genuine mental state of a crew member, it is reasonable to engage the acoustic characteristics obtained from speech signals presenting voice commands during th e spacecraft control and in terpersonal communicatio n. Human emotion reco gnition implies flexible algorithmic techniques satisfying the requirements of reliability and fast operation in real time.

The usage of this procedure leads to a reduction of the feature space dimension by a factor of two (from 384 to approximately 180 attrib-utes), which means decreasing the time resources spent by the recognition algorithm. Moreover, it is proposed to im-plement some algorithmic schemes based on collective decisi on making by the set of classifiers (Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Linear Logistic Regression) that permits the improvement of the recognition quality (by up to 10% relative improvement). The developed algorithmic schemes provide a g uaranteed level of effectiveness and might be used as a reliable alternative to the random choice of a classification model. Due to the robustness property the heu-ristic feature selection procedure is successfully applied on the data pre-processing stage, and then the approaches realizing the collective decisi on making schemes are used. Keywords: emotion recognition, adaptive multi-objective genetic algorithm, classifier, collective decision making. ?@GU? IH>OH>U D J:KIHAG:<:GBX WFHPBC IH J?QB D .

To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that uses a single-frame representation for actions based on appearance and motion information.

The thus obtained descriptors are efficiently represented by the coefficients of a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Actions are classified using an one-vs-all Support Vector Machine.

Both, the optical flow as well as the HOGs, can be computed very efficiently.

Existing travel time estimation approaches generally cover empirical ones, statistical ones and hybrid ones. Despite strong tractability, the empirical approaches cannot sufficiently capture diverse travel time distributions (TTDs) and often encounter some issues (e.g., assumption of a predefined distribution, failure of significance tests). Statistical and hybrid methods possess better generalization in estimating heterogeneous TTDs, but fail to model the network-wide spatiotemporal correlations, which have been found useful in the TTD estimation. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a deep learning based Trip Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (T-InfoGAN). In this method, the trip TTD is estimated by modeling the joint distribution of travel times of two successive links with the consideration of network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. Meanwhile, a dynamic clustering with Wasserstein distance (DCWD) algorithm is used to explore the traffic state transitions for link pairs and cluster the link pairs with similar TTDs into one group, which benefits the training and estimation processes of T-InfoGAN. Then, based on GPS trajectory data from Didi Chuxing in Chengdu city, China, numerical results show that the T-InfoGAN with DCWD can well estimate three mini trip TTDs with various features, and performs better than three other counterparts (i.e., Convolution method, MC-Grid method, and MC-GMMS method) in estimating the TTDs of two longer trips. In summary, this study is the first successful try to estimate trip TTDs within the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and the deep learning based T-InfoGAN is a promising approach to estimate heterogeneous trip TTDs with the better generalization and flexibility in the big data era.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.019", "venue": null, "journal": "Transportation Research Part C-emerging Technologies", "mag_id": "2978273467", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211684840", "211120284", "210930368", "211298550"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208831426"}

In the battle of fighting spam, various detection methods have been designed, which work by automating the detection process using the \"features\" concept combined with machine learning methods. However, the existing features are not effective enough to adapt spammers' tactics due to the ease of manipulation in the features.

The new design of features is divided between robust advanced statistical features incorporating explicitly the time attribute, and behavioral features identifying any posting behavior pattern. The experimental results show that the new form of features is able to classify correctly the majority of spammers with an accuracy higher than 93% when using Random Forest learning algorithm, applied on a collected and annotated data-set.

However, they were just used as a preprocessing step, transforming data into a higher dimensional feature space, or were limited to just consider two feature dimensions. In contrast, we integrate order statistics into the Random Forest framework, and thus avoid explicit mapping onto higher dimensional spaces. In this way, we can also exploit more than two feature dimensions, resulting in increased discriminative power.

More recent work in the field has indicated that other parameters might be equally or more important than similarity. Here we make use of two additional parameters: the variation of prediction among random forest trees (less variation among trees indicates more accurate prediction) and the prediction itself (certain ranges of activity are intrinsically easier to predict than others). The accuracy of prediction for a QSAR model, as measured by the root-mean-square error, can be estimated by cross-validation on the training set at the time of model-building and stored as a three-dimensional array of bins. This is an obvious extension of the one-dimensional array of bins we previously proposed for similarity to the training set [Sheridan et al. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.2004, 44, 1912-1928].

Initially it was expected that a universal recognition code describing the amino acid to base pair contacts would be able to describe protein-DNA complex formation. However, until this very day a universal recognition code has not yet been found and alternative methods became more important. Nowadays, methods that describe the specificity of only one transcription factor (or a small family of transcription factors) are used most often. These methods make use of a set of experimentally validated binding sites to construct a profile for each transcription factor. One of the oldest profile-based methods is the consensus sequence method. Consensus sequences consist of a simple text string in which each character of the string represents the most prevalent nucleotide in the corresponding position of DNA binding sites. As an extension to these consensus sequences, in 1982, Gary Stormo introduced the well-known and very popular positional weight matrix (PWM). These PWMs consist of a 4xL matrix, with L being the length of the binding sites. In each row of these matrices, the frequency of occurrence of one of the four nucleotides is given for a certain position in the binding sites. Even though these PWMs are a big improvement to the consensus sequences method, they also lead to many false positive predictions. Many alternative methods try to improve the accuracy of these PWMs, most of them with very limited success. In this thesis I will discuss the shortcomings of the previous generation of prediction methods and I will suggest new methods that overcome some of these shortcomings. ::: The first method that will be discussed in this thesis makes use of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to visualize evolutionary conserved transcription factor binding sites that are predicted with the PWM method. Binding sites that are conserved across all species in these alignments have a higher likelihood to be functional. Mutation of these binding sites would result in a less fit species, therefore mutations in these binding sites would have a negative effect. By inspecting these multiple sequence alignments for putative PWM hits we can reduce a large number of false positive predictions as false positive hits are less likely to be conserved. ::: A second contribution of this thesis to the improvement of prediction methods is the research on and development of a number of new methods that make use of the structure and the biophysical characteristics of protein-DNA complexes. These characteristics are often overlooked in the previous generation of prediction methods even though they are very important for binding specificity in many protein-DNA complexes. With the help of the Random Forest classification method and sequence-based structural and biophysical characteristics we managed to develop models that can predict transcription factor binding sites with a higher level of accuracy. Based on this method, we also developed a user-friendly web-tool that can make use of a large number of pre-calculated transcription factor models.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2321121105", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:87542125"}

A new approach for fault diagnosis within the power system network, based upon Convolutional Adversarial Neural Networks (CANNs), is presented within this paper. The discussed approach vector combines the properties of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for a hybridized architectural approach.

In addition, inter-object relations are mostly modeled in a symmetric way, which we argue is not an optimal setting. To tackle those difficulties, in this paper, we propose a deep continuous conditional random field (DCCRF) for solving the online MOT problem in a track-by-detection framework. The DCCRF consists of unary and pairwise terms. The unary terms estimate tracked objects\u2019 displacements across time based on visual appearance information. They are modeled as deep convolution neural networks, which are able to learn discriminative visual features for tracklet association. The asymmetric pairwise terms model inter-object relations in an asymmetric way, which encourages high-confidence tracklets to help correct errors of low-confidence tracklets and not to be affected by low-confidence ones much. The DCCRF is trained in an end-to-end manner for better adapting the influences of visual information as well as inter-object relations.

However, when the data is in high dimensions, it is necessary to perform feature selection in the multi-view data classification process. In this paper, we proposed a Multi-view Support Vector Machine Classification with Feature Selection (MSVMCFS) algorithm, which can not only classify multi-view data, but also select features for each view data in the process of classification.

Previous searches have relied on empirically designed statistics incorporating signal-to-noise ratio and signal-based vetoes to separate gravitational wave candidates from noise candidates.

Acoustic Emission (AE) is a passive structural health monitoring technique based on the stress wave generated due to cracking in a structure. A framework has been designed in this study for automated probabilistic classification of the cracks in cementitious components based on the AE signals. With this approach, unlabeled hand designed waveform parameters, i.e. RA values (RA) and Average frequency (AF) are clustered using density dictated unsupervised clustering algorithm. Intersecting clusters in the data were then separated through a hyperplane created using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Based on physical insight obtained from labeled data, unlabeled data was classified into events corresponding to different cracking modes. The framework was applied to the analysis of AE data from Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) beam under bending and Strain Hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC) samples under direct tension. The cracking modes obtained from the proposed machine learning approach are found to be in good agreement with expectations based on composite theory.

{"paper_id": "125967489", "title": "Using rough set theory to improve content based image retrieval system", "authors": [{"first": "Maryam", "middle": ["Shahabi"], "last": "Lotfabadi", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Each image in a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system is represented by its features such as colour, texture and shape. These three groups of features are stored in the feature vector. Therefore, each image managed by the CBIR system is associated with one or more feature vectors. As a result, the storage space required for feature vectors is proportional to the amount of images in the database. In addition, when comparing the similarities among images, the CBIR needs to compare these feature vectors. Nonetheless, researchers are still facing problems when working with a huge image database. Much time is needed when comparing huge feature vectors, as a large amount of memory is required to run the CBIR system. Due to this problem, feature reduction and selection techniques are employed to alleviate the storage and time requirements of large feature vectors. There are many feature reduction techniques, including linear projection techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) and metric embedding techniques (both linear and non-linear). However, these methods have limitations in the CBIR system and cannot improve CBIR performance (retrieval accuracy) and reduce semantic gap efficiently. Therefore, we need a feature selection method that can deal with image features efficiently and has the ability to deal with uncertainties. ::: ::: This research proposes an improved approach to select significant features from the huge image feature vector. The concept behind this research is that it is possible to extract image feature relational patterns in an image feature vector database. After which, these relational patterns are used to generate rules and improve the retrieval results for a CBIR system. In addition, this research proposes a CBIR system utilising the Rough Set instead of deterministic and crisp methods. In this research, Rough Set rules are evaluated with noisy images. Also, in order to have a more accurate classifier in the CBIR system, the classifier is proposed to be based on the Rough Set and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in this research. ::: ::: The significance of this research is firstly, proposing an improved pre-processing phase to solve CBIR problems. Secondly, proposing an integrated framework of using Rough Set with one-versus-one (1-v-1) Support Vector Machine and Rough Set with one-versus-all (1-v-r) Support Vector Machine classifiers in CBIR systems. The Rough Set theory, as a feature selection method in this pre-processing phase, could solve huge amounts of image features problems by narrowing the search space. Also, this theory could deal with vague and incomplete areas by its upper and lower approximations and solve the incomplete and vague areas in image descriptions. As such, the accuracy of the CBIR system can be improved. This proposed approach also gives the confidence and deviation of the estimation (that traditional methods cannot provide before) when compared with historical systems. Finally, the semantic gap problem can be reduced by the Fuzzy Rough Set semantic rules. ::: ::: The performance of the proposed CBIR system is assessed using 2000 images from the Corel image dataset. The images were divided into 10 semantic groups, as well as a number of features. They were then compared to other techniques such as Gain Ratio, Genetic Algorithm, Information Gain, Isomap, Kernel PCA, OneR, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Relief-F. The results from the experiment conducted in this thesis show that the proposed feature selections and classifiers will improve the semantic performance results in the proposed CBIR systems. Retrieval accuracy results for Fuzzy Rough feature selection is 91.06% for Normal images, and the results are 90.31%, 91.28% and 90.42% with Gaussian Noise, Salt & Pepper Noise and Poisson Noise respectively. ::: ::: Moreover, comparing the Rough Set with 1-v-1 SVM and the Rough Set with 1-v-r SVM classifiers to other classifiers (Decision Tree (C5.0), K-nearest neighbour, neural network, and Support Vector Machine) show that the retrieval accuracy has increased to 91.4% for Rough Set 1-v-r SVM and 92% for Rough Set 1-v-1 SVM.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2542386438", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125967489"}

Using speaker dependent classifiers with prior speaker identification step was proposed. Emotion recognition is done using global acoustic features of the speech. Six speech signal parameters are computed with the specialised software. The feature extraction is based on calculation of global statistics of those parameters and their derivatives. Correlation based feature selection algorithms are used for reducing feature vector length. For the evaluation of the system three classifiers were used: Bayes Network, Radial Basis Function Network and Support Vector Machine. Six emotions could be recognised by the system. Several experiments were carried out: emotion recognition of the speaker not known to the system, speaker independent recognition of the known speakers, gender dependent classification as well as speaker dependent recognition with prior identification. The results of identification-driven speech emotion recognition show significant improvement compared to the performance of the speaker independent system based on previous research. The use of the tailored speaker dependent recognition system led to increase in the Bayes Network classification accuracy from 74% to 96%, in the Support Vector Machine classification accuracy from 64% to 96% and in the Radial Basis Function Network classification accuracy from 67% to 88%.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MMAR.2014.6957480", "venue": "2014 19th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)", "journal": "2014 19th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1982497469", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60622700", "60883381", "2689994", "10883411", "12861233", "1117485", "141390676", "1436872", "820989", "60594797", "13861754", "2373348", "60875502", "122448736", "59776165"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1202008"}

One of the challenging problems in spectral mixture analysis is how to model the data of a primary class. Given that the within-class spectral variability (WSV) is inevitable, it is more realistic to associate a group of representative spectra with a pure class. The unmixing method using the extended support vector machines (eSVMs) has handled this problem effectively. However, it has simplified WSV in the mixed cases. In this paper, a further development of eSVMs is presented to address two problems in multiple-endmember spectral mixture analysis: 1) one mixed pixel may be unmixed into different fractions (model overlap); and 2) one fraction may correspond to a group of mixed pixels (fraction overlap). Then, spectral unmixing resolution (SUR) is introduced to characterize how finely the mixture in a mixed pixel can be quantified. The quantitative relationship between SUR and WSV of endmembers is derived via a geometry analysis in support vector machine feature space. Thus, the possible SUR can be estimated when multiple endmembers for each class are given. Moreover, if the requirement of SUR is fixed, the acceptance level of WSV is then limited, which can be used as a guide to remove outliers and purify endmembers for each primary class. Experiments are presented to illustrate model and fraction overlap problems and the application of SUR in uncertainty analysis of spectral unmixing.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2015.2415587", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2039039627", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["137888315", "128430364", "122790509", "17744768", "140591692", "64222754", "1882932", "129835282", "26466868", "140179109", "17918708", "130051971", "41473579", "53641141", "128762103", "28471748", "83868499", "16520624", "27361437", "16576201", "26513325", "52874011", "59076046", "1507025", "45520004", "15815582"], "inbound_citations": ["20850283", "204939877", "211146414", "210970814", "65489615", "61153524", "210838661", "203071471", "207897460", "5694099", "53233450", "53292629"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20457801"}

In real life, many people are members of several social networks in the same time. Constrained by the features and design of each, any single social platform offers only a partial view of a user from a particular perspective. In this paper, we propose MV-URL, a multi-view user representation learning model to enhance user modeling by integrating the knowledge from various networks. Different from the traditional network embedding frameworks where either the whole framework is single-network based or each network involved is a homogeneous network, we focus on multiple social networks and each network in our task is a heterogeneous network. It's very challenging to effectively fuse knowledge in this setting as the fusion depends upon not only the varying relatedness of information sources, but also the target application tasks. MV-URL focuses on two tasks: user account linkage (i.e., to predict the missing true user account linkage across social media) and user attribute prediction. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on two real-world collections of linked social networks, and the experimental results show the superiority of MV-URL compared with existing state-of-art embedding methods.

The proposed technique first detects an initial set of candidates using a Gaussian Matched filter and then classifies the initial set of candidates in order to reduce the number of false positives. A Random Forest ensemble classifier using a set of 79 features (the most common features used within literature) was used for classification.

In addition, the Random Forest is capable of ranking features according to their importance. We have ranked the 79 features according to their importance.

Despite their empirical success as well as a bevy of recent work investigating their statistical properties, a full and satisfying explanation for their success has yet to be put forth. Here we aim to take a step forward in this direction by demonstrating that the additional randomness injected into individual trees serves as a form of implicit regularization, making random forests an ideal model in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings.

First, most part-based models rely on a few pre-specified object parts. However, the optimal object parts for recognition often vary from category to category. Second, acquiring training data with part-level annotation is labor-intensive. Third, modeling spatial relationships between parts in CNNs often involves an exhaustive search of part templates over multiple network streams. We tackle the three issues by introducing a new network layer, called co-occurrence layer. It can extend a convolutional layer to encode the co-occurrence between the visual parts detected by the numerous neurons, instead of a few pre-specified parts. To this end, the feature maps serve as both filters and images, and mutual correlation filtering is conducted between them. The co-occurrence layer is end-to-end trainable. The resultant co-occurrence features are rotation-and translation-invariant, and are robust to object deformation. By applying this new layer to the VGG-16 and ResNet-152, we achieve the recognition rates of 83.6% and 85.8% on the Caltech-UCSD bird benchmark, respectively.

We therefore introduce a metric on joint intensity to mitigate the large intrasubject differences as well as leverage the subtle intersubject differences.

Post-thaw viability is critical to establishing microalgal cultures, and there is a critical need to effectively and rapidly evaluate microalgal viability after the post-thawing process. In the present study, we developed a rapid assay based on the change of fluorescence ratio to determine microalgal viability post-thaw. It was shown that the assessment of microalgal viability by the fluorescence ratio method correlated well with that of the FDA-staining (R2 = 0.978) and regrowth method (R2 = 0.976), demonstrating that the present method could be applied in the high-throughput detection of viability of microalgal strains. Subsequent to establishing this method, we aimed to find out optimal cryopreservation protocol for each strain from a group of 125 microalgal strains. The viability of these strains under different treatments was quickly evaluated by the fluorescence ratio method. Of these strains, 95 attained post-thaw viability over 60%. DMSO was a suitable cryoprotectant for most strains at a concentration \u226410%. Based on the dataset, the relative contribution of 3 variables-genus, cryoprotectants and concentration to post-viability was analyzed with the Random Forest (RF) classification method. All variables together could explain 97.8% of the viability, and type and concentration of cryoprotectant could explain 59.1% in Chlorophyta.

Usually, transmission that are carried out on mobile radio channel are selective in time and frequency. To overcome the channel selectivity and allow high transmission data rate, new approaches for synchronization, equalization and channel ::: estimation are needed. ::: The use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) has shown several advantages in re-gression, prediction and estimation over some of the classical approaches due to its improved generalization capabilities. Moreover, the introduction of complex algebra in the SVM formulation can provide us with a more natural and flexible framework when ::: dealing with complex symbols and constellations. ::: The current thesis work focuses on the study and development of efficient channel estimation algorithms based on complex Support Vector Machines Regression (SVR) that are specifically adapted to pilot-aided OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Mul-tiplexing) structure and applied to Long Term Evolution (LTE) downlink system. The mathematical model of the LTE mobile radio channel is described and simulated for various scenarios based on 3GPP specifications. According to this model, a nonlinear complex SVR is proposed for SISO-OFDM system. The principle of the proposed kernel-based learning algorithm is to exploit the information provided by the reference signals to estimate the channel frequency response. The proposed approach is based on two separate phases: learning phase and estimation phase. In learning phase, we estimate first the subchannels pilot symbols and in estimation phase, frequency responses of data subchannels are determined by means of SVM interpolation mechanism. In addition, a nonlinear complex Multiple Support Vector Machines Regression (M-SVR) algorithm adapted to MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) architecture is proposed to esti-mate the multipath fading channel in MIMO-OFDM system with both STBC (Space Time Bloc Coding) and V-BLAST (Vertical Bell Laboratories layered Space Time) schemes. ::: The feasibility of our approaches is confirmed by computer simulation results achieved for LTE downlink model.

SIDER is one of the most reliable and frequently used datasets for identification of key features as well as building machine learning models for side effects prediction. The inherently unbalanced nature of this data presents with a difficult multi-label multi-class problem towards prediction of drug side effects. We highlight the intrinsic issue with SIDER data and methodological flaws in relying on performance measures such as AUC while attempting to predict side effects.We argue for the use of metrics that are robust to class imbalance for evaluation of classifiers. Importantly, we present a 'hierarchical anatomical classification schema' which aggregates side effects into organs, sub-systems, and systems. With the help of a weighted performance measure, using 5-fold cross-validation we show that this strategy facilitates biologically meaningful side effects prediction at different levels of anatomical hierarchy.

Identification of molecular markers that are related to different types of cancers might lead to discovery of drugs that are patient and disease specific. This study aims to use microarray gene expression cancer data to identify biomarkers that are indicative of different types of cancers. Our aim is to provide a multi-class cancer classifier that can simultaneously differentiate between cancers and identify type-specific biomarkers, through the application of the Binary Coded Genetic Algorithm (BCGA) and a neural network based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: BCGA and ELM are combined and used to select a subset of genes that are present in the Global Cancer Mapping (GCM) data set. This set of candidate genes contains over 52 biomarkers that are related to multiple cancers, according to the literature. They include APOA1, VEGFC, YWHAZ, B2M, EIF2S1, CCR9 and many other genes that have been associated with the hallmarks of cancer. BCGA-ELM is tested on several cancer data sets and the results are compared to other classification methods. BCGA-ELM compares or exceeds other algorithms in terms of accuracy. We were also able to show that over 50% of genes selected by BCGA-ELM on GCM data are cancer related biomarkers. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: We were able to simultaneously differentiate between 14 different types of cancers, using only 92 genes, to achieve a multi-class classification accuracy of 95.4% which is between 21.6% and 38% higher than other results in the literature for multi-class cancer classification.

However, due to the noisy images from pavement surfaces, limited success was accomplished. One major issue with pure video based systems is their inability to discriminate dark areas not caused by pavement distress, such as, tire marks, oil spills, shadows, and recent fillings. To overcome the limitation of the conventional imaging based methods, a probabilistic relaxation technique based on 3-dimensional (3D) information is proposed in this report. The primary goal of this technique is to integrate conventional image processing techniques with stereovision technology to obtain an accurate topological structure of the road defects. In addition, a road scene often contains other objects such as grass, trees and buildings which should be separated from the pavement. Therefore the earlier algorithm has been enhanced to extract the pavement region from a road scene using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Various types of cracks are then obtained from the pavement surface images and classified using a feed-forward neural network. The proposed algorithms are implemented in MATLAB and the results are presented. The second half of the document includes a report detailing the development of a software package that would allow the user to review digital photographs of pavement, evaluate that pavement by the PASER method, store the results in a database, and then make decisions based on the results of that analysis.

Whereas climate, especially precipitation, has been found to constrain fire activity in (semi-)arid regions through productivity, the feedbacks with human systems lack generalization. Here, we assess the biophysical and human-related controls of fire activity in Namibia based on a 16-year record (2000\u20132016) of the MODIS Burned Area product (MCD45A1). The two derived parameters of fire activity include burned area (positive continuous) and the number of fire occurrences (zero-inflated counts), and are individually investigated at a 0.1\u00b0-resolution by means of five common statistical and machine-learning techniques. We evaluate performance and consistency among the models using the adjusted coefficient of determination and the root mean square error, which is obtained from 5-repeated 10-fold cross-validation. A comparable measure of predictor importance among the models is assessed by means of a permutation-based approach. As spatial autocorrelation is present for both parameters of fire activity, we consider this with a spatial cross-validation setup, where k-Means clusters of geographic coordinates are used to derive the test partitions. We find complex machine-learning techniques generally improve the predictions of both parameters of fire activity. Our results confirm the exceptional importance of mean annual precipitation for fire activity across Namibia and highlight human impacts as an additional control of fuel availability. Apart from an increase of burned area and fire occurrences at a mean annual precipitation of approximately 400 mm, population and livestock densities strongly limit fire activity in the best-performing Random Forest models. The largest burned areas are found with moderate green-up rates of vegetation, which we attribute to the presence of open landscapes. The consideration of spatial autocorrelation generally decreases model performances but the relative decreases are higher for the models of burned area, which we attribute to the increased spatial autocorrelation present with this response variable. Resultantly, we recommend accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the evaluation of spatial ecological models and the assessment of predictor importance.

Popular classification algorithms are based on the assumption that data in different classes are roughly equally distributed; however, extremely skewed data, with instances from one class taking up most of the dataset, is not exceptional in practice. Thus, performance of algorithm often degrades significantly when encountering skewed data. Mitigating the problem caused by imbalanced data has been an open challenge for years, and previous researches mostly have proposed solutions from the perspectives of data re-sampling and algorithm improvement. In this paper, focusing on two-class imbalanced data, we have proposed a novel divergence-encouraging autoencoder (DEA) to explicitly learn features from both of the two classes and have designed an imbalanced data classification algorithm based on the proposed autoencoder. By encouraging maximization of divergence loss between different classes in the bottleneck layer, the proposed DEA can learn features for both majority and minority classes simultaneously. The training procedure of the proposed autoencoder is to alternately optimize reconstruction and divergence losses. After obtaining the features, we directly compute the cosine distances between the training and testing features and compare the median of distances between classes to perform classification. Experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperform ordinary and loss-sensitive CNN models both in terms of performance evaluation metrics and convergence properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper proposed to solve the imbalanced data classification problem from the perspective of explicitly learning representations of different classes simultaneously. In addition, designing of the proposed DEA is also an innovative work, which could improve the performance of imbalanced data classification without data re-sampling and benefit future researches in the field.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2879221", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2899937559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13065168", "11463087", "121088440", "7318552", "17561163", "9776971", "26644563", "6664936", "1554582", "3769315", "204083391", "207155015", "9929910", "15762763", "9829879", "207475120", "14049778", "14227081", "14972567", "1783382", "7186684", "25179778", "62335828", "11969155", "15166291", "492338", "3074115", "34480577", "3290402", "6905442", "11715509", "11758569", "18370956", "3770261"], "inbound_citations": ["199543698"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54462247"}

However, such approaches are fundamentally limited since a tight lower bound of mutual information requires sample size exponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these approaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video understanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are prone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the relevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that are not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to learn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To mitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which learns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead of the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator.

Furthermore, the increased amount of malware that emerges every day, renders a manual approach inefficient. This study tackles the problem of analyzing, detecting and classifying the vast amount of malware in a scalable, efficient and accurate manner. We propose a novel approach for detecting malware and classifying it to either known or novel, i.e., previously unseen malware family. The approach relies on Random Forests classifier for performing both malware detection and family classification. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs novel feature representations for malware classification, that significantly reduces the feature space, while achieving encouraging predictive performance. The approach was evaluated using behavioral traces of over 270,000 malware samples and 837 samples of benign software. The behavioral traces were obtained using a modified version of Cuckoo sandbox, that was able to harvest behavioral traces of the analyzed samples in a time-efficient manner.

The study is performed using VV (vertical\u2013vertical) and VH (vertical\u2013horizontal) polarizations over an agricultural site in Urgell, Catalunya (Spain). With field segmentation information from SIGPAC (the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels), the backscatter intensities are averaged within each field. From the Sentinel-1 time series for each field, the statistics and metrics, including the mean value, the variance of the signal, the correlation length, and the fractal dimension, are analyzed. With the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the classification of irrigated crops, irrigated trees, and non-irrigated fields is performed with the metrics vector. The results derived from the SVM are validated with ground truthing from SIGPAC over the whole study area, with a good overall accuracy of 81.08%. Random Forest (RF) machine classification is also tested in this study, which gives an accuracy of around 82.2% when setting the tree depth at three.

Background: Headache is the main cause of neurologic consultation, entailing high cost in healthcare systems and a great impact in quality of life of patients suffering from it. Moreover, the access to qualified specialists and appropriate treatment is not ensured, especially in areas with low number of neurologist per capita. We hypothesize that and AI-system could assist in the diagnosis of headaches with a precision and safety comparable to a specialist. Design/Methods: We reviewed a database of 580 clinical records of patients with headache as chief complaint. Clinical records were processed with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was trained. The definite diagnosis was the one given by the specialist at the consultation. We compared the SVM model performance at classifying the headache as primary versus secondary with two general neurologist. Finally, we used an interactive headache questionnaire filled by patients previous to the consultation and classified the headache with an automatic ICHD criteria system supplemented with a machine-learning model, comparing that diagnosis to the one given by neurologists. All the development and analysis was done using Python. Results: The SVM model trained after \u201creading\u201d clinical records with LSA had a better performance in the diagnosis of secondary headache (sensitivity=90.2%; specificity=93%) in comparison with other neurologists (sensitivity=82%; specificity=85%). A correct headache diagnosis was achieved in 89\u201394% of the cases when ICHD criteria was combined with several machine-learning models.

A 28-run Design-of-Experiment (DoE) was conducted to evaluate the effects of the type of core and shell materials and their concentrations on tensile strength and brittleness index. Six machine learning algorithms were used to model the relationships of product profile outputs and raw material attribute inputs: response surface methodology (RSM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and four different types of artificial neural networks (ANN), namely, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), Genetic Algorithm Based BPNN (GA-BPNN), Mind Evolutionary Algorithm Based BPNN (MEA-BPNN), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Their predictive and generalization performance were compared with the training dataset as well as an external dataset. The results indicated that the core/shell technique significantly improved powder compactability over the physical mixture. All machine learning algorithms being evaluated provided acceptable predictability and capability of generalization; furthermore, the ANN algorithms were shown to be more capable of handling convoluted and non-linear patterns of dataset (i.e. the DoE dataset in this study). Using these models, the relationship of product profile outputs and raw material attribute inputs were disclosed and visualized.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30468845", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.11.039", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Pharmaceutics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2901774033", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25382743", "98474198", "15181105", "197354670", "5260644", "42597658", "26102216", "116858", "2012506", "823824", "197033322", "973668", "24364081", "135632311", "354191", "6809528", "99784172", "1032725", "19272963", "515925", "15480929", "83260912", "33233617", "96937627", "36078238", "6724152", "95994430", "98546222"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53711882"}

Despite the profusion of GPS and WiFi driven location prediction techniques, the sparse and random nature of check-in data generation have ushered diverse problems, which have prompted the prediction of future check-ins to be very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel enhanced location predictor for check-in data that is crafted using Poisson distribution, Wavelets and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Specifically, we show that check-in generation is governed by the Poisson distribution. In addition, among others, we utilize wavelets to rigorously analyze social influence and learn elusive underlying patterns, as well as human mobility behaviors embedded in check-in data. We utilize this knowledge to institute CRF features, which capture latent trends that govern users' mobility. These CRF features are employed to build a robust predictive model that predicts future locations with enhanced accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive model on two real datasets.

Part of these continua may be captured by schizotypy, which shares subclinical traits and biological phenotypes with SCZ, including thalamic structural abnormalities. In this regard, previous findings have suggested that multivariate volumetric patterns of individual thalamic nuclei discriminate HC from SCZ. These results were obtained using machine learning, which allows case-control classification at the single-subject level. However, machine learning accuracy is usually unsatisfactory possibly due to phenotype heterogeneity. Indeed, a source of misclassification may be related to thalamic structural characteristics of those HC with high schizotypy, which may resemble structural abnormalities of SCZ. We hypothesized that thalamic structural heterogeneity is related to schizotypy, such that high schizotypal burden would implicate misclassification of those HC whose thalamic patterns resemble SCZ abnormalities. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Following a previous report, we used Random Forests to predict diagnosis in a case-control sample (SCZ = 131, HC = 255) based on thalamic nuclei gray matter volumes estimates. Then, we investigated whether the likelihood to be classified as SCZ (\u03c0-SCZ) was associated with schizotypy in 174 HC, evaluated with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Prediction accuracy was 72.5%. Misclassified HC had higher positive schizotypy scores, which were correlated with \u03c0-SCZ. Results were specific to thalamic rather than whole-brain structural features. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: These findings strengthen the relevance of thalamic structural abnormalities to SCZ and suggest that multivariate thalamic patterns are correlates of the continuum between schizotypy in HC and the full-blown disease.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31358071", "doi": "10.1017/S0033291719001430", "venue": "Psychological medicine", "journal": "Psychological medicine", "mag_id": "2966225625", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198983275"}

The methodology uses as input variables characteristics of the insulator such as diameter, height, creepage distance, form factor and equivalent salt deposit density. The estimation of flashover performance of polluted insulators is based on field experience and laboratory tests are invaluable as they significantly reduce the time and labour involved in insulators design and selection. The majority of the variables to be predicted are dependent upon several independent variables. The results from this work are useful to predict the contamination severity, critical flashover voltage as a function of contamination severity, arc length, and especially to predict the flashover voltage. The validity of the approach was examined by testing several insulators with different geometries. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach with other intelligence method based on ANN (artificial neural networks) is compared.

This work develops a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework combining a data-driven surrogate model and a stochastic optimization algorithm to achieve multi-variables global optimization for improving the maximum power density of PEMFCs. Simulation results of a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) PEMFC model coupled with the CL agglomerate model constitutes the database, which is then used to train the data-driven surrogate model based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), a typical AI algorithm. Prediction performance shows that the squared correlation coefficient (R-square) and mean percentage error in the test set are 0.9908 and 3.3375%, respectively. The surrogate model has demonstrated comparable accuracy to the physical model, but with much greater computation-resource efficiency: the calculation of one polarization curve will be within one second by the surrogate model, while it may cost hundreds of processor-hours by the physical CFD model.

As a pharmacological intervention has not yet been developed to reverse disease progression, preventive medicine will play a crucial role for patient care and treatment planning. However, predicting which patients will progress to DAT is difficult as patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) could either convert to DAT (MCI-C) or not (MCI-NC). In this paper, we develop a deep learning model to address the heterogeneous nature of DAT development. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was utilized as a single biomarker, and a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) was developed. The 3D-CNN was trained using transfer learning from the classification of Normal Control and DAT scans at the source task. This was applied to the target task of classifying MCI-C and MCI-NC scans. The model results in 82.4% classification accuracy, which outperforms current models in the field. Furthermore, by implementing an occlusion map approach, we visualize key brain regions that significantly contribute to the prediction of MCI-C and MCI-NC. Results show the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and pons regions as significant to prediction, which are consistent with current understanding of disease. Finally, the model\u2019s prediction value is significantly correlated with rates of change in clinical assessment scores, indicating the model is able to predict an individual patient\u2019s future cognitive decline.

The graph construction is motivated by a locally linear embedding of the detection features.

Many of the testable predictions of these systems fall in the realm of cognitive science since they perform some 'computations' well and some poorly and have pronounced 'psychologies'. In such system, simple elements are connected to each other; the elements act like 'neurons' in that they sum excitation and inhibition from other elements. Information is represented as large state vectors of element activities, and it can be shown that simple 'synaptic' learing rules can serve to associate arbitrary state vectors using a matrix of connections. One version of this class of models has been shown,, in the past to form concepts and to perform classification computations.

Although a variety of subjects are involved with demographic attributes prediction, e.g. there are requirements to recognize and predict demography from psychology, but the traditional approach is dynamic modeling on specified field and distinctive datasets. However, dynamic modeling takes researchers a lot of time and energy, even if it is done, no one has an idea how good or how bad it is. To tackle the problems mentioned above, a framework is proposed in this chapter to predict using classifiers as core part, which consists of three main components: data processing, predicting using classifiers and prediction adjustments. The component of data processing performs to clean and format data. The first step is extracting relatively independent data from complicated original dataset. In the next step, the extracted data goes through different paths based on their types. And at the last step, all the data will be transformed into a demographic attributes matrix. To fulfill prediction, the demographic attributes matrix is taken as the input of classifiers, and the testing dataset comes from the same matrix as well. Classifiers in the experiments includes conventional state-of-the-art ones and Extreme Learning Machine, a new outstanding classifier. From the results of experiments based on two unique datasets, it is concluded ELM outperforms others. In the stage of prediction adjustments, two kinds of adjustments strategies are proposed corresponding to single target attributes and multiple target attributes separately, where single target attributes adjustments strategies include: adjusting the parameters of classifiers, adjusting the number of classes of target attributes and adjusting the public attributes. And multiple target attributes adjustment utilizes the outputs of first prediction as the inputs of second prediction to improve the accuracy of the first prediction. The framework proposed in this chapter consumes less time compared with traditional dynamic modeling methods, and there is no need to fully study the knowledge in various subjects for researchers using the framework because of the regular patterns. In addition, adjustment strategies have no restriction on the datasets; hence it will be useful universally. However, in some cases, dynamic modeling has the advantage of precision, resulting in better accuracy, but the results from the framework proposed in the chapter could provide as a comparison. In this work, a universal demographic attributes prediction framework is proposed to work on a variety of dataset with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The framework consists of three main components: First, processing raw data and extracting attribute features depending on different data types; Second, predicting desired attributes by classification; Third, improving the accuracy of classifiers through various adjustment strategies. Two experiments of different data types on real world prediction problems are conducted to demonstrate our framework can achieve better performance than other traditional state-of-the-art prediction methods with respect to accuracy. abstract environment.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-04741-6_11", "venue": "Extreme Learning Machines 2013: Algorithms and Applications", "journal": "Extreme Learning Machines 2013: Algorithms and Applications", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198335846"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:173704177"}

The objective of this research is to propose a damage detection system that can obtain the detailed damage information by use of the minimum number of sensors. The proposed system minimizes the possibility of incorrect judgments. Modal frequencies of a structure are used for pattern recognition in the proposed method. Changes in multiple natural frequencies can be correlated to the spatial information of the location of damaged stories. Typically only two vibration sensors, one on the roof and the other on the ground, detecting a single input and a single output for the structure are needed to determine modal frequencies. Out of many pattern recognition tools, we propose to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This technique has been found effective. Our previous studies demonstrated that the proposed damage detection method worked well for simple models such as shear structures and bending structures. However, real buildings have various boundary conditions at their supports. In this study, the SVM technique was applied to damage detection of structures with various boundary conditions. The feature vectors for SVMs are generated based on the model of a structure. Then locations of structural damage are detected by inputting the measured structural vibration data into the SVMs. From simulation, it was found that the influence of the change in boundary conditions on the lower modes is larger.

Moreover, our approach is able to outperform the state-of-the-art kernels when combined with other kernel methods.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": "1302.4874", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2153211825", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16581515", "7725084", "10667460", "34312806", "64967900", "6075461", "5165854", "5511339", "7395989", "15371289", "10318045", "7806677", "6825083", "6343683", "17069935", "5129873", "195717148"], "inbound_citations": ["11182480", "3247414", "1969813"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1051732"}
{"paper_id": "39321012", "title": "The class imbalance problem: A systematic study", "authors": [{"first": "Nathalie", "middle": [], "last": "Japkowicz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Shaju", "middle": [], "last": "Stephen", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In machine learning problems, differences in prior class probabilities -- or class imbalances -- have been reported to hinder the performance of some standard classifiers, such as decision trees. This paper presents a systematic study aimed at answering three different questions. First, we attempt to understand the nature of the class imbalance problem by establishing a relationship between concept complexity, size of the training set and class imbalance level. Second, we discuss several basic re-sampling or cost-modifying methods previously proposed to deal with the class imbalance problem and compare their effectiveness. The results obtained by such methods on artificial domains are linked to results in real-world domains. Finally, we investigate the assumption that the class imbalance problem does not only affect decision tree systems but also affects other classification systems such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3233/IDA-2002-6504", "venue": "Intell.

First, when the distribution of training data and testing data is quite different, the identification accuracy is low. Second, the traditional identification methods usually include an offline training stage and online identifying stage, which cannot achieve the real-time identification of the radar emitter. Aimed at the above problems, this paper proposes a radar emitter identification method based on transfer learning and online learning. First, for the case where the target domain contains only a small number of labeled samples, the TrAdaBoost method is used as the basic learning framework to train a support vector machine, which can obtain useful knowledge from the source domain to aid in the identification of the target domain. Then, for the case where the target domain does not contain labeled samples, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to filter the unlabeled samples in the target domain to generate the available training data. Finally, to make the identification quickly and accurately, we propose a radar emitter identification method, based on online learning to ensure real-time updating of the model. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method, based on transfer learning and online learning, has higher identification accuracy and good timeliness.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/info11010015", "venue": "Information", "journal": "Information", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998125146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16581586", "26779828", "740063", "207211852", "5848547", "207211713", "18431463", "18531030", "15263248", "22953363"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211005404"}

Low efficiency and poor robustness of the conventional algorithms hinder wide-spread applications of APCS. In this paper, a novel two-staged pavement image processing framework is presented. The pavement images are classified into four general categories in the first stage, so that the images can be processed using category-specific algorithms in the 2nd stage. The four categories include: 1\uff09Distress-free pavement, 2\uff09Pothole-type distress, 3\uff09Cracking-type distress, and 4\uff09Patching-type distress. The focus of this paper is on the initial classification algorithm. The proposed algorithm first fuses a local contrast enhanced image with a global grayscale corrected image to obtain an enhanced distressed pavement image. The enhanced image is then decomposed with a three-layer wavelet transform to obtain three texture features of the entire image including High-Amplitude Wavelet Coefficient Percentage\uff08HAWCP)\uff0cthe High-Frequency Energy Percentage (HFEP), and the Standard Deviation (STD). In the meantime, an improved P-tile method is used to obtain the binary image. From the binary image, three additional shape features are extracted including the Average Area of all Connected Components (AA), the Area of the Maximum Connected Component (AM), and the Equivalent Length of the longest Connected Component (EL). Finally, a BP neural network is used to fuse both the texture and shape features sequentially to achieve the initial classification. Experimental results show that for the four types of pavement images, the proposed algorithm achieves an effective classification of the pavement distress image with the accuracy rates of 96.5%, 91.4%, 95.2% and 98.1% respectively, which are higher than those of the classification algorithm with a single-type feature.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-92231-7_43", "venue": "IIMSS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2338282995,2808169625", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57764785"}

Not only is bugweed considered to be one of five most widespread invasive alien plant (IAP) species in the summer rainfall regions of South Africa but it is also one of the worst invasive alien plants in Africa. It forms dense infestations that not only impacts upon commercial forestry activities but also causes significant ecological and environment damage within natural areas. Effective weed management efforts therefore require robust approaches to accurately detect; map and monitor weed distribution in order to mitigate the impact on forestry operations. The main objective of this research was to determine the utility of support vector machines (SVMs) with a 272-waveband AISA Eagle image to detect and map the presence of co-occurring bugweed within mature Pinus patula compartments in KwaZulu Natal. The SVM when utilized with a recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) approach required only 17 optimal wavebands from the original image to produce a classification accuracy of 93% and True Skills Statistic of 0.83. Results from this study indicate that (1) there is definite potential for using SVMs for the accurate detection and mapping of bugweed in commercial plantations and (2) it is not necessary to use the entire 272-waveband dataset because the SVM-RFE approach identified an optimal subset of wavebands for weed detection thus enabling improved data processing and analysis.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2257988", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2011950836", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["167574123", "84123654", "85619538", "11350963", "90872907", "47880643", "129682526", "7390970", "129465811", "140707210", "133581334", "859732", "216840", "11625727", "59752996", "14004541", "18880454", "6906514", "129803791", "14495716", "14200251", "36061851", "16172488", "61649919", "17367599", "15943670", "16018450", "85069619", "127543969", "128575036", "23279156", "41715946", "129389231", "28637672", "27960844", "5543127", "57720284", "38921681", "121755315", "26615105", "10800171", "54735661", "82954532", "18725248", "64779696", "109796082", "30989494", "8122137", "16771660", "129554031", "7491035", "42674823", "131286056", "94648775", "86574057", "132707866", "110614783", "128544582", "84314598", "86153539", "42224251"], "inbound_citations": ["23590728", "9558600", "53050646", "13049625", "202689034", "122598067", "174804723", "211829895", "21785729", "54589315", "23708470", "2976514", "91197032"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33324806"}

Firstly, the correlations among heat supply and related influencing factors in the heating system were analyzed through the correlation analysis of statistical theory. Then, the SVR model was employed to forecast dynamic heat supply. In the model, the input variables were selected based on the correlation analysis and three crucial parameters, including the penalties factor, gamma of the kernel RBF, and insensitive loss function, were optimized by PSO algorithms. The optimized SVR model was compared with the basic SVR, optimized genetic algorithm-SVR (GA-SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) through six groups of experiment data from two heat sources. The results of the correlation coefficient analysis revealed the relationship between the influencing factors and the forecasted heat supply and determined the input variables.

Our goal was to compoare logistic regression and random forest in multi-scale optimized predictive model of occurrence of the American marten (Martes americana) in northern Idaho USA. There have been relatively few formal comparisons of the performance of multi-scale modeling between logistic regression and random forest, but those that have been conducted have found that random forest out-performs logistic regression. There was substantial similarity in the qualitative interpretation of the logistic regression and the random forest model and both found that occurrence was strongly predicted by a unimodal function of elevation, a non-linear function of canopy cover, a non-linear function of patch density, and the extent of the landscape in large conifer forest. Visual inspection of the predicted occurrence probability maps shows that random forest produces predictions that are more discriminatory, with higher range of predicted probability and higher spatial heterogeneity than logistic regression. The logistic regression model has an AUC of 0.701, while the random forest model had an AUC of 0.981, indicating very high predictive ability, and a much stronger ability to predict presences and absences in the training dataset than the logistic regression model. Expressed as a percentage, the random forest model had 28% higher performance, leading to much better prediction of habitat suitability, better inferences about habitat variables influencing marten occurrence, improved identification of scale dependency, and ultimately, therefore, better guidance to conservation and management.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-96978-7_9", "venue": "Machine Learning for Ecology and Sustainable Natural Resource Management", "journal": "Machine Learning for Ecology and Sustainable Natural Resource Management", "mag_id": "2899534781", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134059035"}

Many concept drift applications require fast response, which means an algorithm must always be (re)trained with the latest available data. But the process of data labeling is usually expensive and/or time consuming when compared to acquisition of unlabeled data, thus usually only a small fraction of the incoming data may be effectively labeled. Semi-supervised learning methods may help in this scenario, as they use both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process. However, most of them are based on assumptions that the data is static. Therefore, semi-supervised learning with concept drifts is still an open challenging task in machine learning. Recently, a particle competition and cooperation approach has been developed to realize graph-based semi-supervised learning from static data. We have extend that approach to handle data streams and concept drift. The result is a passive algorithm which uses a single classifier approach, naturally adapted to concept changes without any explicit drift detection mechanism. It has built-in mechanisms that provide a natural way of learning from new data, gradually \"forgetting\" older knowledge as older data items are no longer useful for the classification of newer data items.

In the Netherlands, people with a loan have the possibility to repay (part of) their outstanding loan before the due date. These prepayments make the length of the portfolio of loans stochastic, which creates problems in the refinancing policy of the bank, and affects the Asset a Liability Management. Moreover, interest rate risk arises from prepayments, meaning that being able to forecast the prepayment rate can increase the performance of the hedging strategy of a bank. Given the magnitude of the mortgage portfolio in the balance sheet of a bank, estimating the prepayment rate is therefore crucial. There are two kinds of models in the literature, the optimal prepayment model, which sees prepayment as a consequence of rational behavior (e.g. prepayments are always exercised at an optimal time), and the exogenous model which also takes into account other macroeconomic variables, client specifics and loan characteristics. Our focus will be on the second kind of techniques, precisely we will approach the problem as a classification task that will be carried out with two different machine learning techniques: Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks.Since prepayments are rare events, this leads to an imbalanced data set framework. The imbalance between classes creates complications in the development of the algorithm, hence ad hoc corrections are applied to solve them.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2923848158", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108342729"}

Specifically, condition assessment of power systems has the advantage of reducing maintenance and repair costs, downtime and reducing risks. This requires measurement of field PD signals which are often observed in an environment contaminated by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) which may mask relevant PD information [2]. The use of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) testing has also been suggested for condition assessment of insulation systems in turbine-driven generators. These techniques allow online testing which avoids generator shutdown during long inspections [3]. Power assets such as transformers, generators and cables surround the EMI signals making them very susceptible to noise. This affects the relevant information contained in the signal which hinders the analysis for PD identification and may affect the classification accuracy of PD. The proposed solution is to employ signal denoising techniques for noise mitigation in the captured field signals. Several denoising methods have been used on PD signals. The most popular technique is wavelet-based which has successfully denoised simulated and real PD signals combined with hard and soft thresholding of the wavelet coefficients [4]. The Wavelet Transform (WT) was exploited in [5] using high spatial correlation and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods to distinguish the relevant PD coefficients from noise. A similar decomposition method using the eigen approach was implemented in [6] to reduce noise collected in field PD data. Different techniques for wavelet coefficient selection were introduced for enhanced PD denoising in [7,8]. The Complex Wavelet Transform (CWT) was used instead of WT in [9,10], in combination with simple and combined information, for signal denoising because of CWT adaptivity to the non-stationary PD signal. However, PD signal denoising is still an ongoing area of research which aims to achieve improved results for non-stationariy nature signals.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/INSUCON.2017.8097195", "venue": "2017 INSUCON - 13th International Electrical Insulation Conference (INSUCON)", "journal": "2017 INSUCON - 13th International Electrical Insulation Conference (INSUCON)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2736770158", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["22436043", "46958015", "10440053", "70615251", "41798425", "110379041", "15168731", "110269698", "16958968", "119325709", "8426429", "1262186"], "inbound_citations": ["214691703", "54435186", "40327022", "52210755", "155106673"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19252106"}

As an important form of multimedia data, images have been widely utilized by many applications, such as face recognition and image classification. Therefore, how to accurately annotate each image from a large set of images is of vital importance but challenging. To perform these tasks well, it is crucial to extract suitable features to character the visual contents of images and learn an appropriate distance metric to measure similarities between all images. Unfortunately, existing feature operators, such as histogram of gradient, local binary pattern, and color histogram, care more about the visual character of images and lack the ability to distinguish semantic information. Similarities between those features cannot reflect the real category correlations due to the well-known semantic gap. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a regularized distance metric framework called semantic discriminative metric learning (SDML). SDML combines geometric mean with normalized divergences and separates images from different classes simultaneously. The learned distance metric can treat all images from different classes equally. And distinctions between similar classes with entirely different semantic contents are emphasized by SDML. This procedure ensures the consistency between dissimilarities and semantic distinctions and avoids inaccuracy similarities incurred by unbalanced locations of samples.

Potential factors impacting productivity are identified and studied based upon the literature and HDD experts across North America and abroad. A neurofuzzy (NF) approach is employed to develop the HDD productivity prediction model operating in clay, rock, and sandy soils. The merits of this approach involve decreasing uncertainties in results, addressing nonlinear relationships, and dealing well with imprecise and linguistic data. The NF model is tested using actual project data, which showed robust results with average validity percentages of 94.7, 82.3, and 86.7% for clay, rock, and sandy soils, respectively. The model is also used to produce productivity curves (production rate versus influencing factors) for each soil type.

Sensitivity analyses of the three environmental factors show that the most influential on LPD of Aeromonas hydrophila is temperature, followed by pH and NaCl, and the most influential on GT is pH, followed by temperature and then NaCl. ::: ::: Practical Applications ::: Aeromonas hydrophila is a foodborne microorganism, which has been isolated from seafood, red meat, poultry, vegetables and water. Predictive microbiology describes microbial behavior using mathematical models to predict the microbiological safety and quality of a food. A nonlinear modeling technique, termed support vector machine (SVM), is proposed to predict lag phase duration and generation time of A. hydrophila. Statistical criteria show that SVM has a better predictive performance for the generation time and lag phase duration than neural network and traditional statistical models. Sensitivity analyses of the SVM can reveal which condition is the most influential factor on the lag phase duration and generation time, respectively. Therefore, SVM could become an alternative to other modeling approaches, all of which are faster than traditional microbiological experiments.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/jfs.12125", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Food Safety", "mag_id": "2097609787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86796052"}

Hence, here, we propose a sequence-based identification of EGs. We performed gene essentiality predictions considering 15 bacteria, 1 archeaon, and 4 eukaryotes. Information-theoretic quantities, such as mutual information, conditional mutual information, entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Markov models, were used as features. In addition, with the hope of improving the prediction performance, other easily accessible sequence-based features related to stop codon usage, length, and GC content were included. For classification, the Random Forest algorithm was used. The performance of the proposed method is extensively evaluated by employing both intra- and cross-organism predictions.

Although a variety of powerful saliency models have been intensively proposed, they usually involve heavy feature (or model) engineering based on priors (or assumptions) about the properties of objects and backgrounds. Inspired by the effectiveness of recently developed feature learning, we provide a novel deep image saliency computing (DISC) framework for fine-grained image saliency computing. In particular, we model the image saliency from both the coarse-and fine-level observations, and utilize the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the saliency representation in a progressive manner. In particular, our saliency model is built upon two stacked CNNs. The first CNN generates a coarse-level saliency map by taking the overall image as the input, roughly identifying saliency regions in the global context. Furthermore, we integrate superpixel-based local context information in the first CNN to refine the coarse-level saliency map. Guided by the coarse saliency map, the second CNN focuses on the local context to produce fine-grained and accurate saliency map while preserving object details. For a testing image, the two CNNs collaboratively conduct the saliency computing in one shot.

In this paper, we propose a cervical nucleus segmentation method in which pixel-level prior information is utilized to provide the supervisory information for the training of a mask regional convolutional neural network (Mask-RCNN), which is then employed to extract the multi-scale features of the nuclei, and the coarse segmentation and bounding box of the nuclei are obtained by forward propagation of the Mask-RCNN. To refine the segmentation, a local fully connected conditional random field (LFCCRF) that contains unary and pairwise energy terms is employed. The nuclear region of interest is determined by extending the bounding box, the coarse segmentation in the nuclear region is used to construct the unary energy, and the pairwise energy is contributed by the position and intensity information of all of the pixels in the nuclear region. By minimizing the energy of the LFCCRF, the final segmentation is realized. We evaluated our method by using cervical nuclei from the Herlev Pap smear data set in this paper, and the precision, recall, and Zijdenbos similarity index were all found to be greater than 0.95 with low standard deviations, demonstrating that our method enables more accurate and stable cervical nucleus segmentation than the current state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871153", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2890567626", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5418838", "2247347", "6414542", "18339050", "17210987", "40741607", "12567984", "2712986", "14691933", "11324631", "145754", "3139559", "34907404", "13081599", "4652031", "6912132", "7897969", "31902192", "343530", "10443693", "4664881", "21205798", "8206919", "56507745", "64217393", "10716717", "206594692", "2239473", "206592484", "14124313", "5574079", "9747820", "6287870", "2930547", "478558"], "inbound_citations": ["201813968", "209495971", "195882685", "199381803", "210697828", "56718006"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53017742"}

In this research, we propose a noble model that takes advantage of transfer learning and data augmentation to classify insect pest species from image data in the most accurate way. In the proposed model, three different Deep Neural Network (DNN) models were used for image classification: VGG19, Inception v3 and ResNet50. With appropriate data augmentation, Inception v3 achieved the best accuracy of 57.08% on a total of 102 insect species classification, beating the previous best result of 49.4% on the same dataset. Additionally, all the species were grouped based on the crops they consume. As Inception v3 was the best performing model across all the classes, it was also used to classify crop specific insect species. For eight different crops, an approximate range of 48.2% to 88.1% accuracy was achieved from classification.

Traditionally, the recognition process relies almost exclusively on human experts, who are based on various characteristics of wood, such as color, structure and texture. However, there are numerous types of wood species in the nature that are difficult to be identified even by experienced scientists. Towards this end, in this paper we propose a novel approach for automated wood species recognition through multidimensional texture analysis. By taking advantage of the fact that static wood images contain periodic spatially-evolving characteristics, we introduce a new spatial descriptor considering each wood image as a collection of multidimensional signals. More specifically, the proposed methodology enables the representation of wood images as concatenated histograms of higher order linear dynamical systems produced by vertical and horizontal image patches. The final classification of images, i.e., histogram representations, into wood species, is performed using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. For the evaluation of the proposed method, a dataset, namely \u201cWOOD-AUTH\u201d, consisting of more than 4200 wood images (from cross, radial and tangential sections of normal wood structure) of twelve common wood species existing in Greek territory, was created.

Structural Health Monitoring methods are being considered in an effort to truncate the number of validation tests required for satellite checkout. The most promising of these monitoring techniques uses an active wave-based method in which an active piezoelectric transducer propagates a Lamb wave through the structure, where it is then received by a second sensor and evaluated over time to detect structural changes. Thus far, this method has proven effective in locating structural defects in a complex satellite panel; however, the attributes associated with the first wave arrival change significantly as the wave travels through ribs and interfaces. This study establishes a method to identify important features in the sensor signal that may otherwise be missed. In this work, an FE model of a plate is developed, and variability is introduced for each state observation. Different states are modeled as masses distributed at 12 locations.

The proposed method involves comparing each image against a reference spectrum, where the reference spectrum is obtained from the spectral signature of the type of coverage you want to detect. In this case the method has been tested using multispectral images (SPOT5) of the community of Madrid (Spain), and multispectral images (Quickbird) of an area over Indonesia that was impacted by the December 26, 2004 tsunami; here, the tests have focused on the detection of changes in vegetation. The image comparison is obtained by applying Spectral Angle Mapper between the reference spectrum and each multitemporal image. Then, a threshold to produce a single image of change is applied, which corresponds to the vegetation zones. The results for each multitemporal image are combined through an exclusive or (XOR) operation that selects vegetation zones that have changed over time. Finally, the derived results were compared against a supervised method based on classification with the Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, the NDVI-differencing and the Spectral Angle Mapper techniques were selected as unsupervised methods for comparison purposes. The main novelty of the method consists in the detection of changes in a specific land cover type (vegetation), therefore, for comparison purposes, the best scenario is to compare it with methods that aim to detect changes in a specific land cover type (vegetation). This is the main reason to select NDVI-based method and the post-classification method (SVM implemented in a standard software tool). To evaluate the improvements using a reference spectrum vector, the results are compared with the basic-SAM method. In SPOT5 image, the overall accuracy was 99.36% and the \u03ba index was 90.11%; in Quickbird image, the overall accuracy was 97.5% and the \u03ba index was 82.16%. Finally, the precision results of the method are comparable to those of a supervised method, supported by low detection of false positives and false negatives, along with a high overall accuracy and a high kappa index.

Previous research contributed little to support forward-looking adaptation. Agro-ecological zoning is a common tool to identify homologous environments and prioritize research. We demonstrate here a pragmatic approach to describe spatial changes in agro-climatic zones suitable for coffee under current and future climates. We defined agro-ecological zones suitable to produce arabica coffee by clustering geo-referenced coffee occurrence locations based on bio-climatic variables. We used random forest classification of climate data layers to model the spatial distribution of these agro-ecological zones. We used these zones to identify spatially explicit impact scenarios and to choose locations for the long-term evaluation of adaptation measures as climate changes. We found that in zones currently classified as hot and dry, climate change will impact arabica more than those that are better suited to it. Research in these zones should therefore focus on expanding arabica's environmental limits. Zones that currently have climates better suited for arabica will migrate upwards by about 500m in elevation. In these zones the up-slope migration will be gradual, but will likely have negative ecosystem impacts. Additionally, we identified locations that with high probability will not change their climatic characteristics and are suitable to evaluate C. arabica germplasm in the face of climate change.

We have basically carried out experiments with two different kinds of classification technologies, namely Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and MultiTask Learning (MTL), resulting in the following runs: \u2022 SVM baseline: Scheme with late fusion and SVM classifiers trained on the shot level, keyframe level, and region level low-level descriptors. \u2022 SVM with bal-SIFT: Similar to our SVM baseline, but incorporating a different kind of region descriptors using a balanced codeword. \u2022 Bagging of SVM: Rather than using individual SVM classifiers, multi-net bagging systems are used. \u2022 MLP-STL: Scheme with late fusion and Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP) trained individually for each high-level concept. This run serves as a baseline for the two following Multi-Task systems. \u2022 Selective MLP-MTL: Incorporates Multi-Task Learning, assigning all tasks the same importance. \u2022 Selective MLP-MTL with priority: Multi-Task Learning scheme, with focus on the individual performance of each category.

The developed tools can be of great assessment for engineers dealing with combustion to have a rapid check on combustion efficiency of natural gas at broad range of applications without the requirement of any unit as pilot plant. The Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm is employed to optimize the bias and weight values of the ANN model. In addition, Hybrid algorithm (coupling of back propagation and least square methods) is used to determine parameters of membership function in the ANFIS approach. Hyper variables of the SVM technique (i.e., C , K and e ) are determined using tried and error procedures.

A feasible alternative is to build surrogates or use an approximation of the actual fitness functions to be evaluated. Naturally these surrogate or meta models are order of magnitude cheaper to evaluate compared to the actual function evaluation. This paper presents two evolutionary algorithm frameworks which involve surrogate based fitness function evaluation. The first framework, namely the Dynamic Approximate Fitness based Hybrid EA (DAFHEA) model [1] reduces computation time by controlled use of meta-models (in this case approximate model generated by Support Vector Machine regression) to partially replace the actual function evaluation by approximate function evaluation. However, the underlying assumption in DAFHEA is that the training samples for the meta-model are generated from a single uniform model.

Postictal generalized electroencephalogram (EEG) suppression (PGES) is a period of suppressed brain activity often occurring after generalized tonic-clonic seizure, a most significant risk factor for SUDEP. Therefore, PGES has been considered as a potential biomarker for SUDEP risk. Automatic PGES detection tools can address the limitations of labor-intensive, and sometimes inconsistent, visual analysis. A successful approach to automatic PGES detection must overcome computational challenges involved in the detection of subtle amplitude changes in EEG recordings, which may contain physiological and acquisition artifacts. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: This study aimed to present a random forest approach for automatic PGES detection using multichannel human EEG recordings acquired in epilepsy monitoring units. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We used a combination of temporal, frequency, wavelet, and interchannel correlation features derived from EEG signals to train a random forest classifier. We also constructed and applied confidence-based correction rules based on PGES state changes. Motivated by practical utility, we introduced a new, time distance-based evaluation method for assessing the performance of PGES detection algorithms. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The time distance-based evaluation showed that our approach achieved a 5-second tolerance-based positive prediction rate of 0.95 for artifact-free signals.

The efficiency of proposed method is evaluated with MNIST and celebA dataset. The results show that the proposed training algorithm converges faster than conventionally trained GANs.

On the other hand, the IGRT workflow involves collecting a series of computed tomography (CT) images from the same patient under treatment. These images contain valuable patient-specific information yet are often neglected by previous works. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, namely incremental learning with selective memory (ILSM), to effectively learn the patient-specific appearance characteristics from these patient-specific images. Specifically, starting with a population-based discriminative appearance model, ILSM aims to \"personalize\" the model to fit patient-specific appearance characteristics. The model is personalized with two steps: backward pruning that discards obsolete population-based knowledge and forward learning that incorporates patient-specific characteristics. By effectively combining the patient-specific characteristics with the general population statistics, the incrementally learned appearance model can localize the prostate of a specific patient much more accurately. This work has three contributions: 1) the proposed incremental learning framework can capture patient-specific characteristics more effectively, compared to traditional learning schemes, such as pure patient-specific learning, population-based learning, and mixture learning with patient-specific and population data; 2) this learning framework does not have any parametric model assumption, hence, allowing the adoption of any discriminative classifier; and 3) using ILSM, we can localize the prostate in treatment CTs accurately (DSC \u223c 0.89 ) and fast ( \u223c 4 s), which satisfies the real-world clinical requirements of IGRT.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4379484", "pubmed_id": "24495983", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2013.2291495", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1979777457", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["10972294", "6809168", "14542608", "11319388", "35901931", "8998794", "13982095", "18846096", "7236378", "13920184", "35045903", "206748223", "12339860", "18602339", "5783050", "2269279", "3135141", "13263862", "1895874", "2244564", "9442803", "14800211", "8640108", "34520151", "1318313", "15100686", "7592584", "967430", "1989341", "16894221", "15662659", "18228763", "1089627", "972888", "42281583", "29597148", "20418318", "20845694", "51740751", "12461947"], "inbound_citations": ["6771738", "23396922", "1315930", "206748223", "42864035", "102349433", "12090000", "74308783", "18985613"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206748223"}

The models tested included boosted regression trees (BRT), Random Forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), generalized linear model (GLM), and Maxent. These analyses were conducted using a newly developed software package called the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM). All models were trained with 499 presence points, 10,000 pseudo-absence points, and predictor variables acquired from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor over an eight-month period to distinguish tamarisk from native riparian vegetation using detection of phenological differences. From the Landsat scenes, we used individual bands and calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and tasseled capped transformations. All five models identified current tamarisk distribution on the landscape successfully based on threshold independent and threshold dependent evaluation metrics with independent location data. To account for model specific differences, we produced an ensemble of all five models with map output highlighting areas of agreement and areas of uncertainty.

Due to high scalability, diverse real environmental state and wide scene variability direct application of action recognition/detection methods such as spatio-temporal interest point (STIP)-local feature based technique, on the whole dataset is practically infeasible. To address this problem, we apply a motion region extraction technique which is based on motion segmentation and region clustering to identify possible candidate ''event of interest'' as a preprocessing step. On these candidate regions a STIP detector is applied and local motion features are computed. For activity representation we use generalized Hough transform framework where each feature point casts a weighted vote for possible activity class centre. A max-margin frame work is applied to learn the feature codebook weight. For activity detection, peaks in the Hough voting space are taken into account and initial event hypothesis is generated using the spatio-temporal information of the participating STIPs. For event recognition a verification Support Vector Machine is used.

Accurate Digital Terrain Models (DTM) are inevitable inputs for mapping areas subject to natural hazards. Topographic airborne laser scanning has become an established technique to characterize the Earth surface: lidar provides 3D point clouds allowing a fine reconstruction of the topography. For flood hazard modeling, the key step before terrain modeling is the discrimination of land and water surfaces within the delivered point clouds. Therefore, instantaneous shoreline, river borders, inland waters can be extracted as a basis for more reliable DTM generation. This paper presents an automatic, efficient, and versatile workflow for land/water classification of airborne topographic lidar data. For that purpose, a classification framework based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is designed. First, a restricted set of features, based only 3D lidar point coordinates and flightline information, is defined. Then, the SVM learning step is performed on small but well-targeted areas thanks to an automatic region growing strategy. Finally, label probabilities given by the SVM are merged during a probabilistic relaxation step in order to remove pixel-wise misclassification. Results show that survey of millions of points are labelled with high accuracy (>95% in most cases for coastal areas, and >89% for rivers) and that small natural and anthropic features of interest are still well classified though we work at low point densities (0.5\u20134 pts/m 2 ).

However, considering a simple association problem, such as associating faces with names, iterative type BAM networks usually take hundreds and sometimes thousands of learning trials to encode such associations correctly, whereas humans in some conditions learn much faster. The present study therefore proposes an adjustment to a particular type of BAM network that increases its performance in a rapid learning condition while processing memory capacity is limited. Results show that the modification to the original learning rule of the BHM leads to improved performance when rapid learning is required. Moreover, the model preserves its high memory load capacity in standard learning. This study could lead to improved cognitive models that can adapt their behavior in function of the contextual conditions. Keywords: Artificial intelligence; Connectionist models; Bidirectional associative memory; Short-term memory learning. Introduction Like human beings, artificial neural networks can discriminate, identify, and categorize perceptual patterns (Faussett, 1994; Haykin, 2009). Bidirectional Associative Memories (BAMs) have been proposed as models of neurodynamics. As such, they are able to develop attractors allowing the network to perform various types of recall under noisy conditions and successfully carry out pattern completion. Many advances were made since Kosko introduced the BAM in 1988; see Acevedo-Mosqueda, Yanez-Marquez & Acevedo-Mosqueda (2013) for a review. Although the majority of improvements made BAM models better suited for learning a wider set of associations and brought greater performance, such improvements have been at the expense of learning times. Nowadays, BAM models often take hundreds and sometimes thousands of learning cycles to correctly associate patterns. Consequently, researchers have attempted to enhance convergence times and performance (Nong & Bui, 2012). Several one-shot learning rules were developed, showing almost perfect performance in some cases (Ritter, Diaz-Deleon, & Sussner, 1999; Wu & Pados, 2000, Acedo, Yanez, & Lopez, 2006a; 2006b). Although these improvements have successfully overcome the limitations of the model presented previously, these models were most often applied to engineering problems rather than providing legitimate models of cognition. For example, good connectionist models of cognition should adapt their connection weights locally, without homuncular knowledge, backpropagation of the error or complex learning procedure (O'Reilly, 1998). Therefore, models should show the ability to learn quickly with excellent performance, while possessing limited memory capacity when encoding time is short (one shot or few shot learning). On the other hand, they should present good performance and good memory load capacity when the encoding time allowed is longer. The present study proposes the introduction of a recency parameter in a modified BAM network (Chartier & Boukadoum, 2006b; 2011), which leads to improved performance in rapid learning situations, but with limited storing capacity. The proposed process therefore allows for learning in conditions where a limited number of iterations is required. The remainder of the paper is divided as follows: The background section describes the architecture of the model and the internal properties of the network, while the method section presents the learning and recall procedures of the model. The results section describes the recall performance tasks of the model under various level of noise. The final section discusses the results and provides a conclusion to the study. Background The model proposed by Chartier & Boukadoum (2006b; 2011) uses an unique matrix for each layer. This Bidirectional Heteroassociative Memory (BHM) is able to learn correlated patterns for bipolar patterns as well as for real-valued patterns.

When computers are applied to solve a practical problem, it is usually the case that the method of deriving the required output from a set of inputs can be described explicitly. As computers are applied to solve more complex problems, however, situations can arise in which there is no known method for computing the desired output from a set of inputs, or where that computation may be very expensive. Forecasting financial time series events such as daily exchange rate directions, for instance, is a problem that is very relevant for the financial community and known to be very difficult in practice. We formally represent this problem as a classification task which is described by the linear separability problem. In the special case of finding whether two sets of points (namely exchange rate ups and downs) in general space can be separated, the linear separability problem becomes the binary classification problem whose most general form, the case of whether two sets of points in general space can be separated by k hyperplanes, is known to be NP-complete.

So, this paper conducted a series of experiments to identify the most influential EEG features induced by music evoking different emotions (calm, joy, sad, and angry). We extracted 27-dimensional features from each of 12 electrode positions then used correlation-based feature selection method to identify the feature set most strongly related to the original features but with lowest redundancy. Several classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), C4.5, LDA, and BPNN, were then used to test the recognition accuracy of the original and selected feature sets. Finally, results are analyzed in detail and the relationships between selected feature set and human emotions are shown clearly.

However, such associations are frequently idiosyncratic and cannot be generalized for diagnostics. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been shown to be functionally associated with several cancer types. Here, we study the association of intra-host mtDNA diversity with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). UDS mtDNA exome data from blood of patients with HCC (n = 293) and non-cancer controls (NC, n = 391) were used to: (i) measure the genetic heterogeneity of nucleotide sites from the entire population of intra-host mtDNA variants rather than to detect specific mutations, and (ii) apply machine learning algorithms to develop a classifier for HCC detection. Average total entropy of HCC mtDNA is 1.24-times lower than of NC mtDNA (p = 2.84E-47). Among all polymorphic sites, 2.09% had a significantly different mean entropy between HCC and NC, with 0.32% of the HCC mtDNA sites having greater (p < 0.05) and 1.77% of the sites having lower mean entropy (p < 0.05) as compared to NC. The entropy profile of each sample was used to further explore the association between mtDNA heterogeneity and HCC by means of a Random Forest (RF) classifier The RF-classifier separated 232 HCC and 232 NC patients with accuracy of up to 99.78% and average accuracy of 92.23% in the 10-fold cross-validation. The classifier accurately separated 93.08% of HCC (n = 61) and NC (n = 159) patients in a validation dataset that was not used for the RF parameter optimization. Polymorphic sites contributing most to the mtDNA association with HCC are scattered along the mitochondrial genome, affecting all mitochondrial genes.

The dichotomizers in ECOC are first optimized individually to increase their accuracy and diversity (or interdependence) which is beneficial to the ECOC framework. Specifically, the best feature set is determined for each possible dichotomizer and a wrapper approach is applied to evaluate the classification accuracy of each dichotomizer on the training dataset using cross-validation. The separability of the ECOC codes is maximized by selecting a set of competitive dichotomizers according to a new criterion, in which a regularization term is introduced in consideration of the binary classification performance of each selected dichotomizer. The proposed method is experimentally applied for classifying four ACG mechanisms. The eye images of 152 glaucoma patients are collected by using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and then segmented, from which 84 features are extracted. The weighted average classification accuracy of the proposed method is 87.65 % based on the results of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), which is much better than that of the other existing ECOC methods.

In MAL, concurrent multiple distributed learning processes can make the learning environment nonstationary for each individual learner. Developing an efficient learning approach to coordinate agents' behaviors in this dynamic environment is a difficult problem, especially when agents do not know the domain structure and have only local observability of the environment. In this paper, a coordinated MAL approach is proposed to enable agents to learn efficient coordinated behaviors by exploiting agent independence in loosely coupled MASs. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly quantify and dynamically adapt agent independence during learning so that agents can make a trade-off between a single-agent learning process and a coordinated learning process for an efficient decision making. The proposed approach is employed to solve two-robot navigation problems in different scales of domains. Experimental results show that agents using the proposed approach can learn to act in concert or independently in different areas of the environment, which results in great computational savings and near optimal performance.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25594993", "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2014.2387277", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2054339854", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10355028", "403512", "6803794", "13844607", "1563147", "10001627", "202496", "19706", "5972732", "905337", "8862416", "7878602", "16037874", "386824", "16037874", "1394727", "15856893", "5661913", "7865148", "11652380", "6610053", "57464058", "9166388", "208910339", "7041867", "12707282", "1455305", "7010011", "1508380", "6520562", "7330198", "6724500", "10195838", "2962689", "19037084", "871178", "3177337", "13052705", "14698020", "9292232", "18126258", "118007968", "14675408", "2045442", "6650901", "442828", "203583", "25126591", "9078010"], "inbound_citations": ["55310162", "115687423", "3433470", "169031246", "208267864", "208617632", "169035584", "57189823", "52192835", "150115723", "150257055", "1385346", "57189444", "12288426"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10515168"}

The main idea of feature selection is to choose a subset of available features, by eliminating features with little or no predictive information, as well as redundant features that are strongly correlated. There are a lot of approaches for feature selection, but most of them can only work with crisp data. Until now there have not been many different approaches which can directly work with both crisp and low quality (imprecise and uncertain) data. That is why, we propose a new method of feature selection which can handle both crisp and low quality data. The proposed approach is based on a Fuzzy Random Forest and it integrates filter and wrapper methods into a sequential search procedure with improved classification accuracy of the features selected. This approach consists of the following main steps: (1) scaling and discretization process of the feature set; and feature pre-selection using the discretization process (filter); (2) ranking process of the feature pre-selection using the Fuzzy Decision Trees of a Fuzzy Random Forest ensemble; and (3) wrapper feature selection using a Fuzzy Random Forest ensemble based on cross-validation. The efficiency and effectiveness of this approach is proved through several experiments using both high dimensional and low quality datasets.

In this paper, a novel parallel SVM training implementation is proposed to accelerate the cross validation procedure by running multiple training tasks simultaneously on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). All of these tasks with different hyperparameters share the same cache memory which stores the kernel matrix of the support vectors. Therefore, this heavily reduces redundant computations of kernel values across different training tasks. Considering that the computations of kernel values are the most time consuming operations in SVM training, the total time cost of the cross validation procedure decreases significantly. The experimental tests indicate that the time cost for the multitask cross validation training is very close to the time cost of the slowest task trained alone.

The accidents should be resolved as soon as possible in order to prevent the core melting and the release of radioactive material to the environment. In this case, operators should follow the emergency operating procedure related with the accident, in step by step order and in allowable time. Nowadays, the advanced main control rooms are equipped with computer-based procedures (CBPs) which is make it easier for operators to do their tasks of monitoring and controlling the reactor. However, most of the CBPs do not include the time remaining display feature which informs operators of time available for them to execute procedure steps and warns them if the they reach the time limit. Furthermore, the feature will increase the awareness of operators about their current situation in the procedure. This paper investigates this issue. The simplified of emergency operating procedure (EOP) of steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) accident of PWR plant is applied. In addition, the sequence of actions on each step of the procedure is modelled using multilevel flow modelling (MFM) and influenced propagation rule. The prediction of action time on each step is acquired based on similar case accidents and the Support Vector Regression.

The first is access to freely-available curated data, the second is the number of false positives that occur in the physical primary screening process, and finally the data is highly-imbalanced with a low ratio of Active compounds to Inactive compounds. This paper first discusses these three problems and then a selection of Weka cost-sensitive classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, C4.5 and Random Forest) are applied to a variety of bioassay datasets. Pharmaceutical bioassay data is not readily available to the academic community. The data held at PubChem is not curated and there is a lack of detailed cross-referencing between Primary and Confirmatory screening assays. With regard to the number of false positives that occur in the primary screening process, the analysis carried out has been shallow due to the lack of cross-referencing mentioned above. In six cases found, the average percentage of false positives from the High-Throughput Primary screen is quite high at 64%. For the cost-sensitive classification, Weka's implementations of the Support Vector Machine and C4.5 decision tree learner have performed relatively well. It was also found, that the setting of the Weka cost matrix is dependent on the base classifier used and not solely on the ratio of class imbalance. Understandably, pharmaceutical data is hard to obtain. However, it would be beneficial to both the pharmaceutical industry and to academics for curated primary screening and corresponding confirmatory data to be provided. Two benefits could be gained by employing virtual screening techniques to bioassay data. First, by reducing the search space of compounds to be screened and secondly, by analysing the false positives that occur in the primary screening process, the technology may be improved. The number of false positives arising from primary screening leads to the issue of whether this type of data should be used for virtual screening. Care when using Weka's cost-sensitive classifiers is needed - across the board misclassification costs based on class ratios should not be used when comparing differing classifiers for the same dataset.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2820499", "pubmed_id": "20150999", "doi": "10.1186/1758-2946-1-21", "venue": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "journal": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2125335678", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["428864", "22432155", "196869745", "206225072", "140109802", "31561268", "477760", "196861592", "9919123", "3645479", "8656691", "207624573", "24301532"], "inbound_citations": ["214976688", "51929679", "32124850", "16208093", "3902448", "3996768", "19002448", "209892282", "14142438", "14032229", "10141548", "215226010", "195770149", "41580388", "21661532", "204847812", "17124959", "14571733", "5716287", "12089945", "210840157", "215455424", "59585298", "4664267", "199543698", "16768894", "15199126", "4858028", "16294886", "27972657", "13789307", "8445089", "17360743", "18099894", "2628870", "30135119", "15834850", "53278065", "20283058", "208878149"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8840471"}

Existing transfer learning algorithms for Bayesian network structure learning give a single maximum a posteriori estimate of network models. Yet, many other models may be equally likely, and so a more informative result is provided by Bayesian structure discovery. Bayesian structure discovery algorithms estimate posterior probabilities of structural features, such as edges. We present transfer learning for Bayesian structure discovery which allows us to explore the shared and unique structural features among related tasks. Efficient computation requires that our transfer learning objective factors into local calculations, which we prove is given by a broad class of transfer biases.

However, the classification problems, complexity and inconsistency in several spectral classifiers developed for hyperspectral images are some reasons warranting further research. This study investigates the application of Deep Support Vector Machine (DSVM) for hyperspectral image classification. Two hyperspectral images, Indian Pines and University of Pavia are used as tentative test beds for the experiment. The DSVM is implemented with four kernel functions: Exponential Radial Basis Function (ERBF), Gaussian Radial Basis Function (GRBF), neural and polynomial. Stand-alone SVMs form the interconnecting weights of the entire network. The network is trained with one hundred input datasets, and the interconnecting weights of the network are initialised using the regularisation parameter of the model. Numerical results show that the classification accuracies of the DSVM for Indian Pines and University of Pavia based on each DSVM kernel functions are: ERBF (98.87%, 98.16%), GRBF (98.90%, 98.47%), neural (98.41%, 97.27%), and polynomial (99.24%, 98.79%). By comparing the DSVM algorithm against well-known classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and K Means (KM) classifiers, the mean classification accuracies for Indian Pines and University of Pavia are: DSVM (98.86%, 98.17%), SVM (76.03%, 73.52%), DNN (94.45%, 93.79%), GMM (76.82%, 78.35%), KNN (76.87%, 78.80%), and KM (21.65%, 18.18%).

The six properties investigated are: \"Accuracy\", \"Reliability\", \"Objectivity\", \"Depth\", \"Conciseness\", and \"Multiple points of views\". The importance of these properties, in satisfying users' information needs and/or in control of information quality, has been widely accepted, and they are amenable to the automatic analysis. We test the learnability of human judgments on these properties at two levels: the general level with the goal of constructing global rules from a group of persons' judgments; and the individual level. ::: The \"combined\" corpus, for the purpose of general level learning, is a combination of work by multiple judges on 3,200 texts. There are also five individual judgment corpora, with about 500 documents in each. The judgments are on 10-point Likert scales. Four statistical and machine learning techniques: linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree C4.5 and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are applied to the automatic assessment task. ::: The linear regression experiments show that we cannot adequately differentiate texts at 10 distinct levels on each non-topical dimension. However, the experiments demonstrate that binary classification techniques (Logistic Regression and Linear SVM), together with the simple language and textual features, can automatically assess the six non-topical properties of documents at levels better than chance. The prediction performance gets better when middle range documents are removed from the dataset. The classification tasks for \"Depth\" and \"Multi-views\" are relatively easier than the other four tasks. With the current set of predictive features, we cannot yet identify the middle range documents. ::: Automatic assessment of one individual judge's assignment is slightly, but not significantly, better than learning for all judges at once. For some judges and some properties, our method achieved very good classification results. Linear based learning methods, logistic regression and linear SVM, are better tools than Boolean-based decision tree (C4.5) method. The advanced SVM method does not show significant superiority over the logistic regression method. The models with good performance tend to contain intuitively reasonable features.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2156020571", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15796038"}

They are treated as the \u201clifeline\u201d of the subsea production system for offshore oil and gas exploitation. During operation, umbilical needs to undertake self-weight and periodical load due to the ocean environment. Meanwhile, the heat during power transmission in electric cable is released to the umbilical body, which influences the mechanical properties and optical transmission in the cable. However, there are a number of components and many kinds of sectional arrangement for the umbilical. So the sectional design with multiple components needs to be solved as a multidisciplinary optimization problem. From the mechanical point of view, the umbilical structure should be designed with more compacted and symmetric layout to obtain even probability of resistance to loads and reduce structural stress to improve its fatigue performance. Concerning thermal effect, these units should be arranged to dissipate the heat easily to avoid the influence on the functional and structural components. In this paper, compactedness, symmetry and temperature distribution are quantified through introducing corresponding indices. Then multidisciplinary optimization framework is established. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) intelligent algorithm is adopted to carry out the optimization to obtain the optimal solution, which is far superior to the initial design. The optimization design strategy is proved to be effective and efficient by some numerical examples, which provides reference for design of umbilical cables.\u00a9 2015 ASME", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/OMAE2015-41492", "venue": "Volume 5A: Pipeline and Riser Technology", "journal": "Volume 5A: Pipeline and Riser Technology", "mag_id": "2260530331", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111508317"}
