Unfortunately, the limited availability of paired lyrics-melody dataset with alignment information has hindered the research progress. To address this problem, we create a large dataset consisting of 12,197 MIDI songs each with paired lyrics and melody alignment through leveraging different music sources where alignment relationship between syllables and music attributes is extracted. Most importantly, we propose a novel deep generative model, conditional Long Short-Term Memory - Generative Adversarial Network (LSTM-GAN) for melody generation from lyrics, which contains a deep LSTM generator and a deep LSTM discriminator both conditioned on lyrics. In particular, lyrics-conditioned melody and alignment relationship between syllables of given lyrics and notes of predicted melody are generated simultaneously.

Given heterogeneous geographic data with class ambiguity, the spatial ensemble learning (SEL) problem aims to find a decomposition of the geographic area into disjoint zones such that class ambiguity is minimized and a local classifier can be learned in each zone. The problem is important for applications such as land cover mapping from heterogeneous earth observation data with spectral confusion. However, the problem is challenging due to its high computational cost. Related work in ensemble learning either assumes an identical sample distribution (e.g., bagging, boosting, random forest) or decomposes multi-modular input data in the feature vector space (e.g., mixture of experts, multimodal ensemble) and thus cannot effectively minimize class ambiguity. In contrast, we propose a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly partitions input data in geographic space. Our approach first preprocesses data into homogeneous spatial patches and uses a greedy heuristic to allocate pairs of patches with high class ambiguity into different zones. We further extend our spatial ensemble learning framework with spatial dependency between nearby zones based on the spatial autocorrelation effect.

From the viewpoint of machine learning, a novel domain correction and adaptive extreme learning machines (DC-AELM) framework with transferring capability is proposed to solve the serious interference problem in e-nose.

By learning from a representative training set a classifier is able to estimate proper decision boundaries. However, in many real-life problems obtaining objects from some of the classes is difficult, or even impossible. In such cases, we are dealing with one- class classification, or learning in the absence of counterexamples. Such recognition systems must display a high robustness to new, unseen objects that may belong to an unknown class. That is why ensemble learning has become an attractive perspective in this field. In our work, we propose a novel one-class ensemble classifier, based on wagging. A weighted version of boosting is used, and the output weights for each object are used directly in the process of training Weighted One-Class Support Vector Machines. This introduces a diversity into the pool of one-class classifiers and extends the competence of formed ensemble.

Previous studies seldom consider in a simultaneous fashion the real situation of insufficiency of available training samples, particularly for small land covers that often contain the key information of the scene, and the problem of complexity. In this paper, the capabilities of a feature reduction technique used for discrimination are combined with the advantages of a Bayesian learning-based probabilistic sparse kernel model, the relevance vector machine (RVM), to develop a new supervised classification method. In the proposed method, the hyperdimensional data are first transformed to a lower dimensionality feature space using the feature reduction technique to maximize separability between classes. The transformed data are then processed by a multiclass RVM classifier based on the parallel architecture and one-against-one strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the method, experiments were carried out on real hyperspectral data.

The key idea of the MES is to capture the peculiarities of an ensemble of different estimators in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of the single estimators. The proposed MES can be implemented in two conceptually different ways: 1) by combining the estimates obtained by the different estimators; 2) by selecting the output of the best single estimator identified according to an adaptive measure of accuracy applied to the input feature space. The MES was applied to the problem of estimating water quality parameters, with a particular focus on the measure of concentration of chlorophyll. In the experimental phase, we used a recent and promising regression approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to create a set of estimators characterized by different 'architectures' to be integrated in the ensemble.

In order to scale the computation to large training sets, a block-wise Nystrom approximation of the multi-view kernel matrix is introduced. We justify our approach theoretically and experimentally, and show its performance on real-world datasets against relevant state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-01872-6_11", "venue": "Linking and Mining Heterogeneous and Multi-view Data", "journal": "Linking and Mining Heterogeneous and Multi-view Data", "mag_id": "2905144382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125635301"}

The combination method of oversampling and undersampling can be one solution in solving imbalance cases. This study aims to address the problem of imbalanced data by combining the oversampling method with the undersampling method to obtain more representative synthetic data. In this study, the undersampling methods used is Neighborhood Cleaning Rules (NCL. While Adaptive Semiunsupervised Weighted Oversampling (A-SUWO) will be used as the oversampling method.

Studies have shown that these diseases are related to cardiac fat. Various medical diagnostic aid systems are developed to reduce these diseases. In this context, this paper presents a new approach to the segmentation of cardiac fat from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The study employs a clustering algorithm called Floor of Log (FoL). The advantage of this method is the significant drop in segmentation time. Support Vector Machine was used to learn the best FoL algorithm parameter as well as mathematical morphology techniques for noise removal. The time to segment cardiac fat on a CT is only 2.01 s on average. In contrast, literature works require more than one hour to perform segmentation. Therefore, this job is one of the fastest to segment an exam completely. The value of the Accuracy metric was 93.45% and Specificity of 95.52%. The proposed approach is automatic and requires less computational effort. With these results, the use of this approach for the segmentation of cardiac fat proves to be efficient, besides having good application times. Therefore, it has the potential to be a medical diagnostic aid tool.

Although a plethora of work has tried to address this issue, an exact solution is yet to be found. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that most of the existing datasets are imbalanced, i.e. the number of instances of a particular class far exceeds that of the others. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the notion of transfer learning to address this issue and focus our efforts on histopathological and imbalanced image classification. We use the popular VGG-19 as the base model and complement it with several state-of-the-art techniques to improve the overall performance of the system. With the ImageNet dataset taken as the source domain, we apply the learned knowledge in the target domain consisting of histopathological images. With experimentation performed on a large-scale dataset consisting of 277,524 images, we show that the framework proposed in this paper gives superior performance than those available in the existing literature. Through numerical simulations conducted on a supercomputer, we also present guidelines for work in transfer learning and imbalanced image classification.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32175873", "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2020.2980831", "venue": "IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics", "journal": "IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics", "mag_id": "3010871530", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212730494"}

We propose an algorithm that identifies neighbouring vertices of a given vertex and thereby identifies the classifiers corresponding to the set of vertices of this polytope. A classifier can then be chosen from them based on a suitable test error criterion. We illustrate our results with an example which demonstrates that this path can be complicated.

It records human motion information, and, with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) training process, we can classify falls and other normal motions successfully with an SVM filter. Based on the SVM filter, an embedded DSP (Digital Signal Processing) system is developed for real-time fall detection. Also, a smart mechanical airbag deployment system is finalized. This system weighs 253.5 grams (including a 42.5 g compressed CO2 cylinder) and is 190 mm long, 57 mm wide, and 30 mm thick. Its size will be reduced in future to allow it to fit onto a belt. The response time of the trigger is 0.133 seconds, which allows more time for compressed air release before a person falls down to the ground.

Using SVM (Support Vector Machine) as the base classifier, we develop two strategies, CoSpa-C and CoSpa-U, embedded within the CoSpa approach. The CoSpa-C strategy selects unlabeled reviews classified with the largest confidence to augment the training dataset to retrain the classifier. The CoSpa-U strategy randomly selects unlabeled reviews with a uniform distribution of confidence.

Specifically, about ~25-40% of those clinically diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) would not have significant A\u03b2 pathology. This study explores a deep learning framework to predict A\u03b2 pathology positivity from baseline clinical assessments and structural MRI data routinely acquired from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) were trained on undirected graphs reconstructed from diffusion MRI and their performances was assessed to see their predictive value based on ground-truth A\u03b2-positivity estimates from AV45-PET scans. Anatomical brain parcellations with atrophy estimates from structural MRI constitute the vertices; tractography based connectivity estimates defined the edges of the graph model. A 10-fold cross validation on independent training and test sets were performed to assess the model performance in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. GCNs were able to learn from atrophy descriptors and network connectivity derived from MRI and predict A\u03b2-positivity. Atrophy was a significant predictor of A\u03b2-positivity in the AD model, but at a lesser degree in healthy and MCI models. The inclusion of other AD-related predictors showed: a significant improvement in test accuracy to 68\u00b14%, sensitivity to 84\u00b17%, specificity to 52\u00b113%, negative predictive value to 77\u00b15%, and positive predictive value to 64\u00b14% in MCI models; and a significant improvement in test accuracy to 69\u00b12% and specificity to 97\u00b14% in HC models. Patterns of regional brain atrophy within large-scale brain networks might offer predictive value to whether or not a subject will test positive for an AV45-PET exam. Predictions are more accurate with the addition of well-established AD-related predictors, however more features may be necessary to increase the predictive ability in healthy and MCI subjects.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2947231496", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:190898578"}

In practice, modeling RP factors is difficult because existing data are under-sampled and imbalanced. Support vector machines (SVMs), a class of statistical learning methods that implicitly maps data into a higher dimensional space, is one machine learning method that recently has been applied to the RP problem with encouraging results. In this thesis, we present and evaluate an ensemble SVM method of modeling radiation pneumonitis. The method internalizes kernel/model parameter selection into model building and enables feature scaling via Olivier Chapelle\u2019s method. We show that the ensemble method provides statistically significant increases to the cross-folded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve while maintaining model parsimony.

In this article, we observed that some unigram words of the existing Telugu SWNet are classified as ambiguous and are not sufficient to analyze the sentiment. In such situations, bigram and trigram phrases can be used to resolve the problem of ambiguity in sentiment prediction. Therefore, we proposed an algorithm to build the Telugu SentiPhraseNet (SPNet) for the sentiment analysis in Telugu. To build SPNet, we have collected the data from various sources namely, Telugu e-Newspapers, Twitter and NLTK Indian Telugu data which resolves the problems with existing SWNet. With the proposed SPNet, we have performed the sentiment analysis and it is compared with SWNet, various existing Machine Learning approaches namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF).

Given the extensive polymorphism of both the KIR3DL1 and HLA class I we sought to train and evaluate a model for predicting the binding between any combination of KIR3DL1 and HLA class I allotypes. Methods KIR3DL1 tetramers were screened for reactivity against a panel of HLA-I molecules which revealed different patterns of specificity for each KIR3DL1 allotype. This data was used to train several machine learning models (Support Vector Machine, Multi-Label Vector Optimization, Linear Regression, Neural Network) to learn the association between the amino acid sequence of the HLA class I allotype and the normalized MFI of the tetramer binding experiments. Separate models were trained for each of 6 KIR3DL1 allotypes.

However, the biological mechanisms linking low SES to disease and/or disease risk factors are not well understood and remain relatively under-studied. The analysis of the blood transcriptome is a promising window for elucidating how social and environmental factors influence the molecular networks governing health and disease. To further define the mechanistic pathways between social determinants and health, this study examined the impact of SES on the blood transcriptome in a sample of African-Americans. Methods An integrative approach leveraging three complementary methods (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, Random Forest and Differential Expression) was adopted to identify the most predictive and robust transcriptome pathways associated with SES. We analyzed the expression of 15079 genes (RNA-seq) from whole blood across 36 samples. Results The results revealed a cluster of 141 co-expressed genes over-expressed in the low SES group. Three pro-inflammatory pathways (IL-8 Signaling, NF-\u03baB Signaling and Dendritic Cell Maturation) are activated in this module and over-expressed in low SES. Random Forest analysis revealed 55 of the 141 genes that, collectively, predict SES with an area under the curve of 0.85. One third of the 141 genes are significantly over-expressed in the low SES group. Conclusion Lower SES has consistently been linked to many social and environmental conditions acting as stressors and known to be correlated with vulnerability to chronic illnesses (e.g. asthma, diabetes) associated with a chronic inflammatory state. Our unbiased analysis of the blood transcriptome in African-Americans revealed evidence of a robust molecular signature of increased inflammation associated with low SES.

Although a number of data-driven techniques have been applied to cope with this issue and achieved noteworthy performance, the reliability prediction problem is still not fully explored, especially for applying the hybridization methods. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid model which integrates singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and support vector machines regression (SVR) to forecast the failure time series data gathered from the maintenance stage of the Boeing 737 aircraft. Two significant components recognized as the trend and fluctuation are extracted from the original failure time series data by using the techniques of SSA and noise test, and the two components are associated with the inherent and operational reliability, respectively. Then two models named as trend-SSA and fluctuation-SVR are individually developed to conduct the tasks of modeling and forecasting the two components. Furthermore, the optimal parameters of the hybrid model are obtained efficiently by a stepwise grid search method. The performance of the presented model is measured against other unitary models such as Holt-Winters, autoregressive integrated moving average, multiple linear regression, group method of data handling, SSA, and SVR, as well as their hybridizations. The comparison results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other techniques and can be utilized as a promising tool for reliability forecast applications.

This often relies critically on high fidelity numerical simulations, which are prohibitively computationally expensive. The application of deep learning techniques to generative modeling is renewing interest in using high dimensional density estimators as computationally inexpensive emulators of fully-fledged simulations. These generative models have the potential to make a dramatic shift in the field of scientific simulations, but for that shift to happen we need to study the performance of such generators in the precision regime needed for science applications. To this end, in this work we apply Generative Adversarial Networks to the problem of generating weak lensing convergence maps.

In order to train the CNN model, a large dataset is necessary. We build the dataset by using synthetic defects. They are simulated using 3D ellipsoidal models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We compare different portions of ellipsoidal/GAN defects in the training subset. In our experiments, the use of GAN defects does not play a relevant role in this solution. However, ellipsoidal defects helped to achieve better performance. Ellipsoidal defects from any size and orientation could be superimposed onto real X-ray images in any location. In addition, we tested several CNN configurations, the best one, that we call Xnet-II, has 30 layers and more than 1,350,000 parameters. It has been trained using a dataset with around 640,000 patches containing 50% of ellipsoidal defects and 50% of real background captured from different casting types. The model was tested using sliding-windows methodology on whole X-ray images achieving promising results (mPA = 0.7102): the model was able to detect real defects from different casting types.

In cell culture analysis, accurate detection of mitosis, or cell division, is critical for quantitative study of cell proliferation. In this work, we present an approach that can detect mitosis within a cell population of high cell confluence, or high cell density, which has proven challenging because of the difficulty in separating individual cells. We first detect the candidates for birth events that are defined as the time and location at which mitosis is complete and two daughter cells first appear. Each candidate is then examined whether it is real or not after incorporating spatio-temporal information by tracking the candidate in the neighboring frames. For the examination, we design a probabilistic model named Two-Labeled Hidden Conditional Random Field (TL-HCRF) that can use the information on the timing of the candidate birth event in addition to the visual change of cells over time. Applied to two cell populations of high cell confluence, our method considerably outperforms previous methods.

Populating crash data with the high-resolution (in space and time) traffic data to investigate the relationship between crash risk and traffic conditions can help the active traffic management (ATM) to predict crash risk in real-time. To improve the accuracy of the existing real-time crash prediction methods, this paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN) model with the variables selected by the random forest (RF). The study used the traffic and crash data from I-5 segment (13.8-miles-long) in Los Angeles, where the traffic data (flow, speed, occupancy and etc.) were recorded by sensors. The RF was used to rank the explanatory variables based on the Gini index, which yields the most significant variables for the crash prediction. Different from the previous studies, the gradient change of traffic data along distance is recognized as an important variable. The developed BN-RF model is evaluated by ROC curve. The results indicate that traffic conditions at two five-minute intervals prior to a crash is very sensitive to the crash risk prediction. A sudden speed change (speed magnitude in a short time and distance), characterized as one unit, makes the distribution of crash posterior probability at least 0.045 higher compared to the marginal value. The most important finding is that the proposed BN-RF model for the real-time crash prediction can accurately predict 70.46% of crashes with a 16.07% of false alarm rate, which is better than that of previous studies.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICTIS.2019.8883694", "venue": "2019 5th International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)", "journal": "2019 5th International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2982614274", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19651059", "14074644", "5010293", "106867872", "110545582", "25143104", "751076", "37803602", "59649976", "25630138", "4413783", "8860508", "38618256", "24929208", "5551113", "8760947", "115868602", "205176195", "205179492", "89141", "2827580", "42979791", "17793133", "140109802", "58593222"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204970760"}

The ability to correctly identify likes and dislikes as well as excitement and boredom would facilitate novel applications in neuromarketing, affective entertainment, virtual rehabilitation and forensic neuroscience that leverage on sub-conscious human affective states. In this neuroinformatics investigation, we seek to recognize human preferences and excitement passively through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) when a subject is presented with some 3D visual stimuli. Our approach employs the use of machine learning in the form of deep neural networks to classify brain signals acquired using a brain-computer interface (BCI). In the first part of our study, we attempt to improve upon our previous work, which has shown that EEG preference classification is possible although accuracy rates remain relatively low at 61%-67% using conventional deep learning neural architectures, where the challenge mainly lies in the accurate classification of unseen data from a cohort-wide sample that introduces inter-subject variability on top of the existing intra-subject variability. Such an approach is significantly more challenging and is known as subject-independent EEG classification as opposed to the more commonly adopted but more time-consuming and less general approach of subject-dependent EEG classification. In this new study, we employ deep networks that allow dropouts to occur in the architecture of the neural network. The results obtained through this simple feature modification achieved a classification accuracy of up to 79%. Therefore, this study has shown that the use of a deep learning classifier was able to achieve an increase in emotion classification accuracy of between 13% and 18% through the simple adoption of the use of dropouts compared to a conventional deep learner for EEG preference classification. In the second part of our study, users are exposed to a roller-coaster experience as the emotional stimuli which are expected to evoke the emotion of excitement, while simultaneously wearing virtual reality goggles, which delivers the virtual reality experience of excitement, and an EEG headset, acquires the raw brain signals detected when exposed to this excitement stimuli. Here, a deep learning approach is used to improve the excitement detection rate to well above the 90% accuracy level. In a prior similar study, the use of conventional machine learning approaches involving k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM) only achieved prediction accuracy rates of between 65% and 89%. Using a deep learning approach here, rates of 78%-96% were achieved.

Weeds are one of the considerable menaces to the real home and humankind. They are destroying native habitats, forbidding native plants. Weeds cause decrease in farm and forest yield, invade crops and they can also harm livestock. The only solution to this problem is to avoid the growth of weeds either by removing them or using herbicides. In this proposed automated idea, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is utilized to make out whether plant is crop or weed. The maize crops are continuously monitored by capturing images using camera. In order to classify a plant as a crop or weed, various features are extricated which among them are shape, texture, color. We have made use of statistical textural features such as Intensity, Mean, Energy, Entropy, Standard Deviation, Smoothness and Third Moment. Machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier is used for accurate prediction to find out whether the plant is crop or weed. The data-set consists of images of maize crop which are 500 in number and equal number of weed images.

DPRF naturally provides a probability mapping associated to its predictions, i.e. the disruptivity signal, now incorporated in the DIII-D PCS. This paper discusses disruption prediction accomplishments in terms of shot-by-shot performances, by simulating alarms on each discharge as in the PCS framework. Depending on the optimised performance metric chosen to evaluate DPRF, we find that almost all disruptive discharges are detected in average with few hundred of milliseconds of warning time, but this comes at a high cost of false alarms produced. Performances are not satisfying ITER requirements, where the success rate has to be higher than 95%, but this is not completely unexpected. DPRF is trained on many years of major disruptions occurring during the flattop phase of the plasma current on DIII-D, but without any differentiation by cause. Furthermore, we find that DPRF is affected by a relatively high fraction of false alarms occurring during the first 500 milliseconds from the flattop onset. This subtle effect, more evident on the discharges where DPRF ran in real-time, can be marginalized by taking specific precautions on the validity range of the predictions, and performances do improve. Even if presently burdened by some limitations, DPRF provides an incredible and novel advantage. Thanks to the feature contribution analysis (e.g., the identification of which signals contributed to triggering an alarm), it is possible to interpret and explain DPRF predictions. It is the first time that such interpretability features is exploited by a disruption predictor: by uncovering the disruption events' causes, a better understanding of disruption dynamics is achieved, and a clear path toward the design of disruption avoidance strategies can be provided.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1741-4326/ab28bf", "venue": null, "journal": "Nuclear Fusion", "mag_id": "2952388932", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197475046"}

Here we applied established population-habitat relationships based on decades of monitoring and research-management collaborations for the Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) to project potential impacts of changing environmental conditions to breeding habitat distribution, quantity, and quality in the near future. Kirtland's warblers are habitat-specialists that nest exclusively within dense jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forests between ca. 5\u201320 years of age. Using Random Forests to predict changes in distribution and growth rate of jack pine under future scenarios, results indicate the projected distribution of jack pine will contract considerably (ca. 75%) throughout the Lake States region, U.S.A. in response to projected environmental conditions in 2099 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios regardless of climate model. Reduced suitability for jack pine regeneration across the Lake States may constrain management options, especially for creating high stem-density plantations nesting habitat. However, conditions remain suitable for jack pine regeneration within their historical and current core breeding range in northern Lower Michigan and several satellite breeding areas. Projected changes in jack pine growth rates varied within the core breeding area, but altered growth rates did not greatly alter the duration that habitat remained suitable for nesting by the Kirtland's Warblers.

As a result, SVM can achieve the state of the art performance on feature selection and classification.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4631603", "venue": "2008 International Symposium on Information Technology", "journal": "2008 International Symposium on Information Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2150625326", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28637672", "5885974", "583205", "875220", "60131810", "17586794", "2443126", "129826264"], "inbound_citations": ["5064499", "118850808", "195740310", "30906968", "54967749", "51994227", "15147433", "56097633"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15886998"}

This explains why, over the past decade, there have been many extensions of RF where each extension employed a variety of techniques and strategies to improve certain aspect(s) of RF. Since it has been proven empirically that ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the constituent models, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, it investigates how an unsupervised learning technique, namely, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) can be used to identify diverse trees in the RF. Second, trees with the highest LOF scores are then used to create a new RF termed LOFB-DRF that is much smaller in size than RF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, but mostly exhibits higher performance in terms of accuracy. The latter refers to a known technique called ensemble pruning. Experimental results on 10 real datasets prove the superiority of our proposed method over the traditional RF.

Usually, camera placement is performed directly by the user, and that task may be laborious. Existing automatic virtual cameras guide the user by optimizing a single rule, e.g. maximizing the visible silhouette or the projected area. However, the use of a static pre-defined rule may fail in respecting the user's subjective understanding of the scene. This work introduces intelligent design galleries, a learning approach for subjective problems such as the camera placement. The interaction of the user with a design gallery teaches a statistical learning machine. The trained machine can then imitate the user, either by pre-selecting good views or by automatically placing the camera. The learning process relies on a Support Vector Machines for classifying views from a collection of descriptors, ranging from 2D image quality to 3D features visibility. Experiments of the automatic camera placement demonstrate that the proposed technique is efficient and handles scenes with occlusion and high depth complexities.

This document provides a literature review on the current status of computational studies aimed at predicting the physicochemical properties and biological effects (including toxicity) of nanomaterials, with an emphasis on medical applications. Although a number of models have been published for physicochemical property prediction, very few models have been published for predicting biological effects, toxicity or the underlying mechanisms of action. This is due to two main reasons: a) nanomaterials form a colloidal phase when in contact with biological systems making the definition and calculation of properties (descriptors) suitable for the prediction of toxicity a new and challenging task, and b) nanomaterials form a very heterogeneous class of materials, not only in terms of their chemical composition, but also in terms of size, shape, agglomeration state, and surface reactivity. There is thus an urgent need to extend the traditional structure-activity paradigm to develop methods for predicting the toxicity of nanomaterials, and to make the resulting models readily available. This document concludes by proposing some lines of research to fill the gap in knowledge and predictive methodology.

In particular, we propose using quantized Haar wavelet features and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for rear-view vehicle detection. Wavelet features are particularly attractive for vehicle detection because they form a compact representation, encode edge information, capture information from multiple scales, and can be computed efficiently. Traditionally, methods using wavelet features for classification truncate the coefficients by keeping only the ones with largest magnitude. We believe that the actual values of the wavelet coefficients are not very important for vehicle detection. In fact, the coefficient magnitudes indicate local oriented intensity differences, information that cold be very different even for the same vehicle under different lighting conditions. Therefore, we argue and demonstrate experimentally that the actual coefficient values are less important compared to the simple presence or absence of those coefficients. Specifically, we propose quantizing large negative coefficients to -1, large positive coefficients to 1, and setting the rest coefficients to 0. The quantized coefficients seem to encode important information about the general shape and structure of vehicles, while ignoring fine details and allowing for sufficient inter-class variability. Experimental results and comparisons using real data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach which has achieved an average accuracy of 93.94% on completely novel test images.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICARCV.2002.1235021", "venue": "7th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, 2002.

Computational prediction of BCEs, which is necessary before classical wet lab validation, has gained tremendous interest recently. Although several computational methods have been developed, their accuracy is unreliable. Thus, developing a reliable model with significant prediction improvements is highly desirable. In this study, we first constructed a non-redundant dataset of 5,550 experimentally validated BCEs and 6,893 non-BCEs from the Immune Epitope Database. We then developed a novel ensemble learning framework for improved linear BCE predictor called iBCE-EL, a fusion of three independent predictors, namely, random forest, extremely randomised tree, and gradient boosting classifiers, which uses either dipeptide composition or a combination of dipeptide and physicochemical properties as input features. Cross-validation analysis on a benchmarking dataset showed that iBCE-EL performed better than individual classifiers, with an accuracy of 72.4%. Furthermore, iBCE-EL significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art method and six other machine learning-based methods developed in this study, with an accuracy of 71.8%, when objectively evaluated using an independent dataset. To the best of our knowledge, iBCE-EL is the first ensemble method for linear BCE prediction.

Unfortunately, the lack of the scalability of the existing GAN-based image translation approaches poses a fundamental challenge to understand the nature of the MR contrast imputation problem: which contrast does matter? Here, we present a systematic approach using Collaborative Generative Adversarial Networks (CollaGAN), which enable the learning of the joint image manifold of multiple MR contrasts to investigate which contrasts are essential. Our experimental results showed that the exogenous contrast from contrast agents is not replaceable, but other endogenous contrast such as T1, T2, etc can be synthesized from other contrast.

F. Skinner, scholars (and parents) have wondered how children move from the blooming, buzzing confusion of infancy, through the tumult of childhood and adolescence, into adulthood.

What is the nature of experience, and how does it generate change? The study of development has always been organized around these big questions. Answers to these questions have a profound influence on daily life, forming a framework for how parents think about their own children, and influencing both national policy and educational curricula.

A vision only approach was used for both tasks, with no use of the text or audio information. For the high-level feature extraction task, we used two different approaches, one using sparse and one using dense visual features to learn classifiers for all 39 required concepts, using the training data supplied by MediaMill [29] for the 2005 data. In addition, we also used a face specific classifier, with features computed for specific facial parts, to facilitate answering people-dependent queries such as \u201cgovernment leader\u201d. We submitted 3 different runs for this task. OXVGG_A was the result of using the dense visual features only. OXVGG_OJ was the result of using the sparse visual features for all the concepts, except for \u201cgovernment leader\u201d, \u201cface\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d, where we prepended the results from the face classifier. OXVGG_AOJ was a run where we applied rank fusion to merge the outputs from the sparse and dense methods with weightings tuned to the training data, and also prepended the face results for \u201cface\u201d, \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cgovernment leader\u201d. In general, the sparse features tended to perform best on the more object based concepts, such as \u201cUS flag\u201d, while the dense features performed slightly better on more scene based concepts, such as \u201cmilitary\u201d. Overall, the fused run did the best with a Mean Average (inferred) Precision (MAP) of 0.093, the sparse run came second with a MAP of 0.080, followed by the dense run with a MAP of 0.053. For the interactive search task, we coupled the results generated during the high-level task with methods to facilitate efficient and productive interactive search. Our system allowed for several \u201cexpansion\u201d methods based on the sparse and dense features, as well as a novel on the fly face classification system, which coupled a Google Images search with rapid Support Vector Machine (SVM) training and testing to return results containing a particular person within a few minutes. We submitted just one run, OXVGG_TVI, which performed well, winning two categories and coming above the median in 18 out of 24 queries. 1 High-level Feature Extraction Our approach here is to train an SVM for the concept in question, then score all key frames in the test set by the magnitude of their discriminant (the distance from the discriminating hyper-plane), and subsequently rank the test shots by the score of their keyframes. We have developed three methods for this task, each differing in their features and/or kernel.

Therefore, the security and protection of the various communication infrastructures using an intrusion detection system (IDS) is of critical importance. In this research, we propose a Feed-Forward Deep Neural Network (FFDNN) wireless IDS system using a Wrapper Based Feature Extraction Unit (WFEU). The extraction method of the WFEU uses the Extra Trees algorithm in order to generate a reduced optimal feature vector. The effectiveness and efficiency of the WFEU-FFDNN is studied based on the UNSW-NB15 and the AWID intrusion detection datasets. Furthermore, the WFEU-FFDNN is compared to standard machine learning (ML) algorithms that include Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). The experimental studies include binary and multiclass types of attacks. The results suggested that the proposed WFEU-FFDNN has greater detection accuracy than other approaches. In the instance of the UNSW-NB15, the WFEU generated an optimal feature vector consisting of 22 attributes. Using this input vector; our approach achieved overall accuracies of 87.10% and 77.16% for the binary and multiclass classification schemes, respectively. In the instance of the AWID, a reduced input vector of 26 attributes was generated by the WFEU, and the experiments demonstrated that our method obtained overall accuracies of 99.66% and 99.77% for the binary and the multiclass classification configurations, respectively.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cose.2020.101752", "venue": null, "journal": "Computers & Security", "mag_id": "3004777721", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212993739"}

A look at factive adjectives", "authors": [{"first": "Annie", "middle": [], "last": "Zaenen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Lauri", "middle": [], "last": "Karttunen", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In this note, we look at the factors that influence veridicity judgments with factive predicates. We show that more context factors play a role than is generally assumed. We propose to use crowd sourcing techniques to understand these factors better and briefly discuss the consequences for the association of lexical signatures with items in the lexicon. 1 Veridicity: what and why Recognizing the inferential properties of constructions and of lexical items is important for NLU (Natural Language Understanding) systems. In this paper we look at FACTUAL INFERENCES, inferences that allow the reader to conclude that an event has happened or will happen or that a state of affairs pertains or will pertain. We will refer to events and states together as SOAs. Factuality is in the world and outside of the text. In cases where the reader has no direct perceptual knowledge about the SOAs, she has to evaluate the factuality of a SOA referred to in a text based on her decoding of the author\u2019s representation of the factuality of the SOA and on her knowledge about the world and about the author\u2019s reliability. Authors have a plethora of means to signal whether they want to present SOAs as factual, as having happened or going to happen or as being more or less probable, possible, unlikely or not factual at all. We will call this presentation of a SOA the VERIDICITY of a SOA. We will call the reader\u2019s interpretation of the author\u2019s intention, the RIV (READER INFERRED VERIDICITY) and the reader judgment about the factuality of a SOA, RIF (READER INFERRED FACTUALITY). Annotation can, at its best, only provide us with RIVs as the author is typically not available for consultation. This leads to a methodological problem. A reader will in his interpretation of a sentence be sensitive, not only to the way an author signals her intentions but also to what he knows about the world. To circumvent this problem as much as possible, corpus annotation for veridicity is typically done by trained annotators with extensive guidelines (see e.g. (Sauri, 2008), (Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2012)) but corpus annotation by trained annotators is an expensive enterprise, hence looks at a limited number of cases. For instance, to anticipate on a case we will discuss later in the paper, lucky occurs only once in the FactBank ((Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2009). Given that annotation is done on running text, it is also difficult to avoid that the reader\u2019s evaluation of the wider extralinguistic context might still play a role. We propose to supplement corpus annotation with crowd sourcing experiments. In these, sentences are presented to Mechanical Turk workers in limited contexts, very similar to the contexts in which linguists judge the effect of the contribution of a lexical item or a construction. But contrary to linguistic practice, we derive our examples from really occurring ones culled from the web and, more importantly, present them to many native speakers (typically 100) and in different variations to explore factors that can influence the interpretation. This kind of variation is very difficult to find in naturally occurring corpora of the type that are used for annotations (e.g. FactBank).

Despite this, many systems are built with standard, predefined filter banks that are not optimized for that particular application. Representation learning methods such as restricted Boltzmann machines may outperform these standard filter banks because they learn a feature description directly from the training data. Like many other representation learning methods, restricted Boltzmann machines are unsupervised and are trained with a generative learning objective; this allows them to learn representations from unlabeled data, but does not necessarily produce features that are optimal for classification. In this paper we propose the convolutional classification restricted Boltzmann machine, which combines a generative and a discriminative learning objective. This allows it to learn filters that are good both for describing the training data and for classification. We present experiments with feature learning for lung texture classification and airway detection in CT images. In both applications, a combination of learning objectives outperformed purely discriminative or generative learning, increasing, for instance, the lung tissue classification accuracy by 1 to 8 percentage points.

The Exploration of a Multi-Theoretical Framework for Holistic and Democratic Adult ESL Instruction Using students\u2019 prior experience has been regarded as an effective way to accommodate adult learning (Dewey, 1938; Lindeman, 1926; Mezirow, 1991; Wlodkowski, 1999) and practice culturally responsive education (Banks, 2001). Moreover, using students\u2019 prior experiences aids in facilitating English as a Second Language (ESL) learning (Diaz-Rico, 2012). While the use of prior experience in culturally responsive teaching has gained attention from educators at various levels, its integrative theoretical basis is unlikely to exist in the context of adult ESL instruction. Based on the nature and situational identity of adult ESL learners, who are often adults learning English as a second language in a new culture, it is important to construct a theoretical framework characterizing who they are (adult learning theory), how language and culture shapes their identities (socio-cultural theory), and how they acquire a second language (second language theory). These relationships do not work in a vacuum, but rather in the embodiment of adult ESL learners\u2019 prior experiences. Lindeman (1926), Dewey (1938), and Merizow (1991) all emphasized the importance of personal development in education for adult learners. The goal of adult ESL education is not only language improvement. Personal growth should be a final educational goal for adult ESL learners. Capitalizing on students\u2019 prior experience and providing opportunities for learners to reflect on their experience is an effective way to achieve this goal. In light of the cognitive theory of Connectionism, which has been psychologically applied to second language acquisition, the use of students\u2019 prior experience is assumed to activate the language elements in linguistic contexts so the overarching process of language learning is more meaningful and feasible. Also, involvement of students\u2019 prior experience helps with comprehending input and lowering learner anxiety in the process of second language learning (Krashen, 1982). In all, connecting with adult ESL learners\u2019 prior experience helps adult ESL learners improve their second language acquisition. A view of education from a socio-cultural perspective emphasizes an understanding of the cultural world where students grow and develop (Alfred, 2003; Perez, 1998). For adult ESL learners, considering learning in socio-cultural contexts is especially significant, mainly because they are from diverse backgrounds with rich cultures and experiences. While prior experience is important in developing holistic instruction in which students improve second language acquisition, social cultural competence, and personal growth, a sense of democratic and critical multiculturalism in adult ESL classrooms is important in promoting social activism and awareness (Smoke, 1998). Dewey (1966) has also postulated, such a sense of democratic and critical multiculturalism shedding light on the dialectical relationship between individuals and society that is inseparable. Thus, the purpose of education is intimately connected with the active role of the citizen in a democracy. In this regard, use of prior experiences directs educators to avoid the pitfall of \u201coppression\u201d in education, as noted by Freire (1972). When respecting and appreciating students\u2019 prior experiences, the power relationship between educators and students is likely to evaporate, creating space for dialogue, human dignity, freedom, and critical thinking in the teaching and learning process. Although the literature suggests the logical interconnection of adult learning theory, socio-cultural theory, and second language theory in effective adult ESL education, further research is warranted and being developed to directly expose this relationship and the effects of exploiting it.

However, shear wave logs are only available in a limited number of wells in an oil field due to the high cost of the log acquisition. For this reason, many attempts have been made to find a correlation between Vs and other petrophysical logs. In this study, a set of log data consisting of depth, neutron porosity (NPHI), density (RHOB), photoelectric (PEF), gamma ray (GR), caliper, true resistivity (RT), VP, and Vs were used to develop a model for Vs estimation in a well drilled in Ahvaz field. For this purpose, Tukey's method was employed to preprocess the data and eliminate outliers. Then, using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), the best features were selected among the inputs to estimate Vs. Results indicate that increasing the number of input parameters of the model leads to an increase in accuracy and determination coefficient; however, this increase was negligible for the models with more than five input parameters. These parameters, i.e., Vp, RT, GR, RHOB, and NPHI, were selected as the best features to estimate Vs adopting Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA). Results obtained from modeling reveal that LSSVM-COA algorithm produces a more accurate estimate of VS compared to LSSVM-PSO and LSSVM-COA in both training and testing steps. In addition, a very slight difference between the error in testing and training steps suggests a higher reliability of LSSVM-COA compared to two other hybrid algorithms. Comparing this model with empirical and regression ones clearly showed that the model error is considerably less than those models. Eventually, another set of data gathered in Ab-Teymour field was used to evaluate the model from the perspective of generalizability. Similarly, Vs estimation by LSSVM-COA model provided more reliable and accurate results compared to those of empirical and regression models, and also LSSVM-PSO and LSSVM-GA algorithms. Finally, it can be concluded that the method employed in this study could be used as an efficient means to accurately estimate Vs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petrol.2018.11.032", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "2901882553", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["155450185"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:105564649"}

However, existing feature selection techniques in random forests are computationally intensive and high RAM memory requirements requiring specialized (uncommon) high throughput infrastructures . In bioinformatics, random forest classifiers are widely used as it is a flexible, self regulating and self contained machine learning algorithm that is robust to the 99predictors(features) P >> subjects N99 problem with minimal tuning parameters. The current feature selection options are used extensively for biomarker detection and discovery; however, they are limited to variants of permutation tests or heuristic rankings with arbitrary cutoffs. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm using the binomial framework for feature selection in random forests, binomialRF, which is designed to produce significance measures devoid of expensive and uninterpretable permutation tests. Furthermore, it offers a highly flexible framework for efficiently identifying and ranking multiway interactions via dynamic tree programming. Methods: We propose a novel and scalable feature selection technique that exploits the tree structure in the random forest, treats each tree as a binomial stochastic process, and determines feature significance by conducting a one sided binomial exact test to determine if a feature was detected more often than expected by random chance. Since each tree is an independent and identically distributed random sample in a binomial process (from the perspective of choosing a splitting variable in the root node), the test statistic is constructed based on the frequency of a feature being selected (each tree is a Bernoulli trial for selecting a feature), and then the features are ranked based on the observed test statistics, its resulting nominal p values, and its multiplicity adjusted q values. Furthermore, the binomialRF framework provides a general selection framework to identify two way and multiway interactions by generalizing the test statistic to count subtrees in the random forest using dynamic tree programming. Results: In simulation studies, the binomialRF algorithm performs competitively with respect to the state of the art in terms of classification accuracy, true model coverage, and controlling for false selection in identifying main effects while attaining substantial computational performance gains (between 30 to 600 times faster in high dimensional settings than the state of the art). In addition, extending the binomialRF using model averaging identified the true model on average with greater accuracy (>20% improvement in reducing false positive feature selection at high dimensions while maximizing true model coverage) and attained greater classification accuracy (between 4% to 9% improvement across all techniques) without sacrificing computational speed (2nd fastest performance after binomialRF). In addition, the framework easily scales and extends to identifying two way and K way interactions (i) without additional memory requirements (only requires storing original predictor matrix), and (ii) with minimal additional computational complexity cost due to efficient dynamic tree programming interaction searches. The algorithm was validated in a case study to predict bronchospasm related hospitalization from blood transcriptomes where the binomialRF algorithm correctly identified the previously published relevant physiological pathways, presented comparable classification accuracy in a validation set, and extended previous work in this area by looking at pathway pathway interactions. Conclusion: The proposed binomialRF proposes a novel and efficient feature selection method devoid of permutation tests that scales linearly in the number of trees, with minimal computational complexity, thus outperforming alternate conventional methods from a computational perspective while attaining competitive model selection and classification accuracies and enabling computations on common of cost effective high throughput infrastructures. Furthermore, the binomialRF model averaging framework greatly improves the accuracy of the feature predictions, controlling for false selection and substantially improving model and classification accuracy. Validated in numerical studies and retrospectively in a clinical trial (case study), the binomialRF paradigm offers a binomial framework to detect feature significance and easily extends to search for multiway interactions in a linear fashion, reducing a known non polynomial time exploration to linear approximations.

People often expressed it verbally through the use of heavy tonal stress and certain gestures clues like eye rolling, hands movement, etc. These tonal and gestural clues are obviously missing to express sarcasm in text, making its detection reliant upon other factors such as capitalization of words, punctuation mark, exclamation mark, etc. To express sarcasm in text, one often use positive or intensified positive words to express their negative feelings on a particular target. Nowadays, posting sarcastic messages on social media like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., has became a new trend to avoid direct negativity. Detecting these indirect negativity i.e., sarcasm in the social media text has become an important task as they influence every business organization. In the presence of sarcasm, sentiment analysis on these social media texts became the most challenging task. The property of sarcasm that makes it difficult to analyze and detect is the gap between its literal and intended meaning. Therefore, an automated system is required for sarcasm detection in textual data which would be capable of identifying actual sentiment of a given text in the presence of sarcasm. ::: ::: In this thesis, we proposed an automated system for sarcasm detection in tweets scripted in English as well as Hindi (Transliterated in English). It also detects sarcasm in Telugu conversation sentences (Transliterated in English). Sarcasm detection methods in the text can be categorized as rule-based, pattern-based, machine learning-based and context-based. ::: ::: Rule-based approach is the most basic method used for sarcasm detection in the text. In this approach, we mainly focus on hyperbolic and syntactic features of the text. Interjections, intensifiers and punctuation symbols are the most frequent hyperbole features used in the text to infer sarcastic messages. The extreme adjective and extreme adverb act as intensifiers for the text. Some examples of intensifiers are thoroughly enjoyed, fantastic weather, so beautiful, etc. The rule-based approach is simple to implement and often attains good accuracy for text classification. Three rule-based classification methods are proposed, one each for English, Hindi and Telugu. ::: ::: Pattern-based approach is the most effective classifier for sarcasm detection in the text. Here, a corpus of sarcastic tweets and conversation sentences were analyzed, and six unique patterns of the sarcastic text were obtained. The patterns are: sarcasm as a contradiction between tweet\u2019s sentiment and its situation phrases, sarcasm as a contradiction between user\u2019s likes and dislikes in Twitter data, sarcasm as a contradiction between a tweet and the universal truth, sarcasm as a contradiction between a tweet and its time-dependent facts, sarcasm as a contradiction between tweet\u2019s sentiment and its context on which it is posted, and a positive tweet with antonym pairs of either verbs or adverbs or adjectives. These approaches attain high accuracy for sarcasm detection in the text. ::: ::: ::: Machine learning-based approach is the most common technique used for classification. The performance of the machine learning classifiers often depends on dataset and feature set quality. In this thesis, lexical, syntactic, hyperbole, sentiment features are used in various machine learning algorithms. The classifiers evaluated are Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and AdaBoost. Among these classifiers, NB outperformed other classifiers because of independence of text features. In text classification (especially when training set is small), NB performs better than other classifiers. ::: ::: Context-based approach is the most important method for text classification. Sarcasm can be detected by considering lexical, pragmatic, hyperbolic or other such features of ::: the text. Some features can also be developed using certain patterns such as unigram, bigram, trigram, etc. There can be features based on verbal or gestural clues such as ::: emoticons, onomatopoeic expressions in laughter, positive interjections, quotation marks, use of punctuation which can help in detecting sarcasm. But all these features are not enough to identify sarcasm in text until the context of the text is known. The machine, as well as human, should be aware of the context of the text and relate it to general world knowledge to be able to identify sarcasm more accurately. In this approach, we mainly focus on situation, topical, temporal, and historical context of the text.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4018/978-1-5225-7186-5.ch010", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2908196369", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:68027325"}

Existing semi-supervised classification methods often have difficulty in dealing with multi-class/multi-label problems due to the lack in consideration of label correlation, our algorithm instead emphasizes dynamic metric fusion with label information.

Using special new product operations, the whole game can be expressed with a factored, modular representation.

The high branching factor can lead to data fragmentation, where decisions have little or no statistical support. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble method, Random Ordinality Ensembles (ROE), that circumvents this problem, and provides signif- icantly improved accuracies over other popular ensemble methods. We perform a random projection of the categorical data into a continuous space by imposing random ordinality on categorical attribute values. A decision tree that learns on this new continuous space is able to use binary splits, hence avoiding the data fragmentation problem. A majority-vote ensemble is then constructed with several trees, each learnt from a differ- ent continuous space. An empirical evaluation on 13 datasets shows this simple method to significantly outperform standard techniques such as Boosting and Random Forests. Theoretical study using an information gain framework is carried out to explain RO performance. Study shows that ROE is quite robust to data fragmentation problem and Random Ordinality (RO) trees are significantly smaller than trees generated using multi-way split.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-02326-2_23", "venue": "MCS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2066978187,2055754951", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59710508", "207738357", "89141", "60993494", "683036", "56776745", "12394453", "26648065", "6644398", "15137276", "61437731", "5262555", "15901912", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["14227815"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1198857"}

Ensemble methodologies have evolved to leverage potentially thousands of base classifiers that are usually instantiations of the same underlying model (e.g., neural networks, decision trees). Random forest (RF) is a classical ensemble classification algorithm which gives the bound of generalization error (or probability of misclassification) of ensemble classifier, but the bound cannot directly address application spaces in which error costs are inherently unequal. However, the error costs in medical image classification are inherently unequal. In this paper, we propose an improved classification algorithm based on random forest (IRFA) to solve the classification problem. It leverages key elements of the derivation of generalization error bound to derive bounds on detection rate (DET) and false alarms rate (FAR) on ROC and gives the performance optimization guidelines for tuning class-specific correlation inferred from the bounds for each region.

Recently, manifold learning (ML) has been used to perform CBIR in a low dimensional representation of the high dimensional image descriptor space to avoid the curse of dimensionality. ML schemes are computationally expensive, requiring an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) for every new query image to learn its low dimensional representation. We present out-of-sample extrapolation utilizing semi-supervised ML (OSE-SSL) to learn the low dimensional representation without recomputing the EVD for each query image. OSE-SSL incorporates semantic information, partial class label, into a ML scheme such that the low dimensional representation co-localizes semantically similar images. In the context of prostate histopathology, gland morphology is an integral component of the Gleason score which enables discrimination between prostate cancer aggressiveness. Images are represented by shape features extracted from the prostate gland.

Thus, this paper develops the classification of lightning transient signals with and without fault. Multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is used to analyze those signals considering five mother wavelets and different decomposition levels of three phase voltages. In this manner, Spectral Energy and Machine Learning as Artificial Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine are employed to classify those signals. On the other hand, the developed work in this paper analyzes most important parameters of lightning strokes, which are essentials in producing conditions with and without fault.

ABSTRACT We propose a dual pathway, 11\u2010layers deep, three\u2010dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for the challenging task of brain lesion segmentation. The devised architecture is the result of an in\u2010depth analysis of the limitations of current networks proposed for similar applications. To overcome the computational burden of processing 3D medical scans, we have devised an efficient and effective dense training scheme which joins the processing of adjacent image patches into one pass through the network while automatically adapting to the inherent class imbalance present in the data. Further, we analyze the development of deeper, thus more discriminative 3D CNNs. In order to incorporate both local and larger contextual information, we employ a dual pathway architecture that processes the input images at multiple scales simultaneously. For post\u2010processing of the network's soft segmentation, we use a 3D fully connected Conditional Random Field which effectively removes false positives. Our pipeline is extensively evaluated on three challenging tasks of lesion segmentation in multi\u2010channel MRI patient data with traumatic brain injuries, brain tumours, and ischemic stroke. We improve on the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art for all three applications, with top ranking performance on the public benchmarks BRATS 2015 and ISLES 2015. Our method is computationally efficient, which allows its adoption in a variety of research and clinical settings.

Various studies have been done for the classification of these facial expressions. There is strong evidence for the universal facial expressions of eight emotions which include: neutral happy, sadness, anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and surprise. So it is very important to detect these emotions on the face as it has wide applications in the field of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. These fields are researching on the facial emotions to get the sentiments of the humans automatically. In Robotics, emotions classification can be used to enhance human-robot interactions since the robot is capable of interpreting a human reaction [13]. In this paper, the emotion detection has been done in both real-time and static images. In this project, we have used the Cohn-Kanade Database (CK) and the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database, which comprises many static images 640 \u00d7 400 pixels and for the real-time using the webcam. The target expression for each sequence in the datasets are fully FACS (Facial action coding system) coded and emotion labels have been revised and validated [3]. So for emotion recognition initially we need to detect the faces by using HAAR filter from OpenCV in the static images or in the real-time videos. Once the face is detected it can be cropped and processed for further detection of facial landmarks. Then using facial landmarks the datasets are trained using the machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) and then classified according to the eight emotions [1]. Using SVM we were getting the accuracy of around 93.7%. These facial landmarks can be modified for getting better accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/icisc.2018.8398861", "venue": "2018 2nd International Conference on Inventive Systems and Control (ICISC)", "journal": "2018 2nd International Conference on Inventive Systems and Control (ICISC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2811041611", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["141196166", "11828808", "11844016", "8693566", "9192390", "2117401", "9045232", "2637589", "9424558", "497628", "3345911", "15823252", "57084593", "207578069", "14294002", "7376030", "3075075"], "inbound_citations": ["210694140", "133607620"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49541939"}

Learning in such systems, particularly those with multiple objectives, takes a considerable amount of time because of the size of the environment and dependencies between goals. Transfer Learning (TL) has been shown to reduce learning time in single-agent, single-objective applications. It is the process of sharing knowledge between two learning tasks called the source and target. The source is required to have been completed prior to the target task. This work proposes extending TL to multi-agent, multi-objective applications. To achieve this, an on-line version of TL called Parallel Transfer Learning (PTL) is presented.

While many studies focus on methodological developments in data reduction, less attention is paid to the assessment of the proposed methods in detailed urban hyperspectral land-cover mapping, using state-of-the-art image classification approaches. In this study we evaluate the potential of two unsupervised data reduction techniques, the Autoassociative Neural Network (AANN) and the BandClust method \u2013 the first a transformation based approach, the second a feature-selection based approach \u2013 for mapping of urban land cover at a high level of thematic detail, using an APEX 288-band hyperspectral dataset. Both methods were tested in combination with four state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers: Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (ADB), the multiple layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machines (SVM). When used in combination with a strong learner (MLP, SVM) BandClust produces classification accuracies similar to or higher than obtained with the full dataset, demonstrating the method\u2019s capability of preserving critical spectral information, required for the classifier to successfully distinguish between the 22 urban land-cover classes defined in this study. In the AANN data reduction process, on the other hand, important spectral information seems to be compromised or lost, resulting in lower accuracies for three of the four classifiers tested. Detailed analysis of accuracies at class level confirms the superiority of the SVM/Bandclust combination for accurate urban land-cover mapping using a reduced hyperspectral dataset.

However predicate tests rely on time-consuming, manual labor. The main goal of this research was to show how predicate tests could be automated with text classification models using a previously annotated dataset. We compared classifier performance between WEKA\u2019s Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Bayesian Logistic Regression implementations using the emergent process and sequential process ontological categories as labels. We compared model performance using WEKA\u2019s N-Gram tokenizer with 3-grams vs. using Java\u2019s WordTokenizer to convert our word dataset to numerical vectors. Models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation considering accuracy, F-measure, and kappa coefficient as measures of performance.

The projected audio features reflect individual music preference adaptively since they are calculated by considering correlations with the user's EEG signals during listening to musical pieces that the user likes/dislikes via a novel CCA proposed in this paper. The novel CCA, called KDLPCCA, can consider not only a non-linear correlation but also local properties and discriminative information of each class sample, namely, music likes/dislikes. Specifically, local properties reflect intrinsic data structures of the original audio features, and discriminative information enhances the power of the final classification. Hence, the projected audio features have an optimal correlation with individual music preference reflected in the user's EEG signals, adaptively. If the KDLPCCA-based projection that can transform original audio features into novel audio features is calculated once, our method can extract projected audio features from a new musical piece without newly observing individual EEG signals.

We conduct a comparison with the popular Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) that, unlike the SVM, has not been applied to phosphorylation site prediction. The resulting CRUM and RVM predictors offer comparable predictive performance to the SVM. The main advantages of CRUM and RVM over the SVM are: 1. An estimation of the posterior probability of the site being phosphorylatable, providing biologists an important measurement of the uncertainty of the prediction. 2. A more parsimonious model, leading to a reduction in prediction run-time that is important in predictions on large-scale data.

To obtain consistent results from different Landsat instruments, an empirical line correction approach was introduced to adjust the sensor-associated differences in band configurations and spectral responses. Significant changes in the major wetland cover types in Poyang Lake were revealed from long-term classification maps. The vegetation coverage of Poyang wetland showed a statistically significant increasing trend during the overall period (15.9 km2 year\u2212 1), and the vegetation tended to spread into the lake center in the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in recent years. At the same time, out-of-phase variability was observed for the mudflats since 1984, with a significant shrinking trend of \u2212 12.1 km2 year\u2212 1 (p", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2014.10.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "1994652972", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33982280", "5516775", "104293308", "1186354", "38865532", "214891768", "85501525", "58013992", "54814690", "17543155", "53714537", "203631660", "18105257", "204247508", "60442741", "14033424", "7436443", "59419509", "131153859", "133884245", "4844919", "13761111", "52026422"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129615642"}

In this paper, we propose a joint neural model which performs entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, without the need of any manually extracted features or the use of any external tool. Specifically, we model the entity recognition task using a CRF (Conditional Random Fields) layer and the relation extraction task as a multi-head selection problem (i.e., potentially identify multiple relations for each entity). We present an extensive experimental setup, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using datasets from various contexts (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and languages (i.e., English, Dutch).

Existing methods for interest point detection provide a sparse representation of actions and require a costly exhaustive search over the entire spatio-temporal volume for action classification. Our contribution here is two-fold -first, we combine the interest point models of actions with pedestrian detection and tracking using a Conditional Random Field (CRF); second, we extend existing interest point detectors to provide a dense action representation while minimizing spurious detections. The larger number of interest points and the high-level reasoning provided by the CRF allows us to automatically recognize action sequences from an unsegmented stream, at real time speed.

In this work, we present a synthetic network, including a symmetric equilibrium generative adversarial network (SEGAN), mul-ti-scale features refine blocks (MSFRB), and attention mechanism (AM) to enhance the performance on vessel segmentation especially for thin vessels. Method: The proposed network is granted powerful multi-scale repre-sentation capability. First, SEGAN is proposed to construct a symmetric adversarial architecture, which forces gener-ator to produce more realistic images with local details. Second, MSFRB are devised to prevent high-resolution features from being obscured, thereby preserving multi-scale features. Finally, the AM is employed to encourage the network to concentrate on discriminative features. Results: On public dataset DRIVE, STARE, and CHASEDB1, we evaluate our network quantitatively and compare it with state-of-the-art works. The ablation experiment shows that SEGAN, MSFRB, and AM both contribute to the desirable performance of our network. Conclusion: The proposed network outperforms other strategies and effectively functions in elusive vessels segmentation, achieving highest scores in Sensitivity, G-Mean, Precision, and F1-Score while maintaining the top level in other metrics.

In this study, a state-of-art random forests sub-Golgi protein classifier, rfGPT, was developed. The rfGPT used 2-gap dipeptide and split amino acid composition for the feature vectors and was combined with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) feature selection method. The rfGPT was trained on a sub-Golgi protein sequence data set (137 sequences), with sequence identity less than 25%.

Therefore, the rfGPT is a more practical tool, because no sequence alignment is required with tens of millions of protein sequences. To date, the rfGPT is the Golgi classifier with the best independent testing scores, optimized by training on smaller benchmark data sets.

Here, we demonstrate that raw sequences can be rapidly sorted into groups, in practice corresponding to genera, by exploiting differences in nucleotide GC content. To do so, we introduce GCSpeciesSorter, which uses classification, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the C4.5 decision tree generator, to differentiate sequences. It also implements a secondary BLAST feature to identify known outliers. In the test case presented, a hermatypic coral holobiont, the cnidarian host includes various endosymbionts. The best characterized and most common of these symbionts are zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium. GCSpeciesSorter separates cnidarian from Symbiodinium sequences with a high degree of accuracy.

A series of RADARSAT-2 quad-pol images were acquired between October 2011 and April 2012. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification scheme was used on three sets of features: the elements of the polarimetric coherency matrix [ T ] , the parameters extracted from a polarimetric decomposition based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of [ T ] and the parameters extracted from a model-based decomposition. Using a single image, the results show that the best classification accuracies ( \u2248 75 % ) are obtained using the [ T ] matrix with the October images. When adding a second image to the feature set, either from two different dates or two incidence angles, the classification accuracy is improved and reaches 90 . 1 % with two images from October 2011 and April 2012 at 27 \u2218 incidence.

The document level classification approximately classifies the sentiment using Bag of words in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

In the phase of classification, the ensemble system is capable to select adaptively feature subspaces which are supposed to be immune to the nonstationary disturbance and to make the final decision by combining the individual decisions of classifiers built in these subspaces.

However, these preconditions considerably limit traditional motor fault diagnosis methods. To address this issue, a new mechanical fault diagnosis method was proposed. Firstly, the vibration signals of motors were collected by the designed acquisition system. Subsequently, variational mode decomposition (VMD) was adopted to decompose the signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions and extract the characteristics of the vibration signals based on sample entropy. Finally, a united random forest improvement based on a SPRINT algorithm was employed to identify vibration signals of rotating machinery, and each branch tree was trained by applying different bootstrap sample sets.

Zadeh* Existing search engines, with Google at the top, have many truly remarkable capabilities. Furthermore, constant progress is being made in improving their performance. But what is not widely recognized is that there is a basic capability which existing search engines do not have: deduction capability \u2013 the capability to synthesize an answer to a query by drawing on bodies of information which reside in various parts of the knowledge base. By definition, a question answering system, ora Q/A system for short, is a system which has deduction capability. Can a search engine be upgraded to a questionanswering system through the use of existing tools \u2013 tools which are based on bivalent logic and probability theory? A view which is articulated in the following is that the answer is: No. The first obstacle is world knowledge \u2013 the knowledge which humans acquire through experience, communication and education. Simple examples are: \u201cIcy roads are slippery,\u201d \u201cPrinceton usually means Princeton University,\u201d \u201cParis is the capital of France,\u201d and \u201cThere are no honest politicians.\u201d World knowledge plays a central role in search, assessment of relevance and deduction. *Professor in the Graduate School and Director, Berkeley initiative in Soft Computing (BISC), Computer Science Division and the Electronics Research Laboratory, Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1776; Telephone: 510-642-4959; Fax: 510-642-1712; E-Mail: zadeh@cs.berkeley.edu . Research supported in part by ONR N00014-02-1-0294, BT Grant CT1080028046, Omron Grant, Tekes Grant and the BISC Program of UC Berkeley. The problem with world knowledge is that it is, for the most part, perception-based. Perceptions\u2013and especially perceptions of probabilities\u2013are intrinsically imprecise, reflecting the fact that human sensory organs, and ultimately the brain, have a bounded ability to resolve detail and store information. Imprecision of perceptions stands in the way of using conventional techniques \u2013 techniques which are based on bivalent logic and probability theory \u2013 to deal with perception-based information. A further complication is that much of world knowledge is negative knowledge in the sense that it relates to what is impossible and/or non-existent. For example, \u201cA person cannot have two fathers,\u201d and \u201cNetherlands has no mountains.\u201d The second obstacle centers on the concept of relevance. There is an extensive literature on relevance, and every search engine deals with relevance in its own way, some at a high level of sophistication. But what is quite obvious is that the problem of assessment of relevance is quite complex and far from solution. There are two kinds of relevance: (a) question relevance and (b) topic relevance. Both are matters of degree. For example, on a very basic level, if the question is q : \u201cNumber of cars in California?\u201d and the available information is p : \u201cPopulation of California is 37,000,000,\u201d then what is the degree of relevance of p to q ? Another example: To what degree is a paper entitled \u201cA New Approach to Natural Language Understanding\u201d of relevance to the topic of machine translation. Basically, there are two ways of approaching assessment of relevance: (a) semantic; and (b) statistical. To illustrate, in the number of cars example, relevance of p to q is a matter of semantics and world knowledge. In existing search engines, relevance is largely a matter of statistics, involving counts of links and words, with little if any consideration of semantics. Assessment of semantic relevance presents difficult problems whose solutions lie beyond the reach of bivalent logic and probability theory. What should be noted is that assessment of topic relevance is more amendable to the use of statistical techniques, which explains why existing search engines are much better at assessment of topic relevance then question relevance. The third obstacle is deduction from perception-based information. As a basic example, assume that the question is q : What is the average height of Swedes?, and the available information is p : Most adult Swedes are tall. Another example is: Usually Robert returns from work at about 6 pm. What is the probability that Robert is at home at 6:15 pm? Neither bivalent logic nor probability theory provide effective tools for dealing with problems of this type. The difficulty is centered on deduction from premises which are both uncertain and imprecise. Underlying the problems of world knowledge, relevance and deduction is a very basic problem \u2013 the problem of natural language understanding. Much of world knowledge and web knowledge is expressed in a natural language. A natural language is basically a system for describing perceptions. Since perceptions are intrinsically imprecise, so are natural languages. A prerequisite to mechanization of question-answering is mechanization of natural language understanding, and a prerequisite to mechanization of natural language understanding is precisiation of meaning of concepts and proposition drawn from a natural language. To deal effectively with world knowledge, relevance, deduction and precisiation, new tools are needed. The principal new tools are: Precisiated Natural Language (PNL); Protoform Theory (PFT); and the Generalized Theory of Uncertainty (GTU). These tools are drawn from fuzzy logic\u2013a logic in which everything is, or is allowed to be, a matter of degree. The centerpiece of the new tools is the concept of a generalized constraint. The importance of the concept of a generalized constraint derives from the fact that in PNL and GTU it serves as a basis for generalizing the universally accepted view that information is statistical in nature. More specifically, the point of departure in PNL and GTU is the fundamental premise that, in general, information is representable as a system of generalized constraints, with statistical information constituting a special case. This, much more general, view of information is needed to deal effectively with world knowledge, relevance, deduction, precisiation and related problems. In summary, the principal objectives of this paper are: (a) to make a case for the view that a quantum jump in search engine IQ cannot be achieved through the use of methods based on bivalent logic and probability theory; and (b) to introduce and outline a collection of non-standard concepts, ideas and tools which are needed to achieve a quantum jump in search engine IQ.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-34783-6_1", "venue": null, "journal": "Capturing Intelligence", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2756141375,1538502651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["33551918", "51990745", "60042906", "8469928", "207847391", "153945720", "18637478", "15117704", "956479", "53615315", "49355239", "67840418", "32227092", "52987048", "13515234", "23677255", "1158583", "17445312", "16899756", "16233997", "17481578", "21576074", "12705912", "8289332", "14527170", "6466648", "6466648", "15342737", "8530757", "14017885", "7558383", "13583525", "10317799", "18419421", "14663585", "6926654", "9529800", "9529800", "12711451"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14485175"}

To bridge the performance gap between the FR-IQA and NR-IQA methods, we propose a NR-IQA method based on multi-task generative adversarial network, which attempts to restore dependable hallucinated images to compensate for the missing corresponding reference images. Two tasks, hallucination images and the quality maps are outputted by the generator and are combined with the specific loss to improve the reliability of hallucination images. Besides, two discriminator networks are used to respectively distinguish the undistorted images and hallucination images pairs, quality maps and structural similarity index measurement maps pairs. Finally, the hallucination images and distorted images are input into the IQA network, and quality scores are evaluated based on the differences between them.

A hybrid fault diagnosis approach is proposed using model-based residuals as input to a set of data-driven fault classifiers. As a case study, sensor data from an internal combustion engine test bed is used where faults have been injected into the system and a physical-based mathematical model of the air flow through the engine is available. First, a feature selection algorithm is applied to find a minimal set of residuals that is able to separate the different fault modes. Then, two different fault classification approaches are discussed, Random Forests and one-class Support Vector Machines. A set of one-class Support Vector Machines is used to model data from each fault mode separately. The case study illustrates an advantage of using one-class classifiers, which makes it possible to detect unknown faults by identifying samples not belonging to any known fault mode.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ifacol.2019.09.046", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC-PapersOnLine", "mag_id": "2974537164", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203707222"}

However, when feature engineering is applied to feature extraction of sEMG signals, important feature information in the signals will inevitably be omitted, which will reduce the performance of signal analysis and recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to complete classification of sEMG hand movements based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and stacking ensemble learning. In this method, a primary classifier based on CNN is designed to extract sEMG data features, which avoid omission of important feature information. A secondary classifier based on the stacking method is designed to integrate three primary classifiers trained with time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain data of the sEMG signal respectively. Then, several experiments on NinaPro DB5 dataset is performed to evaluate the proposed models. When the window length is 200ms, primary classifier is trained and tested with the sEMG signal data divided by the 80ms, 100ms, and 125ms sliding length. The best accuracy can reach 71%. The primary classifier and the secondary classifier trained and tested with sEMG signal data divided by window lengths of 200ms and 300ms in the case of a sliding length of 100ms. When the window length is 200ms, the best primary classifier accuracy and the best secondary classifier accuracy can be 70.92% and 72.09%, respectively. On the window length of 300ms, the best primary classifier accuracy and the best secondary classifier accuracy can reach 75.02% and 76.02%, respectively.

Under the same conditions, the average accuracy of the secondary classifier is 11.5%, 13.6%. and 10.1% higher than LDA, SVM, and LCNN, respectively.

However, the model was not capable of predicting low counts of FIB during both training and testing stages of the models. The ZI and RF models were more consistent when applied to testing data, and they predicted FIB concentrations that characterized the observed FIB concentrations. While these models might need further improvement, results of this study indicate that ZI and RF regression models have high prospects as tools for the real-time prediction of FIB in raw water sources for proactive microbial risk management in water treatment plants.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30045540", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.140", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "2793431487", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52893759", "49664901"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51721395"}

Due to the aspects of short duration and subtle movement, it is challenging to extract spatiotemporal features of micro-expressions. The existing methods only extract features in the three-dimensional orthogonal plane and fail to make full use of that information. To solve this problem, we propose a new Local Cubes Binary Patterns (LCBP) method for micro-expression recognition. LCBP is cascaded by the motion information <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LCBP_{direction}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, the amplitude information <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LCBP_{amplitudes}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, and the spatial information <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LCBP_{3D}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> to obtain the spatiotemporal features. The advantage of LCBP is its ability to preserve the spatiotemporal information and the low feature dimension. Furthermore, to increase the discrimination of features in micro-expression sequences, we apply a differential calculation energy map to find regions of interest (ROI) for getting a weighted energy map. The final micro-expression feature acquired by fusing the LCBP features and the weighted energy map are classified through the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The model is configured by using a two sample t-test technique and Total Intracranial Volume (TIV) as a covariate. The altered voxels between data groups are considered as Voxel of Interests (VOIs) and the 3D masks are generated for GM and WM tissue probability maps.

The embedding learning process aims to generate modality-invariant joint representations for the question-image and question-answer pairs, respectively.

Specifically, the joint embedding of the question-image pair is learned by a three-level attention model, and the joint representation of the question-answer pair is learned by a semantic integration model. Through the adversarial leaning, the answer-related representation are better preserved. Then an answer predictor is proposed to infer the answer from the answer-related representation.

The upsurge in terrorist attacks in the past few years has focused research on biometric systems that have the ability to identify individuals from a distance, and this is spearheading research interest in Gait biometric due to being unobtrusive and less dependent on high image/video quality. Gait biometric is a behavioral trait that aims to identify individuals from image sequences based on their walking style. The growing list of possible civil as well as security applications for various purposes is paralleled by the emergence of a variety of research challenges in dealing with a various external as well as internal factors influencing the performance of Gait Recognition (GR) in unconstrained recording conditions. ::: This thesis is concerned with Gait Recognition in unconstrained scenarios aims to address research questions covering (1) The selection of sets of features for a gait signature; (2) The effects of gender and/or recoding condition case (neutral, carrying a bag, coat wearing) on the performance of GR schemes; (3) Integrating gender and/or case classifications into GR; and (4) The role of emerging Kinect sensor technology, with its capability of sensing human skeletal features in GR and applications. Accordingly, our objectives will focus on investigating, developing and testing the performance of using a variety of gait sequencefeatures for the various components/tasks and their integration. Our tests are based on large number of experiments based on CASIA B database as well as an in-house database of Kinect sensor recording. In all experiments, we use different dimension reduction and feature selection methods do reduce the dimensions in these proposed feature vectors, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Fisher Score, followed by different classification methods like; k-nearest-neighbour (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and linear discriminant classifier (LDC), to test the performance of the proposed methods. ::: The initial part is focused on reviewing existing background removal for indoor and outdoor scenarios and developing more efficient versions primarily by adopting the work for wavelet domain rather than the traditional spatial domain based schemes. These include motion detection by frame differencing and Mixture of Gaussians, the latter being more reliable for outdoor scenarios. Subsequently, we investigated a variety of features that can be extractedfrom various subbands of wavelet-decomposed frames of different body parts (partitioned according to the golden ratio). We gradually built sets of features, together with their fused combinations, that can categorized as hybrid of model-based and motion-based models. The first list of features developed to deal with Neutral Gait Recognition (NGR) includes: Spatio-Temporal Model (STM), Legs Motion Detection Feature (LMD), and the Statistical model of the approximation LL-wavelet subband images (AWM). We shall demonstrate that fusing these features achieves accuracy of 97%, which is comparable to the state of the art. These features will be shown to achieve 96% accuracy in gender classification (GC), and we shall establish that the NGR2 scheme that integrates GC into NGR improves the accuracy by a noticeable percentage. ::: Testing the performance of these NGR schemes in recognising non-neutral cases revealed the challenges of Unrestricted Gait Recognition (UGR). The second part of the thesis is focused on developing UGR schemes. ::: For this, first a new statistical wavelet feature set extracted from high frequency subbands, called Detail coefficients Wavelet Model (DWM) was added to the previous list. Using different combinations of these schemes, will be shown to significantly improve the performance for non-neutral gait cases, but to less extent in the coat wearing case. We then develop a Gait Sequence Case Detection (GSCD) which has excellent performance. We will show that integrating GSCD and GC together into UGR improves the performance for all cases. We shall also investigate the different UGS scheme that generalizes existing work on Gait Energy and Gait Entropy images (GEI and GEnI) features but in the wavelet domain and in different body parts. Testing these two schemes, and their fusion, post the PCA dimension reduction yield much improved accuracy for the non-neutral cases compared to existing scheme GEI and GEnI schemes, but are significantly outperformed by the last scheme. However, by fusing the UGS scheme with the GSCD+GC+UGR scheme above we will get best accuracy that outperform the state of the art in GR specially in the non-neutral cases. ::: The thesis ended by conducting a rather limited investigation on the use of the Kinect sensors for GR. We develop two sets of features: Horizontal Distance Features and Vertical Distance Features from small set of skeleton point trajectories. The experimental result on neutral was very successful but for the unrestricted gait recognition (with the 5 case variations) satisfactory but not optimal performance relies on the gallery including balanced number of samples from all cases.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2507568765", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28683502"}

However, irrespective of the difficulty of a question, the contributor of an accepted answer is awarded with the same 'reputation' score, which may demotivate an user's additional efforts to answer a difficult question. To facilitate a question difficulty aware rewarding system, this study proposes SOQDE (Stack Overflow Question Difficulty Estimation), a supervised learning based Question difficulty estimation model for the StackOverflow. To design SOQDE, we randomly selected 936 questions from a SO datadump exported during September 2017. Two of the authors independently labeled those questions into three categories (basic, intermediate, or advanced), where conflicting labels were resolved through tie-breaking votes from a third author. We performed an empirical study to determine how the difficulty of a question impacts its outcomes, such as number of votes, resolution time, and number of votes. Our results suggest that the answers of a basic question receive more votes and therefore would generate more reputation points for an answerer. Due to less incentives relative to efforts spent by an answerer, intermediate and advanced questions encounter significantly more delays than the basic questions, which further validates the need of a model like SOQDE. To build our model, we have identified textual and contextual features of a question and divided them into two categories-pre-hoc and post-hoc features. We observed a model based on Random Forest achieving the highest mean accuracy (67.6%), using only answer-independent pre-hoc features.

Changes in both the soil and the terrestrial carbon storage occur due to the interactions of natural ecological processes and anthropogenic activities. Research gaps to quantify soil and terrestrial carbon still exist. To discern between the actual and attainable carbon pools is critical to identify suitable adaptation and management alternatives to optimize natural carbon capital in the context of regional imposed changes, such as land use and climate change. Our objectives were to: (i) assess the spatially explicit relationships between observed soil organic carbon (SOC) and environmental factors and (ii) assess actual (TerrCactual) and attainable (TerrCattain) terrestrial carbon capital considering below-ground (soil) and above-ground (biomass) carbon. We collected 234 soil samples in the topsoil (0\u201320 cm) in 2008 and 2009 across the Suwannee River Basin in Florida, USA, based on a random design stratified by land cover/land use and soil suborders. For above-ground carbon assessment, we derived data from the LANDFIRE project which provided a high-resolution map of year-2000 baseline estimates of biomass carbon. A comprehensive set of 172 soil-environmental and human covariates was assembled from multiple data sources to predict and validate observed SOC stocks and TerrCactual using Random Forest (RF). The STEP-AWBH conceptual model (with S: Soil, T: Topography, E: Ecology, P: Parent material, A: Atmosphere, W: Water, B: Biota, and H: Human factors) provided the conceptual modeling framework to model TerrCattain that was implemented using RF and simulated annealing in combination. In the simulation, the STEP factors were kept constant, but the AWBH factors were varied by \u00b110, \u00b120, and \u00b130 %. The combined factors which amount to the highest modeled terrestrial carbon stocks were postulated to equal the attainable terrestrial carbon stocks. Results suggest that the TerrCattain stocks showed slightly larger amounts than the TerrCactual stocks across the basin. The TerrCactual was 190 Tg C and the maximum TerrCattain was 195 Tg C. Biotic, soil, parent material, topographic, and water-related factors played important roles in determining SOC storage, while human factors were only weak predictors. Although mean annual precipitation and monthly mean temperature in summer months were significant to explain both SOC and terrestrial carbon stocks, they showed moderate/minor influence on carbon storage. The land use/land cover variables were the strongest factors predicting soil and terrestrial carbon stocks. These findings suggest that land use adaptions have much potential to achieve TerrCattain, specifically conversions from cropland to land use systems with larger net primary productivity.

The second is the lack of spatial information in the classifier as the conventional ELM only utilizes spectral information for classification of HSI. To tackle these two problems, a new framework for ELM-based spectral\u2013spatial classification of HSI is proposed, where probabilistic modeling with sparse representation and weighted composite features (WCFs) is employed to derive the optimized output weights and extract spatial features. First, ELM is represented as a concave logarithmic-likelihood function under statistical modeling using the maximum a posteriori estimator. Second, sparse representation is applied to the Laplacian prior to efficiently determine a logarithmic posterior with a unique maximum in order to solve the ill-posed problem of ELM. The variable splitting and the augmented Lagrangian are subsequently used to further reduce the computation complexity of the proposed algorithm. Third, the spatial information is extracted using the WCFs to construct the spectral\u2013spatial classification framework.

This approach, nonetheless, demands a considerable amount of time and resources such as kits and reagents that, in endemic areas, may result in a substantial financial burden over affected individuals and health services veering away from RT-PCR analysis. This study presents a powerful combination of high-resolution mass spectrometry and a machine-learning prediction model for data analysis to assess the existence of ZIKV infection across a series of patients that bear similar symptomatic conditions, but not necessarily are infected with the disease. By using mass spectrometric data that are inputted with the developed decision-making algorithm, we were able to provide a set of features that work as a \"fingerprint\" for this specific pathophysiological condition, even after the acute phase of infection.

First, face candidates are extracted using similarity matching of Gabor filter responses in M-style grid. Then, a hierarchy of SVM classifiers trained on PCA subspaces is applied to the candidates. Two steps of SVMs are trained on different number of PCA features and resolution images. The combination of classifiers based on different types of features, frequency and intensity, significantly reduces the false positives due to complementary characteristics of their domains in classification. Coarse-to-fine search by three steps of detection also reduces run-time complexity. Our system can speed up conventional SVM classifier by a factor of 40 resulting in comparable face detection rate (FDR). In addition, the center positions of both eyes are efficiently detected by iterative binary thresholding method with contour tracing in the accurately localized face region.

Compared to a standard voting technique for combining the results of multiple entity extractors, the SVM approach produces comparable precision and recall statistics but tends to utilize fewer of the component entity extractors, thus providing superior computational efficiency, which is critical in practical applications. In this paper, we present our experimental results of comparing a standard voting technique with SVM that each aggregate four entity extractors.

Additionally, on the ECOC framework we can apply the subclass technique (sub-ECOC), where by splitting the initial classes of the problem we create larger but easier to solve ECOC configurations. The multi-class problem's decomposition is achieved via a discriminant tree creation procedure. This discriminant tree's creation is controlled by a triplet of thresholds that define a set of user defined splitting standards. The selection of the thresholds plays a major role in the classification performance. In our work we show that by optimizing these thresholds via particle swarm optimization we improve significantly the classification performance. Moreover, using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as classifiers we can optimize in the same time both the thresholds of sub-ECOC and the parameters C and \u03c3 of the SVMs, resulting in even better classification performance.

Two categories were selected for the FNA smears: malignant and nonmalignant. The system is constituted by the following stages of 1) data collection, 2) data selection 3) choice of suitable clinical and cytological features, 4) application of data mining method for the categorization of FNA biopsy smears. Furthermore a fundamental objective of the doctoral thesis was the improvement of suspect smears (suspicious) categorization, for the latter FNA Biopsy has a known restriction. The system had been trained and checked in relation to the sample that histologic evaluation existed (ground truth). For smears that characterized as nonmalignant by FNA and histological data we\u2019re not available, complementary clinical, laboratory and imaging evaluations took into account in order to create the sample. ::: ::: \u03a4he smears that were available in this thesis, were collected from FNA biopsies in Pathologoanatomy Laboratory, A\u2019 Pathology Department, Medical School of Athens University. Given that the above referred laboratory is a reference center, an important number of FNA smears were sent to it from other laboratories for cross check. The examination files were sorted in chronological order, but there were in paper forms. The requirements for the formation and the design of database system were collected. Based on the material of the diagnosis an improved system was designed and developed for data initialization and coding. The database was developed based on the design and analysis of requirements; in this database data were stored for further investigation. Analysis of the graphical user interface design was performed in parallel to the database design. Taking into account that the system might be used after the completion of thesis, the graphical user interface was designed in order to be user friendly and flexible environment. ::: ::: According to the methodological approach that was followed, the various cytological characteristic of 9102 FNA smears aspired among 2000-2004 was analyzed statistically. The cytological reports cross correlated with histological diagnoses, aiming to calculate the effect or contribution of each cytological characteristic to a false or true cytological diagnosis and to find the possible sources of erroneous diagnosis. The smears that have blood or a few follicular cells without colloid were characterized as insufficient for further diagnosis. The aspiration was performed either in \u0391\u2019 department of Athens University (most of the cases with palpable nodules) or elsewhere (mainly under guidance of the reference center). The acquired smears being send to the reference center from various hospitals with different protocols concerning criteria to perform a thyroid FNA. Histological reports were available for 266 patients. The small number of histological verifications was due to the heterogeneity and the lack of patients files. For evaluating of data, descriptive statistic values were used like mean, standard deviation, percentage, maximum and minimum. In addition to that \u03c72 tests of significance were performed in order to check possible correlation or independence. For correlating cytological and histological diagnosis and evaluating laboratory findings, apart from the descriptive statistic parameters also calculated sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, negative predictive value and positive predictive value. Method of statistical significance in the level of 5% (p < 0,05) was applied in order to specify if a disease was correlated to a cytological parameter. Those checks were performed for each disease category in correlation to any cytological parameter. Statistical analysis divided the smears into nonmalignant, malignant, neoplasms, suspicious for malignancy and borderline. ::: A diagnosis support system was implemented using data mining methods. The system is consisted of four stages. The First stage of the system is the Data Collection environment, which stores the data to the database. The Second stage of this system concerns the Selection of Data. User requirements concluded that 111 characteristics are needed to describe each patient (record). Most of them have binary values, presenting existence and not existence, other have alphanumeric and number values. Among them 60 were selected and 7 more are produced from grouping other characteristics. The final analysis reveals that 67 characteristics of the smears are capable for describing the structure of smears in general. ::: The Third stage of system concerns the Selection of Best Characteristics. Due to the high number of attributes (67 per case), it was essential to eliminate the characteristics that are connected linearly or do not bring diagnostics information. The choice of characteristics applied before the classification, having the aim of discovering a subset of characteristics that optimizes the process of classification. The technique of Sequential Float Forward Search (SFFS) was applied. The number of patients that used was 2,036 (1886 non malignancies and 150 malignancies). Among them all malignancies were histologically confirmed. In addition to that 140 no malignancies were histologically confirmed in correlation to evaluation of clinics, laboratorial and medical image actions (ultrasounds etc.). Among 2.036 smears the 25% used for characteristics selection, 37 smears of Malignant and smears of Non Malignant. The Sequential Float Forward Search (SFFS) Technique, choose the best 12 elements that they reveal high performance to FNA data categorization. ::: The Fourth stage is the Application of Classification using Data Mining Methods or in other words data mining method. For this aim a set of reliable, well confirmed but also modern methods applied. In addition to that the system was trained and was checked using the sample with histological verifications (ground truth). The independent application of four reliable methods, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and k-NN, resulting to comparable outcomes concerning those of FNA. However, further improvement was achieved with the application of Majority (Majority Vote - CMV) using of previous results of three algorithms Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and k-NN. The modified Artificial Immune System (AIS) was applied for first time. AIS presents particularly improved results for the categorization of smears, which are characterised \u201csuspicious\u201d by the experts and is a known weakness of FNA method. These cases constitute a very difficult part for the discrimination among non-malignant and malignant, even for a specialist. Since all these cases are faced clinically using FNA as malignancies, the application of an improved algorithmic method improves accordingly the management of these cases by decreasing the number of useless surgical thyroid operations.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "205517910", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196239832"}

In automatic traffic-sign maintenance and in a visual driver-assistance system, road-sign detection and recognition are two of the most important functions. Our system is able to detect and recognize circular, rectangular, triangular, and octagonal signs and, hence, covers all existing Spanish traffic-sign shapes. Road signs provide drivers important information and help them to drive more safely and more easily by guiding and warning them and thus regulating their actions. The proposed recognition system is based on the generalization properties of SVMs. The system consists of three stages: 1) segmentation according to the color of the pixel; 2) traffic-sign detection by shape classification using linear SVMs; and 3) content recognition based on Gaussian-kernel SVMs. Because of the used segmentation stage by red, blue, yellow, white, or combinations of these colors, all traffic signs can be detected, and some of them can be detected by several colors. Results show a high success rate and a very low amount of false positives in the final recognition stage. From these results, we can conclude that the proposed algorithm is invariant to translation, rotation, scale, and, in many situations, even to partial occlusions", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null,

Thus, image segmentation plays an important role in many multimedia applications.

By combination of Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), a color texture segmentation based on image pixel classification is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we first extract the pixel-level color feature and texture feature of the image via the local spatial similarity measure model and localized Fourier transform, which is used as input of FSVM model (classifier). We then train the FSVM model (classifier) by using FCM with the extracted pixel-level features. Color image segmentation can be then performed through the trained FSVM model (classifier).

In particular, a nonnegative sparse coding procedure is applied on the given SAR image patch set to generate the feature descriptors first.

FFT performs well in extracting saliency features and is not computationally intensive; CLD is able to represent the color features with high effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, this system utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on such features that needs small size of training sets, trains very fast and can classify floating rubbish and any other scenarios of water pollution with satisfying efficiency.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a well-known deep learning technique has shown a remarkable performance in visual recognition applications. However, using such networks in the area of hyperspectral image classification is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the high dimensionality and the insufficient training samples. In addition, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has attracted a lot of attentions in order to generate virtual training samples. In this paper, we present a new classification framework based on integration of multi-channel CNNs and new architecture for generator and discriminator of GANs to overcome Small Sample Size (SSS) problem in hyperspectral image classification. Further, in order to reduce the computational cost, the methods related to the reduction of subspace dimension were proposed to obtain the dominant feature around the training sample to generate meaningful training samples from the original one.

It has a declining population trend due to anthropogenic pressures. Human-driven climate change is expected to have substantial impacts. However, quantitative and transparent information on the ecological niche (potential as well as realized) of this species across the vast and complex eight nations of the HKH region is lacking. Such baseline information is not only crucial for identifying new populations but also for restoring locally-extinct populations, for understanding its bio-geographical evolution, as well as for prioritizing regions and an efficient management. First we compiled, and made publicly available through an institutional repository (dSPACE), the best known \u2018presence only\u2019 red panda dataset with ISO compliant metadata. This was done through the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD.org) data-platform to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org). We used data mining and machine learning algorithms such as high-performance commercial Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest, TreeNet, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines implementations. We averaged all these Geographic Information System (GIS) models for the first produced ensemble model for this species in the HKH region. Our predictive model is the first of its kind and allows to assess the red panda distribution based on empirical open access data, latest methods and the major signals and drivers of the ecological niche. It allows to assess and fine-tune earlier habitat area estimates. Our models promote \u2018best professional practices\u2019.

We show how a discrete-time recurrent \"Elman\" network architecture can be constructed from recurrently connected oscillatory associative memory modules described by continuous nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The modules can learn connection weights between themselves which will cause the system to evolve under a clocked \"machine cycle\" by a sequence of transitions of attractors within the modules, much as a digital computer evolves by transitions of its binary flip-flop attractors. The architecture thus employs the principle of \"computing with attractors\" used by macroscopic systems for reliable computation in the presence of noise. We have specifically constructed a system which functions as a finite state automaton that recognizes or generates the infinite set of six symbol strings that are defined by a Reber grammar. It is a symbol processing system, but with analog input and oscillatory subsymbolic representations. The time steps (machine cycles) of the system are implemented by rhythmic variation (clocking) of a bifurcation parameter. This holds input and \"context\" modules clamped at their attractors while 'hidden and output modules change state, then clamps hidden and output states while context modules are released to load those states as the new context for the next cycle of input.

In software analytics, at least for defect prediction, several methods, like grid search and differential evolution (DE), have been proposed to learn these parameters, which has been proved to be able to improve the performance scores of learners. ::: Objective: We want to evaluate which method can find better parameters in terms of performance score and runtime cost. ::: Methods: This paper compares grid search to differential evolution, which is an evolutionary algorithm that makes extensive use of stochastic jumps around the search space. ::: Results: We find that the seemingly complete approach of grid search does no better, and sometimes worse, than the stochastic search. When repeated 20 times to check for conclusion validity, DE was over 210 times faster than grid search to tune Random Forests on 17 testing data sets with F-Measure ::: Conclusions: These results are puzzling: why does a quick partial search be just as effective as a much slower, and much more, extensive search? To answer that question, we turned to the theoretical optimization literature. Bergstra and Bengio conjecture that grid search is not more effective than more randomized searchers if the underlying search space is inherently low dimensional. This is significant since recent results show that defect prediction exhibits very low intrinsic dimensionality-- an observation that explains why a fast method like DE may work as well as a seemingly more thorough grid search.

Also, in this new approach, the LS problem is formulated in the primal space but it ends up being solved in the dual space overcoming the fact that the regressors are unknown. The method is assessed and compared to the LS-SVM approach through 2 Monte Carlo (MC) experiments. Every experiment consists of 100 runs of a simulated example, and a different noise level is used in each experiment, with Signal to Noise Ratios of 20db and 10db, respectively. The obtained results are twofold, first the performance of the new method is comparable to the LS-SVM, for both noise levels, although the required calculations are much faster for the KPCR. Second, this new method reduces the dimension of the primal space and may convey a way of knowing the number of basis functions required in the Kernel.

Image analysis is one setting where one might want to infer whether a pixel patch contains an object that is \u201cmanmade\u201d (such as a building) or \u201cnatural\u201d (such as a tree). Suppose the label for a pixel patch is \u201cmanmade\u201d; if the label for a nearby pixel patch is then more likely to be \u201cmanmade\u201d there is structure in the output domain that can be exploited to improve pattern recognition performance. Modeling P(X) is difficult because features between parts of the model are often correlated. Therefore, conditional random fields (CRFs) model structured data using the conditional distribution P(Y|X = x), without specifying a model for P(X), and are well suited for applications with dependent features. This paper has two parts. First, we overview CRFs and their application to pattern recognition in structured problems. Our primary examples are image analysis applications in which there is dependence among samples (pixel patches) in the output domain.

Knowledge is acquired from many sources: from within the firm; from other firms; or from competitors, customers, suppliers, and channel partners. Managers must decide how to efficiently search through a universe of potential knowledge sources to select the knowledge that will be the most useful to them. This research examines the conditions under which partner similarity enhances knowledge transfer. Previous research has argued that partner similarity influences knowledge sharing through attraction. Building on past work, our research argues that attraction is only one mechanism by which partner similarity affects knowledge transfer and introduces the idea that partner similarity aids the search through a universe of potential knowledge sources. The dimensions of partner similarity that allow more efficient search will facilitate knowledge transfer, while those similarity dimensions that do not aid search will have a less important impact on transfer. Data from both quantitative and qualitative sources support these hypotheses. Quantitative analyses show that strategic similarity emerges as a more important dimension than customer or location similarities as a significant predictor of knowledge transfer. Qualitative interview data show that businesses are conscious of the strategic similarities within their industry and choose transfer partners accordingly. q 2000 Academic Press", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1006/obhd.2000.2885", "venue": null, "journal": "Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes", "mag_id": "2059164392", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53519711", "206384552", "15638711", "143785344", "110952537", "167980054", "16041013", "55924460", "167497907", "26285921", "207888107", "17369997", "14152901", "18988988", "145363387", "159347148", "49472373", "4336342", "59328515", "19017806", "3904750", "55796421", "14626908", "15908074", "150930", "23689969", "17280506", "108268946", "34226594", "51900712", "22716661", "18389981", "10722217", "5810913", "168343810", "14983632", "160004457", "201034231", "18469254", "17450331", "146779640", "56200461", "167340729", "67798050", "108662513", "12677960", "12766964", "201604670", "37389856", "17284315", "55608782", "5462858", "56199287", "89609121", "12618660", "45953477", "15631959", "30630385", "53598686", "166827512", "18671598", "214708462", "17706310", "27828359", "167952494", "10812477", "18910110", "16829083", "13233862", "8439216", "20053221", "18809008", "166516889", "54013518", "2357584", "149088772", "1906104", "18462119", "21772857", "18384759", "31152866", "28698149", "153783703", "14666431", "25167964", "15789985", "197676914", "145204233", "207796333", "19766831", "59455401", "2707501", "18566253", "8675321", "11193197", "14603418", "64604603", "55112886", "154668286", "7893124", "16312645", "157637119"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144740240"}

SNP genotyping by mapping DNA reads produced via Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on a reference genome is a very common and convenient approach in our days, but still prone to a significant error rate. The need of defining in silico true genetic variants in genomic and transcriptomic sequences is prompted by the high costs of the experimental validation through re-sequencing or SNP arrays, not only in terms of money but also time and sample availability. Several open-source tools have been recently developed to identify small variants in whole-genome data, but still the candidate variants, provided in the VCF output format, present a high false positive calling rate. Goal of this thesis work is the development of a bioinformatic method that classifies variant calling outputs in order to reduce the number of false positive calls. With the aim to dissect the molecular bases of grape acidity (Vitis vinifera L.), this tool has been then used to select SNPs in two grapevine varieties, which show very different content of organic acids in the berry. The VCF parameters have been used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that classifies the VCF records in true and false positive variants, cleaning the output from the most likely false positive results. The SVM approach has been implemented in a new software, called VerySNP, and applied to model and non-model organisms. In both cases, the machine learning method efficiently recognized true positive from false positive variants in both genomic and transcriptomic sequences. In the second part of the thesis, VerySNP was applied to identify true SNPs in RNA-seq data of the grapevine variety Gora Chirine, characterized by low acidity, and Sultanine, a normal acidity variety closely related to Gora. The comparative transcriptomic analysis crossed with the SNP information lead to discover non-synonymous polymorphisms inside coding regions and, thus, provided a list of candidate genes potentially affecting acidity in grapevine.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "172303141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29261228"}

We propose a semi-supervised classification algorithm for data streams with REcurring concept Drifts and Limited LAbeled data, called REDLLA, in which a decision tree is adopted as the classification model. When growing a tree, a clustering algorithm based on k-means is installed to produce concept clusters and unlabeled data are labeled in the method of majority-class at leaves. In view of deviations between history and new concept clusters, potential concept drifts are distinguished and recurring concepts are maintained.

Tu alleviate this problem, the Laplace estimate has been used in the rule induction system CN2.

The parameter m in the m- estimate allows for adapting to the learning domain. Depending on the level of noise in the examples and other properties of the domain, the appropriate level of generalization can be achieved by setting the m parameter to an appropriate value.

Two data-driven models, Poisson regression and Random Forest regression, are trained to predict the number of flood reports per storm event as a proxy for flood severity, given extensive environmental data (i.e., rainfall, tide, groundwater table level, and wind conditions) as input. The method is demonstrated using data from Norfolk, Virginia USA from September 2010 to October 2016. Quality-controlled, crowd-sourced street flooding reports ranging from 1 to 159 per storm event for 45 storm events are used to train and evaluate the models. Random Forest performed better than Poisson regression at predicting the number of flood reports and had a lower false negative rate. From the Random Forest model, total cumulative rainfall was by far the most dominant input variable in predicting flood severity, followed by low tide and lower low tide. These methods serve as a first step toward using data-driven methods for spatially and temporally detailed coastal urban flood prediction.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.044", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2790051527", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["130881281", "1886625", "14678167", "34494702", "140173693", "60993494", "169719513", "129045724", "127686730", "122031911", "36215990", "145774104", "3520971", "25238569", "42987173", "140141858", "29519350", "54714979", "206742563", "110057464", "55365229", "14397205", "17754100", "206555500", "33889998", "209092086", "35733843", "128877353", "17654166", "129310769", "129218880", "67810423", "128937350", "17793133", "11687149", "133128550", "16539327", "129242162", "132134225", "134823365", "28081608", "324934", "23369575", "133860616", "133681588", "140609782", "133516531", "198498822", "56328683", "44750454", "18673929", "134754962", "111395044", "39392403", "132866337", "129949403"], "inbound_citations": ["204229463", "189824066", "202321161", "212683348", "155980866", "210123182", "201301048", "59619467", "203120900", "212926669"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88511391"}

However, there is lack of computationally efficient statistical software for high-dimensional variable selection in the SPH model. In this work, an R package, SurvBoost, is developed to implement the gradient boosting algorithm for fitting the SPH model with high-dimensional covariate variables and other confounders. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that in many scenarios SurvBoost can achieve a better selection accuracy and reduce computational time substantially compared to the existing R package that implements boosting algorithms without stratification.

We used Random Forests and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis to select the most salient impairments in Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and assess patients similarity. We considered a wide-range testing battery for various neuropsychological and visuo-motor impairments which aimed at characterizing subtypes of DCD in a sample of 63 children. Classifiers were optimized on a training sample, and they were used subsequently to rank the 49 items according to a permuted measure of variable importance. In addition, subtyping consistency was assessed with cluster analysis on the training sample. Clustering fitness and predictive accuracy were evaluated on the validation sample. Both classifiers yielded a relevant subset of items impairments that altogether accounted for a sharp discrimination between three DCD subtypes: ideomotor, visual-spatial and constructional, and mixt dyspraxia. The main impairments that were found to characterize the three subtypes were: digital perception, imitations of gestures, digital praxia, lego blocks, visual spatial structuration, visual motor integration, coordination between upper and lower limbs. Classification accuracy was above 90% for all classifiers, and clustering fitness was found to be satisfactory.

Many applications require more than one inertial sensor for an accurate prediction of actions. In this paper, nine inertial sensors are deployed to ensure an accurate recognition of actions.

We assess their performance in combination with different kernels (i.e. which use distance-based and angle-based metrics). The assessment is done in two experiments, under ideal conditions in the laboratory and, separately, in the field (an operational open pit mine) using natural light. For both experiments independent training and test sets are used. Results show that GPs generally outperform the SVMs, irrespective of the kernel used. Furthermore, angle-based methods, including the Spectral Angle Mapper, outperform GPs and SVMs when using distance-based (i.e. stationary) kernels in the field experiment. A new GP method using an angle-based (i.e. a non-stationary) kernel \u2013 the Observation Angle Dependent (OAD) covariance function \u2013 outperforms SAM and SVMs in both experiments using only a small number of training spectra. These findings show that distance-based kernels are more affected by changes in illumination between the training and test set than are angular-based methods/kernels. Taken together, this study shows that independent training data can be used for classification of hyperspectral data in the field such as in open pit mines, by using Bayesian machine-learning methods and non-stationary kernels such as GPs and the OAD kernel.

But tyre classification implementation is still not efficient and effective for tyre industry. This paper proposes a method of tyre classification using tyre marking points indicating shapes based on support vector machine (SVM). First, the tyre marking points printed on the profiles of tyre are acquired by a designed image acquisition device. Second, those tyre marking points images are handled by image preprocessing methods of image denoising, segmentation, and edge detection. After image preprocessing, the contour coordinates of tyre marking points are extracted.

It is necessary to reduce these bands before further analysis, such as land cover classification and target detection. Aiming at the classification task, this paper proposes an effective band selection method from the novel perspective of spectral shape similarity analysis with key points extraction and thus retains physical information of hyperspectral remote sensing images. The proposed approach takes all the bands of hyperspectral remote sensing images as time series. Firstly, spectral clustering is utilized to cluster all the training samples, which produces the prototypical spectral curves of each cluster. Then a set of initial candidate bands are obtained based on the extraction of key points from the processed hyperspectral curves, which preserve discriminative information and narrow down the candidate band subset for the following search procedure. Finally, filtering contiguous bands according to conditional mutual information and branch and bound search are further performed sequentially to gain the optimal band combination. To verify the effectiveness of the integrated band selection method put forward in this paper, classification employing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is performed on the selected spectral bands. The experimental results on two publicly available benchmark data sets demonstrate that the presented approach can select those bands with discriminative information, usually about 10 out of 200 original bands.

As a solution, we propose a new combination of RVM and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) rule which resolves this issue with regionally dealing with every test instance. In our settings, we obtain the relevance vectors for each test instance in the local area given by k-NN rule.

This can be seen as a piece-wise learner which locally classifies test instances. The model is hence called localized relevance vector machine (LRVM).

Considering the relatively long interval between continuous radar images due to radar volume scan, traditional methods in video generation are not suitable. In this letter, we propose Two-stage Generative Adversarial Networks (TsGANs) to address the above-mentioned problem. In general, our TsGAN constructs adversarial process between generators and discriminators: the generator produces samples similar to real data, while the discriminator determines whether or not a sample is eligible. In Stage I, we generate an image sequence containing content and motion features. In Stage II, we design an enhanced net structure to enrich the adversarial processes and further improve the motion features. Experimental testing is performed within the radar coverage in Shenzhen, China, on rainfall events in 2014\u20132016. Results show that our TsGAN is superior to previous works.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/LGRS.2019.2922326", "venue": "IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters", "journal": "IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2953596889", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["57755729", "49543868", "10870215", "7326479", "2337615", "14455111", "1033682", "9933254", "11699847", "8432557", "4475365", "54444777", "1122604", "6352419", "8643626", "1504491", "3356463", "11715509", "19116100", "3627712"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198464847"}

The pneumonia is almost exclusively caused by the species L. pneumophila, of which serogroup 1 is responsible for 90% of patients. Within serogroup 1, large differences in prevalence in clinical isolates have been described. A recent study, using a Dutch Legionella strain collection, identified five virulence associated markers. In our study, we verify whether these five Dutch markers can predict the patient or environmental origin of a French Legionella strain collection. In addition, we identify new potential virulence markers and verify whether these can predict better. A total of 219 French patient isolates and environmental strains were compared using a mixed-genome micro-array. The micro-array data were analysed to identify predictive markers, using a Random Forest algorithm combined with a logistic regression model. The sequences of the identified markers were compared with eleven known Legionella genomes, using BlastN and BlastX; the functionality for each of the predictive markers was checked in the literature.ResultsThe five Dutch markers insufficiently predicted the patient or environmental origin of the French Legionella strains. Subsequent analyses identified four predictive markers for the French collection that were used for the logistic regression model. This model showed a negative predictive value of 91%. Three of the French markers differed from the Dutch markers, one showed considerable overlap and was found in one of the Legionella genomes (Lorraine strain). This marker encodes for a structural toxin protein RtxA, described for L. pneumophila as a factor involved in virulence and entry in both human cells and amoebae.ConclusionsThe combination of a mixed-genome micro-array and statistical analysis using a Random Forest algorithm has identified virulence markers in a consistent way. The Lorraine strain and related Dutch and French Legionella strains contain a marker that encodes a RtxA protein which probably is involved in the increased prevalence in clinical isolates. The current set of predictive markers is insufficient to justify its use as a reliable test in the public health field in France. Our results suggest that genetic differences in Legionella strains exist between geographically distinct entities.

These approaches are useful when an ensemble of classifiers is used and a decision is made by ordinary classifier fusion methods, while each classifier is devoted to monitor part of the environment. Upon detection of anomalous classifiers we propose a strategy that attempts to minimize adverse effects of faulty classifiers by excluding them from the ensemble. We applied this method to an artificial dataset and sensor-based human activity datasets, with different sensor configurations and two types of noise (additive and rotational on inertial sensors). We compared our method with two other well-known approaches, generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), which detect anomalies at data/feature level. We found that our method is comparable with GLR and OCSVM. The advantages of our method compared to them is that it avoids monitoring raw data or features and only takes into account the decisions that are made by their classifiers, therefore it is independent of sensor modality and nature of anomaly. On the other hand, we found that OCSVM is very sensitive to the chosen parameters and furthermore in different types of anomalies it may react differently.

This has prevented the larger research community from effectively applying sophisticated machine learning algorithms to significantly improve the distribution-level accuracy of predictions and increase the efficiency of grid operations. Synthetic dataset generation has proven to be a promising solution for addressing data availability issues in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing and medicine. However, its exploration in the smart grid context remains unsatisfactory. Previous works have tried to generate synthetic datasets by modeling the underlying system dynamics: an approach which is difficult, time consuming, error prone and often times infeasible in many problems. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven approach to synthetic dataset generation by utilizing deep generative adversarial networks (GAN) to learn the conditional probability distribution of essential features in the real dataset and generate samples based on the learned distribution. To evaluate our synthetically generated dataset, we measure the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between real and synthetic datasets as probability distributions, and show that their sampling distance converges. To further validate our synthetic dataset, we perform common smart grid tasks such as k-means clustering and short-term prediction on both datasets.

Fortuitously, sometimes but not always clinical notes contain sections with a heading that identifies the section as a plan.

We trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with the data. We measured accuracy of the trained models on the noisy dataset using ten-fold cross validation and separately on a set-aside manually annotated dataset. ::: Results: About 13% of 117,730 clinical notes contained treatment plans sections with recognizable headings in the 1001 longitudinal patient records that were obtained from Cleveland Clinic under an IRB approval.

In the final stage, several supervised machine learning classifiers are trained to classify neonates' facial expression into pain or no pain expression. The proposed pipeline achieved, on a testing dataset, 0.841 AUC and 90.34 accuracy, which is approx. 7 higher than the accuracy of handcrafted traditional features. We also propose to combine deep features with traditional features and hypothesize that the mixed features would improve pain classification performance. Combining deep features with traditional features achieved 92.71 accuracy and 0.948 AUC. These results show that transfer learning, which is a faster and more practical option than training CNN from the scratch, can be used to extract useful features for pain expression recognition in neonates.

While recent GANs have shown promising results, they can only forecast plausible motion over relatively short periods of time (few hundred milliseconds) and typically ignore the absolute position of the skeleton w.r.t. the camera. Our scheme provides long term predictions (two seconds or more) for both the body pose and its absolute position. Our approach builds upon three main contributions. First, we represent the data using a spatio-temporal tensor of 3D skeleton coordinates which allows formulating the prediction problem as an inpainting one, for which GANs work particularly well. Secondly, we design an architecture to learn the joint distribution of body poses and global motion, capable to hypothesize large chunks of the input 3D tensor with missing data.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM) approach for the task of activity recognition using accelerometer and gyroscope sensory data gathered from a smartphone. The proposed method consists of first-level CHMMs for coarse classification, which separates stationary and moving activities, and second-level CHMMs for fine classification, which classifies the data into their corresponding activity classes. Random Forests (RF) variable importance measures are exploited to determine the optimal feature subsets for both coarse and fine classification.

In the field of text processing, the methods of calculating attention weights are typically at the word level. Although these methods improve the performance of a model, they increase the computational cost significantly. In this paper, we propose to calculate attention weights at the structured event level since 1) events contain richer semantics than words or phrases; and 2) event-based attention mechanism reduces computational cost. Different from the existing deep learning model which does not rely on the text statistical features, we add the statistical features on the basis of attention weight calculation. Compared with the existing models, the semantic information contained in the event structure and the corresponding statistical features improves the quality of the text vector representation and achieves better classification performance.

However, the pyrolysis process is too complex to build a precise mechanism model. Traditional mechanism models based on molecular reactions are also very complex and one single simulation of them is generally time-consuming. In addition, the off-line lab test of yields of the components of outputs has great time delay. So it is very difficult to achieve a precise closed-loop control for pyrolysis process because the yields of ethylene and propylene cannot be tested online or predicted precisely with traditional mechanism models. To handle this problem, this paper tries to establish some data-driven models for the pyrolysis process based on ensemble learning methods, such as AdaBoost.R2 and AdaBoost.RT, and process data.

In a first fusion level, partial decisions for the sub-images are combined to generate a new partial decision for the original image.

To generate the pool of diverse classifiers, we used classical texture-based features as well as keypoint-based features.

This paper demonstrates an information-aware compressive sensing (CS) architecture for dynamic artifact detection of biophysiological signals in wearable applications. Artifacts such as long pause, baseline wandering, and saturation often corrupt recorded data due to environmental factors. In wearable applications where power conservation and ultra-low power operation are paramount, this can lead to wasted power. By combining earlier proposed CS based architectures with an efficient analog feature-extraction (FE) and digital decision making, the sampling rate of the ADC and the integration window of the multiplying DAC can be reduced in presence of artifacts to save power. As shown, this technique can reduce the system power consumption by up to 70% in the more extreme cases of signal corruption. A serialized Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) used for FE is proposed that dramatically simplifies the circuit implementation while the digital classifier comprising of quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier ensures low power operation with accurate decision outcomes.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351853", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2802442185", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6463893", "38187983", "17401815", "7383840", "7879568", "162186", "3900264", "16219813", "11889082", "24852887", "17928222", "11803502", "12158808", "129892493", "206449038"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53085564"}

With the headway in image capturing devices, image data are being generated in high dimensions.

Motivated by this, a new classification algorithm based on a double-window mechanism for handling various concept drifting data streams (named DWCDS) is proposed in this paper. In terms of an ensemble classifier in random decision trees, a double-window-based mechanism is presented to detect concept drifts periodically, and the model is updated dynamically to adapt to concept drifts.

Many diseases, like cancer are related with the signaling defects which are associated with protein phosphorylation. Characterizing the protein kinases and their substrates enhances our ability to understand the mechanism of protein phosphorylation and extends our knowledge of signaling network; thereby helping us to treat such diseases. Experimental methods for predicting phosphorylation sites are labour intensive and expensive. Also, manifold increase of protein sequences in the databanks over the years necessitates the improvement of high speed and accurate computational methods for predicting phosphorylation sites in protein sequences. Till date, a number of computational methods have been proposed by various researchers in predicting phosphorylation sites, but there remains much scope of improvement. In this communication, we present a simple and novel method based on Grammatical Inference (GI) approach to automate the prediction of kinase specific phosphorylation sites. In this regard, we have used a popular GI algorithm Alergia to infer Deterministic Stochastic Finite State Automata (DSFA) which equally represents the regular grammar corresponding to the phosphorylation sites. Extensive experiments on several datasets generated by us reveal that, our inferred grammar successfully predicts phosphorylation sites in a kinase specific manner. It performs significantly better when compared with the other existing phosphorylation site prediction methods. We have also compared our inferred DSFA with two other GI inference algorithms.

However, deducing such relationships becomes elusive when dealing with very large databases of geochemical data; identifying sample pairs for altered and unaltered equivalents is challenging, correlations between elements may not be intuitive, and large amounts of data are laborious to interpret manually. Machine learning offers potential solutions to problems involving large numbers of data, many variables or features, and complicated relationships between variables. ::: Here we present a workflow to process a whole rock geochemical dataset and produce labels for groups of similar least-altered protolith rocks, and then apply these labels to groups of altered rocks. Protolith samples were clustered using K-Means, a technique that involves partitioning n observations into K clusters such that each sample is associated to the cluster belonging to the nearest mean. This clustering approach is analogous to visually assigning samples to groups based on X-Y geochemical plots, e.g., granite AFM diagrams that geologists commonly use. The advantage of K-Means clustering is that many variables can be considered simultaneously. Altered samples were classified using Random Forests, a supervised classification algorithm, based on the cluster results for the protoliths groups. ::: This approach allows the rapid association of altered samples to their likely corresponding protolith. Interpreting the results gives insight into original protolith geometry, and undertaking further processing can improve the understanding of chemical changes during alteration. Generating and spatially interpreting results took only a few hours, including QaQc and trialling different pre-processing approaches, and was completed without costly geochemical software. Cross section interpretations of protolith geometry, i.e., before ore deposit formation, has an added benefit of lithology label confidence measures from Random Forests. ::: The motivation of this workflow is to assist geologists working with large drillhole datasets including geochemical information and manual logging information. A common task during exploration is to provide interpretations of site geology, and information about the effects and spatial extent of alteration related to mineralisation. These, in turn, give exploration and mining teams a basis for understanding the potential role of original rock geometry controls on the location of ore, or hallmarks of enveloping alteration zones. The aim of this workflow is to provide a high-speed approach to processing drillhole information that is reproducible and objective.

In order to solve RB-LSSVR, the Student's t-distribution is written as a scale-mixture form and variational approximation is used to iteratively learn the parameters of RB-LSSVR. The hyperparameters of the Gamma distribution that can't be solved explicitly are optimized by using Newton method.

SVMs are being constructed for each AF in the multi-valued feature set (Table 1), using speech data and annotation from the IFA Dutch \u201cOpen-Source\u201d (van Son et al. 2001) and TIMIT English (Garofolo et al. 1993) corpora. The primary objective of this research is to assess the AF classification performance of different multiclass generalizations of the SVM, including one-versus-rest, one-versus-one, Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG), and direct methods for multiclass learning. Observing the successful application of SVMs to numerous classification problems (Bennett and Campbell 2000), it is hoped that multiclass SVMs will outperform existing state-of-the-art AF classifiers. One of the most basic challenges for speech recognition and other spoken language systems is to accurately map data from the acoustic domain into the linguistic domain. Much speech processing research has approached this task by taking advantage of the correlation between phones, the basic units of speech sound, and their acoustic manifestation (intuitively, there is a range of sounds that humans would consider to be an \u201ce\u201d). The mapping of acoustic data to phones has been largely successful, and is used in many speech systems today. Despite its success, there are drawbacks to using phones as the point of entry from the acoustic to linguistic domains. Notably, the granularity of the \u201cphoneticsegmental\u201d model, in which speech is represented as a series of phones, makes it difficult to account for various subphone phenomena that affect performance on spontaneous speech. Researchers have pursued an alternative approach to the acoustic-linguistic mapping through the use of articulatory modeling. This approach more directly exploits the intimate relation between articulation and acoustics: the state of one\u2019s speech articulators (e.g. vocal folds, tongue) uniquely determines the parameters of the acoustic speech signal. Unfortunately, while the mapping from articulator to acoustics is straightforward, the problem of recovering the state of the articulators from an acoustic speech representation, acoustic-to-articulatory inversion, poses a formidable challenge (Toutios and Margaritis 2003).

We will report experiments showing that Instance-Based Learning, an exemplar-based model, makes the same kinds of stress related errors in production that children make: (i) the amount of production errors is related to metrical markedness, and (ii) stress shifts and errors with respect to the segmental and syllabic structure of words typically take the form of a regularization of stress patterns.

This obviates the need for gradient signal to flow through the discriminator for training the generator; an intrinsic property of original GAN formulation. Given the inherent difficulty of training adversarial models, and low convergence speed of policy gradient, training GANs using policy gradient is a non-trivial problem and requires deep study. Currently GANs have used only differentiable discriminators for training. Policy-GAN germinates the possibility of using a wide variety of non-differentiable discriminator networks for training GANs, something which was not possible with the original GAN framework.

In this letter, a recursive SVM (RSVM) is presented, in which several orthogonal directions that best separate the data with the maximum margin are obtained.

This method takes advantage of rough set reduct ideology in order to realize the reduction of different types of ground object spectral features on the basis of the conventional subspace division method. In using this method, the primary spectral band based on spectral information can be determined. Then, the grey-level co-occurrence matrix method can be used to calculate the texture information of the primary spectral band and determine the reduction and optimization in order to obtain the final band based on the spectrum and texture information. Verification of this method is made by using CASI data of Heihe Region, China, and AVIRIS data of the Indiana Region, USA, and also using Support Vector Machine SVM classification of the original spectral, primary spectral, and final bands. The results indicate the following. 1 The method for optimal selection of the critical spectral band and texture band, based on the rough set theory, can efficiently improve the classification accuracy of high-spatial resolution remote-sensing images. However, the effects for the low-spatial resolution images are minimal. 2 For high-spatial-resolution remote-sensing images, such as roads, trenches, buildings, and other types of object with obvious textural features, the addition of image texture information can increase the degree of distinction of these different types and thereby improve the classification accuracy. However, the addition of the textural information for some objects with similar texture features will cause misclassification and reduce the classification accuracy for these types of images. 3 This method can realize the optimal selection of spectrum and texture bands of a hyperspectral image and has a certain universality. Also, the texture information will be richer and this method will be more practical through increasing the spatial resolution of images.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/01431161.2015.1034892", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of remote sensing", "mag_id": "2006943967", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["34645347", "20194452", "101118676"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:120080251"}

Variable groups are determined as; total density of medical imaging technologies, workforce distribution in surgical care, number of surgical prodecures and risk of catastrophic expenditure for surgical care. K-means clustering algorithm was used to classify countries according to the surgical indicators. Optimal number of clusters determined by using within cluster sum of squares and scree plot.

It has less structured contents than other images which makes its recovery possible in the absence of some file system metadata. However, an essential problem of which is fragmented JPEG file intertwined with non-JPEG files and/or Bifragmented in the scan area. This paper proposes RX_myKarve as a new file carving framework for solving a number of forensic recovery problems including fragmentation. The RX_myKarve basic design includes a structure-based and content-based carving approaches. It adopts machine learning and evolutionary algorithms in its main components of identification validation and reassembling. The identification and validation techniques encompass an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for identifying and filtering the image data in the scan area. The reassembling technique encompasses a genetic algorithm to reconstruct the data from fragmented pieces to a complete image. The main contribution of the paper lies on the reassembling of fragmented image file clusters in the scan area. The RX_myKarve is tested and evaluated by using the Digital Forensic Research Workshop (DFRWS) 2006 and 2007 forensic challenge datasets. The results show that the RX_myKarve is able to carve and fully recover all the giving cases of the DFRWS-2006 dataset, which are 19 images, and all the relevant cases of the DFRWS-2007 dataset, which are 18 images.

The proposal of SS-ELM (semi-supervised Extreme Learning Machine) extends ELM algorithm to the area of semi-supervised learning which is an important issue of machine learning on big data. However, the original SS-ELM algorithm needs to store the data in the memory before processing it, so that it could not handle large and web-scale data sets which are of frequent appearance in the era of big data. To solve this problem, this paper firstly proposes an efficient parallel SS-ELM (PSS-ELM) algorithm on MapReduce model, adopting a series of optimizations to improve its performance. Then, a parallel approximate SS-ELM Algorithm based on MapReduce (PASS-ELM) is proposed. PASS-ELM is based on the approximate adjacent similarity matrix (AASM) algorithm, which leverages the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme to calculate the approximate adjacent similarity matrix, thus greatly reducing the complexity and occupied memory. The proposed AASM algorithm is general, because the calculation of the adjacent similarity matrix is the key operation in many other machine learning algorithms.

A distinctive channel current blockade signal is created as individually \"captured\" DNA molecules interact with the channel and modulate the channel's ionic current. The nanopore detector is sensitive enough that nearly identical DNA molecules can be classified with very high accuracy using machine learning techniques such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).ResultsA non-standard implementation of an HMM, emission inversion, is used for improved classification. Additional features are considered for the feature vector employed by the SVM for classification as well: The addition of a single feature representing spike density is shown to notably improve classification results. Another, much larger, feature set expansion was studied (2500 additional features instead of 1), deriving from including all the HMM's transition probabilities. The expanded features can introduce redundant, noisy information (as well as diagnostic information) into the current feature set, and thus degrade classification performance.

Steganography has recently made great progress in the long-term confrontation with steganalysis. To improve the security of image steganography, steganography must have the ability to resist detection by steganalysis algorithms. Traditional embedding-based steganography embeds the secret information into the content of an image, which unavoidably leaves a trace of the modification that can be detected by increasingly advanced machine-learning-based steganalysis algorithms. The concept of steganography without embedding (SWE), which does not need to modify the data of the carrier image, appeared to overcome the detection of machine-learning-based steganalysis algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel image SWE method based on deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. We map the secret information into a noise vector and use the trained generator neural network model to generate the carrier image based on the noise vector. No modification or embedding operations are required during the process of image generation, and the information contained in the image can be extracted successfully by another neural network, called the extractor, after training.

One of the effects of stroke is foot drop. Foot drop (FD) is a weakness that occurs in specific muscles in the ankle and foot such as the anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus muscles. Foot flexion and extension are normally generated by lower motor neurons (LMN). The affected muscles impact the ankle and foot in both downward and upward motions. One possible solution for FD is to investigate the movement based on the bio signal (myoelectric signal) of the muscles. Bio signal control systems like electromyography (EMG) are used for rehabilitation devices that include foot drop. One of these systems is function electrical stimulation (FES). This paper proposes new methods and algorithms to develop the performance of myoelectric pattern recognition (M-PR), to improve automated rehabilitation devices, to test these methodologies in offline and real-time experimental datasets. Label classifying is a predictive data mining application with multiple applications in the world, including automatic labeling of resources such as videos, music, images and texts. We combine the label classification method with the self-advised support vector machine (SA-SVM) to create an adapted and altered label classification method, named the label self-advised support vector machine (LSA-SVM). For the experimental data, we collected data from foot drop patients using the sEMG device, in the Metro Rehabilitation Hospital in Sydney, Australia using Ethical Approval (UTS HREC NO. ETH15-0152).

A new motion descriptor, which is a group of histograms based on optical flow, is proposed for motion representation. The optical flow here is treated as spatial pattern of noisy measurement instead of precise pixel displacement.

We therefore utilize the existing data from non-target (different-type) machines for feature representation learning to improve anomaly detection for the target machine. Specifically, deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained to discriminate the normal and faulty states of the non-target machines are used to extract features.

Moreover, metric learning (ML) is usually introduced into the deep models to further increase the discrimination of deep representations. However, the usual deep ML methods treat the training samples in each training batch in the stochastic gradient descent-based learning procedure independently, and thus, they neglect the important contextual (structural) information in the training samples. In this paper, we first introduce deep structural ML (DSML) into the literature of remote sensing scene classification and specifically capture and use the structural information during the training on the remote sensing images. Further analysis demonstrates that DSML usually makes many learned metric parameters similar. This similarity leads to obvious model redundancy and thus decreases the representational ability of the model. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new diversity-promoting DSML (D-DSML) method by regularizing the learning procedure by a diversity-promoting prior over the parameter factors. The proposed D-DSML encourages the parameter factors to be uncorrelated, such that each factor can model unique information, and thus, the model\u2019s description ability and classification performance would be significantly improved.

Training of SVM requires to solve a linearly constrained convex quadratic problem. In real applications the number of training data may be very huge and the Hessian matrix cannot be stored. In order to take into account this issue a common strategy consists in using decomposition algorithms which at each iteration operate only on a small subset of variables, usually referred to as the working set. The convergence properties of a decomposition method strongly depend on the rule for selecting the working set. On the other hand training time can be signiflcantly reduced by using a caching technique, that allocates some memory space to store the recently used columns of the Hessian matrix. In order to take into account both theoretical requirements and computational issues related to a caching technique, we propose a hybrid decomposition algorithm model embedding the most violating pair rule and possibly any other working set selection rule.

Accordingly, ACs are of high interest for the exploration of structure-activity relationships (SARs). ACs reveal small chemical modifications that result in profound biological effects. The ability to foresee such small chemical changes with significant biological consequences would represent a major advance for drug design. Nevertheless, only few attempts have been made so far to predict whether a pair of analogues is likely to represent an AC-and even fewer went further to quantitatively predict how \"deep\" a cliff might be. This might be due to the fact that such predictions must focus on compound pairs. Matched molecular pairs (MMPs), defined as pairs of structural analogs that are only distinguished by a chemical modification at a single site, are a preferred representation of ACs. Herein, we report new strategies for AC prediction that are based upon two different approaches: (i) condensed graphs of reactions, which were originally introduced for modeling of chemical reactions and were here adapted to encode MMPs, and, (ii) plain descriptor recombination-a strategy used for quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling of nonadditive mixtures (MQSPR). By applying these concepts, ACs were encoded as single descriptor vectors used as input for support vector machine (SVM) classification and support vector regression (SVR), yielding accurate predictions of AC status (i.e., cliff vs noncliff) and potency differences, respectively. The latter were predicted in a compound order-sensitive manner returning the signed value of expected potency differences between AC compounds.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27564682", "doi": "10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00359", "venue": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "mag_id": "2517880718", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202579363", "214867597", "215480307", "14384664", "53507124"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3559414"}

Existing tracking algorithms use appearance samples from previous frames to form a template set upon which target appearance models are built.

In this paper, we propose a robust visual tracking algorithm with an adaptive appearance model using a point-to-set metric learning technique. To do this, we first model a target representation using a set of target templates and a regularized affine hull (RAH) spanned by the target templates. Then, we learn a point-to-set distance metric, which is incorporated into the optimization process to obtain an adaptive target representation. The RAH model covers unseen target appearances by affine combinations of the target templates.

Scale-translation rigidity facilitates high quality 3D shape learning and guarantees unique reconstruction. The multi-chart structure uses as input a dataset of 3D shapes (with arbitrary connectivity) and a sparse correspondence between them. The output of our algorithm is a generative model that learns the shape distribution and is able to generate novel shapes, interpolate shapes, and explore the generated shape space.

The interaction sites (residues) are essential to understanding the underlying mechanisms of protein-protein interactions. Previous research has demonstrated that the accurate identification of protein-protein interaction sites (PPIs) is helpful for developing new therapeutic drugs because many drugs will interact directly with those residues. Because of its significant potential in biological research and drug development, the prediction of PPIs has become an important topic in computational biology. However, a severe data imbalance exists in the PPIs prediction problem, where the number of the majority class samples (non-interacting residues) is far larger than that of the minority class samples (interacting residues). Thus, we developed a novel cascade random forests algorithm (CRF) to address the serious data imbalance that exists in the PPIs prediction problem. The proposed CRF resolves the negative effect of data imbalance by connecting multiple random forests in a cascade-like manner, each of which is trained with a balanced training subset that includes all minority samples and a subset of majority samples using an effective ensemble protocol. Based on the proposed CRF, we implemented a new sequence-based PPIs predictor, called CRF-PPI, which takes the combined features of position-specific scoring matrices, averaged cumulative hydropathy, and predicted relative solvent accessibility as model inputs. Benchmark experiments on both the cross validation and independent validation datasets demonstrated that the proposed CRF-PPI outperformed the state-of-the-art sequence-based PPIs predictors.

This paper aims to addresses the challenges regarding decision-making based on mammography reports and propose a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) using data mining methods to help clinicians to interpret mammography reports. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: For this purpose, 2441 mammography reports were collected from Imam Khomeini Hospital from March 21, 2018, to March 20, 2019. In the first step, these mammography reports are analyzed and program code is developed to transform the reports into a dataset. Then, the weight of every feature of the dataset is calculated. Random Forest, Na\u00efve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Deep Learning classifiers are applied to the dataset to build a model capable of predicting the need for referral to biopsy. Afterward, the models are evaluated using cross-validation with measuring Area Under Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity indices. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: The mammography type (diagnostic or screening), mass and calcification features mentioned in the reports are the most important features for decision-making. Results reveal that the K-NN model is the most accurate and specific classifier with the accuracy and specificity values of 84.06% and 84.72% respectively. The Random Forest classifier has the best sensitivity and AUC with the sensitivity and AUC values of 87.74% and 0.905 respectively. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Accordingly, data mining approaches are proved to be a helpful tool to make the final decision as to whether patients should be referred to biopsy or not based on mammography reports.

Identification of drug-target interactions through biological experiments is time consuming, laborious, and costly. Therefore, using computational approaches to predict candidate targets is a good way to reduce the cost of wet-lab experiments. However, the known interactions (positive samples) and the unknown interactions (negative samples) display a serious class imbalance, which has an adverse effect on the accuracy of the prediction results. To mitigate the impact of class imbalance and completely exploit the negative samples, we proposed a new method, named DTIGBDT, based on gradient boosting decision trees, for predicting candidate drug-target interactions. We constructed a drug-target heterogeneous network that contains the drug similarities based on the chemical structures of drugs, the target similarities based on target sequences, and the known drug-target interactions. The topological information of the network was captured by random walks to update the similarities between drugs or targets. The paths between drugs and targets could be divided into multiple categories, and the features of each category of paths were extracted. We constructed a prediction model based on gradient boosting decision trees. The model establishes multiple decision trees with the extracted features and obtains the interaction scores between drugs and targets. DTIGBDT is a method of ensemble learning, and it effectively reduces the impact of class imbalance. The experimental results indicate that DTIGBDT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for drug-target interaction prediction. In addition, case studies on Quetiapine, Clozapine, Olanzapine, Aripiprazole, and Ziprasidone demonstrate the ability of DTIGBDT to discover potential drug-target interactions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6555260", "pubmed_id": "31214240", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2019.00459", "venue": "Front.

We call the concept target-aware transfer learning. Given only small-scale labeled data, and starting from an ImageNet pre-trained network, we exploit a scheme of removing its potential redundancy for the target task through iterative operations of filter-wise pruning and network optimization. The basic motivation is that compact networks are on one hand more efficient and should also be more tolerant, being less complex, against the risk of overfitting which would hinder the generalization of learned representations in the context of transfer learning. Further, unlike existing methods involving network simplification, we also let the scheme identify redundant portions across the entire network, which automatically results in a network structure adapted to the task at hand. We achieve this with a few novel ideas: (i) cumulative sum of activation statistics for each layer, and (ii) a priority evaluation of pruning across multiple layers.

This problem becomes a challenge due to the lack of deep knowledge about the biological systems and unfamiliarity of conservative characteristics in the messenger RNA (mRNA). Therefore, it is fundamental to research for computational methods aiming to help the patterns discovery for identification of the Translation Initiation Sites (TIS). In the field of Bioinformatics, machine learning methods have been widely applied based on the inductive inference, as Inductive Support Vector Machine (ISVM). On the other hand, not so much attention has been given to transductive inference-based machine learning methods such as Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM). The transductive inference performs well for problems in which the amount of unlabeled sequences is considerably greater than the labeled ones. Similarly, the problem of predicting the TIS may take advantage of transductive methods due to the fact that the amount of new sequences grows rapidly with the progress of Genome Project that allows the study of new organisms. Consequently, this work aims to investigate the transductive learning towards TIS identification and compare the results with those obtained in inductive method.ResultsThe transductive inference presents better results both in F-measure and in sensitivity in comparison with the inductive method for predicting the TIS. Additionally, it presents the least failure rate for identifying the TIS, presenting a smaller number of False Negatives (FN) than the ISVM. The ISVM and TSVM methods were validated with the molecules from the most representative organisms contained in the RefSeq database: Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana. The transductive method presented F-measure and sensitivity higher than 90% and also higher than the results obtained with ISVM. The ISVM and TSVM approaches were implemented in the TransduTIS tool, TransduTIS-I and TransduTIS-T respectively, available in a web interface. These approaches were compared with the TISHunter, TIS Miner, NetStart tools, presenting satisfactory results.ConclusionsIn relation to precision, the results are similar for the ISVM and TSVM classifiers. However, the results show that the application of TSVM approach ensured an improvement, specially for F-measure and sensitivity. Moreover, it was possible to identify a potential for the application of TSVM, which is for organisms in the initial study phase with few identified sequences in the databases.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5290616", "pubmed_id": "28152994", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-017-1502-6", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2583689827", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["25913307", "6813096", "37026200", "1554582", "35225133", "52874011", "2154417", "11034725", "8019204", "234541", "205225949", "24614945", "2374498", "961425", "3332028", "3096276"], "inbound_citations": ["49563292", "1247506", "52985874", "27941197"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16870805"}

Recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that border-ownership assignment can be modeled as a process of self-organization by lateral interactions within V2 cortex. However, the mechanism proposed relies on propagation of signals through horizontal fibers, which would result in increasing delays of the border-ownership signal with increasing size of the visual stimulus, in contradiction with experimental findings. It also remains unclear how the resulting border-ownership representation would interact with attention mechanisms to guide further processing. Here we present a model of border-ownership coding based on dedicated neural circuits for contour grouping that produce border-ownership assignment and also provide handles for mechanisms of selective attention.

L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of promising means, although its signal is saturated at 75\u2013150 Mg ha\u22121 of AGB, making it difficult to monitor high biomass forest. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) conducts ScanSAR mode observations that cover the whole tropical region about nine times a year. We investigated whether such time-series data is effective in overcoming the signal saturation issue. In Borneo, we adopted a spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)-derived AGB data for training and validation data, then developed an AGB estimation model using the Random Forest algorithm. As a result, we improved the saturation issue, and estimated the AGB up to 280 Mg ha\u22121 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 62.8 Mg ha\u22121. Such an AGB range covers 83% of Borneo's forests. The developed model was applied to create an AGB map of Borneo with a 250-m resolution as of 2016. Total AGB of Borneo was calculated at 12.8 Gt with an average of 173.3 Mg ha\u22121. This article showed the PALSAR-2 time-series data to be highly useful in the AGB mapping of high carbon stock forests.

In this paper, we propose a Graph Embedding Ensemble Learning method (abbreviated as \u201cGEEL\u201d) to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions. First, we collect lncRNA sequences and miRNA sequences to calculate lncRNA-lncRNA sequence similarity and miRNA-miRNA sequence similarity, and then we combine them with the known lncRNA-miRNA interactions to construct a heterogeneous network, which takes lncRNAs and miRNAs as nodes. We adopt graph embedding methods to learn representations of lncRNAs and miRNAs from the heterogeneous network, and then merge the representations of lncRNAs and miRNAs to represent the lncRNA-miRNA pairs. Random forest classifiers are built based on the merged representations to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions. We consider five different graph embedding methods, and evaluate the corresponding models. Further, we use individual graph embedding method-based model as base predictors and build a high-level ensemble model. The experimental results show that GEEL achieves AUPR score of 0.7004 and AUC score of 0.9537, and outperforms base predictors and other state-of-the-art methods.

However, they are often not accessible to experimental study because of their low stability and difficulty to produce the proteins and assemble them in native conformation. Thus, docking algorithms have been developed to provide an in silico approach of the problem. A protein--protein docking procedure traditionally consists of two successive tasks: a search algorithm generates a large number of candidate solutions, and then a scoring function is used to rank them. ::: ::: Results: To address the second step, we developed a scoring function based on a Voronoi tessellation of the protein three-dimensional structure. We showed that the Voronoi representation may be used to describe in a simplified but useful manner, the geometric and physico-chemical complementarities of two molecular surfaces. We measured a set of parameters on native protein--protein complexes and on decoys, and used them as attributes in several statistical learning procedures: a logistic function, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and a genetic algorithm. For the later, we used ROGER, a genetic algorithm designed to optimize the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. To further test the scores derived with ROGER, we ranked models generated by two different docking algorithms on targets of a blind prediction experiment, improving in almost all cases the rank of native-like solutions. ::: ::: Availability: http://genomics.eu.org/spip/-Bioinformatics-tools-", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17237048", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btl654", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2120412820", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["40589986", "6583731", "22495910", "8952183", "21137936", "30660409", "10632794", "2496555", "31489448", "8975518", "45628282", "2060349"], "inbound_citations": ["14424484", "12903725", "2469248", "4646248", "412713", "18621121", "4850122", "17330914", "1964655", "206191101", "15550780", "5976513", "601175", "14036247", "3104317", "324989", "215579630", "16145041", "17280332", "6134223", "65062854"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12603679"}

Recent literature shows that condition monitoring of ship systems has been tackled on single and independent component level. However, there has recently been a research tendency towards holistic system modelling. In this respect, this paper presents a methodology for intelligent, system-level modelling for the monitoring of main engine performance utilising data acquired through noon-reports. The proposed methodology will train a main engine expected-performance model. Training is based on one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Newly-acquired data are compared against model output and the probability of belonging to the same performance profile as used for model training is estimated. This will eventually lead to increasing ship operability and income through operational enhancement and minimisation of ship downtime. Two case studies are included, one utilising main engine data and one diesel generator data. Both are complemented by a sensitivity analysis, showing successful results in the recognition of deviant, abnormal ship machinery conditions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2768088191", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["115445321"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115512848"}

To improve the performance and robustness of these frameworks, developers provide users with highly-configurable parameters. Due to the high-dimensional parameter space and complicated interactions of parameters, manual tuning of parameters is time-consuming and ineffective. Building performance-predicting models for big data frameworks is challenging for several reasons: (1) the significant time required to collect training data and (2) the poor accuracy of the prediction model when training data are limited. To meet this challenge, we proposes an <italic>auto-tuning configuration parameters system</italic> (ATCS), a new auto-tuning approach based on <italic>Generative Adversarial Nets</italic> (GAN). ATCS can build a performance prediction model with less training data and without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, an optimized <italic>Genetic Algorithm</italic> (GA) is used in ATCS to explore the parameter space for optimum solutions. To prove the effectiveness of ATCS, we select five frequently-used workloads in Spark, each of which runs on five different sized data sets.

Monitors were initialized to collect raw acceleration data at a sampling rate of 80 Hz. Fifteen of the participants also wore GT3X+ in free-living settings and were directly observed for 2-3 h. Time- and frequency-domain features from acceleration signals of each monitor were used to train random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models to classify five activity types: sedentary, standing, household, locomotion, and recreational activities. All algorithms were trained on laboratory data (RFLab and SVMLab) and free-living data (RFFL and SVMFL) using 20-s signal sampling windows. Classification accuracy rates of both types of algorithms were tested on free-living data using a leave-one-out technique. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Overall classification accuracy rates for the algorithms developed from laboratory data were between 49% (wrist) and 55% (ankle) for the SVMLab algorithms and 49% (wrist) to 54% (ankle) for the RFLab algorithms. The classification accuracy rates for SVMFL and RFFL algorithms ranged from 58% (wrist) to 69% (ankle) and from 61% (wrist) to 67% (ankle), respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Our algorithms developed on free-living accelerometer data were more accurate in classifying the activity type in free-living older adults than those on our algorithms developed on laboratory accelerometer data.

Accurate estimation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error. Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1 (RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combination of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area). Further work on developing species-specific wood densities and allometric equations is required to improve AGB and carbon stock estimation in the SS.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2019.111496", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2985495555", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210257089"}

To overcome these problems we argue to use version spaces (VSs) [3] for reliable classification. The key idea is to construct VSs containing hypotheses of the target class or of its close approximations. In this way the unanimous-voting classification rule of VSs does not misclassify instances; i.e., instance classifications become reliable. To construct VSs with the property above we propose an approach extending the volumes of VSs s.t. instance misclassifications are blocked.

However, under the uncontrolled condition, the transformation is caused by both facial actions and head motions. To remove the influence by head motions, we propose a Twin-Cycle Autoencoder (TCAE) that can disentangle the facial action related movements and the head motion related ones. Specifically, TCAE is trained to respectively change the facial actions and head poses of the source face to those of the target face. Our experiments validate TCAE's capability of decoupling the movements.

First, we propose an adaptive superpixel generation algorithm based on simple linear iterative clustering version with 0 parameter (ASLIC0). This algorithm can acquire a superpixel image with fewer superpixels and better fit the boundary of region of interest (ROI) by automatically selecting the optimal number of superpixels. Second, we compose a training set by calculating the statistical, texture, curvature and fractal features for each superpixel. Third, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to train classification model based on the features of the second step. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The experimental results on Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark 2017 (BraTS2017) show that the proposed method has good segmentation performance. The average Dice, Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, and specificity for the segmented tumor against the ground truth are 0.8492, 3.4697 pixels, 81.47, and 99.64%, respectively.

Therefore, computational tools for reliably predicting linear B-cell epitopes are highly desirable. We evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained utilizing five different kernel methods using fivefold cross-validation on a homology-reduced data set of 701 linear B-cell epitopes, extracted from Bcipep database, and 701 non-epitopes, randomly extracted from SwissProt sequences. Based on the results of our computational experiments, we propose BCPred, a novel method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using the subsequence kernel. We show that the predictive performance of BCPred (AUC = 0.758) outperforms 11 SVM-based classifiers developed and evaluated in our experiments as well as our implementation of AAP (AUC = 0.7), a recently proposed method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using amino acid pair antigenicity. Furthermore, we compared BCPred with AAP and ABCPred, a method that uses recurrent neural networks, using two data sets of unique B-cell epitopes that had been previously used to evaluate ABCPred. Analysis of the data sets used and the results of this comparison show that conclusions about the relative performance of different B-cell epitope prediction methods drawn on the basis of experiments using data sets of unique B-cell epitopes are likely to yield overly optimistic estimates of performance of evaluated methods. This argues for the use of carefully homology-reduced data sets in comparing B-cell epitope prediction methods to avoid misleading conclusions about how different methods compare to each other.

In this paper, a predictive computerized approach is proposed to predict the performance of an immobilized-cell biofilter treating NH3 vapors in terms of its removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC). The input parameters to the ANN model were inlet concentration, loading rate, flow rate and pressure drop, and the output parameters were RE and EC. The data set was divided into two parts: a training matrix consisting of 51 data points, and a test matrix with 16 data points representing each parameter considered in this study. Earlier experiments of continuous biofilter operation showed removal efficiencies from 60 to 100% at inlet loading rates (ILRs) varying between 0.5 to 5.5 g NH3/m^3/h. Internal network parameters of the ANN model during simulation were selected using the 2k factorial design, and the best network topology for the model was thus estimated. Predictions were evaluated based on their d coefficient values (R2). The results showed that a multilayer network (4-4-2) with a back propagation algorithm was able to predict biofilter performance effectively with R^2 values of 0.9825 and 0.9982.

We calculate the gradient of the VCV which is used to perform a watershed segmentation of the brain volume into regions. A region selection stage finds the most relevant watershed regions. We propose two different approaches to characterize region relevance: (a) a wrapper procedure using extreme learning machines (ELM), and (b) apply correlation distribution percentiles to select most discriminant regions.

""}], "abstract": "Differences of cotton between America and China exist in harvesting and classification were summarized.In America,the characteristics of cotton production have been recognized,such as large scale,single variety,long autumn and mid-long fibre etc.It helps to pick and classify cotton fully by machines.In contrast,in China,the characteristics of cotton production leads to inadaptation for mechanism-based technology.Cotton harvesting mostly performed by hand,mainly restricted by plenty of labor,and the classification that is fulfilled by dint of human sensing.In view of the conjuncture,an assumption for cotton harvesting based on agricultural robot were put forward in this paper.In China,agricultural robot-based cotton harvesting combines the advantages of the handcraft-based and the mechanism-based,and it has the potential to resolve the conflict between production efficiency and high fiber grade.Comparing with mechanism-harvested cotton,robot-harvested cotton includes the follow advantages:\u2474Adapting the variety of cotton.Many qualification of mechanism-based technology for cotton harvesting such as mid-long fibre,short-term autumn,single variety,and poor disease resistance,result in the use of agricultural robot technology for cotton harvesting.Owing to human simulating picker,robot-based technology with programmable feature resolves some problems such as short fibre,long-term autumn,variety because of the special climate and zone.\u2475Requesting poor agriculture.In order to control the height along with maturity of cotton plant,and reduce the impurity mixed with leaves,the use of chemicals for pre-harvest cotton will lead to drug-resistance before cotton harvesting.Agriculture robot with spatial freedom has the potential to avoid leaf scrap mixed,reduce cost and ensure sowing of cotton plant.\u2476Increasing the yield of high quality cotton.Traditional visual quality inspection performed by human inspectors has the potential to be replaced by computer vision systems for robot-harvested cotton,and a nicer representative sample may meet the classification before cotton harvesting.The quality of classification for cotton harvesting as well as the yield of high quality cotton will be advanced greatly.\u2477Reducing production cost.Agricultural robot-harvested ensures high quality and avoids plenty of fee for picking owe to simulating human being's action.harvesting robot plays some other roles with compact,flexible moving and convenient for remote portage in agricultural production.Hence,cotton harvesting using agriculture robot adapts to the situation of China.At present,harvest robot with machine vision has been capable of harvesting many fruit and vegetable such as orange,tangerine,tomato,murphy,fungus,cucumber,apple,watermelon,grape.Plenty of experience obtained in terms of harvesting consists of three aspects:\u2474robot's self-determination navigation,\u2475objective detection,\u2476robot's framework.Digital image processing performed with a computer to manipulate information within an image makes it useful.Image processing in agricultural applications may consist of three steps: \u2474 image enhancement,\u2475image feature extraction,and \u2476image feature classification.The image acquisition board receives imaging data from a CCD camera.Image enhancement procedures such as pixel-to-pixel operations,filters,and morphological operations are generally used to correct some problems such as poor contrast or noise caused by inadequate and non-uniform illumination.Statistical procedures such as mean,standard deviation,variance and principle component analysis can be used to extract cotton features,such as size,shape,shine,color,texture,position,leaf states of cotton.Modern mathematics microscope,wavelet analysis system,can be successfully applied to edge detection due to analyzing locally in time.For the rapid prototype of a machine vision system,artificial intelligence programming can be incorporated into the system.Newer tools such as artificial neural network-Fuzzy/Rough,Fractal Geometry,Support Vector Machine can be applied to enhance the robustness of the classification of the color imaging system through computing connected weights,fraction dimension,sustainable vector,respectively.Further more,a flexible requirement may meet multi-sensors such as approach,touch and force for sensing.Considering the biology feature as well as shape of cotton,robot's end manipulator must be optimally designed structurally when grabbing.With the quite great development of mathematics along with robot sectors,agricultural industrialization as well as the fall of cost,the use of intelligent robot for harvest cotton has the potential to become routine operations in order to increase the yield of high quality cotton greatly.Extensive cultivation of cotton production will be replaced by intensivism gradually in the future.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Cotton

They describe sensory information as being encoded in a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated representations across the layers of the cortex. They have been shown in previous studies as robust models of object recognition. In a previous work, we have also shown Hubel Weisel models as being capable of representing a hierarchy of concepts. In this paper, we explore incremental learning with respect to Hubel Weisel models of concept representation. The challenges of incremental learning in the Hubel Weisel model are discussed. We then compare the use of variably dense self organizing maps to perform incremental learning against the original implementation using growing self organizing maps.

These novel platforms yield highly detailed metabolite profiles in large numbers of samples. Such profiles can be used as fingerprints for the accurate identification and classification of samples as well as for the study of effects of experimental conditions on the concentrations of specific metabolites. Challenges for the application of these methods lie in the acquisition of high-quality data, data normalization, and data mining. Here, a high-throughput fingerprinting approach based on analysis of headspace volatiles using ultrafast gas chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (ultrafast GC/TOF-MS) was developed and evaluated for classification and screening purposes in food fermentation. GC-MS mass spectra of headspace samples of milk fermented by different mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were collected and preprocessed in MetAlign, a dedicated software package for the preprocessing and comparison of liquid chromatography (LC)-MS and GC-MS data. The Random Forest algorithm was used to detect mass peaks that discriminated combinations of species or strains used in fermentations. Many of these mass peaks originated from key flavor compounds, indicating that the presence or absence of individual strains or combinations of strains significantly influenced the concentrations of these components. We demonstrate that the approach can be used for purposes like the selection of strains from collections based on flavor characteristics and the screening of (mixed) cultures for the presence or absence of strains. In addition, we show that strain-specific flavor characteristics can be traced back to genetic markers when comparative genome hybridization (CGH) data are available.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3165422", "pubmed_id": "21742903", "doi": "10.1128/AEM.00352-11", "venue": "Applied and environmental microbiology", "journal": "Applied and environmental microbiology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2103194603", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6574412", "19980182", "89141", "5079550", "13502670", "35195883", "27707053", "205212917", "95746833", "25518107", "9857004", "31078366", "2812884", "95227854", "40654712", "96398899", "84304767", "40791412", "1959467", "11486395", "17567223", "109556529", "35010920"], "inbound_citations": ["215251322", "57757241", "23507370", "46897986", "206251207", "6915081", "4961635", "36336842", "17909569", "11679", "90712009", "4915914", "52244962", "215681985"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7899351"}

The main goals of this work is to combine classical behaviour-based control with motor primitives implemented with SNN for motion representation. We extend a previously presented bio-inspired approach to represent hand and arm motion using motor primitives, and combine it with a behaviour-based architecture to model different locomotion behaviours for a multi-legged robot. There are four main components. First, to model the individual leg motions we use two motor primitives implemented with spiking neural networks for the swing and stance phases. Second, to control the motor primitives of each leg there are local behaviours corresponding to each phase, and corresponding to each activation pattern. Third, the activation patterns are used to facilitate multi-leg coordination and generate different walking behaviours. Fourth, a high-level control interface integrates control signals from other sources and activates the patterns. We conducted five different experiments to evaluate our approach in a simulated environment using the Neurorobotics Platform (NRP).

INTRODUCTION The financial crisis means that business enterprise loses the ability of payment, has no capability to play expired liability or expenses and appears asset value less than issued debt. Once the enterprise occur financial crisis, it will bring great loss for executive and financial institution. Financial distress prediction is of interest not only to managers but also to external stakeholders of company. Gestel et al. [10] observed corporate bankruptcy cause substantial losses to the business community and society as whole.

The interannual variability of monsoon rainfalls is high, which forces South Indian farmers to adapt their irrigated areas to local water availability. In this study, we have developed and tested a methodology for monitoring these spatiotemporal variations using Sentinel-1 and -2 observations over the Kudaliar catchment, Telangana State (~1000 km2). These free radar and optical data have been acquired since 2015 on a weekly basis over continental areas, at a high spatial resolution (10\u201320 m) that is well adapted to the small areas of South Indian field crops. A machine learning algorithm, the Random Forest method, was used over three growing seasons (January to March and July to November 2016 and January to March 2017) to classify small patches of inundated rice paddy, maize, and other irrigated crops, as well as surface water stored in the small reservoirs scattered across the landscape. The crop production comprises only irrigated crops (less than 20% of the areas) during the dry season (Rabi, December to March), to which rain-fed cotton is added to reach 60% of the areas during the monsoon season (Kharif, June to November). Sentinel-1 radar backscatter provides useful observations during the cloudy monsoon season. The lowest irrigated area totals were found during Rabi 2016 and Kharif 2016, accounting for 3.5 and 5% with moderate classification confusion. This confusion decreases with increasing areas of irrigated crops during Rabi 2017. During this season, 16% of rice and 6% of irrigated crops were detected after the exceptional rainfalls observed in September. Surface water in small surface reservoirs reached 3% of the total area, which corresponds to a high value. The use of both Sentinel datasets improves the method accuracy and strengthens our confidence in the resulting maps. This methodology shows the potential of automatically monitoring, in near real time, the high short term variability of irrigated area totals in South India, as a proxy for estimating irrigated water and groundwater needs. These are estimated over the study period to range from 49.5 \u00b1 0.78 mm (1.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2016, and 44.9 \u00b1 2.9 mm (6.5% uncertainty) in the Kharif season, to 226.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm (2.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2017. This variation must be related to groundwater recharge estimates that range from 10 mm to 160 mm\u00b7yr\u22121 in the Hyderabad region.

To achieve accurate placement, a needle equipped with optical fibers that allows tissue discrimination at the needle tip based on optical spectroscopy is proposed. This study investigates the sensitivity and specificity with which this optical needle can discriminate nerves from the surrounding tissues making use of different classification methods.MethodsDiffuse reflectance spectra were acquired from 1563 different locations from 19 human cadavers in the wavelength range of 400\u20131710 nm; measured tissue types included fascicular tissue of the nerve, muscle, sliding fat and subcutaneous fat. Physiological parameters of the tissues were derived from the measured spectra and part of the data was directly compared to histology. Various classification methods were then applied to the derived parameter dataset to determine the accuracy with which fascicular tissue of the nerve can be discriminated from the surrounding tissues.ResultsFrom the parameters determined from the measured spectra of the various tissues surrounding the nerve, fat content, blood content, beta-carotene content and scattering were most distinctive when comparing fascicular and non-fascicular tissue. Support Vector Machine classification with a combination of feature selections performed best in discriminating fascicular nerve tissue from the surrounding tissues with a sensitivity and specificity around 90 %.ConclusionsThis study showed that spectral tissue sensing, based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy at the needle tip, is a promising technique to discriminate fascicular tissue of the nerve from the surrounding tissues.

Although the recently proposed regularized online sequential-extreme learning machine (ReOS-ELM) can overcome this issue, it requires a batch of representative initial training data to construct a base model before online learning. The initial data is usually difficult to collect in adaptive control applications. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved version of ReOS-ELM, entitled fully online sequential-extreme learning machine (FOS-ELM). While retaining the advantages of ReOS-ELM, FOS-ELM discards the initial training phase, and hence becomes suitable for adaptive control applications. To demonstrate its effectiveness, FOS-ELM was applied to the adaptive control of engine air-fuel ratio based on a simulated engine model. Besides, controller parameters were also analyzed, in which it is found that large hidden node number with small regularization parameter leads to the best performance. A comparison among FOS-ELM and SGBP was also conducted. The result indicates that FOS-ELM achieves better tracking and convergence performance than SGBP, since FOS-ELM tends to learn the unknown engine model globally whereas SGBP tends to \u201cforget\u201d what it has learnt.

However, the obfuscation of underlying details of services in cloud computing, also due to privacy requirements, affects the effectiveness of autonomic managers. Data-driven approaches, in particular those relying on service clustering based on machine learning techniques, can assist the autonomic management and support decisions concerning, e.g., the scheduling and deployment of services. Unfortunately, applying such approaches is further complicated by the coexistence of different types of data within the information provided by the monitoring of cloud systems: both continuous (e.g., CPU load) and categorical (e.g., VM instance type) data are available. Current approaches deal with this problem in a heuristic fashion. In this paper, instead, we propose an approach that uses all types of data, and learns in a data-driven fashion the similarities and patterns among the services. More specifically, we design an unsupervised formulation of random forest to calculate service similarities and provide them as input to a clustering algorithm. For the sake of efficiency and to meet the dynamism requirement of autonomic clouds, our methodology consists of two steps: 1) off-line clustering and 2) on-line prediction. Using datasets from real-world clouds, we demonstrate the superiority of our solution with respect to others and validate the accuracy of the on-line prediction. Moreover, to show applicability of our approach, we devise a service scheduler that uses similarity among services, and evaluate its performance in a cloud test-bed using realistic data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TNSM.2016.2569000", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2381381716", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "16053894", "15619865", "125866813", "57368876", "11414993", "120209414", "2279539", "3123830", "1546559", "13328418", "189915041", "15362116", "14888871", "3264137", "191396", "272682", "705946", "207083657", "15608898", "16169235", "14314033", "850937", "18354283", "15705502", "12554589", "245216", "195709538", "7724157", "14505386", "6007004", "17698583", "6852308", "14431516", "14774168", "15063987", "7798270", "599570", "3427402", "7032175", "1027883", "9832214", "34139004"], "inbound_citations": ["1727391", "29935388", "57191062", "215082354", "53234062", "84837670"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15857977"}

Currently, experiments identified only a small number of drug-target interactions. Therefore, the development of computational methods for drug-target interaction prediction is an urgent task of theoretical interest and practical significance. In this paper, we propose a label propagation method with linear neighborhood information (LPLNI) for predicting unobserved drug-target interactions. Firstly, we calculate drug-drug linear neighborhood similarity in the feature spaces, by considering how to reconstruct data points from neighbors. Then, we take similarities as the manifold of drugs, and assume the manifold unchanged in the interaction space. At last, we predict unobserved interactions between known drugs and targets by using drug-drug linear neighborhood similarity and known drug-target interactions. The experiments show that LPLNI can utilize only known drug-target interactions to make high-accuracy predictions on four benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we consider incorporating chemical structures into LPLNI models. Experimental results demonstrate that the model with integrated information (LPLNI-II) can produce improved performances, better than other state-of-the-art methods.

However, the demand for AFV is still not clear, due to the complex interaction between influencing factors. This paper aimed to investigate the AFV adoption behavior in order to estimate the AFV penetration in specific regions. 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), providing the detailed information of AFV users, was utilized to conduct the factor analysis and establish the prediction model. Three groups of variables, including vehicle-related, household-related and individual-related variables, were considered. Additionally, the AFV users are only 4.2% of all the respondents, which is a typical imbalanced distribution. Thus, this paper also introduced the methods to deal with the imbalanced dataset for AFV users and conventional vehicle (CV) users, which was rarely investigated in existing studies. To construct the prediction model, five machine learning methods, Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), were employed and compared.

The Bayesian classifier enabled application of the \u2019smoothing procedure\u2019 over the data from the third stage, which succeeded to distinguish the probabilities of the mentioned stages. This results are obtained as a continuation of our previous work, where we proposed methodologies for statistical analysis of colorectal gene expression data obtained from the two widely used platforms, Affymetrix and Illumina.

Methods 23 FEP patients and 23 age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy participants were included in the study. An innovative multivariate approach based on Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) methods was implemented on structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Results MKL provides the best classification performances in comparison with the more widely used Support Vector Machine, enabling the definition of a reliable automatic decisional system based on the integration of multimodal imaging information. Our results show a discrimination accuracy greater than 90% between healthy subjects and patients with FEP. Regions with an accuracy greater than 70% on different imaging sources and measures were middle and superior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, uncinate fascicles and cingulum. Conclusions this study shows that multivariate machine learning approaches integrating multimodal and multisource imaging data can classify FEP patients with high accuracy.

During inference, DBMs function as Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) because of the intractable distributions. To learn the parameters, optimizations can alternatively be operated on these surrogate RNNs with \"truncated message passing\". As a consequence, the gradient will propagate through a long chain without any local guidance which can potentially affects the optimization procedure. In this paper, we address this problem by adding skip connections during back-propagation while keeping the forward propagation (inference) untouched.

This makes LS-CRF orders of magnitude faster than classical CRF training based on probabilistic inference, and at the same time more flexible and easier to implement than other approximate techniques, such as pseudolikelihood or piecewise training. We apply LS-CRF to the task of semantic image segmentation, showing that it achieves on par accuracy to other training techniques at higher speed, thereby allowing efficient CRF training from very large training sets.

This research reports on new methodologies developed for mapping the spatial extent of native grasslands to an unprecedented level of detail and assessing how the grasslands are fragmented. The test site is in the Newell County region of Alberta (NCRA). 72 Landsat and 34 SPOT images from 1985 to 2008 were considered for the analysis. With an airport runway used as a pseudo-invariant feature (PIF), relative radiometric correction was applied to 17 Landsat and 8 SPOT images that included the same airport runway. All the images were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm into grassland, crop, water and road infrastructure classes. The classification results showed an average of 98.2 % overall accuracy for Landsat images and SPOT images. Spatial extents and their temporal change were estimated for all the land cover classes after classifying the images. Fragmentation statistics were obtained using FRAGSTATS 3.3 software that calculated land cover pattern metrics (patch, class and landscape). Based on the available satellite image data, it is found that in Newell County there is almost no significant change found in the grassland and road infrastructure land cover in over two decades.

Using both native and super-resolved data, we then train several custom detection models using the SIMRDWN object detection framework. SIMRDWN combines a number of popular object detection algorithms (e.g. SSD, YOLO) into a unified framework that is designed to rapidly detect objects in large satellite images. This approach allows us to quantify the effects of super-resolution techniques on object detection performance across multiple classes and resolutions.

Finally, the most important features selected by HMIGA are presented, proving the important role of the shank's sensor on the recognition process, where almost 50% of the selected features are from the shank sensor.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICAR.2015.7251474", "venue": "2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)", "journal": "2015 International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1486028797", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7682556", "16940389", "17530883", "15113797", "10396798", "8325117", "25557855", "21867706", "21383262", "16933675", "206764015", "9249389", "53704821", "15113797", "7682556", "16940389", "2791599", "195680386", "37749887", "60371", "9249389"], "inbound_citations": ["210971376", "55554355", "84186445"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15791852"}
