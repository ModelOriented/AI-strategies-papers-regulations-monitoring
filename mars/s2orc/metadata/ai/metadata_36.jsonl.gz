However, large areas of peatland are heavily degraded in the UK. When peat becomes exposed the potential for it to actively sequester carbon is greatly reduced and carbon stores are rapidly lost through erosion. Peatland restoration is a tool that addresses the government public service agreement targets for biodiversity, and soil and water protection in uplands. Blanket bogs are a UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitat. Many areas fall under designations for sites of protection under the EU habitats directive which is aimed at bringing the areas into ?favourable condition?.The Moors for the Future Partnership is restoring large areas of badly eroded peat in the Peak District National Park to stabilise the surface and re-establish ecosystem functions. Monitoring is of pivotal importance to judge the success of the restoration work. This project assesses the suitability of high resolution remote sensing as an alternative monitoring tool to traditional field based plot surveys which are both time consuming and expensive.Remote sensing has been seen as a potential tool for mapping and monitoring peatlands, but to date the application of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing to monitoring peatland restoration has not been fully investigated.A floristic restoration trajectory has been established using a statistical classification (TWINSPAN) of vegetation cover data combined with expert knowledge of previous restoration, and autecology of the moorland species. Hyperspectral classification techniques were applied, including: Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM); Support Vector Machines (SVM); and maximum likelihood classification using both Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), and narrow band vegetation indices. A successful classification of the restoration succession has been achieved.A predictive model for vegetation cover of plant functional types has been produced using a Partial Least Squares Regression and applied to the whole restoration site at the landscape-scale. RMSEs of between 10 and 16% indicate that the models can be used as a useful operational tool.A spectral library of key moorland species and their phenological response has been established using field spectroscopy in parallel to the image analysis. This has enabled the suggestion that the species are most separable from one another in July and it is recommended that this is the optimal month for remote sensing monitoring. This has facilitated the development of a set of recommendations for the most appropriate vegetation indices to use throughout the year depending species to be differentiated. High spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing data is needed to successfully characterise the vegetation response to restoration management in the upland peatland environment.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "623924204", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126496345"}

In contrast, Automatic Speech Recognition handles the speech signal in small, equal-sized parts called frames. Although the speech community has developed techniques for efficient frame classification, these efforts have mostly been ignored in computational paralinguistics. In this study we propose a simple, three-step technique to utilize frame-level DNN training know-how in computational paralinguistics. We show that this method by itself provides good accuracy scores, and by combining it with the standard paralinguistic classification approach, we get close to the performance of heavyweight, state-of-the-art techniques such as Fisher vector analysis. However, our approach has the advantage that it can be easily realized by using standard speech recognition tools. To demonstrate the generic applicability of this three-step method proposed, we performed our experiments on four different corpora containing different paralinguistic tasks. Overall, we were able to achieve improvements over the baseline score in all four cases, leading to relative error reductions of up to 19%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2019.104943", "venue": "Knowl.

For nonlinear regression, the kernel function of SVM transforms the nonlinear input space into a high dimensional feature space in which the solution of the problem can be represented as being a linear regression problem. Therefore, in all probability the performance of SVM models is decided by the kernel function, and choosing a proper kernel function is very important. Whereas the nature of the data is usually unknown, it is very difficult to make, on beforehand, a proper choice out of the possible kernel functions. For this reason, during the model building process, usually more than one kernel is applied to select the one which gives the best prediction performance. Unfortunately, this will lead to a very time-consuming optimization procedure. To circumvent this disadvantage, a novel universal kernel function based on the Pearson VII function (PUKF) is introduced in this paper.

Sentinel-2 is intended to improve vegetation assessment at local to global scale. Rangeland quality assessment is crucial for planning and management of grazing areas. Well managed and improved grazing areas lead to higher livestock production, which is a pillar of the rural economy and livelihoods, especially in many parts of the African continent. Leaf nitrogen (N) is an indicator of rangeland quality, and is crucial for understanding ecosystem function and services. Today, estimation of leaf N is possible using field and imaging spectroscopy. However, a few studies based on commercially available multispectral imageries such as WorldView-2 and RapidEye have shown the potential of a red-edge band for accurately predicting and mapping leaf N at the broad landscape scale. Sentinel-2 has two red edge bands. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of the spectral configuration of Sentinel-2 for estimating leaf N concentration in rangelands and savannas of Southern Africa. Grass canopy reflectance was measured using the FieldSpec 3, Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) in concert with leaf sample collections for leaf N chemical analysis. ASD reflectances were resampled to the spectral bands of Sentinel-2 using published spectral response functions. Random Forest (RF) technique was used to predict leaf N using all thirteen bands. Using leave-one-out cross validation, the RF model explained 90% of leaf N variation, with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.04 (6% of the mean). Interestingly, spectral bands centred at 705 nm (red edge) and two shortwave infrared centred at 2190 and 1610 nm were found to be the most important bands in predicting leaf N. These findings concur with previous studies based on spectroscopy, airborne hyperspectral or multispectral imagery, e.g. RapidEye, on the importance of shortwave infrared and red-edge reflectance in the estimation of leaf N. In that sense, the ESA\u2019s Sentinel-2 sampling in both spectral regions has a unique spectral configuration, and a high potential to estimate leaf N which is crucial for informing decision makers on rangeland condition monitoring.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2067315", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2023439624", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["129494315", "128914031", "36683730", "130528466", "73567688", "123042718", "120831239", "56058974", "15106804", "128936712", "13328009", "129208076", "25556587", "146139655", "85944902", "58919061", "128699141", "118804036", "89141", "11687149", "128755122", "129258567", "15245447", "45944920", "129911397", "119622537", "53367572"], "inbound_citations": ["25656573", "4485698"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129725862"}

While it is powerful, SVMs produce a dense set of high-dimensional weight vectors as output, which are difficult to interpret, and require additional post-processing to relate to known functional networks. In this paper, we propose a joint framework that combines network identification and classification, resulting in a set of networks, or Sparse Connectivity Patterns (SCPs) which are functionally interpretable as well as highly discriminative of the two groups. Applied to a study of normal development classifying children vs. adults, the proposed method provided accuracy of 76%(AUC= 0.85), comparable to SVM (79%,AUC=0.87), but with dramatically fewer number of features (50 features vs. 34716 for the SVM). More importantly, this leads to a tremendous improvement in neuro-scientific interpretability, which is specially advantageous in such a study where the group differences are wide-spread throughout the brain.

The high tolerance to coldness and relatively fast growth rate make this genus the main species group for forestation. According to the predictions of the global circulation model CGCM3, temperature could rise by 2-4 degrees C over the next 100 years. Few studies have been conducted on the response of larch species to climate warming in Northeastern China. Such studies are becoming increasingly needed due to the economic and ecological significance of this genus. This paper studies the potential distribution ranges of three larch species under the current and the warming climate conditions. A new classification and regression tree technique, Random Forest, was used to investigate the potential distributions of three larch species, based on 18 environmental variables which reflect the climate, topography and soil conditions of Northeastern China. The results showed that the biological coldness index (BCI) is the most important factor for Dahurian larch, annual precipitation (AP) is the most important factor for Korean larch and elevation (DEM) is the most important factor for Prince Rupprecht larch. Under the current climate regime, in general, the prediction accuracy for the training dataset is much higher than that of testing dataset. The prediction accuracy for Dahurian larch is much higher than that of other two larch species. Under three climate warming scenarios, the southeast boundary of suitable habitat of Dahurian Larch was modeled to retreat northwestward by 90 km (CGCM3-B1) via 105 km (CGCM3-Al B) to 140 km (CGCM3-A2) scenario. The potential area would thus decrease from 25.5 million ha currently to 13, 9.5 and 7.2 million ha, correspondingly. The northwest boundary of suitable habitat for Korean larch was modeled move northwestward by 100 km (CGCM3-B 1) via 125 km (CGCM3-A1B) to 340 krn (CGCM3-A2), while the southern boundary may move northeastward 125 km via 170-200 km, respectively. The modeled potential area thus decreased from 14.6 million ha to 14.5, 12.6 and 9.7 million ha, correspondingly. The suitable habitat of Prince Rupprecht Larch was modeled to disappear under each of the three scenarios. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To avoid this problem and obtain more faithful visualization results, a variant of SOM, i.e. Dynamic Self-Organizing Map (DSOM), was presented in this paper. DSOM can dynamically increase the map size, as the training data set is expanded according to its intrinsic neighborhood structure, starting from a small neighborhood in which the data points can lie on or close to a linear patch. According to the locally Euclidean nature of the manifold, the map can be guided onto the manifold surface and then the global faithful visualization results can be achieved step by step. Experimental results show that DSOM can discover the intrinsic manifold structure of the data more faithfully than SOM. In addition, as a new manifold learning method, DSOM can obtain more concise visualization results and be less sensitive to the neighborhood size and the noise than typical manifold learning methods, such as Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP) and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), which can also be verified by experimental results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14311/NNW.2015.25.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Neural Network World", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1942028023", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["205709550"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54004621"}

In this paper, we have some contributions for IoT botnet detection: first, we present a novel high-level PSI-rooted subgraph-based feature for the detection of IoT botnets; second, we generate a limited number of features that have precise behavioral descriptions, which require smaller space and reduce processing time; third, The evaluation results show the effectiveness and robustness of PSI-rooted subgraph-based features, as with five machine classifiers consisting of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bagging, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine, each classifier achieves more than 97% detection rate and low time-consuming.

Due to the uncertainty of mechanical wear between kinematic pairs, it is challenging to predict backlash error through physical models directly. An alternative method is to leverage data-driven models to map the degradation. This paper proposes a data-driven method for backlash error predication through Deep Belief Network (DBN). The proposed method focuses on the assessment of both current and future geometric errors for backlash error prediction and subsequent maintenance in machining centers. During the process of prognosis, a DBN via stacking Restricted Boltzmann Machines is constructed for backlash error prediction. Energy-based models enable DBN to mine information hidden behind highly coupled inputs, which makes DBN a feasible method for fault diagnosis and prognosis when the target condition is beyond the historical data. In the experiment, to confirm the effectiveness of deep learning for backlash error prediction, similar popular regression methods, including Support Vector Machine Regression and Back Propagation Neural Network, are employed to present a comprehensive comparison in both diagnosis and prognosis. The experimental results show that the performances of all these regression methods are acceptable in the diagnostic stage.

The goal of image-text cross-modal retrieval is to search images (texts) by using text (image) queries by computing the similarities of images and texts directly. Many existing methods rely on low-level visual features and textual features for cross-modal retrieval, ignoring the characteristics existing in the raw data of different modalities. In this paper, a novel model based on modality-specific feature learning is proposed. Considering the characteristics of different modalities, the model uses two types of convolutional neural networks to map the raw data to the latent space representations for images and texts, respectively. Particularly, the convolution based network used for texts involves word embedding learning, which has been proved effective to extract meaningful textual features for text classification. In the latent space, the mapped features of images and texts form relevant and irrelevant image-text pairs, which are used by the one-vs-more learning scheme. This learning scheme can achieve ranking functionality by allowing for one relevant and more irrelevant pairs. The standard back-propagation technique is employed to update the parameters of two convolutional networks.

The system consists of a customized harness outfitted with wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and a base station for processing IMU data to classify canine postures. Research in operant conditioning, the science of behavior change, indicates that successful animal training requires consistent and accurate feedback on behavior. Properly designed computer systems excel at timeliness and accuracy, which are two characteristics most amateur trainers struggle with and professionals strive for. Therefore, in addition to the system being ergonomically designed to ensure the dog's comfort and well-being, it is engineered to provide posture detection with timing and accuracy on par with a professional trainer. We contend that providing a system with these characteristics will one day aid dogs in learning from humans by overcoming poor or ineffective timing during training. We present the initial steps in the development and validation of a computer-assisted training system designed to work outside of laboratory environments.The main contributions of this work are (a) to explore the trade-off between low-latency responses to changes in time-series IMU data representative of posture changes while maintaining accuracy and timing similar to a professional trainer, and (b) to provide a model for future ACI technologies by documenting the user-centered approach we followed to create a computer-assisted training system that met the criteria identified in (a). Accordingly, in addition to describing our system, we present the results of three experiments to characterize the performance of the system at capturing sit postures of dogs and providing timely reinforcement. These trade-offs are illustrated through the comparison of two algorithms. The first is Random Forest classification and the second is an algorithm which uses a Variance-based Threshold for classification of postures. Results indicate that with proper parameter tuning, our system can successfully capture and reinforce postures to provide computer-assisted training of dogs.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.04.010", "venue": "Int.

Bioinformatics provides a wide range of applications for Multitask Learning (MTL) methods. Identification of Bacterial virulent protein is one such application that helps in understanding the virulence mechanism for the design of drug and vaccine. However, the limiting factor in a reliable prediction model is the scarcity of the experimentally verified training data. To deal with, casting the problem in a Multitask Learning scenario, could be beneficial. Reusability of auxiliary data from related multiple domains in the prediction of target domain with limited labeled data is the primary objective of multitask learning model. Due to the amalgamation of multiple related data, it is possible that the probability distribution between the features tends to vary. Therefore, to deal with change amongst the feature distribution, this paper proposes a composite model for multitask learning framework which is based on two principles: discovering the shared parameters for identifying the relationships between tasks and common underlying representation of features amongst the related tasks. Through multi-kernel and factorial evolution, the proposed framework able to discover the shared kernel parameters and latent feature representation that is common amongst the tasks. To examine the benefits of the proposed model, an extensive experiment is performed on the freely available dataset at VirulentPred web server. Based on the results, we found that multitask learning model performs better than the conventional single task model. Additionally, our findings state that if the distribution between the tasks is high, then training the multiple models yield slightly better prediction. However, if the data distribution difference is low, multitask learning significantly outperforms the individual learning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31813491", "doi": "10.1016/j.artmed.2019.101757", "venue": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "journal": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "mag_id": "2984224296", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208955378"}

The discriminative capability of machine learning methods has recently been used to facilitate STD. This paper presents a new approach to improve STD using support vector machines (SVM) based on acoustic information. The concept of pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) well used in the retrieval of text, image and video is used here. The basic idea of using PRF here is to assume some spoken segments in the first-pass retrieved results are relevant (or pseudo-relevant) and some others irrelevant (or pseudo-irrelevant), and take these segments as positive and negative examples to train a query-specific SVM. This SVM is then used for re-ranking the first-pass retrieved results, and only the re-ranked results are shown to the user. In this paper, feature vectors representing the spoken segments based on acoustic information to be used in SVM are considered and analyzed. Furthermore, conventionally in PRF the items with the highest and lowest scores in the first-pass retrieved results are respectively taken as pseudo-relevant and -irrelevant, but in this way some incorrect examples are inevitably included in the training data especially when the recognition accuracy is poor. Here we further propose an enhanced SVM which not only better selects positive/negative examples considering the reliability of the spoken segments, but emphasizes more on more reliable training examples by modifying the SVM formulation.

This later offers a scientific watch tool, Peerus, addressing various issues, such as the real time recommendation of newly published papers or the search for active experts to start new collaborations. To tackle this diversity of applications, a common approach consists in learning representations of the nodes and attributes of this HAN and use them as features for a variety of recommendation tasks. However, most works on attributed network embedding pay too little attention to textual attributes and do not fully take advantage of recent natural language processing techniques. Moreover, proposed methods that jointly learn node and document representations do not provide a way to effectively infer representations for new documents for which network information is missing, which happens to be crucial in real time recommender systems.

Gaze direction estimates are beneficial in the context of surveillance as an indicator of an individual's intentions and their interest in their surroundings and other people. The overall task is broken down into two problems. The first is that of tracking large numbers of pedestrians in low resolution video, which is required to identify the head regions within video frames. The second problem is to process the extracted head regions and estimate the direction in which the person is facing as a coarse estimate of their gaze direction. The first approach for head tracking combines image measurements from HOG head detections and KLT corner tracking using a Kalman filter, and can track the heads of many pedestrians simultaneously to output head regions with pixel-level accuracy. The second approach uses Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Data Association (MCMCDA) within a temporal sliding window to provide similarly accurate head regions, but with improved speed and robustness. The improved system accurately tracks the heads of twenty pedestrians in 1920x1080 video in real-time and can track through total occlusions for short time periods. The approaches for gaze direction estimation all make use of randomised decision tree classifiers. The first develops classifiers for low resolution head images that are invariant to hair and skin colours using branch decisions based on abstract labels rather than direct image measurements. The second approach addresses higher resolution images using HOG descriptors and novel Colour Triplet Comparison (CTC) based branches. The final approach infers custom appearance models for individual scenes using weakly supervised learning over large datasets of approximately 500,000 images.

We provide a new Bayesian procedure for drawing inferences about the nature and number of decision rules that are present in a population of agents. We show that the algorithm performs well in both a Monte Carlo study and in an empirical application. We apply our procedure to analyze the actual behavior of subjects who are confronted with a difficult dynamic stochastic decision problem in a laboratory setting. The procedure does an excellent job of grouping the subjects into easily interpretable types. Given the difficultly of the decision problem, we were surprised to find that nearly a third of subjects were a \u201cNear Rational\u201d type that played a good approximation to the optimal decision rule. More than 40% of subjects followed a rule that we describe as \u201cfatalistic,\u201d since they play as if they don\u2019t appreciate the extent to which payoffs are a controlled stochastic process. And about a quarter of the subjects are classified as \u201cConfused,\u201d since they play the game quite poorly.

Climate and in particular temperature plays a key role in vine physiology and phenology. Temperatures can be highly variable inside a winegrowing region and they are strongly related to local environment (topography, water bodies, vegetation, urban areas...). General Circulation Models (GCM) and dynamical regional models can not take into account this local variability due to their low resolution. For fine scale modeling, a classic option is to create model based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using temperature as dependant variable and local parameters as predictor variables. Though efficient, the non-linearity assumption is a strong constraint that limits performances of spatial models at the vineyard scale. In this study, we compared two fully automated methods which estimate daily temperature and temperature sums at a very fine scale, based on linear (MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Regression: SVR) assumptions. Data were registered using a network of temperature data loggers installed in 2011 in renown sub-appellations of the Bordeaux area, including Saint-Emilion and Pomerol. Three growing seasons were studied 2012, 2013 and 2014. Model validation showed that SVR presented better results in each case thanks to the non linear component, for an equivalent computing time. Our study has highlighted that a high density network produces maps with a wider range of temperatures compared to medium to low density networks commonly used at a regional scale. In this article, a replicable and highly accurate model was created to produce fine scale temperature maps.

At the time of diagnosis, more than half of the patients will have disseminated disease and, yet, diagnosing can be challenging. New methods are desired to improve the diagnostic work-up. Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles displaying various proteins on their membrane surfaces. In addition, they are readily available in blood samples where they constitute potential biomarkers of human diseases, such as cancer. Here, we examine the potential of distinguishing non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients from control subjects based on the differential display of exosomal protein markers. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Plasma was isolated from 109 NSCLC patients with advanced stage (IIIa-IV) disease and 110 matched control subjects initially suspected of having cancer, but diagnosed to be cancer free. The Extracellular Vesicle Array (EV Array) was used to phenotype exosomes directly from the plasma samples. The array contained 37 antibodies targeting lung cancer-related proteins and was used to capture exosomes, which were visualised with a cocktail of biotin-conjugated CD9, CD63 and CD81 antibodies. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The EV Array analysis was capable of detecting and phenotyping exosomes in all samples from only 10 \u00b5L of unpurified plasma. Multivariate analysis using the Random Forests method produced a combined 30-marker model separating the two patient groups with an area under the curve of 0.83, CI: 0.77-0.90. The 30-marker model has a sensitivity of 0.75 and a specificity of 0.76, and it classifies patients with 75.3% accuracy. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The EV Array technique is a simple, minimal-invasive tool with potential to identify lung cancer patients.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4348413", "pubmed_id": "25735706", "doi": "10.3402/jev.v4.26659", "venue": "Journal of Extracellular Vesicles", "journal": "Journal of Extracellular Vesicles", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2159903805", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["31558568", "668694", "16586485", "35935086", "5336704", "17433524", "41382249", "2025385", "6351735", "7854217", "25028623", "10311923", "27601726", "4966807", "14148823", "46729411", "34573113", "42421156", "15707344", "23500526", "44609974", "23085454", "6646401", "25152954", "8335465", "42727262", "1145443", "26991978", "7011852", "8931497", "35671693", "10993886", "9879730", "40280319", "33534215", "23698306", "28358476", "3560775", "987303", "95416", "21436720", "24820851", "1549894", "5976387", "34398717", "74060757", "8432375", "25343464", "41142466", "3211916", "13525790", "356368", "16169058", "42498785", "21778120", "23416489"], "inbound_citations": ["56321818", "58014547", "17844332", "38130891", "29253382", "214606929", "215428770", "89864828", "195066381", "4042883", "23755514", "91262320", "3588621", "23476826", "24908372", "211044385", "23950935", "57783846", "51705775", "2915037", "57761876", "215516612", "202573813", "206027585", "203638198", "3998065", "24471158", "11689008", "215008934", "89703987", "214590780", "25245078", "52112185", "52142440", "215436619", "204800147", "215556252", "215359716", "195695568", "215448635", "22837277", "58559802", "198966034", "1663273", "1531109", "32752819", "86637622", "210880347", "215166547", "135174", "215723621", "4901815", "25464539", "3716680", "4862087", "52247975", "3576867", "215485997", "215485997", "1500277", "16085392", "214889622", "77395068", "75135590", "4332886", "49413214", "16343879", "204939837", "204939837", "202802201", "47005242", "31810404", "214954308", "215167143", "213640446", "212615520", "9833717", "7889949", "215450557", "44138643", "14101903", "8459943", "3820201", "215490910", "51874293", "3804966", "2553846"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16393981"}

The label propagation algorithm is known to be one of the near-linear solutions which is easy to implement. However, it is not stable and it cannot take advantage of the prior information about the network structure which is very common in real applications. In this paper, a new Semi-supervised clustering approach based on an Evidential Label Propagation strategy (SELP) is proposed to incorporate limited domain knowledge into the community detection model. The main advantage of SELP is that it can effectively use limited supervised information to guide the detection process. The prior information about the labels of nodes in the graph, including the labeled nodes and the unlabeled ones, is initially expressed in the form of mass functions. Then the evidential label propagation rule is designed to propagate the labels from the labeled nodes to the unlabeled ones. The communities of each node can be identified after the propagation process becomes stable. The outliers can be identified to be in a special class. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SELP on both graphs and classical data sets.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijar.2017.09.008", "venue": "Int.

We train a classifier-based detector for elevated regions in laser exposure result images. For this purpose we acquire two high resolution layer images: one after laser exposure and another one after powder deposition for the next layer. Ground truth labels for critical regions are obtained from analysis of the latter, where elevated regions are not covered by powder. We compute dense descriptors (HOG, DAISY, LBP) on the surface image after laser exposure and compare their predictive power. The top five descriptor configurations are used to optimize parameters of Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifiers. We validate the detectors with optimized parameters using cross-validation on 281 images from three build jobs. Using a DAISY descriptor with a SGD classifier we achieve a F1-score of 0.670.

In the early stages of the plants' development, the color of both the plants and the weeds are similar, making it difficult to differentiate between the two. The process becomes even harder if the weeds and plants overlap. The proposed system addresses this problem by creating a sophisticated mean for weed identification. The major components of this system are composed of three processes: image segmentation, feature extraction and decision-making. In the image segmentation process, the input images are processed into lower units where the relevant features are extracted. In the decision-making process, the system makes use of the Support Vector Machine to analyze and segregate the weeds from the plants. Afterward, the findings are used to dictate which plants receive herbicides and which do not.

In this study, we propose both supervised and unsupervised machine learning strategies to improve tumor characterization. Our first approach is based on supervised learning for which we demonstrate significant gains in deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), by utilizing completely 3D approach and transfer learning to address the requirements of volumetric and large amount of training data, respectively. Motivated by the radiologists' interpretations of the scans, we then show how to incorporate task dependent feature representations into a CAD system via a graph regularized sparse Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework. ::: In the second approach, we explore an unsupervised scheme in order to address the limited availability of labeled training data, a common problem in medical imaging applications. Inspired by learning from label proportion (LLP) approaches, we propose a new algorithm, proportion-SVM, to characterize tumor types.

The main objective is to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence a particular phenotype (i.e. disease trait). GWAS typically use a p-value threshold of 5 10 8 to identify highly ranked SNPs. While this approach has proven useful for detecting disease-susceptible SNPs, evidence has shown that many of these are, in fact, false positives. Consequently, there is some ambiguity about the most suitable threshold for claiming genome-wide significance. Many believe that using lower p-values will allow us to investigate the joint epistatic interactions between SNPs and provide better insights into phenotype expression. One example that uses this approach is multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), which identifies combinations of SNPs that interact to influence a particular outcome. However, computational complexity is increased exponentially as a function of higher-order combinations making approaches like MDR difficult to implement. Even so, understanding epistatic interactions in complex diseases is a fundamental component for robust genotype-phenotype mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines GWAS quality control and logistic regression with deep learning stacked autoencoders to abstract higher-order SNP interactions from large, complex genotyped data for case-control classification tasks in GWAS analysis. We focus on the challenging problem of classifying preterm births which has a strong genetic component with unexplained heritability reportedly between 20%-40%. A GWAS data set, obtained from dbGap is utilised, which contains predominantly urban low-income African-American women who had normal and preterm deliveries. Epistatic interactions from original SNP sequences were extracted through a deep learning stacked autoencoder model and used to fine-tune a classifier for discriminating between term and preterm births observations. All models are evaluated using standard binary classifier performance metrics.

In order to reveal the thematic grid of a sentence, a system called HTRP (Hybrid Thematic Role Processor) is proposed, in which the connectionist architecture has, as input, a featural representation of the words of a sentence, and, as output, its thematic grid.

These bottles are then sorted into the respective containers. Manual sorting may not be a suitable option for recycling facilities of high throughput. It has also been noted that the high turnover among sorting line workers had caused difficulties in achieving consistency in the plastic separation process. As a result, an intelligent system for automated sorting is greatly needed to replace manual sorting system. The core components of machine vision for this intelligent sorting system is the image recognition and classification.[3]Therefore, in this work, an automated classification of plastic bottles based on the extraction of best feature vectors to represent the type of plastic bottles is performed using the morphological based approach. Morphological operations are used to describe the structure or form of an image. By using the two-dimensional description of plastic bottle silhouettes, edge detection of the object silhouette is performed followed by the erosion process. This procedure can be considered as two stages; a) a feature vector is extracted from the analysis of morphological operation and structure element used and b) a classification technique is applied to that input vector in order to provide a meaningful categorization of the data content. In this study, Support Vector Machines (SVM) was employed merely to classify the image of two groups of plastic bottles namely polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) and non-PET. Additionally, for detailed classification task, the pattern of decision boundary for classification of extracted feature vectors based on morphological approach is also illustrated.

Colored and fluorescent samples were included in the study, which made Raman spectroscopy challenging although fluorescence was diminished by using an excitation wavelength of 1064 nm.

Classification is done using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on sets of Army, Air Force and Navy camouflage uniform personnel datasets. In the proposed system, the arm of service of personnel is recognised by the camouflage of a persons uniform, type of cap and the type of badge/logo. The detailed analysis done include; camouflage cap and plain cap differentiation using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture feature; classification on Army, Air Force and Navy camouflaged uniforms using GLCM texture and colour histogram bin features; plain cap badge classification into Army, Air Force and Navy using Speed Up Robust Feature (SURF). The proposed method recognised camouflage personnel arm of service on sets of data retrieved from google images and selected military websites. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) was used to improve recognition and reduce dimensionality, thereby speeding the classification process. With this method success rates recorded during the analysis include 93.8% for camouflage appearance category, 100%, 90% and 100% rates of plain cap and camouflage cap categories for Army, Air Force and Navy categories, respectively. Accurate recognition was recorded using SURF for the plain cap badge category. Substantial analysis has been carried out and results prove that the proposed method can correctly classify military personnel into various arms of service. We show that the proposed method can be integrated into a face recognition system, which will recognise personnel in addition to determining the arm of service which the personnel belong.

It is commonly achieved after performing feature selection that consists of selecting appropriate features to enhance the classification accuracy. Most of feature selection based text classification methods rely on building a term-frequency inverse-document frequency feature vector which is not usually efficient. In addition, numerous document classification studies are focused on English language. This paper deals with Arabic Text Classification which is not intensively studied due to the complexity of Arabic language. A new firefly algorithm based feature selection method is proposed. This algorithm has been successfully applied in different combinatorial problems. However, it has not been involved in feature selection concept to deal with Arabic Text Classification. To validate this technique, Support Vector Machine classifier is used as well as three evaluation measures including precision, recall and F-measure. Furthermore, experiments on OSAC real dataset along with a comparison with the state-of-the-art methods are performed. The proposed method achieves a precision value equals to 0.994.

The field has been studied for a long time, with many techniques such as classical machine learning and deep learning methods currently available. However, the emergence of stronger encryption protocols has led to the rise of new challenges. One of the challenges is capturing and labeling a large amount of encrypted traffic data especially for training deep learning classifiers, as current techniques rely on deep packet inspection tools (DPI) which perform poorly on encrypted traffic. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The basic idea is to utilize the samples generated by DCGAN generators as well as unlabeled data to improve the performance of a classifier trained on a few labeled samples. Thus, alleviating the difficulties associated with large dataset collecting and labeling.

However, kernel SVM always has high computational cost in practice which makes it unsuitable to handle large scale data. Moreover, kernel SVM always brings hyper-parameters, e.g. bandwidth in Gaussian kernel. Since the hyper-parameters have a significant influence on the final performance of kernel SVM and are pretty hard to tune especially for large scale data, one may need to put lots of effort into finding good enough parameters, and improper settings of the hyper-parameters often make the classification performance even lower than that of linear SVM. Inspired by recent progresses on linear SVM for dealing with large scale data, we propose a well-designed classifier to efficiently handle large scale linearly inseparable data, i.e. Decision Tree SVM (DTSVM). DTSVM has much lower computational cost compared with kernel SVM, and it brings almost no hyper-parameters except a few thresholds which can be fixed in practice.

Despite of its extraordinary successes in stream data mining, existing ensemble models, in stream data environments, mainly fall into the ensemble classifiers category, without realizing that building classifiers requires labor intensive labeling process, and it is often the case that we may have a small number of labeled samples to train a few classifiers, but a large number of unlabeled samples are available to build clusters from data streams. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new ensemble model which combines both classifiers and clusters together for mining data streams. We argue that the main challenges of this new ensemble model include (1) clusters formulated from data streams only carry cluster IDs, with no genuine class label information, and (2) concept drifting underlying data streams makes it even harder to combine clusters and classifiers into one ensemble framework. To handle challenge (1), we present a label propagation method to infer each cluster's class label by making full use of both class label information from classifiers, and internal structure information from clusters.

However, this manual diagnostic method is imprecise because many ignition patterns are very similar. Therefore, a diagnosis may need many trials to identify the malfunctioning parts. Meanwhile the mechanic needs to disassemble and assemble the engine parts for verification. To tackle this problem, Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is firstly employed to extract the features of the ignition pattern. With the extracted features, a statistics over the frequency subbands of the pattern can then be produced, which can be used by Multi-classLeast Squares Support Vector Machines (MCLS-SVM) for engine fault classification. With the newly proposed classification system, the number of diagnostic trials can be reduced. Besides, MCLS-SVM is also compared with a typical classification method, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).

In addition, a focus on prediction accuracy often comes at the cost of slower processing time. This paper focuses on the prediction of future human actions in an intelligent environment with the goal of achieving both high prediction accuracy and response times that are appropriate for a real-time application environment. We performed experiments using the MavPad dataset, which was gathered from a fully-instrumented home environment, and compared several different machine learning algorithms that included both single and ensemble classifiers. This study investigates whether an ensemble approach will satisfy the condition of realtime application much better than the performance of a single classifier. The results show that using a Support Vector Machine as a single classifier approach achieves the best results when using a group of sensors within a local zone, while the Random Forest classifier as an ensemble classifier approach achieves a higher performance when using sensors that are distributed across all zones inside the environment.

In this review we present a different approach to language research that has emerged from the parallel distributed processing or \u2019connectionist\u2019 enterprise. In the connectionist framework, mental operations are studied by simulating learning and processing within networks of artificial neurons. With that in mind, we discuss recent progress in connectionist models of auditory word recognition, reading, morphology, and syntactic processing. We argue that connectionist models can capture many important characteristics of how language is learned, represented, and processed, as well as providing new insights about the source of these behavioral patterns.

Two RF models were generated, including: (1) all MODIS reflective bands; and (2) only the red (R) and near infrared (NIR) bands. Active fire information, vegetation indices and auxiliary variables were taken into account as well. Both RF models were trained using a statistically designed sample of 130 reference sites, which took into account the global diversity of fire conditions. For each site, fire perimeters were obtained from multitemporal pairs of Landsat TM/ETM+ images acquired in 2008. Those fire perimeters were used to extract burned and unburned areas to train the RF models. Using the standard MD43A4 resolution (500 \u00d7 500 m), the training dataset included 48,365 burned pixels and 6,293,205 unburned pixels. Different combinations of number of trees and number of parameters were tested. The final RF models included 600 trees and 5 attributes. The RF full model (considering all bands) provided a balanced accuracy of 0.94, while the RF RNIR model had 0.93. As a first assessment of these RF models, they were used to classify daily MCD43A4 images in three test sites for three consecutive years (2006\u20132008). The selected sites included different ecosystems: Australia (Tropical), Boreal (Canada) and Temperate (California), and extended coverage (totaling more than 2,500,000 km2). Results from both RF models for those sites were compared with national fire perimeters, as well as with two existing BA MODIS products; the MCD45 and MCD64. Considering all three years and three sites, commission error for the RF Full model was 0.16, with an omission error of 0.23. For the RF RNIR model, these errors were 0.19 and 0.21, respectively. The existing MODIS BA products had lower commission errors, but higher omission errors (0.09 and 0.33 for the MCD45 and 0.10 and 0.29 for the MCD64) than those obtained with the RF models, and therefore they showed less balanced accuracies.

Most of the published works focused on accurate classifiers design to produce identity predictions for query faces without suggesting how reliable the predictions are. These classifiers may not be applicable in some critical situations where the incorrect predictions have serious consequences. Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper proposes a highly reliable face recognition scheme by Random Subspace Support Vector Machine (SVM) ensemble which provides a reject option. Being different with previous classifier ensembles which purpose to increase the classification accuracy only, the objective of the proposed SVM ensemble is to supply classification confidence to accommodate the situations where no decision should be made if the confidence is low. The ensemble is created using Random Subspace (RS) method, together with four different feature descriptions to comprehensively characterize face images, including Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG), Gabor filtering and wavelet transform. The consensus from the ensemble's voting conforms to the confidence measure and the rejection option is accomplished accordingly when the confidence falls below a threshold. The reliable recognition scheme is empirically evaluated using a realistic face database created by the author, showing that pre-defined 100% accuracy can be reached with a rejection rate 7%.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358950", "venue": "2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journal": "2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2094452178", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["64400393", "9209281", "37530814", "206590483", "7211257", "369876", "206420153", "61437731", "35730151", "44861092", "961425", "207738357", "16596563"], "inbound_citations": ["126403555"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11409959"}

The neural network partitions each training bag (obtained using bagging) at the root level into C subsets where C is the number of classes in the dataset and subsequently, C oblique decision trees are trained on such partitions. The proposed method provides a rich insight into the data by grouping the confusing or hard to classify samples for each class and thus, provides an opportunity to employ fine-grained classification rule over the data. The performance of the ensemble classifier is evaluated on several multi-class datasets where it demonstrates a superior performance compared to other state-of- the-art classifiers.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1802.01240", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489738", "venue": "2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2786776331,2963913807,2950281621", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["7732239", "62574244", "11407469", "8206601", "10603765", "60993494", "15043609", "62527551", "4821855", "52812153", "207428618", "207738357", "35018957", "41654006", "35758499", "123819049", "35144651", "62599243", "11883992", "6771667", "10738438", "9166592", "15235617", "20753527", "15133030", "3117752", "15874442"], "inbound_citations": ["203734673", "59553791", "195767000"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3632068"}

The territorial nature of breeding Cactus wren is well-documented and typically involves nest usurping (i.e., destruction) of conspecifics. Due to their similar nesting ecology, breeding Verdin are frequently the target of such behavior and are often forced to move or abandon nests. Using the Verdin/Cactus wren system as a case study, our goal was to evaluate the performance of SDMs that include only environmental predictors with SDMs that also include biotic relationships as predictors. Location East Foundation\u2019s San Antonio Viejo Ranch in south Texas. Methods We built SDMs (MaxEnt, Boosted Regression Tree [BRT], and Random Forest [RF]) to project Verdin distribution during the early (April through mid-May), peak (mid-May through mid-June), and late (mid-June through mid-July) breeding periods using occurrence data collected during the 2015 and 2016 breeding seasons. We ran parallel analyses using relevant environmental features alone as predictors and then environmental features with observed Cactus wren density. Results Random Forest (RF) produced the highest predictive performance SDMs for all three breeding periods (AUC = 0.81-0.99; TSS = 0.23-0.73). All models improved in predictive power ( \u0394 AUC = 0.01-0.10) and model sensitivity ( \u0394 TSS = 0.09-0.66) with the inclusion of Cactus wren density as a predictor of Verdin presence. Main conclusions Our results indicate that SDM performance is improved by the inclusion of biotic relationships as predictors. Incorporating biotic interactions, as well as their temporal trends, is essential in efforts to monitor or conserve bird species with similar nesting ecologies. Further, modeling algorithms that can accommodate complex, non-linear relationships (e.g., Random Forest) should be preferred in SDM development and application.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108743", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecological Modelling", "mag_id": "2959266423", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203878487"}

Therefore, combining the dissolved gas analysis (DGA) technology, a transformer fault diagnosis method based on Gray Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO) optimized hybrid kernel extreme learning machine is proposed in this paper. Firstly, based on Mercer's theorem, a hybrid kernel extreme learning machine model is constructed by combining the local radial basis kernel function and the global polynomial kernel function. Secondly, the parameters of hybrid kernel function can be optimized by the GWO algorithm. Meanwhile, the Logistic chaotic map is used to generate the initial population parameters of the GWO algorithm, which makes the distribution of initial population parameters as evenly as possible to avoid adverse effect of convergence speed and the optimization results.

The methodology was designed to optimize the search of parsimonious models by feature selection, parameter tuning and model selection. In this work, different experiments are conducted with four complexity metrics in six high dimensional datasets. Although XGBoost performs well with high-dimensional databases, preliminary results indicated that GA-PARSIMONY with feature selection slightly improved the testing error.

It is therefore convenient to have a practical statistical method for the accurate classification of individuals into carriers and non-carriers. In this paper, we compared \u2013 through cross-validation\u2013 five classification models (Lasso-penalized logistic regression \u2013Lasso, Support Vector Machines with either linear or radial kernel \u2013SVML and SVMR, k-nearest neighbors \u2013KNN, and multi-allelic gene prediction \u2013MAG), for the identification of carriers of the TUBD1 recessive mutation on BTA19 (Bos taurus autosome 19), known to be associated with high calf mortality. A population of 3116 Fleckvieh and 392 Brown Swiss animals genotyped with the 54K SNP-chip was available for the analysis. Results: In general, the use of SNP genotypes proved to be very effective for the identification of mutation carriers. The best predictive models were Lasso, SVML and MAG, with an average error rate, respectively, of 0.2 %, 0.4 % and 0.6 % in Fleckvieh, and 1.2 %, 0.9 % and 1.7 % in Brown Swiss. For the three models, the false positive rate was, respectively, 0.1 %, 0.1 % and 0.2 % in Fleckvieh, and 3.0 %, 2.4 % and 1.6 % in Brown Swiss; the false negative rate was 4.4 %, 7.6 % 1.0 % in Fleckvieh, and 0.0 %, 0.1% and 0.8 % in Brown Swiss. MAG appeared to be more robust to sample size reduction: with 25 % of the data, the average error rate was 0.7 % and 2.2 % in Fleckvieh and Brown Swiss, compared to 2.1 % and 5.5 % with Lasso, and 2.6 % and 12.0 % with SVML. Conclusions: The use of SNP genotypes is a very effective and efficient technique for the identification of mutation carriers in cattle populations.

In this work, we proposed a transfer learning\u2013based deep learning approach, for classification of prostate lesions in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging images. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging images were preprocessed to remove bias artifact and normalize the data. Two state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network models, InceptionV3 and VGG-16, were pretrained on ImageNet data set and retuned on the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data set. As lesion appearances differ by the prostate zone that it resides in, separate models were trained. Ensembling was performed on each prostate zone to improve area under the curve. In addition, the predictions from lesions on each prostate zone were scaled separately to increase the area under the curve for all lesions combined. Results: The models were tuned to produce the highest area under the curve on validation data set. When it was applied to the unseen test data set, the transferred InceptionV3 model achieved an area under the curve of 0.81 and the transferred VGG-16 model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83.

To study land use / cover, remote sensing as an efficient technology, is always desired by experts. In this case, classification could be considered as one of the most important methods of extracting information from digital satellite images. Selecting the best classification method and applying the proper values for parameters extremely influence the trust level of extracted land use maps.

Moreover, we prove its potential for structure\u2013activity relationship analysis on Aster multispectral data of central county of Kabodar-Ahang region in Hamedan, Iran. Accuracy of SVMs method is varied by the type of kernel functions and its parameters. The purpose of this research is to find the accuracy of Land use extraction by SVM method by Polynomial and radial basis functions kernel with their estimated optimum parameters in addition to compare the results with Maximum Likelihood method. Most of the scientists imply that Maximum Likelihood method is suitable for classification. Therefore, we try to compare SVM with ML method and to deliberate the efficiency of this new method in classification progress on Aster multispectral data. The accuracy of SVM method by Polynomial and radial basis functions kernel with optimum parameters and ML classification methods achieved 93.18%, 91.77% and 88.35 % respectively as an overall accuracy. By comparing the accuracy of these methods, SVM method by Polynomial kernel was evaluated as suitable. Therefore, we can suggest using SVM method especially with the use of Polynomial kernel to determine land use.

Since thermal power generation is the main form of power generation, the large-scale development of electric vehicles is equivalent to replacing oil with coal, which will accordingly result in carbon emissions increasing if the scale of electric vehicles exceeds a certain limit. A relationship model between regional energy mix structure and electric vehicles holdings under the constraint of carbon emission reduction is established to perform a quantitative analysis of the limitation mechanism. In order to measure the scale of the future electric vehicle market under the constraint of carbon emissions reduction, a method called Extreme Learning Machine optimized by Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO-ELM) with higher precision than Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed to predict the power structure and the trend of electric vehicle development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2019\u20132030.

The proportion of clean energy generation should reach 0.314 and 0.323 to match a complete replacement of traditional fuel vehicles for electric vehicles. A substantial increase in clean energy generation is needed so that the large-scale promotion of electric vehicles can still achieve the goal of carbon reduction. Therefore, this article will be helpful for policy-making on electric vehicle development scale and energy mix structure in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/su11102928", "venue": null, "journal": "Sustainability", "mag_id": "2944939169", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201242477"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:181797060"}

In addition, some recent studies have suggested that increasing the number of nurses in selected geographic areas could lead to the reduction of the rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations in those areas. In the meantime, health authorities are highly interested in solutions improving health care services to reduce the potentially avoidable hospitalizations. The first approaches could be based on descriptive statistics such as actual rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations at the geographic area level. These simple approaches have limitations since they do not consider other potential factors associated to the high rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach using support vector machine for regression to select not only the geographic areas but also the number of to-be-added nurses in these areas for the biggest reduction of potentially avoidable hospitalizations. In this approach, besides considering all the potential factors, we also take into account the constraints related to the budget and the equality of health care access. In our work, we specifically apply the approach on the Occitanie, France region and geographic areas mentioned above are the cross-border living areas (fr. Bassins de vie-BVs).

On the other hand, deep learning networks are ill-equipped for incremental learning. When a well-trained network is adapted to new categories, its performance on the old categories will dramatically degrade. To address this problem, incremental learning methods have been explored to preserve the old knowledge of deep learning models. However, the state-of-the-art incremental object detector employs an external fixed region proposal method that increases overall computation time and reduces accuracy compared to object detectors such as Faster RCNN that use trainable Region Proposal Networks (RPNs). The purpose of this paper is to design an efficient end-to-end incremental object detector using knowledge distillation for object detectors based on RPNs. We first evaluate and analyze the performance of RPN-based detector with classic distillation towards incremental detection tasks. Then, we introduce multi-network adaptive distillation that properly retains knowledge from the old categories when fine-turning the model for new task.

This demands adaptive, learning-based techniques for constructing malware detection engines, instead of the traditional manual-based strategies. Prior work in learning-based malware detection engines primarily focuses on dynamic trace analysis and byte-level n-grams. Our approach in this paper differs in that we use compiler intermediate representations, i.e., the callgraph representation of binaries. Using graph-based program representations for learning provides structure of the program, which can be used to learn more advanced patterns. We use the Shortest Path Graph Kernel (SPGK) to identify similarities between call graphs extracted from binaries. The output similarity matrix is fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to construct highly-accurate models to predict whether a binary is malicious or not. However, SPGK is computationally expensive due to the size of the input graphs. Therefore, we evaluate different parallelization methods for CPUs and GPUs to speed up this kernel, allowing us to continuously construct up-to-date models in a timely manner. Our hybrid implementation, which leverages both CPU and GPU, yields the best performance, achieving up to a 14.2x improvement over our already optimized OpenMP version. We compared our generated graph-based models to previously state-of-the-art feature vector 2-gram and 3-gram models on a dataset consisting of over 22,000 binaries. We show that our classification accuracy using graphs is over 19% higher than either n-gram model and gives a false positive rate (FPR) of less than 0.1%.

In this paper, we argue that, regardless of the feature extractor, it is crucial to carefully design a metric learning pipeline, namely the loss function, the sampling strategy and the discriminative margin parameter, for building robust diarization systems. Furthermore, we propose to adopt a fine-grained validation process to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the generalization power of metric learning pipelines. To this end, we measure diarization performance across different language speakers, and variations in the number of speakers in a recording.

The log data include neutron porosity, water saturation, and shale volume. The multinomial response factor is the measured vertical Lithofacies sequence that has mainly sand, shale, and shaly sand.

The nonlinear separations of components handled by KSVM led to obtaining high level of accuracy of lithofacies prediction and attained 99.55% of the total correct percent. After depicting the vertical sand, shale, and shaly sand posterior distribution, it was shown that KSVM prediction has compatible between the sand posterior values with the high records of neutron porosity and low intervals of shale volume.

Since the major goal of AI is to maximize efficiency, this lack of research is very reasonable. However, a formal description of negative aspects of learning remains an important inquiry, since it seems to be a common feature of cognitive processes. ::: ::: Negative Transfer of Learning denotes a well-observed, yet widely discussed phenomenon in Psychology: the knowledge of one type of domain may hinder or prevent the learning success of a new domain. In the classic AB-AC list paradigm, previously acquired associative knowledge maps the output to a different target, hence decreasing efficiency. Once the source domain is identified as faulty, the source domain gets forgotten with each computation. ::: ::: Niche competition: ::: ::: Inspired by the competitive exclusion principle, the author models the two task domains as competing niches, the overlap of which constitutes a space where learning is impaired. The author aims to develop a model of negative transfer in a heterogeneous feature space environment using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the algorithm performs at a steady low level, the author tries to validate the above mentioned theory by adding a power function into the computations, which approximates the 'forgetting' rate of the source domain. As an expected result, the target domain will be learned at a faster rate, even though source and target share a substantial amount of features (usually considered to aid learning). ::: ::: The computational experiments section of the study will use a transfer source data set likely consisting of pictures and a transfer target data set consisting of elements sharing several structural features with the source (data was not selected yet at time of submission). We predict that for the given data sets, results will not just project a negative learning outcome, but will moreover allow predictions to negative transfer effects in real-life situations. ::: ::: Behavioral Experiment: ::: ::: If time and effort capacities allow, a small behavioral sensorimotor experiment is planned where knowledge (source) and prospected learning outcome (target) are calibrated in a relation similar to the data sets used. The method will consist of action-planning based on similar knowledge compared to the desired outcome of the task (for example, learning an accuracy-demanding task which, after a high success rate is reached, then has to be performed inversely). Data will be recorded with a trigger that allows the participant to perform the tasks on a screen. If the niche competition approach remains a valid assumption, similar distributions of negative-then-positive learning courves can be predicted. ::: ::: Prospective Conclusions: ::: ::: This would contribute strong evidence for a probabilistic approach to cognition, rather than being representational, computationally-oriented, since learning success would not be stored as elements that will be recalled by a certain set of functions when needed. Rather, the mind applies previously learned theories of the world that are controlled for outcome while being executed. ::: ::: Literature: ::: ::: (1) Hardin, G. (1960).

Because of payload capacity restrictions, off-the-shelf digital cameras are widely used on medium and small sized UAVs. The limitation of low spectral resolution in digital cameras for vegetation mapping can be reduced by incorporating texture features and robust classifiers. Random Forest has been widely used in satellite remote sensing applications, but its usage in UAV image classification has not been well documented. The objectives of this paper were to propose a hybrid method using Random Forest and texture analysis to accurately differentiate land covers of urban vegetated areas, and analyze how classification accuracy changes with texture window size. Six least correlated second-order texture measures were calculated at nine different window sizes and added to original Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images as ancillary data. A Random Forest classifier consisting of 200 decision trees was used for classification in the spectral-textural feature space. Results indicated the following: (1) Random Forest outperformed traditional Maximum Likelihood classifier and showed similar performance to object-based image analysis in urban vegetation classification; (2) the inclusion of texture features improved classification accuracy significantly; (3) classification accuracy followed an inverted U relationship with texture window size. The results demonstrate that UAV provides an efficient and ideal platform for urban vegetation mapping.

The advent of anti-cancer immunotherapies necessitates novel approaches to biomarker identification beyond traditional genomic profiling. One promising approach is incorporation of nomograms into treatment decisions. Nomograms are prediction tools, based on statistical modeling, designed to predict treatment outcomes. As a first step toward developing a nomogram, we conducted analyses to predict CD137 expression of natural killer cells after monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. ::: ::: ::: Patients and methods ::: Patient, tumor and immune characteristics were collected from 199 patients with breast cancer (N = 62), head/neck cancers (N = 46) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (N = 91), who were receiving mAb therapy as part of clinical trials. The difference in CD137 expression before and after mAb therapy was assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate those who respond to mAb therapy via increased CD137 expression, we applied classification and regression trees (CART), multivariable lasso regression tools and Random Forest. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: The CD137 expression was significantly different for each cancer type [mean (SD): Breast: 6.6 (6.5); Head/Neck: 11.0 (7.0); NHL: 7.5 (7.1), P < 0.0001]. For breast cancer and NHL, FcR polymorphism and baseline CD137 expression were significant predictors of increased CD137 expression; for head/neck cancer, FcR polymorphism and age were significant predictors of increased expression. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Our preliminary results suggest that FcR polymorphism, pre-treatment CD137 expression and age are significant predictors of CD137 upregulation in patients. This study demonstrates that the development of a nomogram for therapy response is feasible. Further work validating our models in an independent cohort will provide the next steps in developing a nomogram that may be used to individualize this therapeutic approach for patients (NCT01114256).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6246233", "pubmed_id": "27831501", "doi": "10.1093/annonc/mdw570", "venue": null, "journal": "Annals of Oncology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2555459688", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["30026949", "7135836", "13168052", "21393911", "18699308", "6385161", "761248", "5102592", "173993992", "18760054", "16495178", "22498098", "3093707", "31074953", "206319195", "44953979", "11088424", "22433892", "9692609", "19947320", "26976241", "21276504", "12578709", "3132050"], "inbound_citations": ["53022922", "52196845"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206322523"}

We show how to apply maximum likelihood estimation and the Anderson-Darling test to select a suitable parametric model for the distribution function. We then use deep feature learning to predict samples of the SUR curve and apply the method of least squares to fit the parametric model to the predicted samples.

It is challenging to learn accurate representations of these words with only a few observations. In this paper, we formulate the learning of OOV embeddings as a few-shot regression problem, and address it by training a representation function to predict the oracle embedding vector (defined as embedding trained with abundant observations) based on limited observations. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical attention-based architecture to serve as the neural regression function, with which the context information of a word is encoded and aggregated from K observations.

Advances in genomics and proteomics provide the opportunity to uncover properties of druggable genomes. Although several studies have been conducted for distinguishing drug targets from non-drug targets, they mainly focus on the sequences and functional roles of proteins. Many other properties of proteins have not been fully investigated. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Using the DrugBank (version 3.0) database containing nearly 6,816 drug entries including 760 FDA-approved drugs and 1822 of their targets and human UniProt/Swiss-Prot databases, we defined 1578 non-redundant drug target and 17,575 non-drug target proteins. To select these non-redundant protein datasets, we built four datasets (A, B, C, and D) by considering clustering of paralogous proteins. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We first reassessed the widely used properties of drug target proteins. We confirmed and extended that drug target proteins (1) are likely to have more hydrophobic, less polar, less PEST sequences, and more signal peptide sequences higher and (2) are more involved in enzyme catalysis, oxidation and reduction in cellular respiration, and operational genes. In this study, we proposed new properties (essentiality, expression pattern, PTMs, and solvent accessibility) for effectively identifying drug target proteins. We found that (1) drug targetability and protein essentiality are decoupled, (2) druggability of proteins has high expression level and tissue specificity, and (3) functional post-translational modification residues are enriched in drug target proteins. In addition, to predict the drug targetability of proteins, we exploited two machine learning methods (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest). When we predicted drug targets by combining previously known protein properties and proposed new properties, an F-score of 0.8307 was obtained. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: When the newly proposed properties are integrated, the prediction performance is improved and these properties are related to drug targets. We believe that our study will provide a new aspect in inferring drug-target interactions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5471946", "pubmed_id": "28617227", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-017-1639-3", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2619634539", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2439425", "2399921", "43167245", "11078940", "13166282", "205476533", "11979420", "3082221", "856614", "14076525", "6549016", "5043549", "23788352", "17065002", "15286634", "7404533", "226104", "17518984", "16354144", "407367", "12878691", "1285259", "3116168", "12211379", "24140937", "46098679", "2554981", "13454515", "10718909", "10418677", "29013368", "30462190", "14908344", "17571298", "8273174", "18121974", "37265235", "1308158"], "inbound_citations": ["212690498", "208014694", "3416296", "208213435", "215434179", "149445586", "16502154"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8106949"}

In this paper, we propose a unified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for controllable image-to-image translation. In addition to conditioning on a reference image, we show how the model can generate images conditioned on controllable structures, e.g., class labels, object keypoints, human skeletons and scene semantic maps. The proposed GAN framework consists of a single generator and a discriminator taking a conditional image and the target controllable structure as input. In this way, the conditional image can provide appearance information and the controllable structure can provide the structure information for generating the target result. Moreover, the proposed GAN learns the image-to-image mapping through three novel losses, i.e., color loss, controllable structure-guided cycle-consistency loss and controllable structure-guided self-identity preserving loss. Note that the proposed color loss handles the issue of \"channel pollution\" when back-propagating the gradients. In addition, we present the Fr\\'echet ResNet Distance (FRD) to evaluate the quality of generated images. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two challenging image translation tasks with four different datasets demonstrate that the proposed GAN model generates convincing results, and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both tasks. Meanwhile, the proposed GAN framework is a unified solution, thus it can be applied to solving other controllable structure-guided image-to-image translation tasks, such as landmark-guided facial expression translation and keypoint-guided person image generation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.06112", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996609772", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["2202933", "6200260", "19046372", "30484693", "42092779", "41191245", "6055117", "4667462", "118687112", "4444247", "206770979", "8239952", "1082740", "6441226", "58006524", "9417016", "1033682", "211022860", "52889459", "12803511", "1515901", "52012426", "81981856", "41805341", "52049245", "56657859", "4872519", "59316571", "1074837", "199442637", "16224674", "980236", "14124313", "1059659", "6628106", "1263188", "5696978", "113580300", "24373591", "10680224", "12339720", "195345871", "17727533", "4766599"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209324092"}

Structurally, an LRFNN-SVR is a five-layered recurrent network. The recurrent structure in an LRFNN-SVR comes from locally feeding the firing strength of each fuzzy rule back to itself. The consequent layer in an LRFNN-SVR is a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (T-S-K)-type consequent, which is a linear function of current states, regardless of system input and output delays. For the structure learning, a one-pass clustering algorithm clusters the input-training data and determines the number of network nodes in hidden layers. For the parameter learning, an iterative linear SVR algorithm is proposed to tune free parameters in the rule consequent part and feedback loops. The motivation for using SVR for parameter learning is to improve the LRFNN-SVR generalization ability. This paper demonstrates LRFNN-SVR capabilities by conducting simulations in dynamic system prediction and identification problems with noiseless and noisy data.

As to the incremental learning, an important step for action recognition, we introduce three methods to perform the low-dimensional embedding of new data. Two of them are motivated by local methods, locally linear embedding and locality preserving projection. Those two techniques are proposed to learn explicit linear representations following the local neighbor relationship, and their effectiveness is investigated for preserving the intrinsic action structure. The rest one is based on manifold-oriented stochastic neighbor projection to find a linear projection from high-dimensional to low-dimensional space capturing the underlying pattern manifold.

Most existing studies about sentiment analysis on microblogging focus on the text, or integrate image as an auxiliary information into text, so they are not applicable in this scenario. Although a few methods related to sentiment analysis for image have been proposed, most of them either ignore the semantic gap between low-level visual features and higher-level image sentiments, or require a lot of textual information in the phases of both training and inference. This paper proposes a new sentiment analysis method based on Simple Multiple Kernel Learning (SimpleMKL). Specifically, textual information as a sort of sufficiently emotional source data, we can use it to promote the ability via SimpleMKL to classify images. And once we get the image classifier, none of texts are needed when predicting other unlabelled images.

Classification or clustering is one of the well-known methods in spatial data analysis. Traditionally, classifiers are generally based on per-pixel approaches and are not utilizing the spatial information within pixel, called mixels which is an important source of information to image classification. There are two foremost reasons behind the existence of mixels: (a) coarse or low spatial resolution of sensor and (b) topographic effects that recorded on optical satellite imagery due to differential terrain illuminations over rugged areas such as Himalayas. In the present study, different classification algorithms have been implemented to drive the impact of topography on them. Among various available, three algorithms for the mapping of snow cover region over north Indian Himalayas (India) are compared: (a) maximum likelihood classification (MLC) as supervised classifier; (b) k-mean clustering as unsupervised classifier; and (c) linear spectral mixing model (LSMM) as soft classifier. These algorithms have been implemented on AWiFS multispectral data, and analysis was carried out. The classification accuracy is estimated by the error matrices, and LSMM achieved higher accuracy (84.5\u201388.5%) as compared to MLC (81\u201384%) and k-mean (74\u201381%). The results highlight that topographically derived classifiers achieved better accuracy in mapping as compared to simple classifiers.

CGRL is an open challenge in machine learning due to the daunting number of all possible tuples to deal with when the numbers of nodes in multiple graphs are large, and because the labeled training instances are extremely sparse as typical. Existing methods such as tensor factorization or tensor-kernel machines do not work well because of the lack of convex formulation for the optimization of CGRL models, the poor scalability of the algorithms in handling combinatorial numbers of tuples, and/or the non-transductive nature of the learning methods which limits their ability to leverage unlabeled data in training. This paper proposes a novel framework which formulates CGRL as a convex optimization problem, enables transductive learning using both labeled and unlabeled tuples, and offers a scalable algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution and enjoys a linear time complexity with respect to the sizes of input graphs.

In such an environment, the controlling systems need to be intelligent enough to deal with a vast amount of data to detect defects in a real-time process. Driven by such a need, artificial intelligence models such as deep learning have to be deployed into IIoT systems. However, learning and using deep learning models are computationally expensive, so an IoT device with limited computational power could not run such models. To tackle this issue, edge intelligence had emerged as a new paradigm towards running Artificial Intelligence models on edge devices. Although a considerable amount of studies have been proposed in this area, the research is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose a novel edge-based multi-phase pruning pipelines to ensemble learning on IIoT devices.

Most existing vehicle detection systems are based on a radar system, which measures distance between a host and leading (or oncoming) vehicles under various weather conditions. However, it requires high deployment cost and complexity overload when there are many vehicles. A camera based vehicle detection technique is also good alternative method because of low cost and simple implementation. In general, night time vehicle detection is more complicated than day time vehicle detection, because it is much more difficult to distinguish the vehicle`s features such as outline and color under the dim environment. This paper proposes a method to detect vehicles at night time using analysis of a captured color space with reduction of reflection and other light sources in images. Four colors spaces, namely RGB, YCbCr, normalized RGB and Ruta-RGB, are compared each other and evaluated. A suboptimal threshold value is determined by Otsu algorithm and applied to extract candidates of taillights of leading vehicles. Statistical features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy are extracted from the candidate regions and used as feature vector for SVM(Support Vector Machine) classifier.

The safety and reliability of a ship's work rely strongly on the performance of such an engine; therefore, early detection of any type of failure that affects the engine is of crucial importance. Automatic diagnostic systems are of special importance because they can operate continuously in real time, thereby providing efficient monitoring of the engine's performance. We introduce a fully automatic machine learning-based system for engine fault detection. For this purpose, we monitor various signals that are emitted by the engine, and we use them as an input for a pattern classification algorithm. This action is realized by an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines that work in a decomposition mode. Because we address 14 different faults and a correct operation mode, we must handle a 15-class problem. We tackle this task by binarization in one-vs-one mode, where each Extreme Learning Machine is trained on a pair of classes. Next, Error-Correcting Output Codes are used to reconstruct the original multi-class task.

A circular transformation with a translational/rotational bias term that performs a one-to-one transformation of real-valued features to the complex plane is used as an activation function for the input neurons. The neurons in the hidden layer employ a fully complex-valued Gaussian-like ('sech') activation function.

Every tree species has a unique set of crown structural characteristics that can be used for tree species classification. In this paper, we use both the internal and external crown structural information of a conifer tree crown, derived from a high density small foot-print multi-return LiDAR data acquisition for species classification. Considering the fact that branches are the major building blocks of a conifer tree crown, we obtain the internal crown structural information using a branch level analysis. The structure of each conifer branch is represented using clusters in the LiDAR point cloud. We propose the joint use of the k-means clustering and geometric shape fitting, on the LiDAR data projected onto a novel 3-dimensional space, to identify branch clusters. After mapping the identified clusters back to the original space, six internal geometric features are estimated using a branch-level analysis. The external crown characteristics are modeled by using six least correlated features based on cone fitting and convex hull.

The availability and easy accessibility of the Internet connectivity have created unprecedented opportunities for sexual education, learning, and growth for adolescences to be in the rise. Hence, the risk of porn addiction developed by teenagers has also increased due to highly prevalent porn consumption. To date, the only available means of detecting porn addiction is through questionnaire. However, while answering the questions, participants may suppress or exaggerate their answers because porn addiction is considered taboo in the community. Hence, the purpose of this project is to develop an engine with multiple classifiers to recognize porn addiction using electroencephalography (EEG) signals and to compare classifiers performance. In the experimental study, the neuro-physiological signals of EEG data were collected previously in Indonesia among students age 9 to 13 years old by researchers from the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). The EEG data were pre-processed, and relevant features are extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Then, the features are classified to produce the outputs of valance and arousal. Subsequently, three different classifiers of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayesian (NB), and Random Forest (RF) are employed to determine whether the participant is a porn addict or otherwise. The experimental results show that the MLP classifier yields slightly better accuracy compared to Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers making the MLP classifier preferable for porn addiction recognition.

Qualitative data is fed into the system that allows it not only to assess the KM situation in the company in a straightforward and intuitive manner, but also to propose corrective actions to improve that situation. DIPKIP is based on four separate steps. An initial \u201cData Acquisition\u201d step, in which key data is captured, is followed by an \u201cIntelligent Processing\u201d step, using neural projection architectures. Subsequently, the \u201cKnowledge Identification\u201d step catalogues the company into three categories, which define a set of possible theoretical strategic knowledge situations: knowledge deficit, partial knowledge deficit, and no knowledge deficit. Finally, a \u201cProposal\u201d step is performed, in which the \u201cknowledge processes\u201d\u2014creation/acquisition, transference/distribution, and putting into practice/updating\u2014are appraised to arrive at a coherent recommendation. The knowledge updating process (increasing the knowledge held and removing obsolete knowledge) is in itself a novel contribution. DIPKIP may be applied as a decision support system, which, under the supervision of a KM expert, can provide useful and practical proposals to senior management for the improvement of KM, leading to flexibility, cost savings, and greater competitiveness. The research also analyses the future for powerful neural projection models in the emerging field of KM by reviewing a variety of robust unsupervised projection architectures, all of which are used to visualize the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional data sets. The main projection architecture in this research, known as Cooperative Maximum-Likelihood Hebbian Learning (CMLHL), manages to capture a degree of KM topological ordering based on the application of cooperative lateral connections. The results of two real-life case studies in very different industrial sectors corroborated the relevance and viability of the DIPKIP system and the concepts upon which it is founded.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-8640.2009.00351.x", "venue": "COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2147684671", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["19115273", "60684573", "132793700", "53141646", "195857595", "207113401", "18157900", "34942712", "29386972", "32918479", "47546496", "639140", "6520113", "85511682", "154695397", "1008581", "166850645", "10710709", "42348006", "56495768", "144828484", "60710418", "11359216", "118739231", "62155475", "106554597", "34329071", "154038919", "154685631", "207107700", "60708333", "107052859", "2522031", "31189947", "29079744", "26633477", "14686610", "152350696", "1780932", "2659073"], "inbound_citations": ["17962252", "6652678", "78012", "16867421", "11653689", "15837158", "48448340", "703014", "24542768", "16793808", "19719593", "12482048", "13305843", "18249461", "7297829", "20410740", "54900779", "47018458", "4396052", "8613381", "386252"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6441473"}

The HERF is an ensemble of classifiers composed of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and Decision Trees. Training of the HERF includes optimal rotation of random partitions of the feature set aimed to increase diversity. AL follows an strategy of optimal sample selection in order to minimize the number of data samples needed to obtain a required accuracy degree. AL is pertinent for interactive learning processes where a human operator is required to select training samples to enhance the classifier in an iterative process, therefore labeling samples for training may be a time consuming and expensive process. CTA image segmentation is one of such processes, due to the variability in CTA images which hinders the generalization of classifiers trained on one dataset to new datasets.

After adding those labeled pixels to the training data, the classifier is retrained. This iteration is repeated until image segmentation quality meets the required level.

Ligand docking and ranking techniques show considerable promise in their ability to quantify the interactions between proteins and small molecules. Despite the advances in the development of docking approaches and scoring functions, the genome-wide application of many ligand docking/screening algorithms is limited by the quality of the binding sites in theoretical receptor models constructed by protein structure prediction. In this study, we describe a new template-based method for the local refinement of ligand-binding regions in protein models using remotely related templates identified by threading. We designed a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model that selects correct binding site geometries in a large ensemble of multiple receptor conformations. The SVR model employs several scoring functions that impose geometrical restraints on the C\u03b1 positions, account for the specific chemical environment within a binding site and optimize the interactions with putative ligands. The SVR score is well correlated with the RMSD from the native structure; in 47% (70%) of the cases, the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient is >0.5 (>0.3). When applied to weakly homologous models, the average heavy atom, local RMSD from the native structure of the top-ranked (best of top five) binding site geometries is 3.1 A (2.9 A) for roughly half of the targets; this represents a 0.1 (0.3) A average improvement over the original predicted structure. Focusing on the subset of strongly conserved residues, the average heavy atom RMSD is 2.6 A (2.3 A). Furthermore, we estimate the upper bound of template-based binding site refinement using only weakly related proteins to be \u223c2.6 A RMSD.

The MSFD enforces all Member States to adopt an adaptive management strategy in their territorial waters grounded on (1) an ecosystem-based approach, (2) the creation and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as essential tools to reach a (3) previously designed Good Environmental Status (GES), to which they must evolve as the result of (4) policy measures that would only be enforced after the launching of a (5) monitoring program based on (6) previously selected indicators/parameters. In the case of the Spanish State, the MSFD was legally transposed as a state law in year 2010, leading to the designation of 10 new offshore MPAs. One of these 10 areas, evaluated under the framework of the Life+ Indemares project, sets the spatial limits of this PhD thesis: the offshore area of Cap de Creus. ::: This thesis begins by evaluating the structure of the megabenthic invertebrate assemblages present on the continental shelf and submarine canyon based on 60 underwater video transects performed by a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and a manned submersible. 9 different assemblages were identified: (A) shelf assemblage with Eunicella cavolini; (B) soft-bottom shelf assemblage with pennatulaceans; (C) soft-bottom assemblage with Sabella pavonina; (D) sandy bottom shelf assemblage with Leptometra phalangium; (E) deep shelf and shelf-break assemblage with Lanice conchilega; (F) cold-water coral assemblage with Madrepora oculata; (G) \u2018Roche du large\u2019 assemblage with sponges; (H) slope assemblage with Cerianthus membranaceus; and (I) aggregation of the brittle star Ophiothrix fragilis. Depth, current speed and substrate type were identified as the main factors determining the spatial patterns observed at the scale of the study area, although fishing intensity played a predominant role in the soft-bottom areas of the shelf, where fishing is known to occur. This information was used to elaborate predictive distribution maps of benthic assemblages using the algorithm Random Forest. Increasing levels of bottom trawling intensity had a negative impact on species richness, diversity, and also on the structure of the community dwelling on the continental shelf. Based on the response of key megafauna species to increasing levels of fishing effort, 4 species were chosen as indicators for a monitoring program. A detailed monitoring protocol together with quantitative baseline data is provided in order to assess the future evolution of the benthic ecosystem once management measures are put in practice. The proposed protocol extensively describes the sampling methodology to be applied at sea, the video analysis, the processing of the data and the interpretation of the results. Two fish assemblages were identified in the video images: (A) shelf assemblage with highly-mobile small-sized fishes (Trisopterus spp., Serranus cabrilla, triglidae and Scorpaena species) and (B) canyon assemblage with less mobile and larger fishes (Helycolenus dactylopterus, Lepidopus caudatus, Conger conger and Phycis phycis). The low number of fishes identified in the ROV footage made us very pessimistic with their use in the monitoring protocol as indicators of fishing activity. Finally, this thesis provides the amount of marine litter accumulated on the seafloor of the study area. ::: The results of this PhD thesis have to be considered an attempt to simplify the implementation of the MSFD in offshore areas by providing the necessary tools to implement an ecosystem-based approach to management using imaging techniques, which should lead to a continuous monitoring of the benthic ecosystem, as demanded by the MSFD.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2902036316", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133707235"}

First, we discover that a versatile D boosts the adversarial framework to a preferable Nash equilibrium. Then, we design the D via dense connections, which brings more stable adversarial loss. Furthermore, a novel perceptual loss function, by reusing the intermediate features of D, is used to eliminate the gradient vanishing problem of Gs. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to focus on improving the performance of the D.

With the ongoing wave of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, hackers have far more sophisticated tools at their disposal to orchestrate identity fraud on login portals. Such attacks bypass static security rules and hence protection against them requires the use of machine learning based \u2018intelligent\u2019 security algorithms. This paper explores the use of client behavioral biometrics to secure website logins. A client\u2019s mouse dynamics, keystrokes and click patterns during login are used to create a customized security model for each user that can differentiate the user of interest from any other impersonator. Such a model, combined with existing protocols, will provide enhanced security for the user\u2019 profile, even if credentials are compromised. The module first employs a means of collecting relevant behavioral data from the client side when a new account is created. The collection module can easily be integrated with any web application without impacting website performance. After sufficient collection of login data, a biometric-based fraud detection algorithm is created that secures the account against future impersonators. Our choice of algorithms is the Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Boosting, the outcomes of which are polled to give the prediction. We find that such a model shows good performance (accuracy, precision and recall) for different train: test splits. Moreover, the model is easily implementable for any web based authentication, is scalable and can be fully automated, if a dataset like ours can be created from client activity on the web application of interest.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-13-5826-5_52", "venue": "SSCC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2913206404", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211479382"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86419726"}

For comparison purposes, hybrid models based on double combinations of maximal, submaximal and questionnaire variables have also been developed. By utilizing 10-fold cross-validation, the performance of the models has been calculated using multiple correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that the best values of R and RMSE, with 0.94 and 2.92mLkg1min1 respectively, have been obtained by combining the triple of relevantly identified maximal, submaximal and questionnaire variables. Compared with the results of the rest of hybrid models in this study and the other prediction models in literature, the reported values of R and RMSE have been found to be considerably more accurate. The predictor variables gender, age, maximal heart rate (MX-HR), submaximal ending speed (SM-ES) of the treadmill and Perceived Functional Ability (Q-PFA) questionnaire have been found to be the most relevant variables in predicting VO2max. The results have also been compared with that of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and TreeBoost (TB), and it is seen that SVM significantly outperforms other regression methods for prediction of VO2max.

The use of embedded systems to build these smart spaces, in combination with data analytics, can provide real-time information about the environment and how it interacts with the people in it. In this paper, we demonstrate how one embedded system that acquires data based on a 2-dimensional positional-grid, movement, temperature and vibration is used to build a smart and pervasive space. Data collected from these sensors is used for real time localization in conjunction with machine learning mechanisms to analyze human activities. We evaluate five machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Network applied on a dataset collected in our lab. Results show high classification performance for all methods giving up-to 99.95% classification accuracy. These patterns provide useful information about occupancy patterns, movement patterns, etc., which will be later used to allocate computational resources in the smart space accordingly.

One practical example of online multitask learning is the micro-blog sentiment detection on a group of users, which classifies micro-blog posts generated by each user into emotional or non-emotional categories. This particular online learning task is challenging for a number of reasons. First of all, to meet the critical requirements of online applications, a highly efficient and scalable classification solution that can make immediate predictions with low learning cost is needed. This requirement leaves conventional batch learning algorithms out of consideration. Second, classical classification methods, be it batch or online, often encounter a dilemma when applied to a group of tasks, i.e., on one hand, a single classification model trained on the entire collection of data from all tasks may fail to capture characteristics of individual task; on the other hand, a model trained independently on individual tasks may suffer from insufficient training data. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a collaborative online multitask learning method, which learns a global model over the entire data of all tasks. At the same time, individual models for multiple related tasks are jointly inferred by leveraging the global model through a collaborative online learning approach.

However, there is a paucity of tools available to investigate variants in sORF regions of the genome. Here we investigate the performance of commonly used tools for variant calling and variant prioritisation in these regions, and present a framework for optimising these processes. First, the performance of four widely used germline variant calling algorithms is systematically compared. Haplotype Caller is found to perform best across the whole genome, but FreeBayes is shown to produce the most accurate variant set in sORF regions. An accurate set of variants is found by taking the intersection of called variants. The potential deleteriousness of each variant is then predicted using a pathogenicity scoring algorithm developed here, called sORF-c. This algorithm uses supervised machine-learning to predict the pathogenicity of each variant, based on a holistic range of functional, conservation-based and region-based scores defined for each variant. By training on a dataset of over 130,000 variants, sORF-c outperforms other comparable pathogenicity scoring algorithms on a test set of variants in sORF regions of the human genome.

Many analytical methods have been used in the literature to analyze the accidents database. One of the recent methods in this domain is the data-mining techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a well-known data mining technique called Random Forests (RF) in predicting the severity of road accidents based on 5973 accidents occurred in Abu Dhabi over a period of 6 years (2008\u20132013). The factors studied in this paper include: five accident-related attributes (year, day, time, reason of accident, and accident type), six driver-related attributes (gender, nationality, age, seat belt use, casualty status, degree of injury), and five road-related attributes (lighting, road surface, speed limit, lane numbers, and weather). The severity of the accident was classified into one of four classes (Minor, Moderate, Severe, and Death). RF was then used to build a prediction model using 10-fold cross validation method. The overall model predication performance was 68.5%. The generated model was found to perform poorly on the underrepresented classes (Death and Severe). As a result, the original data was transformed into a balanced data set using Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The performance of RF on the balanced data was 78.19% with 14% improvement. In order to validate the performance of the RF model, an ordered probit model was also used as a comparative benchmark. The accuracy of the ordered probit model was 59.5%, and 34% for the original and balanced data sets respectively. It was obvious that RF technique outperforms the ordered probit method in predicting the severity or road traffic accidents.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-93885-1_78", "venue": "Advances in Human Aspects of Transportation", "journal": "Advances in Human Aspects of Transportation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2809973185", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["46340589", "157801218", "46371338", "23209820", "112247519", "89141", "57031857", "3093707", "16089788", "1936061", "30475953", "13301799", "106989434"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167214154"}

By 2020, the World Health Organization expects COPD and COPD exacerbations to be the third leading cause of death world-wide. Furthermore, In 2005 it was estimated that COPD exacerbations cost the U.S. healthcare system 38 billion dollars. Studies attempting to determine factors related to COPD readmissions are still very limited. Moreover, few have used a organized machine-learning, sensitivity analysis approach, such as a Random Forest (RF) statistical model, to analyze this problem. This study utilized the RF machine learning algorithm to determine factors that predict risk for multiple COPD exacerbations in a single year. This was a retrospective study with a data set of 106 patients. These patients were divided randomly into training (80%) and validating (20%) data-sets, 100 times, using approximately sixty variables intially, which in prior studies had been found to be associated with patient readmission for COPD exacerbation. In an interactive manner, an RF model was created using the training set and validated on the testing dataset. Mean area-under-curve (AUC) statistics, sensitivity, specificity, and negative/positive predictive values (NPV, PPV) were calculated for the 100 runs. The following variables were found to be important predictors of patients having at least two COPD exacerbations within one year: employment, body mass index, number of previous surgeries, administration of azithromycin/ceftriaxone/moxifloxacin, and admission albumin level. The mean AUC was 0.72, sensitivity of 0.75, specificity of 0.56, PPVof 0.7 and NPVof 0.63. Histograms were used to confirm consistent accuracy The RF design has consistently demonstrated encouraging results.

Various types of machine learning and classification algorithms have already been applied to a variety of different datasets. The power signals can already achieve good results for different classification algorithms on different datasets. However, the information content of the power signals is limited. When calculating the power from the current and voltage signal, information is lost through integration over a period. Many publications in the field are based on proprietary, unpublished datasets. Often, only particular scenarios are in focus. Thus, real comparability between the works is difficult. The Home Equipment Laboratory Dataset 1 (HELD1) dataset introduces the current-voltage based new waveform called Frequency Invariant Transformation of Periodic Signals (FIT-PS) for use with the well-known standard machine learning algorithms, k Nearest Neighbors Classifier (kNN), Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM) and Naive Bayes Classifier (Bayes).

Due to these issues various expert and automated seizure detection systems have been developed for accurate and fast detection of seizures. Preliminary seizure detection and prediction algorithms were patient-specific, where the classifier's training and testing were done on the same person. The current work provides a study of generalized automated seizure detection system which can classify seizures and non-seizures signals.

These features are classified by different supervised machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC).

A typical idea to deal with the first point is to say that an algorithm performs well if it infers {\\it in\\ the\\ limit} the correct language. The second point has led to debate about how to define polynomial time: the main definitions of polynomial inference have been proposed by Pitt and Angluin. We return in this paper to a definition proposed by Gold that requires a characteristic set of strings to exist for each grammar, and this set to be polynomial in the size of the grammar or automaton that is to be learned, where the size of the sample is the sum of the lengths of all strings it includes.

Most previous research mainly relied either on the close-loop adjusting manually or on the predesigned characteristic function with the expertise, while ignoring to learn the mechanism of human in some ways. Enlightened by recent works (humanoid walking, robot fall protection, object grasping, etc.) in robotics community, where inspirations from human being offer a promising alternative in robots acquiring their skills, the issue of how a robot learning the human-inspired drum-playing skill is addressed in this research. With the investigation on the learning process of human, a new approach for robots autonomously developing their drum-playing skill is proposed. Firstly, the robot developmentally learns its internal model through repeated sensorimotor experiences between its motor system and the sounds. Then it constantly adjusts its action according to auditory feedback under an open-ended learning style. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective for a robot to achieve the drum-playing skill autonomously. The robot can predict the likely sound of a planned or executed motor action with an average similarity of 81.19%, and the motor action required to achieve a desired sound with an average similarity of 81.28%. Furthermore, with our open-ended algorithm, the robot can achieve a desired sound with an average similarity of 96.93% via average 1.16 times adjustment. After adjusting, the internal model will be updated according to the sensorimotor experiences produced in previous adjustment process.

Understanding individual travel behavior is vital in travel demand management as well as in urban and transportation planning.

Few studies used LSBM as a large data source to extend its potential in predicting individual travel destination using ML techniques. In the presented research, we created a spatio-temporal probabilistic model based on an ensemble ML framework named \u201cRandom Forests\u201d utilizing the travel extracted from geotagged Tweets in 419 census tracts of Greater Cincinnati area for predicting the tract ID of an individual\u2019s travel destination at any time using the information of its origin.

Essentially, QS is an intracellular signaling system which are different for the different gram characters of bacteria. While gram-negative bacteria use chemical autoinducer molecules like acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) for such signaling, the gram-positive bacteria use peptide-based signaling systems. These quorum-sensing peptides (QSPs) can initiate a signaling cascade of events via two-component system or even by direct binding to transcription factors. After the detection of QSPs by bacteria, response regulators or transcriptional factors are activated, which further stimulates change in the target gene expression. Owing to the therapeutic potential of the AHLs and QSPs as drug targets, different in silico approaches were utilized for the identification of inhibitors and their modeling which can help in combatingthe respective bacterial pathogenicity. Thus, certain group of researchers also developed machine learning tools based on support vector machine (SVM) and hidden Markov models (HMM) for the identification of novel and effective biofilm inhibitory peptides (BIPs), while others used in silico approaches for predicting and designing of antibiofilm peptides usingbidirectional recursive neural network (BRNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Moreover, biological network visualization techniques and analysis enabled the identification of QSPs in different bacteria using related information from the curated databases. To this end, identification of the binding pocket(s), motif search, and other physicochemical properties will help in predicting the three-dimensional structure of such target. Furthermore, ultra-high-throughput screening is another approach which unveils QS inhibitors (QSI) based on the characterization of natural products and screening for naturally occurring enzymes. This review specifically focuses on all such in silico approaches in predicting QSI in different bacterial species. Such in silico QSI predictions and their docking onto QS targets can help to shape up a promising future for making newer therapeutic options available against different pathogenic bacteria.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-32-9409-7_6", "venue": "Implication of Quorum Sensing and Biofilm Formation in Medicine, Agriculture and Food Industry", "journal": "Implication of Quorum Sensing and Biofilm Formation in Medicine, Agriculture and Food Industry", "mag_id": "2990106984", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213837397"}

Each edge of a hypergraph (called hyperedge) can connect any number of brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) instead of only two ROIs, and thus characterizes highorder relations among multiple ROIs that cannot be uncovered by a simple graph in the traditional graph based FCN construction methods. Unlike the existing hypergraph based methods where all hyperedges are assumed to have equal weights and only certain topological features are extracted from the hypergraphs, we propose a hypergraph learning based method for FCN construction in this paper. Specifically, we first generate hyperedges from fMRI time series based on sparse representation, then employ hypergraph learning to adaptively learn hyperedge weights, and finally define a hypergraph similarity matrix to represent the FCN. In our proposed method, weighting hyperedges results in better discriminative FCNs across subjects, and the defined hypergraph similarity matrix can better reveal the overall structure of brain network than using those hypergraph topological features. Moreover, we propose a multi-hypergraph learning based method by integrating multi-paradigm fMRI data, where the hyperedge weights associated with each fMRI paradigm are jointly learned and then a unified hypergraph similarity matrix is computed to represent the FCN. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort dataset for the classification of individuals\u2019 learning ability from three paradigms of fMRI data.

Four areas are chosen as target areas where load prediction error is evaluated as a measure of goodness. A subset of the total data set is used to lower the computation time; only Swedish locations were used, and only data from SMHI was used. ::: ::: The impact of using different subsets of weather features as well as selecting features from several locations is investigated using FCBF and epsilon-Support Vector Regression.

An investigation of how the relationships between features change with distance is performed and the results are then used to motivate a greedy feature selection method. ::: ::: FCBF, even when implemented with the naive approximation of marginal and conditional entropy, filtered the total data set from 3180 to approximately 20 features with a prediction error of less than 1% for three of the target areas and 1.71% for the fourth. Further tests lowered the numbered of features even further without significantly affecting the prediction error. Using FCBF to rank the weather variables for a single area proved less than optimal which may be attributed to many of the extremely small intra-feature SU values.

Unlike univariate approaches, it is designed as a prediction task by decoding the brain state. fMRI brain decoding is a challenging classification problem due to the noisy, redundant and spatio-temporal correlated data, where there are generally much more features than samples. The use of a classifier requires that raw data is mapped into n-dimensional real vectors where the structural information of the data is not taken into account. Alternative methods propose a different data representation based on a graph encoding. While graphs provide a more powerful representation, machine learning algorithms for this type of encoding become computationally intensive. The contribution of this paper is the introduction of a graph kernel with a lower computational complexity that allows taking advantage from both the representative power of graphs and the discrimination power of kernel-based classifiers such as Support Vector Machines. We provide experimental results for a discrimination task between faces and houses on a fMRI dataset.

This impossibility can be due to hardware limitations, the data cannot be completely stored in memory as required by many of the existing algorithms, or requirements concerning the training and/or classification times that traditional classifiers are not able to fulfill. In any case, it is mandatory to adapt the current machine learning solutions to the new scenario which, inevitably, leads to the design of simple and easily scalable algorithms. In particular, this thesis proposes two complementary solutions that make it possible to face up those classification problems requiring real-time predictions. ::: The first of these contributions is a new feature selection algorithm independent of the classifier and capable of reducing its computational cost in the classification and training phases. The proposed method can be categorized into the multivariate filters group and it yields similar classification rates that its state-of-the-art counterparts while reducing their computational complexity. In addition, the new algorithm is reformulated in a higher dimensional space induced by a kernel turning out to be equivalent to the well-known Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA). This equivalence is theoretically proven providing new insights into the KFDA. ::: The second contribution of this work is focused on the design of an algorithm capable of classifying patterns in few milliseconds. Motivated by the difficulty of applying nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to real-time classification domains, the new method attempts to approximate the nonlinear decision boundaries by means of piecewise linear functions while locally preserving the maximum margin criteria. The results presented in this thesis show how the proposed algorithm can bridge the gap between the simplicity but low accuracy of linear SVMs and the effectiveness but sophistication of nonlinear SVMs in real-time classification systems. ::: In conclusion, the large amount of data makes it sometimes necessary to leave aside the precision of the most complex models in favor of approximate solutions fulfilling the requirements of the classification system.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "10285164", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117583798"}

This paper applies cross-sectional data analysis to explore such beliefs and demonstrates weak-to-moderate correlations between daily SMA and EPA volumes. Further correlation analysis, using 30-day rolling windows, shows a high variability in correlation of SMA-EPA pairs and calls into question the predictive potential of SMA in relation to EPA. Considering the moderate correlation of selected SMA and EPA pairs (e.g., Post-Orders), we investigate whether SMA features can predict changes in the EPA levels, instead of precise EPA daily volumes. We define such levels in terms of EPA distribution quantiles (2, 3, and 5 levels) over training data. We formulate the EPA quantile predictions as a multi-class categorization problem. The experiments with Random Forest and Logistic Regression show a varied success, performing better than random for the top quantiles of purchase orders and for the lowest quantile of search and clickthrough activities.

In this paper, we propose a fast and robust approach for Chinese text and symbol extraction in traffic panels from natural scene images. Given a traffic panel in natural scene, Contrasting Extremal Region (CER) algorithm is applied to extract character candidates which are further filtered by boosting classifier using Histogram Orientation Gradient Features. Since Chinese characters often consist of multiple isolated strokes, a hierarchical clustering process of stroke components is carried out to group isolated strokes into characters using the detected characters as seeds. Next, the Chinese text lines are formed by Distance Metric Learning (DSL) method.

The potential for any country's tourism industry to develop will depend substantially on its ability to maintain competitive advantage in its delivery of goods and services to visitors (Dwyer, Forsyth, & Rao, 2000). The success of tourism destinations thus depends on their regional tourist competitiveness in terms of the attractiveness characteristics that make up the tourist strength of a certain area (Cracolicia & Nijkampb, 2009).According to World Tourism Organization (WTO) and World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), it was predicted that the revenue of global tourism industry was about 10.4% of global GDP. Moreover, WTO estimated that the global tourism people would increase to more than 16 hundred million, and the revenue of global tourism industry would be 2 thousand billion US dollars in 2020. In other words, tourism industry would generate a great deal of profit.Tourism destination competitiveness has been studied for more than 20 years. In order to evaluate tourism destination competitiveness, establishing evaluation model and choosing evaluation method are two critical aspects (Zhang et al., 2008). In this study, ten factors of destination attractiveness (Cracolicia and Nijkampb, 2009) were adopted to establish the model for evaluating tourist preference. These destination attractiveness related factors include reception and sympathy of local residents, artistic and cultural cities, landscape/environment and nature, hotels and other accommodation, typical foods, cultural events, level of prices/living costs, quality and variety of products in the shops, information and tourist services as well as tourist safety. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed as the methodology to investigate tourist preference. SVM is a powerful classifier. The related data were collected from tourists of two groups of tourists with different age. One group is of tourists below age of 50, and the other group is of tourists above age of 51.

The challenge of the experiments was to characterize the rate of salts in cores and alteration of porosity and permeability after reservoir desalination due to drilling mud or water injection. For these three measured characteristics, we developed the relevant predictive models, which were based on the results of RCA and data on coring depth and top and bottom depths of productive horizons. To select the most accurate Machine Learning algorithm a comparative analysis has been performed. It was shown that different algorithms work better in different models. However, two hidden layers Neural network has demonstrated the best predictive ability and generalizability for all three rock characteristics jointly. The other algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine and Linear Regression, also worked well on the dataset, but in particular cases. Overall, the applied approach allows predicting the alteration of porosity and permeability during desalination in porous rocks and also evaluating salt concentration without direct measurements in a laboratory.

Nowadays, it is common to see multiple sources available for knowledge transfer, each of which, however, may not include complete classes information of the target domain. Naively merging multiple sources together would lead to inferior results due to the large divergence among multiple sources. In this paper, we attempt to utilize incomplete multiple sources for effective knowledge transfer to facilitate the learning task in target domain. To this end, we propose an incomplete multisource transfer learning through two directional knowledge transfer, i.e., cross-domain transfer from each source to target, and cross-source transfer. In particular, in cross-domain direction, we deploy latent low-rank transfer learning guided by iterative structure learning to transfer knowledge from each single source to target domain. This practice reinforces to compensate for any missing data in each source by the complete target data. While in cross-source direction, unsupervised manifold regularizer and effective multisource alignment are explored to jointly compensate for missing data from one portion of source to another. In this way, both marginal and conditional distribution discrepancy in two directions would be mitigated.

In addition, it is also uncovered that there exists an optimal phase noise intensity at which the spiking rhythm coincides with the frequency of the subthreshold signal, resulting in a phase-noise-induced resonance phenomenon. However, neurons usually do not work alone, but are connected in the form of arrays or blocks. Therefore, we study the spiking activity induced by phase noise in arrays of globally and locally coupled excitable neural models. We find that there also exists an optimal phase noise intensity for generating large neural response and such an optimal value is significantly decreased compared to an isolated single neuron case, which means the detectability in response to the subthreshold signal of neurons is sharply improved because of the coupling. In addition, we reveal two new resonance behaviors in the neuron ensemble with the presence of phase noise: there exist optimal values of both coupling strength and system size, where the coupled neurons generate regular spikes under subthreshold stimulations, which are called as coupling strength and system size resonance, respectively.

In the present study, we have developed a method, NAGbinder, which predicts the NAG-interacting residues in a protein from its primary sequence information. We extracted 231 NAG-interacting non-redundant protein chains from Protein Data Bank, where no two sequences share more than 40% sequence identity. All prediction models were trained, validated, and evaluated on these 231 protein chains. At first, prediction models were developed on balanced data consisting of 1335 NAG-interacting and non-interacting residues, using various window size. The model developed by implementing Random Forest using binary profiles as the main principle for identifying NAG-interacting residue with window size 9, performed best among other models. It achieved highest Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.31 and 0.25, and Area Under Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) of 0.73 and 0.70 on training and validation dataset, respectively. We also developed prediction models on realistic dataset (1335 NAG-interacting and 47198 non-interacting residues) using the same principle, where the model achieved MCC of 0.26 and 0.27, and AUROC of 0.70 and 0.71, on training and validation dataset, respectively. The success of our method can be appraised by the fact that, if a sequence of 1000 amino acids is analysed with our approach, 10 residues will be predicted as NAG-interacting, out of which 5 are correct.

The derivation of ultra-high spatial resolution fractional vegetation cover (FVC) based on multispectral imagery acquired from an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) has several applications, including the potential to revolutionise the collection of field data for calibration/validation of satellite products. In this study, abundance maps were derived using three methods, applied to data collected in a typical Australian rangeland environment. The first method used downscaling between Landsat FVC maps and UAS images with Random Forest regression to predict bare ground, photosynthetic vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation cover. The second method used spectral unmixing based on endmembers identified in the multispectral imagery. The third method used an object-based classification approach to label image segments. The accuracy of all UAS FVC and Landsat FVC products were assessed using 20 field plots (100 m diameter star transects), as well as from 138 ground photo plots. The classification method performed best for all cover fractions at the 100 m plot scale (12-13% RMSE), with the downscaling approach only able to accurately predict photosynthetic cover. The downscaling and unmixing generally over-predicted non-photosynthetic vegetation associated with Chenopod shrubs. When compared with the high-resolution photo plot data, the classification method performed the worst, while the downscaling and unmixing methods achieved reasonable accuracy for the photosynthetic component only (12-13% RMSE).

To deal with large-scale data, CPU-based or GPU-based parallelization solutions have been proposed to improve performance. However, the problem is an ongoing one. In this paper, we focus on the big data environment and propose a distributed CRF on a heterogeneous CPU-GPU cluster called DHCRF. Our approach differs from previous work. Specifically, it leverages a three-stage heterogeneous Map and Reduce operation to improve the performance, making full use of CPU-GPU collaborative computing capabilities in a big data environment. Furthermore, by combining elastic data partition and intermediate results multiplexing method, the distributed CRF is optimized.

In a departure from prior works, we used a robust description of the coordination environment as a distribution over 25 distinct coordination motifs with coordination numbers ranging from 1-12.

Furthermore, the random forest models can be applied to predict the coordination environment from experimental K-edge XANES with minimal loss in accuracy (82.1%) due to the use of data augmentation. A drop-out feature importance analysis highlights the key roles that the pre-edge and main-peak regions play in coordination environment identification, with the post-peak region becoming increasingly important at higher coordination numbers.

X-ray mammograms are one of the most common techniques used by radiologists for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Early detection and diagnosis is important, since may statistics have shown that detecting the cancer in its early stage will reduce the mortality rates by 30 \u2013 70%. Although most CAD systems were designed to help radiologists in their diagnosis by providing useful insight, the accuracy of CAD systems remains below the level that would lead to an improvement in the overall radiologists' performance. Two main problems appear to affect the decision of detecting and diagnosing breast cancer: the accuracy of the CAD systems used, and the radiologists' performance in reading and diagnosing mammograms. In this work we help to improve CAD system's performance as well as radiologists' performance by adding a preprocessing step to improve the sensitivity significantly. In this work we developed a pre-CAD system that is based on separating mammograms into two disjoint categories according to their tissue type (fatty, or dense). Unlike other CAD systems who aim to detect abnormal mammograms, we are using our pre-CAD system to detect normal mammograms instead of abnormal ones. The pre-CAD system will work as a \"first look\" that will screen-out normal mammograms, leaving the radiologists and other conventional CAD systems to focus on the suspicious cases. This will reduce the workload of radiologists and allow them to focus on the \"hard to classify\" cases. Moreover, our pre-CAD system design is based on the separation of mammograms into fatty or dense according to their radiologically-defined breast density. This will improve the classification accuracy since the classifier will focus on detecting normal mammograms within the same tissue type. A one-class Support Vector Machine classifier is used to detect normal mammogram in tissue-type separately. This helps improve the overall performance of radiologists if it is used as a complement to an existing CAD system. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features were extracted for each of dense and fatty mammograms. The results showed that the classifier performance is significantly improved when GLCM features are extracted for fatty tissues. On the other side, the classifier performance was significantly improved when LBP features are extracted for dense tissues. The sensitivity was significantly increased when dense and fatty mammograms were separated. In summary, different set of features suited different tissue densities. Future work could focus on designing a fully-automated pre-CAD system for normal mammogram classification.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2243641580", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3032617"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112201042"}

In such cases, test samples often fall into gaps between training samples where the nearest neighbours are too distant to be good indicators of class membership. One solution is to project the data onto a discriminative lower dimensional subspace. We propose a gap-resistant nonparametric method for finding such subspaces: first the gaps are filled by building a convex model of the region spanned by each class - we test the affine and convex hulls and the bounding disk of the class training samples - then a set of highly discriminative directions is found by building and decomposing a scatter matrix of weighted displacement vectors from training examples to nearby rival class regions. The weights are chosen to focus attention on narrow margin cases while still allowing more diversity and hence more discriminability than the 1D linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) projection.

They are trained on increasing-size subsets of one mammographic dataset and used to generate diverse and realistic breast masses. The effect of including the generated images and/or applying horizontal and vertical flipping is tested in an environment where a 1:10 imbalanced dataset of masses and normal tissue patches is classified by a fully-convolutional network. A maximum of ~ 0:09 improvement of F1 score is reported by using DCGANs along with flipping augmentation over using the original images. We show that DCGANs can be used for synthesising photo-realistic breast mass patches with considerable diversity. It is demonstrated that appending synthetic images in this environment, along with flipping, outperforms the traditional augmentation method of flipping solely, offering faster improvements as a function of the training set size.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.02062", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2543506", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2971576907,3012550810", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Materials Science", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["52188256", "1033682", "3686035", "11758569", "1687220"], "inbound_citations": ["208513262"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202236148"}

Currently, a number of machine learning based methods have been developed to predict new CPIs in the literature. However, as there is not yet any publicly available set of validated negative CPIs, most existing machine learning based approaches use the unknown interactions (not validated CPIs) selected randomly as the negative examples to train classifiers for predicting new CPIs. Obviously, this is not quite reasonable and unavoidably impacts the CPI prediction performance. In this paper, we simply take the unknown CPIs as unlabeled examples, and propose a new method called PUCPI (the abbreviation of PU learning for Compound-Protein Interaction identification) that employs biased-SVM (Support Vector Machine) to predict CPIs using only positive and unlabeled examples. PU learning is a class of learning methods that leans from positive and unlabeled (PU) samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that identifies CPIs using only positive and unlabeled examples. We first collect known CPIs as positive examples and then randomly select compound-protein pairs not in the positive set as unlabeled examples. For each CPI/compound-protein pair, we extract protein domains as protein features and compound substructures as chemical features, then take the tensor product of the corresponding compound features and protein features as the feature vector of the CPI/compound-protein pair. After that, biased-SVM is employed to train classifiers on different datasets of CPIs and compound-protein pairs. Experiments over various datasets show that our method outperforms six typical classifiers, including random forest, L1- and L2-regularized logistic regression, naive Bayes, SVM and $k$ -nearest neighbor (kNN), and three types of existing CPI prediction models.

This has been the major motivation behind the development of the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, which has been extensively used since its first publication in 2007. The database relies on a downscaling methodology whereby census counts of animals in sub-national administrative units are redistributed at the level of grid cells as a function of a series of spatial covariates. The recent upgrade of GLW1 to GLW2 involved automating the processing, improvement of input data, and downscaling at a spatial resolution of 1 km per cell (5 km per cell in the earlier version). The underlying statistical methodology, however, remained unchanged. In this paper, we evaluate new methods to downscale census data with a higher accuracy and increased processing efficiency. Two main factors were evaluated, based on sample census datasets of cattle in Africa and chickens in Asia. First, we implemented and evaluated Random Forest models (RF) instead of stratified regressions. Second, we investigated whether models that predicted the number of animals per rural person (per capita) could provide better downscaled estimates than the previous approach that predicted absolute densities (animals per km2). RF models consistently provided better predictions than the stratified regressions for both continents and species. The benefit of per capita over absolute density models varied according to the species and continent. In addition, different technical options were evaluated to reduce the processing time while maintaining their predictive power. Future GLW runs (GLW 3.0) will apply the new RF methodology with optimized modelling options. The potential benefit of per capita models will need to be further investigated with a better distinction between rural and agricultural populations.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4792414", "pubmed_id": "26977807", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0150424", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2302432179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["56353959", "3861749", "10477108", "129544099", "13038648", "69093125", "7299695", "4991058", "19180580", "25130594", "18515310", "13898718", "8667013", "16382452", "89141", "2078297", "5042366", "3902338", "1369889", "6216032", "26844434", "8376937", "55564510", "128594026", "23541992", "3626971", "3093707", "128489530", "121599458", "25139877"], "inbound_citations": ["58553553", "195560667", "7052792", "214966236", "22212007", "49367436", "6111014", "53114022", "15235859", "204782393", "54556830", "169037473", "201195089"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2694347"}

Finally, TTC is reliably estimated from the divergence of the optical flow field. This algorithm involves only feed-forward data flows with simple pixel-level operations, and hence has inherent parallelism for hardware acceleration. The algorithm offers good scalability, allowing for flexible tradeoffs among estimation accuracy, processing speed and hardware resource. Experimental evaluation shows that the accuracy of the optical flow estimation is improved due to the use of Random Forests compared to existing voting-based approaches.

In this paper, we first investigate whether discriminative signatures could be obtained for activities on water through a simulation study. Then, we show how we can effectively achieve high classification accuracy by applying deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) directly to the spectrogram of real measurement data. From the five-fold cross-validation on our dataset, which consists of five aquatic activities, we report that the conventional feature-based scheme only achieves an accuracy of 45.1%. In contrast, the DCNN trained using only the collected data attains 66.7%, and the transfer learned DCNN, which takes a DCNN pre-trained on a RGB image dataset and fine-tunes the parameters using the collected data, achieves a much higher 80.3%, which is a significant performance boost.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5190971", "pubmed_id": "27886151", "doi": "10.3390/s16121990", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2552002155", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["122244298", "128417976", "128922592", "26712448", "20883096", "19168743", "53129095", "21139748", "31224966", "8736756", "7230302", "195908774", "15076873", "43558337", "124929499", "2930547", "44050523", "3074096", "7172528"], "inbound_citations": ["30076665", "208613809", "195801567", "52006286", "211105100", "210972029", "164682090", "35158882", "197471820", "115840934", "202089654", "210694242", "52127909", "116796953", "13666010", "49537954", "207852362", "52054715", "49656446", "49410307", "5055196", "208036241", "209696002", "203656101", "204820419", "53287657", "202687701", "13821232", "201258589", "49182725", "202135270", "67871368", "106407488", "46530760", "211120692"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6717965"}

Poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying HCC prevents early detection and leads to high mortality. We developed a random forest model that incorporates copy-number variation, DNA methylation, transcription factor, and microRNA binding information as features to predict gene expression in HCC. Our model achieved a highly significant correlation between predicted and measured expression of held-out genes. Furthermore, we identified potential regulators of gene expression in HCC. Many of these regulators have been previously found to be associated with cancer and are differentially expressed in HCC. We also evaluated our predicted target sets for these regulators by making comparison with experimental results. Lastly, we found that the transcription factor E2F6, one of the candidate regulators inferred by our model, is predictive of survival rate in HCC.

For hyperspectral image classification, the collection of samples is always difficult. However, directly applying GAN to hyperspectral image classification exists two problems. One is that the generated samples lack discriminative information. Meanwhile, the discriminator has no discriminative ability for multiclassification. Another is that spatial and spectral information requires to be considered in hyperspectral image classification simultaneously. To address these problems, a novel multiclass spatial\u2013spectral GAN (MSGAN) method is proposed. In MSGAN, two generators are devised to generate the samples containing spatial and spectral information, respectively, and the discriminator is devised to extract joint spatial\u2013spectral features and output multiclass probabilities. Moreover, novel adversarial objectives for multiclass are defined. The discriminator is devised to predict training samples belonging to true classes and generated samples belonging to all the classes with the same probability. The generators are devised to make the discriminator mistake. By adversarial learning between the discriminator and generators, the classification performance of the discriminator is promoted with the assistance of discriminative generated samples. Experimental results on hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves encouraging classification performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods, especially with the limited training samples.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2019.2899057", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921445432", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["128188583", "21747372", "59568647", "119212893", "40020155", "22677105", "836457", "30385339", "22132610", "3754543", "25498647", "4339759", "15410401", "44095716", "53502685", "3661078", "17177706", "1006603", "6906514", "43846694", "46275095", "36175098", "44935336", "17804904", "24309481", "207763512", "43828797", "2078144", "20001037", "11707694", "1033682", "11758569", "1282515", "6281601", "12803511", "5002792", "1687220", "13943041", "10894094", "42273056", "52112233", "53228737", "5808102", "857142", "6662846", "17485266", "16203715"], "inbound_citations": ["199669259", "197530661", "196184217", "212718962", "213467273"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127969304"}

The estimators produced by a Monte Carlo numerical design are two subsets of inputs leading to safe and unsafe situations, the measures of which can be traduced as deterministic bounds for the probability. Several situations are considered, when the design is independent, identically distributed or not, or sequential. As a major consequence, a consistent estimator of the (limit state) surface separating the subsets under isotonicity and regularity arguments can be built, and its convergence speed can be exhibited. This estimator is built by aggregating semi-supervized binary classifiers chosen as constrained Support Vector Machines.

In this article, we propose an approach that can make use of not only labeled EEG signals but also the unlabeled ones which are more accessible. We also suggest the use of data fusion to further improve the seizure prediction accuracy. Data fusion in our vision includes EEG signals, cardiogram signals, body temperature and time. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 28-s EEG windows as a pre-processing step. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained in an unsupervised manner where information of seizure onset is disregarded. The trained Discriminator of the GAN is then used as feature extractor. Features generated by the feature extractor are classified by two fully-connected layers (can be replaced by any classifier) for the labeled EEG signals. This semi-supervised seizure prediction method achieves area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 77.68% and 75.47% for the CHBMIT scalp EEG dataset and the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, respectively.

When generating an image of a character, the pose of the character takes is an important component of its composition. Thus it is necessary fora user who wants to create an illustration to be able to specify the pose easily. We collected a set of illustrations of human figures from the internet, and for each illustration, a simple line drawing that specifies the pose was drawn manually. We constructed a GAN that takes a line drawing as its input and creates an illustration of a person in a pose that matches the line drawing. These networks are learned using the data set we prepared.

Supervised anti-spam filters using machine-learning methods have been particularly effective in categorizing spam and non-spam messages. These automatically integrate spam corpora pre-processing, appropriate word lists selection, and the calculation of word weights, usually in a bag-of-words fashion. To develop an accurate spam filter is challenging because spammers attempt to decrease the probability of spam detection by using legitimate words. Complex models are therefore needed to solve such a problem. However, existing spam filtering methods usually converge to a poor local minimum, cannot effectively handle high-dimensional data and suffer from overfitting issues. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel spam filter integrating an N-gram tf.idf feature selection, modified distribution-based balancing algorithm and a regularized deep multi-layer perceptron NN model with rectified linear units (DBB-RDNN-ReL). As demonstrated on four benchmark spam datasets (Enron, SpamAssassin, SMS spam collection and Social networking), the proposed approach enables capturing more complex features from high-dimensional data by additional layers of neurons. Another advantage of this approach is that no additional dimensionality reduction is necessary and spam dataset imbalance is addressed using a modified distribution-based algorithm. We compare the performance of the approach with that of state-of-the-art spam filters (Minimum Description Length, Factorial Design using SVM and NB, Incremental Learning C4.5, and Random Forest, Voting and Convolutional Neural Network) and several machine learning algorithms commonly used to classify text. We show that the proposed model outperforms these other methods in terms of classification accuracy, with fewer false negatives and false positives. Notably, the proposed spam filter classifies both major (legitimate) and minor (spam) classes well on personalized / non-personalized and balanced / imbalanced spam datasets. In addition, we show that the proposed model performs better than the results reported by previous studies in terms of accuracy.

The latter employs the kth 2-tuple (dis) similarity matrix to codify information related to covalent and non-covalent interactions in these biopolymers. The calculation of the inter-amino acid distances is generalized by using several dis-similarity coefficients, where normalization procedures based on the simple stochastic and mutual probability schemes are applied. A new local-fragment approach based on amino acid-types and amino acid-groups is proposed to characterize regions of interest in proteins. Topological and geometric macromolecular cutoffs are defined using local and total indices to highlight non-covalent interactions existing between the side-chains of each amino acid. Moreover, local and total indices calculations are generalized considering a LEGO approach, by using several aggregation operators. Collinearity and variability analyses are performed to evaluate every generalizing component applied to the definition of these novel indices. These experiments are oriented to reduce the number of MDs obtained for performing prediction models. The predictive power of the proposed indices was evaluated using two benchmark datasets, folding rate and secondary structural classification of proteins. The proposed MDs are modeled using the following strategies: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), respectively. The best regression model developed for the folding rate of proteins yields a cross-validation coefficient of 0.875 (Test Set) and the best model developed for secondary structural classification obtained 98% of instances correctly classified (Test Set). These statistical parameters are superior to the ones obtained with existing MDs reported in the literature. Overall, the new theoretical generalization enhanced the information extraction into the MDs, allowing a better correlation between these two evaluated benchmark datasets and the proposed indices. The optimal theoretical configurations defined for the calculation of these MDs consider low collinearity and less information redundancy among them.

Any initiative to foster HGFs requires the ability to reliably anticipate them. There seems to be a consensus in previous mainly regression-based studies on the impossibility of such a prediction (Coad, Doc Trav Centre d\u2019Econ Sorbonne 24:1\u201372 2007b). Using a novel random forest (RF) based approach and a recent data set (2004\u20132014) covering 179970 unique firms from nine European countries, we show the potential of a true out-of-sample prediction: depending on the country, we were able to determine up to 39% of all HGFs by selecting only ten percent of all firms. The RF algorithm is both used to determine relevant predictors and for the actual prediction and pattern analysis. Both the selection of the best RF and the cross-country comparisons are based on a Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. We find that most accurate HGF predictions are possible in GB, France, and Italy and largely confirm this ranking using Venkatraman\u2019s unpaired test. Apart from the firm\u2019s size, age, and past growth, the sales per employee, the fixed assets ratio, and the debt ratio are quite important. Our \u201ctypical\u201d HGFs determined using RF prototypes have been older and bigger than the remaining firms, which is counterintuitive and atypical in literature. Based on our finding, typical HGFs are not start-ups, which questions current political funding strategies. Apart from that, our results do not support and rather refute the existence of a survivorship bias.

The two pollution factors were, respectively, industrial pollution (IP) factor, which identifies the intensity and presence of industrial pollutants from common water quality parameters that got influenced due to the release of industrial effluents in a river and organic pollution (OP) factor, which tries to estimate the intensity of organic pollutants from common quality parameters that get affected due to anthropogenic presence in the adjacent catchments. A neurogenetic model was prepared to estimate industrial pollution (IP) and organic pollution (OP) factors where observed stream flow data from 42 gauged and ungauged sampling points within two river networks in the Eastern India and land use of adjacent catchments of the sampling points were taken as input. The IP and OP factors are prepared to be directly proportional to water pollution, that is, if the factors are more than 0.7, water is polluted and if the same are less than 0.5, water is not polluted at all. The pattern identification capability of neurogenetic models enforces the authors for selection of neurogenetic models for the prediction of the above two factors. After the model was validated with the help of common validation equations, the selected model was applied to predict future IP and OP of the same region due to changed climate scenario generated by PRECIS climate model. The output of PRECIS was fed to PARITYCGD model (9), which estimated the stream flow due to the changed climatic scenario that was again used to predict IP and OP of the sampling points. The estimated values were fed to a surface algorithm to show the spatial variation of the two factors within the river basins. According to the results, area under water pollution from industries were more than the area that was not under pollution during the A2 scenario of climate change, but in B2 the trend reverses and more area without industrial pollution would emerge.

However, in the process of obtaining multi-spectral transmission images, it is difficult to identify the heterogeneity in images due to the image blur caused by the scattering effect of the light source in the biological tissue and the weak transmission signal. This paper proposes a combination method based on the modulation-demodulation-frame accumulation technique (MDFAT) and the combination feature information of multi-spectral transmission images to improve the accuracy of heterogeneous classification. Firstly, the acquisition experiment of phantom multi-spectral transmission images is designed. Then, the high-resolution image is obtained by the MDFAT, and the 14-dimensional feature information of the heterogeneous region is extracted from the images before and after processing. The combination feature information of wavelengths is arranged in order of blue light, green light, near-infrared light and red light. Finally, Random Forest (RF) is used to classify the heterogeneities in the transmission image. The results show that the quality of multi-spectral transmission image is significantly improved after the processing of MDFAT, and the gray level of image is also obviously increased, so that more abundant feature information of heterogeneous region can be obtained. And the overall classification accuracy of RF model established after image preprocessing has been significantly improved. Among them, the 3-wavelength combination model has the best classification effect and the best robustness, followed by the 4-wavelength combination model. The classification accuracy of single-wavelength model is low, but it is also greatly improved compared with that before image preprocessing. In conclusion, this paper improves the image quality by the MDFAT, and the classification accuracy of heterogeneities is significantly improved by combining the feature information of multi-spectral transmission images, which promotes the potential application of multi-spectral transmission imaging in early breast cancer detection.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.infrared.2019.102992", "venue": null, "journal": "Infrared Physics & Technology", "mag_id": "2963360157", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199684514"}

Contrary to previous work, we found that search guidance was better for high-typicality targets compared to low- typicality targets, as measured by both the proportion of immediate target fixations and the time to fixate the target. Consistent with previous work, we also found an effect of typicality on target verification times, the time between target fixation and the search judgment; as target typicality decreased, verification times increased. To model these typicality effects, we trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers on the target categories, and tested these on the corresponding specific targets used in the search task. This analysis revealed significant differences in classifier confidence between the high-, medium-, and low-typicality groups, paralleling the behavioral results.

However, the attributes of vehicle that contain detailed descriptions are beneficial for training reID model. Hence, this paper proposes a novel Attribute-Guided Network (AGNet), which could learn global representation with the abundant attribute features in an end-to-end manner.

On other hand there are only few studies on relation between expression level and composition of nucleotide/protein sequence, using expression data. There is a need to understand why particular genes/proteins express more in particular conditions. In this study, we analyze 3468 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae obtained from Holstege et al., (1998) to understand the relationship between expression level and amino acid composition.ResultsWe compute the correlation between expression of a gene and amino acid composition of its protein. It was observed that some residues (like Ala, Gly, Arg and Val) have significant positive correlation (r > 0.20) and some other residues (Like Asp, Leu, Asn and Ser) have negative correlation (r < -0.15) with the expression of genes. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.18) was also found between length and gene expression. These observations indicate the relationship between percent composition and gene expression level. Thus, attempts have been made to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method for predicting the expression level of genes from its protein sequence. In this method the SVM is trained with proteins whose gene expression data is known in a given condition. Then trained SVM is used to predict the gene expression of other proteins of the same organism in the same condition. A correlation coefficient r = 0.70 was obtained between predicted and experimentally determined expression of genes, which improves from r = 0.70 to 0.72 when dipeptide composition was used instead of residue composition. The method was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation test. We also demonstrate that amino acid composition information along with gene expression data can be used for improving the function classification of proteins.ConclusionThere is a correlation between gene expression and amino acid composition that can be used to predict the expression level of genes up to a certain extent.

In the field of image recognition, state-of-the-art transfer learning methods for DNNs re-use parameters trained on source domain data except for the output layer. However, this method may result in poor classification performance when the amount of target domain data is significantly small. To address this problem, we propose a method called All-Transfer Deep Learning, which enables the transfer of all parameters of a DNN. With this method, we can compute the relationship between the source and target labels by the source domain knowledge. We applied our method to actual two-dimensional electrophoresis image~(2-DE image) classification for determining if an individual suffers from sepsis; the first attempt to apply a classification approach to 2-DE images for proteomics, which has attracted considerable attention as an extension beyond genomics.

In atmospheric models, due to their computational time or resource limitations, physical processes have to be simulated using reduced (i.e. simplified) models. The use of a reduced model, however, induces errors to the simulation results. These errors are referred to as approximation errors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to correct these approximation errors. We model the approximation error as an additive noise process in the simulation model and employ the Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm for constructing a computationally low cost predictor for the approximation error. In this way, the overall simulation problem is decomposed into two separate and computationally efficient simulation problems: solution of the reduced model and prediction of the approximation error realisation. The approach is tested for handling approximation errors due to a reduced coarse sectional representation of aerosol size distribution in a cloud droplet formation calculation as well as for compensating the uncertainty caused by the aerosol activation parameterization itself. The results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of the simulation compared to the conventional simulation with a reduced model. The proposed approach is rather general and extension of it to different parameterizations or reduced process models that are coupled to geoscientific models is a straightforward task. Another major benefit of this method is that it can be applied to physical processes that are dependent on a large number of variables making them difficult to be parameterized by traditional methods.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/gmd-6-2087-2013", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoscientific Model Development", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2148490902", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128558569", "129923611", "128958912", "4642642", "40822780", "98832583", "134593048", "60504238", "128863314", "117989446", "56555626", "20401150", "124788010", "61173040", "5707599", "119659308", "33497877", "10659969", "129280419", "15001270", "55827984", "120760831", "14973086", "9604957"], "inbound_citations": ["88513804"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53643213"}

Further improvements on the novel method for state of charge (SOC) determination of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells based on the impedance spectra classification are presented. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to impedance spectra of a LFP cell, with each impedance spectrum representing a distinct SOC for a predefined temperature. As a SVM is a binary classifier, only the distinction between two SOC can be computed in one iteration of the algorithm. Therefore a search pattern is necessary. A balanced tree search was implemented with good results. In order to further improvements of the SVM method, this paper discusses two new search pattern, namely a linear search and an imbalanced tree search, the later one based on an initial educated guess. All three search pattern were compared under various aspects like accuracy, efficiency, tolerance of disturbances and temperature dependancy. The imbalanced search tree shows to be the most efficient search pattern if the initial guess is within less than \u00b15 % SOC of the original SOC in both directions and exhibits the best tolerance for high disturbances. Linear search improves the rate of exact classifications for almost every temperature. It also improves the robustness against high disturbances and can even detect a certain number of false classifications which makes this search pattern unique. The downside is a much lower efficiency as all impedance spectra have to be evaluated while the tree search pattern only evaluate those on the tree path.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/ars-14-55-2016", "venue": null, "journal": "Advances in Radio Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2526960177", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["23564640", "8920668", "52874011", "5246200", "23693378", "55267192", "98591721", "14545364", "14133004", "110115393", "13507246", "110127999", "823263"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56059807"}

While convolutional neural networks can learn high-semantic level features for object recognition, these methods still have limitations for RGB-D scene classification. One limitation is that how to learn better multi-modal features for the RGB-D scene recognition is still an open problem. Another limitation is that the scene images are usually not object-centric and with great spatial variability. Thus, vanilla full-image CNN features maybe not optimal for scene recognition. Considering these problems, in this paper, we propose a compact and effective framework for RGB-D scene recognition. Specifically, we make the following contributions: 1) A novel RGB-D scene recognition framework is proposed to explicitly learn the global modal-specific and local modal-consistent features simultaneously. Different from existing approaches, local CNN features are considered for the learning of modal-consistent representations; 2) key Feature Selection (KFS) module is designed, which can adaptively select important local features from the high-semantic level CNN feature maps. It is more efficient and effective than object detection and dense patch-sampling based methods, and; 3) a triplet correlation loss and a spatial-attention similarity loss are proposed for the training of KFS module. Under the supervision of the proposed loss functions, the network can learn import local features of two modalities with no need for extra annotations.

Analysis of hyperspectral, or imaging spectrometer, imagery has shown an impressive capacity to map a wide range of natural and anthropogenic land cover. Applications have been mostly with single-date imagery from relatively small spatial extents. Future hyperspectral satellites will provide imagery at greater spatial and temporal scales, and there is a need to assess techniques for mapping land cover with these data. Here we used simulated multi-temporal HyspIRI satellite imagery over a 30,000 km 2 area in the San Francisco Bay Area, California to assess its capabilities for mapping classes defined by the international Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). We employed a mapping methodology and analysis framework that is applicable to regional and global scales. We used the Random Forests classifier with three sets of predictor variables (reflectance, MNF, hyperspectral metrics), two temporal resolutions (summer, spring-summer-fall), two sample scales (pixel, polygon) and two levels of classification complexity (12, 20 classes). Hyperspectral metrics provided a 16.4\u201321.8% and 3.1\u20136.7% increase in overall accuracy relative to MNF and reflectance bands, respectively, depending on pixel or polygon scales of analysis.

However, the discrimination of tree species requires the selection of the relevant spectral features derived from imagery. We can extract an extensive number of image parameters even from images with a low spectral resolution, such as Red-Green-Blue (RGB) or near-infrared (NIR) images. Hence, identifying the most relevant image parameters for tree species discrimination is still an issue. We generated 42 parameters from very high resolution images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), such as chromatic coordinates, spectral indices, texture measures and a canopy height model (CHM). The aim of this study was to compare the relevance of these components for classifying savannah tree species. We obtained very high (5 cm) pixel resolution RGB-NIR imagery with a delta-wing UAV in a thorn bush savannah landscape in central Namibia in April 2016. Simultaneously, we gathered ground truth data on the location of 478 individual trees and large shrubs belonging to 16 species. We then used a Random Forest classifier on single and combined thematic sets of image data, e.g. RGB, NIR, texture and in combination with CHM. The best average overall accuracy was 0.77 and the best Cohen\u00b4s Kappa value was 0.63 for a combination of RGB imagery and the CHM. Our results are comparable to other studies using hyperspectral data and LiDAR information. We further found that the abundance of the tree species is crucial for successful mapping, with only species with a high abundance being classified satisfactorily. Diverse ecosystems such as savannahs could therefore be a challenge for future tree mapping projects. Nevertheless, this study indicates that UAV-borne RGB imagery seems promising for detailed mapping of tree species.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-64332-8_10", "venue": "The Roles of Remote Sensing in Nature Conservation", "journal": "The Roles of Remote Sensing in Nature Conservation", "mag_id": "2767205119", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135006710"}

Whenever candidate classifiers are trained, all the samples in all source domains are involved in learning, and the information conducive to target task learning can be obtained,so that negative transfer can be avoided.

In this paper, we put forward a real-time tracking system RASS, which can achieve this goal and is promising in the applications like the safeguard system. Our basic idea is to divide the tracking field into different areas, with adjacent areas using different communication channels. So, the interference among different areas can be prevented. For each area, three communicating nodes are deployed on the ceiling as a regular triangle to monitor this area. In each triangle area, we use a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to locate the object. This model simulates the relationship between the signal dynamics caused by the object and the object position. It not only considers the ideal case of signal dynamics caused by the object, but also utilizes their irregular information. As a result, it can reach the tracking accuracy to around 1 m by just using three nodes in a triangle area with 4 m in each side.

Given that noises are inevitable, it is essential for dimensionality reduction techniques to be robust from noises. 2) The conventional techniques separate the graph learning system apart from informative feature determination. These techniques used to construct a data structure graph first, and keep the graph unchanged to process the feature extraction or feature selection. Hence, the result of feature extraction or feature selection is strongly relying on the graph constructed. 3) The conventional techniques determine data intrinsic structure with less systematic and partial analyzation. They maintain either the data global structure or the data local manifold structure.

Here activity recognition is considered as a sequence labelling problem, while abnormal behaviour is flagged based on the deviation from normal patterns.

To get the discriminating wavenumbers, a wavenumber selection strategy is put forward in this paper. In the strategy, full-spectrum, four spectral wavenumber selection methods (competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, CARS; successive projections algorithm, SPA; Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination, MC-UVE and moving window Partial Least Squares, mwPLS) coupling with Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier (Full-SVM, CARS-SVM, SPA-SVM, MC-UVE-SVM, mwPLS-SVM) are applied respectively to investigate the wavenumber selection method, and then the wavenumbers selected by the best wavenumber selection method are regarded as the discriminating wavenumbers correspondingly. Experiment results show that the CARS-SVM is the best wavenumber selection method among CARS-SVM, SPA-SVM, MC-UVE-SVM and mwPLS-SVM methods, and 42 discriminating wavenumbers are selected by CARS. Furthermore, the stability of these 42 discriminating wavenumbers has been verified by new graded asphalt from different source.

This leads to the supremacy of noise in the data that extracts predictive models disposed to over-fitting and hence imprecise.

The innovative contribution of this study is to reconnoiter the application of Gradient Boosting technique which is more robust because of its regularization formulation. The global retailer data is used to compare Gradient Boosting against three traditionally used supervised classifiers like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and reveal its suggestively higher accuracy for predicting employee turnover.

To identify by spatial independent component analysis (ICA) the brain networks involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathological processes and evaluate their discriminative value in separating patients from controls. ::: Background. Positron emission tomography and volume of interest (VOI) analysis have recently shown in ALS an accuracy of 93[percnt] in separating patients from controls. ::: Methods. Two hundred fifty-nine ALS patients and forty age and sex-matched control subjects underwent brain 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET). Spatial ICA of the preprocessed FDG-PET images was performed. Intensity values were converted to z-scores and binary masks were used as data-driven VOIs. The accuracy of this classifier was tested versus a validated system processing intensity signals in 27 brain meta-VOIs. Support Vector Machine was independently applied to both datasets and \u2018leave-one-out\u2019 technique verified the general validity of results. ::: Results. ICA identified eight pathophysiological meaningful components: bilateral cerebellum/midbrain; bilateral basal ganglia/thalami; bilateral temporal cortex; bilateral frontal/prefrontal cortex; bilateral patietal/posterior cingulate cortices (posterior portion of DMN); bilateral medial temporal /sub-genual anterior cingulate cortex; bilateral occipital cortex; bilateral motor cortex. This eight components discriminated patients from controls with 99.0[percnt] accuracy; the discriminating value of bilateral cerebellum/midbrain alone was 96.3[percnt]. Among the meta-VOIs right temporal lobe alone reached an accuracy of 93.7[percnt]. ::: Conclusions. Spatial ICA identified in this large cohort of ALS patients spatially distinct networks allowing a high discrimination value which improves substantially the previously accuracy obtained by VOI. The cerebellar/midbrain component accounted for the highest accuracy in differentiating ALS patients from healthy controls. Spatial ICA and multivariate analysis performed better in comparison to univariate semiquantification methods in identifying the neurodegenerative features of ALS. Our finding support the possibility to include PET in the diagnostic process of ALS.

Regardless of their importance, the bradykinesia-related items show low agreement between different evaluators. In this study, we design an applicable tool that provides an objective quantification of bradykinesia and that evaluates all characteristics described in the MDS-UPDRS. Twenty-five patients with Parkinson's disease performed three of the five bradykinesia-related items of the MDS-UPDRS. Their movements were assessed by four evaluators and were recorded with a nine degrees-of-freedom sensor. Sensor fusion was employed to obtain a 3-D representation of movements. Based on the resulting signals, a set of features related to the characteristics described in the MDS-UPDRS was defined. Feature selection methods were employed to determine the most important features to quantify bradykinesia. The features selected were used to train support vector machine classifiers to obtain an automatic score of the movements of each patient.

This approach is illustrated with an experimentation case of myrtle rust (Austropuccinia psidii) on paperbark tea trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The method integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hyperspectral image sensors, and data processing algorithms using machine learning. Imagery is acquired using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec \u00ae camera, orthorectified in Headwall SpectralView \u00ae , and processed in Python programming language using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), and Scikit-learn third-party libraries. In total, 11,385 samples were extracted and labelled into five classes: two classes for deterioration status and three classes for background objects. Insights reveal individual detection rates of 95% for healthy trees, 97% for deteriorated trees, and a global multiclass detection rate of 97%. The methodology is versatile to be applied to additional datasets taken with different image sensors, and the processing of large datasets with freeware tools.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5948945", "pubmed_id": "29565822", "doi": "10.3390/s18040944", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2789266805,2913988069", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["88004938", "85353686", "33214324", "1370428", "631886", "84788928", "31867108", "24337924", "85996889", "90002593", "758948", "34858541", "84227498", "83520816", "84642607", "83974294", "207840468", "89745976", "427994", "140139246", "17986123", "7903367", "32521007", "10797979", "37034447", "26235001", "55000200", "91165607", "533301", "15403251", "1658385", "109435533", "114862393", "109652910", "215665285", "11105886", "3327194", "10499907", "117764485", "51767360", "6087317", "29599238", "6104298", "132768976", "6214825", "4650265", "10659969", "133358670", "60768981"], "inbound_citations": ["133187167", "56176769", "210840295", "181816205", "211107881", "85500827", "199004569", "182377363", "84183818", "49352330", "215427672"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4186970"}

Reliability, vulnerability and resiliency are used as indicators to evaluate the model performance in meeting objectives of satisfying water demand and maximizing flood prevention. Results of the performance evaluation indicate that the releases predicted by the genetic-based neurofuzzy model gave higher reliability for water supply and flood protection compared to the actual operation, the releases based on simulation following the current rule curve, and the predicted releases based on other approaches such as the fuzzy rule-based model and the neurofuzzy model.

This is due to the volume of digital data available, combined with the relatively isolated nature of the batsman versus bowler contest observed per ball. Like many other sports, Cricket is reliant on the contribution of interacting individuals causing fluctuations in match outcomes. Understanding the quantifiable causes of this variation can help interested parties derive insight into team success and potential strategies for optimising performance. Understanding the individual dynamic within the team setting can lead to improved team ratings. The objective of this research was to develop a roster-based system for limited overs cricket by deriving a team rating as a combination of individual ratings. The intent was to build an adaptive optimisation system that selects a cricket team of 11 players from a list of available players, such that the optimal team produces the greatest team rating. The attributes used to define the individual ratings are based on the statistical significance and practical contribution to winning. An adaptive system was used to create the individual ratings using a modified version of a Product Weighted Measure. The weights for this system were created using a combination of a Random Forest and Analytical Hierarchical Process. The underlying framework of this system was validated by demonstrating an increase in the accuracy of predicted match outcomes compared to other established ranking methods for cricket teams. For the 2015/16 Big Bash, this approach outperformed the results outlined by Patel et al. (2016) by 12.3%. The results confirm that cricket team ratings based on the aggregation of individual playing ratings with attributes weighted towards winning limited over matches are superior to ratings based on summaries of team performances and match outcomes.

We develop a decision engine that delegates tasks between human and machine and demonstrate that the combined system provides at least a factor of 8 increase in the classification rate, classifying 210 803 galaxies in just 32 d of GZ2 project time with 93.1 per cent accuracy.

In contrast to face recognition in visual spectrum, because of the domain discrepancy, this task requires to extract domain-invariant feature or common space projection learning. To bridge this domain gap, we propose a graph-structured module that focuses on facial relational information to reduce the fundamental differences in domain characteristics. Since relational information is domain independent, our Relational Graph Module (RGM) performs relation modeling from node vectors that represent facial components such as lips, nose, and chin. Propagation of the generated relational graph then reduces the domain difference by transitioning from spatially correlated CNN (convolutional neural network) features to inter-dependent relational features. In addition, we propose a Node Attention Unit (NAU) that performs node-wise recalibration to focus on the more informative nodes arising from the relation-based propagation. Furthermore, we suggest a novel conditional-margin loss function (C-Softmax) for efficient projection learning on the common latent space of the embedding vector. Our module can be plugged into any pre-trained face recognition network to help overcome the limitations of a small HFR database. The proposed method shows superior performance on three different HFR databases CAISA NIR-VIS 2.0, IIIT-D Sketch, and BUAA-VisNir in various pre-trained networks.

Malicious attackers use compromised OSN accounts to spread fake news, to send spam messages and to promote malicious applications which in turn lead to substantial financial and reputation loss. The current scenario in the world is that heavily funded and sophisticated criminal groups execute these malicious activities. Numerous Twitter accounts are either fake or compromised as they are victims of these attacks. Detecting these compromised accounts is a challenging task due to various reasons, including the dynamic behaviour of OSN services and its users. A new framework titled User Behaviour Analytics based Compromised Account Detection(UbCadet) proposed in this paper. Some of the significant derived attributes proposed in this work to profile a Twitter user are Similarity of tweet text, Similarity of hashtag, time of tweeting and Geo-location information. In this work, User Behavioural Profile builds with derived attributes of a Twitter user. Based on this user profile, the tweets of each user converts to individual tweet patterns. These patterns are classified as normal or anomalous using k-Nearest Neighbour machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the ensemble method and Random Forest classifier has also experimented for pattern classification. An account classifies as compromised or benign based on the frequency of normal or anomalous tweets from that account. The dataset collected from Yelp, which is a popular crowd-sourced review forum is also used for the experiment in addition to the Twitter dataset, to examine the applicability of the proposed approach in other OSNs.

Indeed, one of the major security issues in Cloud is to protect against distributed attacks and other malicious activities on the network that can affect confidentiality, availability and integrity of Cloud resources.

The system reduces natural language processing (NLP) ambiguity by segmenting text by domain, allowing for domain-specific downstream processes to analyze each segment independently. ::: A tokenized text input stream is received by the system. At every word, an Indicator Function calculates a quantitative feature signal we call an Indicator Value Signal, that runs in parallel to the input stream. This feature signal is monitored for domain changes by an event controller, which segments the stream into feature chunks. The event controller can activate slowly over large spans of text, or rapidly and intrasententially. As the event controller indicates each domain change with an event signal, pipeline processes assigned to specific indicator function values are executed to process the segment, and add additional feature signals to the feature signal stack. At the end of the pipeline, feature signals are unified to produce a single annotated output stream. ::: To exemplify the framework, this dissertation makes three additional contributions. The first is a novel short-string language identification system that calculates our Indicator Value Signal. The second is a machine transliteration system to convert the Arabizi chat alphabet into Arabic script. The third is a modular part of speech tagger for multilingual code-mixing. ::: The short-string language identification system extracts an n-gram, and selects the closest language out of 373 reference languages by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a matrix of language model measurements. This classifier learns patterns of similarity and divergence of a language's tokens across all reference languages, leading to high accuracy on in-domain n-grams from a legal corpus as well as out-of-domain tokens from an English-Egyptian Arabic code-mixing microblog corpus. ::: The machine transliteration system converts Arabizi, a Latinized Arabic chat alphabet into Arabic script, in order to utilize existing NLP tools on Arabic chat text. A parallel, word-aligned corpus of the chat alphabet was collected from a dozen Arabic speakers. From the corpus we induced a probabilistic mapping of cross-dialect Arabizi characters to Arabic script and used this to train a highly accurate transducer. ::: The multilingual part of speech tagger demonstrates the modularity of our framework. We find that segmenting language before tagging, and then applying single-language homogeneous language models, is competitive to multilingual heterogeneous tagging models. We compare the two approaches on a speech transcript of English-Spanish code-mixing. ::: In addition to language identification, we consider a range of alternative indicator functions, such as genre identification, entropy, and gender identification, which could add a language adaptation ability on top of existing NLP systems and provide a boost in accuracy and performance on variational processing. ::: To summarize, this dissertation provides an architecture for NLP that allows for better handling of complicated language variation. To demonstrate the model, we introduce a short-string language identification system with state of the art accuracy, the first research on machine transliteration for a chat alphabet, and a modular part of speech tagger for multilingual code-mixing.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "25263363", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16762147", "29559446", "11416374", "17699297"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59702535"}

Lately, photonic reservoir computing (RC)\u2013a hardware machine learning technique with recurrent connectivity\u2013has been proposed as a post-processing tool that deals with deterministic distortions from fiber transmission. Here, we show that RC post-processing is remarkably efficient for multilevel encoding and for the use of very high launched optical peak power for fiber transmission up to 14 dBm. Higher power levels provide the desired high SNR values at the receiver end, at the expense of a complex nonlinear transformation of the transmission signal. Our demonstration evaluates a direct fiber communication link with 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) encoding and direct detection, without including optical amplification, dispersion compensation, pulse shaping or other digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. By applying RC post-processing on the distorted signal, we numerically estimate fiber transmission distances of 27 km at 56 Gb/s and of 5.5 km at 112 Gb/s data encoding rates, while fulfilling the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) bit-error-rate (BER) limit for data recovery.

In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a skip connection deep forest (SForest), which can be viewed as a modification of the standard deep forest model. It leverages multi-class-grained scanning method to train multiple binary forest from different training sub-dataset of classes to encourage the diversity of ensemble and solve the class-imbalance problem. To expand the diversity of each layer in cascade forest, five different classifiers are employed. Meanwhile, the fitting quality of each classifiers is taken into consideration in representation learning. In addition, we propose a skip connection strategy to augment the feature vector, and use Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) as the final classifier to improve the overall performance.

With their unique root structure they serve as important natural coastal protection and provide habitats with excellent conditions for cultivating fish, shrimp and crab species. Despite all benefits mangrove forests are disappearing at alarming rates around the world but especially in Asia such as the Mekong Delta coast. Therefore, this research focusses on the Ca Mau Province in Vietnam. The Ca Mau province is the southernmost province of Vietnam with mangroves present along the coastlines, the Mui Ca Mau National Park and in mixed mangrove aquaculture farms. Remote sensing has been widely proven to be essential in mapping mangrove ecosystems. Previous research used either expensive optical and radar data sources or free but lower resolution systems. This study is the first that uses the new Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite missions that provide free available data with high spatial (10-20 meter) and temporal (10-12 days) resolution. Since optical data is prone to cloud effects and radar data is hard to interpret, both data sets are combined to investigate improvements for classifying mangroves. The data is processed in the new online Google Earth Engine platform providing a powerful tool for big data applications such as land cover classification. Optical data is found to separate mangroves by their spectral reflectance mainly in the near-infrared wavelength domain. The dominant mangrove species in the Ca Mau province, Rhizophora Apiculata and Avicennia Alba, are found to be separable from comparing unsupervised clustering results with ground truth locations. The C-band radar signal is dominated by volume scattering, indicating the density of the canopy. Especially VV-polarization has good correlation with canopy parameters. To improve information from the radar signal a temporal analysis is executed. Seasonal variations are quantified and show an increase according to the spatial succession of mangroves. Pioneer species, such as Avicennia genus, show less seasonal variations than mature species, such as Rhizophora genus. With the previous information five classes are defined: urban area, water and three mangrove classes: Rhizophora Apiculata species in extensive shrimps, Rhizophora Apiculata species in natural environment and Avicennia Alba species. A classification method is set-up in the Google Earth Engine with a Random Forest classifier using the satellite data inputs and ground truth training input of the five classes. A combination of the optical data with the temporal information of the radar data is found to be the best data input for separating those five classes. Classification results are obtained for discriminating mangrove types up to an overall accuracy of 87\\%. The classification gets less reliable when mangrove species are mixed or at locations where the ground truth training input was scarce. With the resulting yearly land cover maps land cover changes can be detected. Comparing the land cover map of 2017 with a mangrove cover product of 2000 shows a regression along the southern coastline. No significant changes inside the shrimp farms are found between 2016 and 2017 but with the future availability of a long time series of Sentinel-1 and 2 data those can be detected with the method that is resulted from this study.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2885589044", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134666315"}

Our simple but general clip representation captures both topology and density; we can handle not only rigid area match or edge displacement constraints but also variant edge tolerances and don't care regions. On the other hand, for achieving a small cluster count, our clip clustering is guided by the natural grouping structure of layout clips. Our experiments are conducted on 2016 CAD contest at ICCAD benchmark suite; our results show that our algorithm outperforms the reference solution and all contest winning teams, delivering the smallest cluster count, fastest runtime, and 100% validity.

This tool, the Hydra, uses the best performing technique from Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), to predict the taxa expected at a stream site, and further evaluates the quality of a site, though a classification system based on observed/expected values, similar to that used in River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) models. To test the procedure, we used a dataset composed of 137 training sites, 15 validation sites and 174 test sites (potentially disturbed) from Portuguese streams. The combined use of three machine learning techniques was more effective in the prediction of invertebrate taxa at a site than their individual use. The three methods were always tested for all invertebrate taxa, but from the three techniques tested, SVM and KNN were most often the best performing techniques (the most accurate among the three for a higher number of taxa) in the prediction of invertebrate taxa with the present dataset. The combination of all algorithms implemented in Hydra resulted in good models for stream bioassessment (e.g. SD OE50 0.6, Spearman correlations with global degradation >0.7). We also found no advantage in removing rare taxa from the training dataset, and 50% accuracy is the most adequate accuracy level for calculation of OE ratios through Hydra. Future work should consist of comparing the performance of this technique with others, such as the RIVPACS models, using the same datasets. Considering the flexibility of this technique, self-adjustment and easy implementation through a website (aquaweb.uc.pt), we expect it to be also useful in the prediction of other aquatic elements such as fishes and algae.

The need for this research derives from the urgent and increasing need for accurate and efficient algorithms. Colon cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, hence it is vitally important for the cancer tissues to be expertly identified and classified in a rapid and timely manner, to assure both a fast detection of the disease and to expedite the drug discovery process. Methods In this research, a three-phase approach was proposed and implemented: Phases One and Two examined the feature selection algorithms and classification algorithms employed separately, and Phase Three examined the performance of the combination of these. Results It was found from Phase One that the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm performed best with the colon dataset as a feature selection (29 genes selected) and from Phase Two that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm outperformed other classifications, with an accuracy of almost 86%. It was also found from Phase Three that the combined use of PSO and SVM surpassed other algorithms in accuracy and performance, and was faster in terms of time analysis (94%). Conclusions It is concluded that applying feature selection algorithms prior to classification algorithms results in better accuracy than when the latter are applied alone.

This increase in complexity means that in many cases existing network performance analysis methods are no longer effective, and that there is a need for more powerful methods. ::: In this dissertation, we propose the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a powerful state-of-the-art machine learning technique, as a network performance analysis framework that can cope with increasing network complexity. Support Vector Machines are a suitable candidate framework in this situation because of their ability to handle complicated non-linear relationships between large numbers of variables while retaining high computational efficiency. ::: To make a case for the effectiveness of SVMs as a framework for network performance analysis, we devise SVM-based solutions for three network performance analysis problems. The three problems that we consider present very different challenges, but they have in common the property of becoming more difficult to solve as network complexity increases. Finding effective solutions to a set of problems that present different challenges is important for establishing SVMs as a useful general-purpose framework rather than an ad hoc solution for specific situations. We find that in each case SVM-based solutions improve on existing solutions significantly in areas such as accuracy, measurement overhead and ease of practical deployment. Hence we conclude that SVMs provide an effective framework for network performance analysis in the face of growing network complexity.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2224521137", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61578363"}

However, eco-environmental sounds have many specific properties such as the diversity, high background noise and non-stationary structure which make many traditional audio features hard to characterize them accurately. In this paper, a novel feature extraction technique based on Matching Pursuit algorithm is adopted to obtain proper features which can describe the specific properties of eco-environment sounds accurately. In order to further improve the performance of our classification system, we make use of the support vector machine to automatically classify the eco-environmental sounds into seven classes. The experimental results show that our system is effective to classify the environmental sounds quickly and accurately.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIECS.2010.5677677", "venue": "2010 2nd International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science", "journal": "2010 2nd International Conference on Information Engineering and Computer Science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1982745335", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206601864", "10467693", "15834484", "15304547", "6271279", "9733022", "6917056", "17943490", "14427335", "60900296", "206787478", "9790719"], "inbound_citations": ["10290540"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18576894"}

Through spatial and optical calibration, the approach sufficiently utilized the information hidden in the images and features of the cell nucleus.

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson X2 divergence. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs. We also conduct two comparison experiments between LSGANs and regular GANs to illustrate the stability of LSGANs.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1611.04076", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id":

The latter purpose is supported by variable importance measures that rate the relevance of predictors. Yet existing measures can not be computed when data contains missing values.

However, it is unknown to what extend these approaches are able to provide a reliable estimate of a variables relevance. An extensive simulation study was performed to investigate this property for a variety of missing data generating processes. Findings and recommendations: Complete case analysis should not be applied as it inappropriately penalized variables that were completely observed. The new importance measure is much more capable to reflect decreased information exclusively for variables with missing values and should therefore be used to evaluate actual data situations.

The kernel mapping takes into account the representation of query words in their respective collections along with their semantic meaning. Then, standard regression techniques are deployed to learn the parameter values on a source collection which are later applied to obtain the values on the target collections. Our experiments on standard IR collections show that the proposed approach can efficiently tune the parameters of IR models query by query for new (unseen) target collections.

For many diseases, existing clinical literature may suggest the risk of disease varies with some markers of biological and etiological importance, for example age. To identify effective prediction rules using nonparametric decision functions, standard statistical learning approaches treat markers with clear biological importance (e.g., age) and other markers without prior knowledge on disease etiology interchangeably as input variables. Therefore, these approaches may be inadequate in singling out and preserving the effects from the biologically important variables, especially in the presence of potential noise markers. Using age as an example of a salient marker to receive special care in the analysis, we propose a local smoothing large margin classifier implemented with support vector machine (SVM) to construct effective age-dependent classification rules. The method adaptively adjusts age effect and separately tunes age and other markers to achieve optimal performance. We derive the asymptotic risk bound of the local smoothing SVM, and perform extensive simulation studies to compare with standard approaches.

Because marginal distribution is usually unknown, the possible solution is to reduce data dimension into an optimized contrast function to measure component independency. In this research, PSO algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. PSO is used to distinguish the signal selected by two different contrast functions. The problem existed in gradient method is solved using PSO, that is getting trapped in local optimum. The result of feature reduction done by using ICA-PSO technique is then compared with the result of feature reduction done by using ICA algorithm and PCA. Furthermore, the result gained by using ICA-PSO is used to classify hyperspectral images. In this work, Support Vector Machine is used as classifier. Classification result obtained by using ICA-PSO dimensionality reduction on AVIRIS, the value of average accuracy (AA) is 0.8535, overall accuracy (OA) is 0.8310, and K is 0.785. Whereas on HYDICE, classification result obtained by using ICA-PSO dimensionality reduction is at 0.8783 for AA, 0.8625 for OA, K is 0.850.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSITech.2016.7852649", "venue": "2016 2nd International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech)", "journal": "2016 2nd International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2588299075", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1070929", "17865664", "124843961", "18194068", "14354938", "61815900", "6906514", "1070929", "16203715"], "inbound_citations": ["38649717", "133225113"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13071752"}

Profiles were then reduced and visualized with SOM. The distribution of 10 major phytochemical classes, in relation to TCM profile, was delineated with SOM-Ward clustering. These classes comprised aliphatics, alkaloids, simple phenolics, lignans, quinones, polyphenols (flavonoids and tannins), and mono-, sesqui-, di-, and triterpenes (including sterols). Highly distinctive patterns of association between phytochemical class and TCM profile were revealed, suggesting that a strong phytochemical basis underlies the traditional language of Chinese medicine. Maps trained after random permutation of herbs assigned to each category were, by contrast, devoid of feature, providing additional evidence for the significance of these associations. Most classes were split into relatively few clusters, and further analysis revealed that simple descriptors, comprising skeletal type, molecular weight, and calculated log P, were in most cases able to readily discriminate within-class clusters.

We refer to kernels of this class as Tessellated Kernels (TKs) due to the observation that if applied to kernel-based learning algorithms, the resulting discriminants are defined by continuous piecewise-polynomial functions with hyper-rectangular domains whose vertices are determined by the training data. The number of parameters used to define these TKs is determined by the length of an associated monomial basis. However, even for a single monomial basis function the TKs are universal in the sense that the resulting discriminants occupy a hypothesis space which is dense in L2.

The accepted method for promoter prediction is to use a pair of position weight matrices (PWMs), which define conserved motifs at the sigma-factor binding site. However this method is known to result in a large number of false positive predictions, thereby limiting its usefulness to the experimental biologist. We adopt an alternative approach based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) using a modified mismatch spectrum kernel. Our modifications involve tagging the motifs with their location, and selectively pruning the feature set. We quantify the performance of several SVM models and a PWM model using a performance metric of area under the detection-error tradeoff (DET) curve.

The first stage of our system allows detecting and tracking a bare hand in a cluttered background using face subtraction, skin detection and contour comparison. The second stage allows recognizing hand gestures using bag-of-features and multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Finally, a grammar has been developed to generate gesture commands for application control. ::: Our hand gesture recognition system consists of two steps: offline training and online testing. In the training stage, after extracting the keypoints for every training image using the Scale Invariance Feature Transform (SIFT), a vector quantization technique will map keypoints from every training image into a unified dimensional histogram vector (bag-of-words) after K-means clustering. This histogram is treated as an input vector for a multi-class SVM to build the classifier. In the testing stage, for every frame captured from a webcam, the hand is detected using my algorithm. Then, the keypoints are extracted for every small image that contains the detected hand posture and fed into the cluster model to map them into a bag-of-words vector, which is fed into the multi-class SVM classifier to recognize the hand gesture. ::: Another hand gesture recognition system was proposed using Principle Components Analysis (PCA). The most eigenvectors and weights of training images are determined. In the testing stage, the hand posture is detected for every frame using my algorithm. Then, the small image that contains the detected hand is projected onto the most eigenvectors of training images to form its test weights. Finally, the minimum Euclidean distance is determined among the test weights and the training weights of each training image to recognize the hand gesture. ::: Two application of gesture-based interaction with a 3D gaming virtual environment were implemented. The exertion videogame makes use of a stationary bicycle as one of the main inputs for game playing.

In this study, Random Forests statistical analysis was used on a database of 499 surveyed inland valleys in four study zones in three West African countries. The goal of the study was to assess parameters that indicate (are predictors for) high potential for development of rice-based systems in inland valleys. These parameters are related to the biophysical (hydrology, soil, climate, and topography) and socio-economic (demography, accessibility, and markets) environments. Farmer group surveys and secondary data from existing publicly available spatial data sets were used. The analysis revealed that, across the four research areas, the following parameters were relevant predictors for rice development: (1) distance from the inland valley to the nearest market; (2) distance from the inland valley to the nearest rice mill; (3) population density in the immediate environment of the inland valley; (4) total nitrogen in the top 20 cm of the soil profile; (5) land elevation; and (6) soil texture on the upper slope of the inland valley. Several predictors were highly important for specific research areas, but not for all, thus showing the diversity in the studied agricultural landscapes. These predictors included soil fertility management, source of irrigation water, and the percentage of female farmers in the inland valley. The identified relevant predictors will be used to map the potential rice production development of the inland valleys.

In this paper, a new approach for Android botnet classification based on features selection and classification algorithms is proposed. The proposed approach uses the permissions requested in the Android app as features, to differentiate between the Android botnet apps and benign apps.

Most studies focus on extracting activity patterns within a given region or across multiple voxels, and utilize the relationships among voxels to decipher the category of a stimulus image. Yet, the functional connectivity (FC) patterns across regions of interest in response to image categories, and their potential contributions to category classification are largely unknown. New method We investigated whole-brain FC patterns in response to 4 image category stimuli (cats, faces, houses, and vehicles) using fMRI in healthy adult volunteers, and classified FC patterns using machine learning framework (Support Vector Machine [SVM] and Random Forest). We further examined the FC robustness and the influence of the window length on FC patterns for neural decoding. Results The average one-vs.-one classification accuracy of the two classification models were 74% within subjects and 80% between subjects, which are higher than the chance level (50%). The Random Forest results were better than SVM results, and the 48-s FC results were better than the 24-s FC results. Comparison with existing method(s) We compared the classification performance of our FC patterns with two other existing methods, inter-block and intra-block, without overlapping temporal information. Conclusions Whole-brain FC patterns for different window lengths (24 and 48 s) can predict images categories with high accuracy.

When trained on limited datasets, a high capacity model, as most leading neural network architectures are, is likely to overfit and thus generalize poorly to unseen data. Further aggravating the problem, data used to train models in medicine are typically collected in silos and from narrow data distributions that are determined by specific acquisition hardware, imaging protocols, and patient demographics. In addition, class imbalance within and across datasets is a common complication as disease conditions or sub-types have varying degrees of prevalence. In this paper, we motivate the need for generalizable training in the context of skin lesion classification by evaluating the performance of ResNet across 7 public datasets with dataset bias and class imbalance. To mitigate dataset bias, we extend the classification and contrastive semantic alignment (CCSA) loss that aims to learn domain-invariant features. As the CCSA loss requires labelled data from two domains, we propose a strategy to dynamically sample paired data in a setting where the set of available classes varies across domains. To encourage learning from underrepresented classes, the sampled class probabilities are used to weight the classification and alignment losses. Experimental results demonstrate improved generalizability as measured by the mean macro-average recall across the 7 datasets when training using the weighted CCSA loss and dynamic sampler.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32251-9_40", "venue": "MICCAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2979553811", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12905100", "39043221", "23714201", "3767412", "51929145", "12825123", "10768153", "206594692", "51614248", "52833113", "3172259", "4533221", "4357800", "31062300", "53102564"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201625607"}

Therefore, replacing conventional video cameras in surveillance systems with less-intrusive and yet effective alternatives, such as micro-wave radars, is of high interest. The aim of this work is to explore the application of Reservoir Computing Networks (RCNs) to the problem of identifying a limited number of people in an indoor environment, leveraging gait information captured by micro-wave radar measurements. These measurements are done using a commercial low-power linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar. Besides the low quality of the outputs of such a radar sensor, walking spontaneously as opposed to controlled situations adds another level of complexity to the targeted use case. In this context, RCNs are interesting tools, given that they have shown a high effectiveness in capturing temporal information and handling noise, while at the same time being easy to setup and train. Using Micro-Doppler features as inputs, we follow a structured procedure towards optimizing the parameters of our RCN-based approach, showing that RCNs have a great potential in processing the noisy features provided by a low-power radar.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/RADAR.2019.8835753", "venue": "2019 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)", "journal": "2019 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2969128506", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["124141384", "26712448", "49410307", "6717965", "32975698", "12562712", "8578649", "6151991", "16096318", "54901285", "120106233", "17733022", "2625066", "7032232"], "inbound_citations": ["212634093"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202089654"}

The aim of this study is to develop a clinically useful support vector machine (SVM)-based prediction model to identify patients with high probability of OSA for non-sleep specialist physician in clinical practice. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The SVM model was developed using the features routinely collected at the clinical evaluation from 6,875 Chinese patients referred to sleep clinics for suspected OSA. Three apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cutoffs, \u22655/h, \u226515/h, and \u226530/h were used to define the severity of OSA. The continuous and categorized features were selected separately and were further selected through stepwise forward feature selection. Those modeling was achieved through 5-fold cross-validation. The model discriminative ability was evaluated for the whole dataset and four subgroups categorized with gender and age (<65 versus \u226565 y/o). ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Two features were selected to predict AHI cutoff \u22655/h with six features selected for \u226515/h, and six features selected for \u226530/h, respectively, to reach AUROC 0.82, 0.80, and 0.78, respectively. The sensitivity was 74.14%, 75.18%, and 70.26%, while the specificity was 74.71%, 68.73%, and 70.30%, respectively. Compared to logistic regression, Berlin Questionnaire, NoSAS Score, and SLIM scoring system, the SVM model performs better with a more balanced sensitivity and specificity. The discriminative ability was best for male <65 y/o and modest for female \u226565 y/o. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our model provides a simple and accurate modality for early identification of patients with OSA and may potentially help prioritize them for sleep study.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31917446", "doi": "10.1093/sleep/zsz295", "venue": "Sleep", "journal": "Sleep", "mag_id": "2999086204", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210120432"}

The feature vectors fed to the SVMs are formed based on the physical relationship between damages and modal frequency changes. The SVM uses a hypothesis space of linear functions in a high dimensional feature space. The simplest SVM model is the so-called linear SVM (LSVM) that works only for the case where data are linearly separable in the original feature space. A series of experiments are undertaken to verify the performance of the proposed approach. The damage is introduced by replacing columns by weak columns. By replacing two columns, the storey stiffness is reduced to 60% of the original stiffness. Although acceleration sensors are installed at all storeys, only the top sensor and the bottom sensor are used for obtaining modal frequencies. The modal frequencies are calculated from time histories of the vibration experiment by applying the subspace identification method.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/B978-008044100-9/50062-0", "venue": "Advances in Building Technology", "journal": "Advances in Building Technology", "mag_id": "130809272", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107275530"}

While the molecular mechanisms of TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway have been studied in detail, the global networks downstream of SMAD remain largely unknown. The regulatory effect of SMAD complex likely depends on transcriptional modules, in which the SMAD binding elements and partner transcription factor binding sites (SMAD modules) are present in specific context.ResultsTo address this question and develop a computational model for SMAD modules, we simultaneously performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) and mRNA expression profiling to identify TGF-\u03b2/SMAD regulated and synchronously coexpressed gene sets in ovarian surface epithelium. Intersecting the ChIP-chip and gene expression data yielded 150 direct targets, of which 141 were grouped into 3 co-expressed gene sets (sustained up-regulated, transient up-regulated and down-regulated), based on their temporal changes in expression after TGF-\u03b2 activation. We developed a data-mining method driven by the Random Forest algorithm to model SMAD transcriptional modules in the target sequences. The predicted SMAD modules contain SMAD binding element and up to 2 of 7 other transcription factor binding sites (E2F, P53, LEF1, ELK1, COUPTF, PAX4 and DR1).ConclusionTogether, the computational results further the understanding of the interactions between SMAD and other transcription factors at specific target promoters, and provide the basis for more targeted experimental verification of the co-regulatory modules.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2724489", "pubmed_id": "19615063", "doi": "10.1186/1752-0509-3-73", "venue": "BMC Systems Biology", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1988562314", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["19326475", "21213975", "13308960", "30415532", "15602655", "21417744", "24933410", "19225069", "6571996", "25985879", "21855375", "28793570", "22499356", "25031629", "25290925", "12802228", "30753043", "30661489", "3976338", "12325331", "207855666", "16968887", "2063342", "30469674", "32562717", "22632188", "20870769", "29805653", "21365784", "9874716", "8313580", "16691520", "10806348", "2083080", "1376939", "1395902", "8063616", "8422538", "16851235", "38386435", "22431926", "30685355", "41248939", "11841439", "25009161", "25610907", "7234685", "31786626", "32118269", "8232208", "37583222", "39999195", "18223202", "17945638", "18303836", "459210", "3140538", "5612356", "16313962", "20677063", "21828314", "1663150", "22851552", "11406308", "25861421", "37114681", "19890301", "26251833", "17395628", "1092936", "10750294", "46009416", "2173901", "73835166", "20756819", "24906021", "21343474", "9048905", "25646903"], "inbound_citations": ["16343115", "21326174", "12983889", "23991066", "914260", "29479559", "23293065", "6490496", "214921888", "44180602", "14804654", "202563883", "215684421", "4717975", "1470137", "44099185", "46624842", "210829202", "215062253", "11745222", "18592285", "13685337", "2550368", "6448013", "10824879", "6479699", "205349474", "209505732", "59607041", "10818746", "23171678"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7644031"}

Approach: In this study, two variant of conditions i.e., different performances of individual subsystems and inconsistent quality of test samples are experimented to multibiometric systems. By applying multialgorithm scheme, two types of features extraction method i.e., Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) are executed in this study. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier for both subsystems for the pattern matching process. Scores from both LPC and MFCC based sub systems are fused at score level fusion using fixed weighting and adaptive weighting approaches. For fixed weighting, sum-rule method is employed while for the adaptive weighting, sum-rule based on weight adaptation and sum-rule with weight produced from fuzzy logic inference are executed. The performances of single, fixed and adaptive systems are then compared. Results: Experimental results show that at 40dB and 20dB SNR signals, EER performances of single systems are 1.1730 and 38.2695% respectively. Consequently, the EER performances are observed as 2.7355 and 1.1359% for the sum-rule based on weight adaptation and sum-rule with weight produced from Fuzzy Logic.

Virtual reality (VR) cloud gaming and 360\u00b0 video streaming are on the rise. With a VR headset, viewers can individually choose the perspective they see on the head-mounted display by turning their head, which creates the illusion of being in a virtual room. In this experimental study, we applied machine learning methods to anticipate future head rotations (a) from preceding head and eye motions, and (b) from the statistics of other spherical video viewers. Approach. Ten study participants watched each 3 1/3 hours of spherical video clips, while head and eye gaze motions were tracked, using a VR headset with a built-in eye tracker. Machine learning models were trained on the recorded head and gaze trajectories to predict (a) changes of head orientation and (b) the viewport from population statistics. Results. We assembled a dataset of head and gaze trajectories of spherical video viewers with great stimulus variability. We extracted statistical features from these time series and showed that a Support Vector Machine can classify the range of future head movements with a time horizon of up to one second with good accuracy. Even population statistics among only ten subjects show prediction success above chance level. %Both approaches resulted in a considerable amount of prediction success using head movements, but using gaze movement did not contribute to prediction performance in a meaningful way. Even basic machine learning models can successfully predict head movement and aspects thereof, while being naive to visual content. Significance. Viewport forecasting opens up various avenues to optimize VR rendering and transmission. While the viewer can see only a section of the surrounding 360\u00b0 sphere, the entire panorama has typically to be rendered and/or broadcast. The reason is rooted in the transmission delay, which has to be taken into account in order to avoid simulator sickness due to motion-to-photon latencies.

Emphysema quantification of these images was performed by measuring the percentage of low-attenuation lung area (LAA%). The following values related to HEQ were obtained: nb0 and nb1.

HEQ was more useful than LAA% for predicting visual score.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5444793", "pubmed_id": "28542398", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0178217", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2619002118", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6160609", "36874845", "205390277", "21367733", "43803241", "32679947", "23893827", "249631", "6456621", "10426919", "34089345", "16510097", "135939009", "4973577", "3001700", "15385067", "11616380", "884483", "13455892", "89141", "207720429", "25888240", "23903604", "207427874", "8369823"], "inbound_citations": ["30923322", "58947735"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23815206"}
