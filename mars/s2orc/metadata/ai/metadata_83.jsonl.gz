We propose in this work a method for segmentation and automatic recognition of white blood cells WBC (nucleus and cytoplasm) by selecting the relevant pixels for the pixels-based classification task. Different pixel selection algorithms are applied as a prior step to the pixel-based classification task where a comparative study of five pixel selection methods from three type group: condensation, edition and hybrid algorithms are performed. The proposed method comprises four phases: First, the expert will intervene on ten cytological images by labeling the regions of interest (ROI). The second is an image preprocessing with a characterization of each pixel of the image. The third step consists of applying pixel selection technique in the aim to reduce computational time and save the predictive power of the approach by pixel-wise segmentation. Finally, a pixel-based classification is performed by Random Forest based on a Region-growing approach from pixels of interest by the classifiers to extract the nucleus and cytoplasm. Our approach is evaluated on sixty cytological images; the obtained results are very promising and demonstrate the efficiency and power of segmentation by the Random Forest classifier in automatic segmentation.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3038884.3038890", "venue": "MedPRAI-2016", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2595801869", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["44971656", "12470146", "898475", "15553329", "14799233", "657686", "2970147", "6674796", "207738357", "89141", "12181206", "9139637", "52874011", "22850594", "120138631", "59916112", "21481695", "19865010", "29824202", "6692916", "14530050", "37224926", "42888031", "115774692"], "inbound_citations": ["211110337", "3796689", "57377082"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17473469"}

Instead of providing a hard decision, this scheme estimates the discrete probability distribution of the orientation.

The authors propose mutually incoherent pose bases which are implicit poselet co-occurrences and are learned by dictionary training to describe body pose. Poselets in a pose basis are not constrained in space and quantity, thus pose basis can describe body pose more flexibly than k-poselet. In their method, body pose in an image is represented by a sparse linear combination of pose bases because pose in an action varies while each image only captures a snapshot from a single viewpoint. In dictionary training, the challenge is how to stabilise the sparse representation which is the input of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for action recognition, because the original pose signal is ambiguous while dictionary is an over complete matrix. Their solution is to add cumulative coherence as penalty in objective function and induce pose bases become mutually incoherent. They evaluate the method on two popular datasets and experiment results show the pose representation has encouraging performance in action recognition. Furthermore, they empirically exploit the complementary role of the local pose feature with deep convolutional neural network features from holistic image.

However, traditional transformation based methods are domain-specific, the transformations are required to be carefully designed. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has been proposed to generate new samples which match the real data distribution. But directly using GAN generated samples in data augmentation faces the problems of label absence and uncertain data quality. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust data augmentation method using GAN generated samples. This method proposes a modified GAN to generate more diverse samples and label them with a soft distribution labeling method. With an improved stochastic gradient descent, all the data are used to train the final classifier. The experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets: MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10.

Many important parameters related to the diagnosis and treatments of such sleep disorders are simultaneously examined. This process is exhausting and time-consuming for experts and also requires experience; thus, it can cause difference of opinion among experts. Because of this, automatic sleep staging systems have been designed. In this study, a decision support system was developed to determine OSAS patients. In the developed decision support system, unlike in the available published literature, patient and healthy individual classification was performed using only the Pulse Transition Time (PTT) parameter rather than other parameters obtained from polysomnographic data like ECG (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalography), carbon dioxide measurement and EMG (Electromyography). The suggested method can perform feature extraction from PTT signals by means of a deep-learning method. AlexNet and VGG-16, which are two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, have been used for feature extraction.

In this paper we have enhanced the classification accuracy of a Mental workload task using a novel Fixed-Value Modified Beer-Lambert law (FV-MBLL) method. The hemodynamic changes corresponding to mental workload are measured from the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) using fNIRS. The concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (\u0394c ::: HbO ::: (t) and \u0394c ::: HbR ::: (t)) of 20 participants are recorded for mental workload and rest. The statistical analysis shows that data obtained from fNIRS is statistically significant with p 1.97 at confidence level of 0.95. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to discriminate mental math (coding) task from rest. Four features, namely mean, peak, slope and variance, are calculated on data processed through two different variants of Beer-lambert Law i.e., MBLL and FVMBLL for tissue blood flow. The optimal combination of the mean and peak values classified by SVM yielded the highest accuracy, 75%. This accuracy is further enhanced using the same feature combination, to 94% when those features are calculated using the novel algorithm FV-MBLL (with its optical density modelled form the first 4 sec stimulus data).

Moreover, the best method (\u2018DNN_PCM\u2019) performed significantly better at almost one standard deviation higher than the mean performance. Furthermore, Multi-task and PCM implementations were shown to improve performance over single task Deep Neural Networks. Conversely, target prediction performed almost two standard deviations under the mean performance. Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression performed around mean performance.

Previous work on transfer learning has focused on relatively restricted settings, where specific parts of the model are considered to be carried over between tasks. Recent work on covariate shift focuses on matching the marginal distributions on observations X across domains. Similarly, work on target/conditional shift focuses on matching marginal distributions on labels Y and adjusting conditional distributions P(X|Y ), such that P(X) can be matched across domains. However, covariate shift assumes that the support of test P(X) is contained in the support of training P(X), i.e., the training set is richer than the test set. Target/conditional shift makes a similar assumption for P(Y). Moreover, not much work on transfer learning has considered the case when a few labels in the test domain are available. Also little work has been done when all marginal and conditional distributions are allowed to change while the changes are smooth. In this paper, we consider a general case where both the support and the model change across domains. We transform both X and Y by a location-scale shift to achieve transfer between tasks.

Its earliest sign are red lesions, a general term that groups both microaneurysms and hemorrhages. In daily clinical practice, these lesions are manually detected by physicians using fundus photographs. However, this task is tedious and time consuming, and requires an intensive effort due to the small size of the lesions and their lack of contrast. Computer-assisted diagnosis of DR based on red lesion detection is being actively explored due to its improvement effects both in clinicians consistency and accuracy. Several methods for detecting red lesions have been proposed in the literature, most of them based on characterizing lesion candidates using hand crafted features, and classifying them into true or false positive detections. Deep learning based approaches, by contrast, are scarce in this domain due to the high expense of annotating the lesions manually. In this paper we propose a novel method for red lesion detection based on combining both deep learned and domain knowledge. Features learned by a CNN are augmented by incorporating hand crafted features. Such ensemble vector of descriptors is used afterwards to identify true lesion candidates using a Random Forest classifier. We empirically observed that combining both sources of information significantly improve results with respect to using each approach separately.

The goal of the MW algorithms is not to fully reproduce this MSG-SEVIRI cloud classification, as the MW observations do not have enough information on clouds to reach this level of precision. The objective is instead to obtain a stand-alone MW cloud mask and classification algorithm that can be used efficiently in forthcoming retrieval schemes of surface or atmospheric parameters from microwave satellite observations. This is an important tool over both ocean and land since the assimilation of the MW observations in the operational centers is independent from the other satellite observations. Clear sky and low, medium, and opaque-high clouds can be retrieved over ocean and land at a confidence level of more than 80%.

Inaccurate decision decision making is the challenge in the process and thus can\u2019t be permitted in healthcare industry. Data mining methodologies can be applied to large medical datasets to extract insights that aid healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In CVDs data mining, classification categorize a patient as having CVDs or free from it based on their similarities to previous examples of other patients. The classification accuracy rate is highly influenced by feature selection technique which eliminates features or attributes with practically no or little information from the dataset. Thus, feature selection and classification algorithms are considered as a concern of global \"combinatorial optimization\". The aim of this research is to investigate the optimal hybrid model of feature selection and classification algorithms in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases based on three performance metrics namely accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. It followed the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). The effect of hybrid feature selection and classification algorithms is examined on heart disease dataset acquired from University of California, Irvine - Machine Learning Repository (UCI-ML). The feature selection algorithm used is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The classification algorithms used are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest and C5.0 Decision Tree. The hybrid feature selection and classification algorithms are evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with the objective of achieving superior predictive performance. Results demonstrated that hybrid combination of PSO with SVM (PSO_SVM) achieves superior predictive performance over other models.

The latter represents each user search log as a graph whose nodes are queries, and uses the learned similarity function to weight edges between query pairs. Finally, search tasks are detected by clustering those queries in the graph which are connected by the strongest links, in fact by detecting the strongest connected components of the graph. To discriminate between \"strong\" and \"weak\" links also the GQC module entails a learning phase whose goal is to estimate the best threshold for pruning the edges of the graph. We discuss how the QSL module can be effectively implemented using Learning to Rank (L2R) techniques.

Moreover, lesions have high similarity with the healthy regions in terms of appearance. In this paper, we propose an accurate skin lesion segmentation model based on a modified conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We introduce a new block in the encoder of cGAN called factorized channel attention (FCA), which exploits both channel attention mechanism and residual 1-D kernel factorized convolution. The channel attention mechanism increases the discriminability between the lesion and non-lesion features by taking feature channel interdependencies into account. The 1-D factorized kernel block provides extra convolutions layers with a minimum number of parameters to reduce the computations of the higher-order convolutions. Besides, we use a multi-scale input strategy to encourage the development of filters which are scale-variant (i.e., constructing a scale-invariant representation). The proposed model is assessed on three skin challenge datasets: ISBI2016, ISBI2017, and ISIC2018.

Unlike existing methods, we propose to use a general classifier like Random Forests to recognize dynamic gestures. The temporal dimension is handled afterwards by majority voting in a sliding window over the consecutive predictions of the classifier. The gestures can have partially similar postures, such that the classifier will decide on the dissimilar postures. This brute-force classification strategy is permitted, because dynamic human gestures show sufficient dissimilar postures. Online continuous human gesture recognition can classify dynamic gestures in an early stage, which is a crucial advantage when controlling a game by automatic gesture recognition. Also, ground truth can be easily obtained, since all postures in a gesture get the same label, without any discretization into consecutive postures. This way, new gestures can be easily added, which is advantageous in adaptive game development. We evaluate our strategy by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on a self-captured stealth game gesture dataset and the publicly available Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 Kinect (MSRC-12) dataset. On the first dataset we achieve an excellent accuracy rate of 96.72%. Furthermore, we show that Random Forests perform better than Support Vector Machines.

Images can be thought of as points in some high-dimensional image space where each coordinate represents the intensity value of a single pixel. These manifold learning techniques have been successfully applied to simple image sets, such as handwriting data and a statue in a tightly controlled environment. However, they fail in the case of natural image sets, even those that only vary due to a single degree of freedom, such as a person walking or a heart beating. Parameterizing data sets such as these will allow for additional constraints on traditional computer vision problems such as segmentation and tracking.

Based on the new architecture, we present an FPGA hardware accelerator that achieves 459 times higher throughput than state-of-the-art. Visual recognition is a typical task on mobile platforms that usually use two scenarios either the task runs locally on embedded processor or offloaded to a cloud to be run on high performance machine. We show that computationally intensive visual recognition task benefits from being migrated to our dedicated hardware accelerator and outperforms high-performance CPU in terms of runtime, while consuming less energy than low power systems with negligible loss of recognition accuracy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/DATE.2017.7927210", "venue": "Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2017", "journal": "Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2017", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2611966310", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1915014", "1856462", "2118350", "7244356", "23977817", "19308998", "9901844", "12866582", "3356463", "16436072", "875592", "13381535"], "inbound_citations": ["204800861", "202734551", "203609314", "52095461", "49669175", "189824855", "209168366", "60440604", "52898990", "201848301", "211210239", "58006505", "59337238", "3400517", "211520621", "211298228", "29168452", "201103599", "189824708", "195223088"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22545155"}

Our insight is to model the forecasting problem at a higher level of abstraction. Specifically, we exploit human pose detectors as a free source of supervision and break the video forecasting problem into two discrete steps. First we explicitly model the high level structure of active objects in the scene---humans---and use a VAE to model the possible future movements of humans in the pose space. We then use the future poses generated as conditional information to a GAN to predict the future frames of the video in pixel space. By using the structured space of pose as an intermediate representation, we sidestep the problems that GANs have in generating video pixels directly.

Training sets of 10,000 however, simply cannot be managed with PC-based resources. For this reason most SVM implementations must contend with some kind of chunking process to train parts of the data at a time (10 chunks of 1000, for example, to learn the 10,000). Sequential and multi-threaded chunking methods provide a way to run the SVM on large datasets while retaining accuracy.

With the framework, we empirically compare a broad spectrum of off-the-shelf ECC designs for multilabel classification. The results not only demonstrate that RAKEL can be improved by applying some stronger ECC, but also show that the traditional binary relevance approach can be enhanced by learning more parity-checking labels. Our research on different ECCs also helps to understand the tradeoff between the strength of ECC and the hardness of the base learning tasks.

These problems are low contrast between the ridge and the valley pattern on fingerprint image, non-uniform lighting, motion blurriness and defocus, due to less depth of field of digital camera.

Preprocessing is an important step prior to fingerprint feature extraction and matching. In this paper we put our more emphasis on preprocessing so that the drawbacks stated earlier can be removed.

In addition to the HCV induction algorithm, this article also outlines some of the techniques for noise handling and discretization of numerical domains developed and implemented in the HCV (Version 2.0) software, and provides a performance comparison of HCV (Version 2.0) with other data mining algorithms ID3, C4.5, C4.5rules, and NewID in noisy and continuous domains. The empirical comparison shows that the rules generated by HCV (Version 2.0) are more compact than the decision trees or rules produced by ID3-like algorithms, and HCV's predicative accuracy is competitive with ID3-like algorithms. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(19980415)49:5<435::AID-ASI6>3.0.CO;2-R", "venue": "KDD 1998", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1986040934", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61151313"}

To overcome these challenges, we present a transfer methodology for a novel Bayesian classifier designed to distinguish between normal operations and faulty operations.

Patients with focal epilepsy show reorganization or plasticity of brain networks involved in cognitive functions, inducing \u2018atypical\u2019 (compared to \u2018typical\u2019 in healthy people) brain profiles. Moreover, some of these patients suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy, and they undergo surgery to stop seizures. The neurosurgeon should only remove the zone generating seizures and must preserve cognitive functions to avoid deficits. To preserve functions, one should know how they are represented in the patient\u2019s brain, which is in general different from that of healthy subjects. For this purpose, in the pre-surgical stage, robust and efficient methods are required to identify atypical from typical representations. Given the frequent location of regions generating seizures in the vicinity of language networks, one important function to be considered is language. The risk of language impairment after surgery is determined pre-surgically by mapping language networks. In clinical settings, cognitive mapping is classically performed with fMRI. The fMRI analyses allowing the identification of atypical patterns of language networks in patients are not sufficiently robust and require additional statistic approaches. In this study, we report the use of a statistical nonlinear machine learning classification, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, to identify atypical patterns and classify 55 participants as healthy subjects or patients with epilepsy. XGBoost analyses were based on neurophysiological features in five language regions (three frontal and two temporal) in both hemispheres and activated with fMRI for a phonological (PHONO) and a semantic (SEM) language task. These features were combined into 135 cognitively plausible subsets and further submitted to selection and binary classification. Classification performance was scored with the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Our results showed that the subset SEM_LH BA_47-21 (left fronto-temporal activation induced by the SEM task) provided the best discrimination between the two groups (AUC of 91 \u00b1 5%).

Since the composition of mineral salts and discharge affects the TDS of water, it is important to understand the relationships of mineral salts composition with TDS. ::: Materials and Methods: In this study, methods of artificial neural networks with five different training algorithm,Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), Fletcher Conjugate Gradient (CGF), One Step Secant (OSS) and Gradient descent with adaptive learning rate backpropagation(GDA)algorithm and adaptive Neurofuzzy inference system based on Subtractive Clustering were used to model water quality properties of Zarrineh River Basin, to be developed in total dissolved solids prediction. ANN and ANFIS program code were written in MATLAB language. Here, the ANN with one hidden layer was used and the hidden nodes\u2019 number was determined using trial and error. Different activation functions (logarithm sigmoid, tangent sigmoid and linear) were tried for the hidden and output nodes. Therefore, water quality data from seven hydrometer stationswere used during the statistical period of 18years (1993-2010).In this research, the study period was divided into two periods of dry and wet flow, and then in a preliminary statistical analysis, the main parameters affecting the estimation of the TDS are determined and isused for modeling. 75% of data are used for remaining and 25% of the data are used for evaluation of the model, randomly. In this paper, three statistical evaluation criteria, correlation coefficient (R), the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to assess models\u2019 performances. ::: Results and Discussion: By applying correlation coefficients method between the parameters of water quality and discharge with total dissolved solid in two periods, wet and dry periods, the significant (at 95% level) variables entered into the model were Q, HCO3., Cl, So4, Ca, Na and Mg. The optimal ANN (LM) architecture used in this study consists of an input layer with seven inputs, one hidden and output layer with two and five neurons for dry and wet periods, respectively. Similar ANN(LM), ANFIS-SC model had the best performance. It is clear that the ANFIS with 0/72 and 0/58 radii value has the highest R and the lowest RMSE for dry and wet periods, respectively. Comparing the ANFIS-SC estimations with the measured data for the test stage demonstrates a high generalization capacity of the model, with relatively low error and high correlation. From the scatter plots it is obviously seen that the ANFIS-SC predictions are closer to the corresponding measured TDS than other models in two periods. As seen from the best straight line equations (assume the equation as y=ax) in the scatter plots that the coefficient for ANFIS-SC is closer to 1 than other models. In addition ANFIS-SC performancedwith the correlation coefficients in dry and wet periods, respectively 0.975 , 0.969 and with Root-mean-square errors, respectively 34.41 , 23.85 in order to predict dissolved solids (TDS) in the rivers of Zarrineh River Basin. The obtained results showed the efficiency of the applied models in simulating the nonlinear behavior of TDS variations in terms of performance indices. The results are also tested by using t test for verifying the robustness of the models at 99% significance level. Comparison results indicated that the poorest model in TDS simulation was ANN-GDAin dry and wet periods, especially in test period. The observed relationship between residuals and model computed TDS values shows complete independence and random distribution. It is further supported by the respective correlations for ANFIS-SC models (R2 = 0.0012 for dry period and R2 = 0.0214 for wet period) which are negligible small. Plots of the residuals versus model computed values can be more informative regarding model fitting to a data set. If the residuals appear to behave randomly it suggests that the model fits the data well. On the other hand, if non- random distribution is evident in the residuals, the model does not fit the data adequately. On the base of these results, we propose ANFIS-SC and ANN (LM) methods as effective tools for the computation of total dissolved solids in river water, respectively. ::: Conclusion: It can be concluded that the ANN with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm and ANFIS-SC models can be considered as promising tools for forecasting TDS values, based on water quality parameters. With attention to the aim of current research that is presenting the feasibility of artificial intelligence techniques for modeling TDS values, it is notable that the results presented in this paper are for research purpose and applying the abstained results for real-world needs some complicated steps and building artificial intelligences methods, based on complete data and parameters maybe affected the TDS values", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.22067/jsw.v30i6.22357", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2588436269,2338835725", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:75069380"}

The user becomes aware of the blur only after viewing pictures on a higher resolution display. The causes of motion blur are object movement, camera shake, or any relative speed between the object and the camera. To avoid this problem, many anti-shaking or image stabilization techniques have been developed. However, a detecting mechanism for motion blur is still lacking. Hence, this paper will address some possible solutions and evaluate their performance. The purpose of a motion blur detector is to classify the digital image as blurred or clear and inform users. This function can supply information for users to decide to retake the picture immediately instead of turning the camera to playback mode to check. For achieving higher error tolerance and adaptation to different image capturing circumstances, a machine learning technique is employed. Different digital image processing schemes are explored to find the most discriminative features. Among the many machine techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been implemented. To achieve the best performance for SVM, inherent information -extraction from motion blurred images is extremely important.

However, there are currently few models of autism that bridge observations between the biological, environmental, and behavioral sciences.

Connectionist, neural network models of learning and behavioral impairments in autism have also been described (Cohen, 2007). ::: ::: Following these leads elements of a constructivist and connectionist model have been proposed to explain why the impairment of joint attention development is a primary and cardinal behavioral feature of autism (Mundy, 2003; Mundy & Newell, 2007). The goal of this paper is to continue the development of this model in the context of a review of evidence for the central role of joint attention in autism and to describe how the model contributes to an integration of biological and behavioral phenomenon associated with this disorder. In particular, joint attention may be best conceived as an essential form of parallel and distributed social information processing that is essential to human learning. Examples of how this conceptualization fosters theoretical links between the specific social symptoms of autism with genetic, neurodevelopmental, executive and social-cognitive processes are described.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2715157", "pubmed_id": "19358304", "doi": "10.1002/aur.61", "venue": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "journal": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1997554049", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["144796824", "2824162", "140466438", "145117406", "45808562", "38829507", "6347498", "29019855", "11399145", "12350259", "4820744", "53199966", "140783771", "145343420", "8739", "12171656", "145615503", "45507997", "11129620", "21037797", "1652980", "10361568", "19807048", "10387880", "22435326", "9492793", "15997449", "5301548", "71769168", "18018034", "7970237", "15278076", "141345781", "29598795", "8103092", "8213107", "31875833", "569781", "1416314", "151807547", "12580222", "35349365", "1349762", "38371802", "5735246", "1246968", "24976189", "207688505", "145806576", "23243452", "17511182", "45782605", "1010967", "12111447", "18986350", "45120205", "12555754", "13758688", "684322", "7157186", "19029386", "7301474", "147599499", "2556627", "145519136", "12661812", "16252007", "24952401", "8153426", "143298603", "26490481", "10949213", "6009838", "12436073", "36336416", "8826493", "30290811", "15687874", "33333880", "45961333", "144164002", "11856573", "21440104", "45838114", "5712760", "144433549", "3103331", "33528756", "144662888", "12362364", "31438995", "210429064", "14612956", "144035492", "151334760", "14754779", "13988273", "142707507", "14746104", "15269399", "26360555", "15001718", "8684348"], "inbound_citations": ["813403", "10306854", "17283564", "6174228", "215047797", "1891607", "215478647", "205271828", "8503337", "73564037", "12297474", "54114995", "52878197", "1002659", "207158975", "82689", "7403707", "20988397", "6166109", "16186769", "14229256", "215026175", "7955909", "12006061", "145297119", "4094679", "15819777", "462661", "8716961", "206715766", "55888276", "8784601", "211481777", "209436638", "33732085", "23232123", "203912096", "1140136", "151409471", "188585746", "25103481", "14880308", "4946009", "3969347", "10316999", "3903279", "25443978", "151392085", "12110239", "25407074", "152252769", "13458422", "33660781", "3707555", "1598320", "46817100", "149206451", "16076979", "3864894", "208291343", "16344792", "7822102", "205107020", "36774090", "49727324", "19123612", "32626833", "22377252", "14629947", "29953167", "54462899", "1719002", "16134546", "215326678", "17214984", "56170958", "211241267", "13186010", "16357221", "17858551", "15583776", "12642905", "13982077", "5538281", "6240366", "59252595", "4914928", "45240711", "146253353", "17810170", "215489104", "23289827", "14620977", "10773384", "73708036", "209391310", "535415", "121153298", "9174246", "62842390", "144334473", "2963745", "55313833", "18964484", "50820550", "5886779", "4899413", "10011877", "8728185"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16338647"}

The two-class approach reduces the problem to Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification, where we artificially generate a second class of data points according to a uniform distribution. The simple approach to generating the uniform data suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we (1) describe the reduction of MV-set estimation to NP classification, (2) devise improved methods for generating artificial uniform data for the two-class approach, (3) advocate a new performance measure for systematic comparison of MV-set algorithms, and (4) establish a set of benchmark experiments to serve as a point of reference for future MV-set algorithms. We find that, in general, the two-class method performs more reliably.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MLSP.2006.275565", "venue": "2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing", "journal": "2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2538491138", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["123651633", "2110475", "2432283", "547095", "2302699", "6323273", "12757517", "669581", "11860755", "13565206", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["15498645", "14823981", "9196479", "7873481", "4709065", "12522725", "117342955", "19302629", "7449671", "117680690", "7095754"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14346015"}

To be able to properly utilize such multi-source medical claim data, we propose an approach that represents medical codes from different ontologies in the same vector space.

The new approach was evaluated on the code cross-reference problem, which aims at identifying similar codes across different ontologies.

The differences in drainage networks help in distinguishing between various network types and understanding natural processes. The aim of this study is to develop a new and simple classification method for determining various river network types based on a critical parameter of river networks, the tributary junction angle. For the analysis, fifty river networks are predefined as five network types (dendritic, parallel, pinnate, rectangular, and trellis networks). The tributary junction angles are calculated for each drainage network type, and then the beta distribution is employed to identify distributional characteristics of the junction angles. Parameter estimates of the beta distribution are used to classify different river networks because the estimates provide classified features of natural processes. Support Vector Machines are then utilized to determine the network classification with the parameter estimates. Furthermore, the results are validated against classification using a different approach with commonly used statistics. The proposed method can clearly distinguish between different network types, except for the rectangular and trellis types. In addition, parameter estimates of the beta distribution indicate differences in drainage network types more clearly than the statistics of the angles.

While words in every natural language may manifest morphological ambiguity, solving the problem of morphological disambiguation presents different challenges for different languages. In this work, we present an approach to this problem using Conditional Random Fields, a statistical framework that elegantly avoids data sparseness problems arising from the large vocabulary and tag set sizes, a characteristic of Turkish language.

In [14] and [15] we presented two EA models, namely DAFHEA (Dynamic Approximate Fitness based Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm) and DAFHEA-II respectively. The original DAFHEA framework [14] reduces computation time by controlled use of meta-models generated by Support Vector Machine regression to partly replace actual fitness evaluation by estimation. DAFHEA-II [15] is an enhancement to the original framework in that it can be applied to problems that involve uncertainty.

Predicting WPREs is of vital importance given that they can damage the turbines in a wind farm. In contrast to previous binary approaches (ramp versus non-ramp), a three-class prediction is proposed in this paper by considering: negative ramp, non-ramp and positive ramp, where the natural order of the events is clear. The independent variables used for prediction include past ramp function values and meteorological data obtained from physical models (reanalysis data). The proposed methodology is based on reservoir computing and an over-sampling process for alleviating the high degree of unbalance of the dataset (non-ramp events are much more frequent than ramps). The reservoir computing model is a modified echo state network composed by: a recurrent neural network layer, a nonlinear kernel mapping and an ordinal logistic regression, in such a way that the order of the classes can be exploited. The standard synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is applied to the reservoir activations, given that the direct application over the input variables would damage its temporal structure. The performance of this proposal is compared to the original dataset (without over-sampling) and to nominal logistic regression, and the results obtained with the oversampled dataset and ordinal logistic regression are found to be more robust.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-59153-7_61", "venue": "IWANN", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2616292835", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["39674671", "52902641"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35259898"}

In the testing phase, a grid is extracted from the query image and every patch is transformed into a binary sparse representation using the dictionary, creating a fingerprint of the face.

Broad range of techniques for fusion of color and texture descriptors were analyzed, belonging to two approaches \u2013 early fusion and late fusion. Early fusion approach combines descriptors during the extraction phase, while late fusion is based on combining of classification results of independent classifiers. An efficient algorithm for extraction of a compact image descriptor based on early fusion of texture and color information, is proposed in the thesis. Experimental evaluation of the algorithm demonstrated a good compromise between efficiency and accuracy of classification results. ::: Research on the late fusion approach was focused on artificial neural networks and a recently introduced algorithm for extremly fast training of neural networks denoted as Extreme Learning Machines - ELM. Main disadvantages of ELM are insufficient stability and limited accuracy of results. To overcome these problems, a technique for combining results of multiple ELM-s into a single classifier is proposed, based on probability sum rules. The created ensemble of ELM-s has demonstrated significiant improvement of accuracy and stability of results, compared with an individual ELM. ::: In order to additionaly improve classification accuracy, a novel hierarchical method for late fusion of multiple complementary descriptors by using ELM classifiers, is proposed in the thesis. In the first phase of the proposed method, a separate ensemble of ELM classifiers is trained for every single descriptor. In the second phase, an additional ELM-based classifier is introduced to learn the optimal combination of descriptors for every category.

The novelty of the proposed technique is to design auto-encoders that make use of data structures to learn enhanced sparse data representations. The data structure is borrowed from the Manifold Learning field, that is data are supposed to be sampled from smooth manifolds, which are here represented by graphs of proximities of the input data. As a consequence, the proposed auto-encoders finds sparse data representations that are quite robust w.r.t. perturbations. The model is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. However, it can be decomposed into iterative sub-optimization problems that are convex and for which well-posed iterative schemes are provided in the context of the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding (FISTA) framework.

Accordingly, effectively detecting fraud reviews is becoming a critical task for cybersecurity. Although various efforts have been put on fraud review detection, they may fail in the case of cold-start where a review is posted by a new user who just pops up on social media. The main reason lies in lacking sufficient historical information of the new user. Recently, limited research has been conducted on fraud review detection with the cold-start problem, in which, however, advanced methods either ignore complex collaborative review manipulations or overlook fraud-related characteristics. As a result, they may easily be deceived by camouflage fraudsters and have low detection precision. This paper presents a novel socially-attentive user representation learning method for fraud review detection with the cold-start problem, namely SATURN, which leverages the fraud-related user reviewing behavior with comprehensive user social couplings for cold-start fraud review detection. SATURN jointly embeds user-item-attitude-review entities relations, explicit and implicit hierarchical social couplings, and fraud-related information into a user vector representation space, in which the fraud-related representation of a new user can be effectively inferred according to the learned socially-attentive entities relation. Subsequently, SATURN effectively detects fraud reviews with the cold-start problem in its learned representation space. Extensive experiments on four large real-world data sets demonstrate SATURN significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art and two baseline competitors in terms of both general and cold-start fraud review detection tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-15-0105-0_6", "venue": "Theoretical Computer Science", "journal": "Theoretical Computer Science", "mag_id": "2970981729", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202772072"}

While doing so, the upper bound on the generalization error is minimized. Thus, SVM based classifiers are expected to have more generalization capability than neural networks.

CNPO uses a pore vector containing 0 or 1 to extract the essential FSs with high contribution based on the thought of cell nuclear pore selection mechanism. This model can be used to identify the continuous parameter based on the IFSs without massive OSs and time-consuming work. Two experiments are used to validate the proposed model, and one case is used to illustrate the practical value in the real engineer field.

This classification result is also compared with that obtained by replacing the base classifier by LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), kNN (k Nearest Neighbor) and SVM (Support Vector Machine). The uniqueness of this research is in the development, implementation and application of three main ideas: (1) the hybrid ensemble method, which aims to improve classification accuracy, (2) a pseudo-margin criterion for assessing the quality of predictions and (3) an automatic feature reduction method using results drawn from Random Forests. An additional point-density analysis is performed to study the influence of decreased point density on classification accuracy results. By using Random Forests as the base classifier, the average classification accuracies for the geometric classifier and vertical profile classifier are 88.0% and 88.8%, respectively, with improvement to 91.2% using the ensemble method.

But it is well known that this type of networks has various limitations like the amount of disposable energy. Indeed, once a sensor node exhausts its resources, it will be dropped from the network, stopping so to forward information about maybe relevant features towards the sink. This will result in broken links and data loss which impacts the diagnostic accuracy at the sink level. It is therefore important to keep the network's monitoring service as long as possible by preserving the energy held by the nodes. As packet transfer consumes the highest amount of energy comparing to other activities in the network, various topologies are usually implemented in wireless sensor networks to increase the network lifetime. In this paper, we emphasize that it is more difficult to perform a good diagnostic when data are gathered by a wireless sensor network instead of a wired one, due to broken links and data loss on the one hand, and deployed network topologies on the other hand. Three strategies are considered to reduce packet transfers: (1) sensor nodes send directly their data to the sink, (2) nodes are divided by clusters, and the cluster heads send the average of their clusters directly to the sink, and (3) averaged data are sent from cluster heads to cluster heads in a hop-by-hop mode, leading to an avalanche of averages. Their impact on the diagnostic accuracy is then evaluated. We show that the use of random forests is relevant for diagnostics when data are aggregated through the network and when sensors stop to transmit their values when their batteries are emptied. This relevance is discussed qualitatively and evaluated numerically by comparing the random forests performance to state-of-the-art PHM approaches, namely: basic bagging of decision trees, support vector machine, multinomial naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting. Finally, a way to couple the two best methods, namely the random forests and the gradient boosting, is proposed by finding the best hyperparameters of the former by using the latter.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compind.2018.10.006", "venue": "Comput.

In contrast, limited attempt has been made to understand post-transcriptional modifications. Recently it has been shown that tRNA modifications play direct role in the genome structure and codon usage. This study is an attempt to understand kingdom-wise tRNA modifications particularly uridine modifications (UMs), as majority of modifications are uridine-derived.ResultsA three-steps strategy has been applied to develop an efficient method for the prediction of UMs. In the first step, we developed a common prediction model for all the kingdoms using a dataset from MODOMICS-2008. Support Vector Machine (SVM) based prediction models were developed and evaluated by five-fold cross-validation technique. Different approaches were applied and found that a hybrid approach of binary and structural information achieved highest Area under the curve (AUC) of 0.936. In the second step, we used newly added tRNA sequences (as independent dataset) of MODOMICS-2012 for the kingdom-wise prediction performance evaluation of previously developed (in the first step) common model and achieved performances between the AUC of 0.910 to 0.949. In the third and last step, we used different datasets from MODOMICS-2012 for the kingdom-wise individual prediction models development and achieved performances between the AUC of 0.915 to 0.987.ConclusionsThe hybrid approach is efficient not only to predict kingdom-wise modifications but also to classify them into two most prominent UMs: Pseudouridine (Y) and Dihydrouridine (D).

A homemade machine-learning classifier was developed to analyze volume and dose variations of parotid glands (PG). Using deformable image registration (DIR) and GPU, patients' conditions were analyzed automatically. Support Vector Machines (SVM) was used for time-series evaluation. \"Inadequate\" class identified patients that might benefit from replanning. Double-blind evaluation by two radiation oncologists (ROs) was carried out to validate day/week selected for re-planning by the classifier. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The cohort was affected by PG mean reduction of 23.7\u00b18.8%. During the first 3weeks, 86.7% cases show PG deformation aligned with predefined tolerance, thus not requiring re-planning. From 4th week, an increased number of pts would potentially benefit from re-planning: a mean of 58% of cases, with an inter-center variability of 8.3%, showed \"inadequate\" conditions. 11% of cases showed \"bias\" due to DIR and script failure; 6% showed \"warning\" output due to potential positioning issues. Comparing re-planning suggested by tool with recommended by ROs, the 4th week seems the most favorable time in 70% cases. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: SVM and decision-making tool was applied to overcome ART challenges. Pts would benefit from ART and ideal time for re-planning intervention was identified in this retrospective analysis.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27765457", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmp.2016.10.005", "venue": "Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics", "journal": "Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics", "mag_id": "2516205961", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202761364", "214859023", "52079948", "49563007", "108379974", "56492651", "4890871", "162171199", "164887589", "53106436"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21183097"}

Any text can be classified by comparing the distance of clustering centers or by SVM. If the text nears one cluster center of a category and far away from all the cluster centers of other categories, UC can classify it rightly with high possibility, otherwise SVM is employed to decide the category it belongs.

While deep neural network approaches have recently demonstrated remarkable results in terms of synthesis quality, they still come at considerable computational costs (minutes of run-time for low-res images). Our paper addresses this efficiency issue. Instead of a numerical deconvolution in previous work, we precompute a feed-forward, strided convolutional network that captures the feature statistics of Markovian patches and is able to directly generate outputs of arbitrary dimensions. Such network can directly decode brown noise to realistic texture, or photos to artistic paintings. With adversarial training, we obtain quality comparable to recent neural texture synthesis methods. As no optimization is required at generation time, our run-time performance (0.25 M pixel images at 25 Hz) surpasses previous neural texture synthesizers by a significant margin (at least 500 times faster). We apply this idea to texture synthesis, style transfer, and video stylization.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1604.04382", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi":

Although the potential of alternative approaches such as machine learning (ML) to identify robust neuroanatomic correlates of psychiatric disease has long been acknowledged, few studies have attempted to evaluate the abilities of ML to identify structural brain abnormalities associated with ASD. Here we use a sample of 110 ASD patients and 83 typically developing (TD) volunteers (95 females) to assess the suitability of support vector machines (SVMs, a robust type of ML) as an alternative to standard statistical inference for identifying structural brain features which can reliably distinguish ASD patients from TD subjects of either sex, thereby facilitating the study of the interaction between ASD diagnosis and sex. We find that SVMs can perform these tasks with high accuracy and that the neuroanatomic correlates of ASD identified using SVMs overlap substantially with those found using conventional statistical methods. Our results confirm and establish SVMs as powerful ML tools for the study of ASD-related structural brain abnormalities.

These POS taggers implement the process of assigning the correct PoS (noun, verb, adjective, adverb \u2026) to each word of the sentence. PoS taggers are developed by modeling the morphosyntactic structure of natural language text. In this paper, we tried to improve the accuracy of existing Amazigh POS taggers using a voting algorithm.

The method was evaluated using two highresolution SPOT 5 satellite images, taken during the successive summers of 2005 and 2006, with a similar azimuth and elevation of the sun. Two supervised algorithms have been tested: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Mahalanobis distance. The SVM classifier is compared with the Mahalanobis classifier. The outcome is that the SVM results in an image that more clearly shows changes. The evaluation is accomplished visually, using ROC curves. The NDVI index is also considered, since it is the usual means of studying vegetation in satellite images.

In this work, a procedure that is able to estimate the RUL of equipment directly from sensor values without the need for estimating degradation states or a failure threshold is developed. A direct relation between sensor values or health indicators is modeled using a support vector regression. Using this procedure, the RUL can be estimated at any time instant of the degradation process. In addition, an offline wrapper variable selection is applied before training the prediction model. This step has a positive impact on the accuracy of the prediction while reducing the computational time compared to existing indirect RUL prediction methods.

In order to learn an appropriate distance metric, most of existing metric learning approaches restrict the learned distances between similar pairs to be smaller than a given lower bound, while the learned distances between dissimilar pairs are required to be larger than a given upper bound. However, the learned metrics may not perform well by leveraging the fixed bounds, especially when the data distributions are complex in practical applications. Besides, most methods attempt to learn a distance metric with a full rank matrix transformation from the given training data, which is not only inefficient to compute but also prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Metric Learning with the Low Rank Constraint (AML-LR) method, which restricts the learned distances between examples of pairs using adaptive bounds and meanwhile the rank of the learned matrix is minimized. Therefore, the learned metric is adaptive to different data distributions and robust to avoid overfitting. To solve the proposed optimization problem efficiently, we present an effective optimization algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method.

Although significant progress has been made on this problem in recent years, several important challenges remain, such as how to properly capture temporal information in evolving networks. In practice, most networks are continually evolving. Some networks only add new edges or nodes such as authorship networks, while others support removal of nodes or edges such as internet data routing. If patterns exist in the changes of the network structure, we can better understand the relationships between nodes and the evolution of the network, which can be further leveraged to learn node representations with more meaningful information. In this paper, we propose the Embedding via Historical Neighborhoods Aggregation (EHNA) algorithm. More specifically, we first propose a temporal random walk that can identify relevant nodes in historical neighborhoods which have impact on edge formations. Then we apply a deep learning model which uses a custom attention mechanism to induce node embeddings that directly capture temporal information in the underlying feature representation.

Given a face image, we first extract pixel difference vectors (PDV) in local patches, and learn a discriminative mapping in an unsupervised manner to project each pixel difference vector into a context-aware binary vector. Then, we perform clustering on the learned binary codes to construct a codebook, and extract a histogram feature for each face image with the learned codebook as the final representation. In order to exploit local information from different scales, we propose a context-aware local binary multi-scale feature learning (CA-LBMFL) method to jointly learn multiple projection matrices for face representation. To make the proposed methods applicable for heterogeneous face recognition, we present a coupled CA-LBFL (C-CA-LBFL) method and a coupled CA-LBMFL (C-CA-LBMFL) method to reduce the modality gap of corresponding heterogeneous faces in the feature level, respectively.

There are multiple remote sensing classification methods, including a suite of nonparametric classifiers such as decision-tree (DT), rule-based (RB), and random forest (RF). High-resolution satellite imagery can provide more specificity to the classified end product, and ancillary data layers such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and hydrogeomorphic layers such as distance-to-a-stream can be coupled to improve overall accuracy (OA) in wetland studies. In this paper, we contrast three nonparametric machine-learning algorithms (DT, RB, and RF) using a large field-based dataset (n = 228) from the Selenga River Delta of Lake Baikal, Russia. We also explore the use of ancillary data layers selected to improve OA, with a goal of providing end users with a recommended classifier to use and the most parsimonious suite of input parameters for classifying wetland-dominated landscapes. Though all classifiers appeared suitable, the RF classification outperformed both the DT and RB methods, achieving OA >81%. Including a texture metric (homogeneity) substantially improved the classification OA. However, including vegetation/soil/water metrics (based on WorldView-2 band combinations), hydrogeomorphic data layers, and elevation data layers to increase the descriptive content of the input parameters surprisingly did not markedly improve the OA. We conclude that, in most cases, RF should be the classifier of choice. The potential exception to this recommendation is under the circumstance where the end user requires narrative rules to best manage his or her resource.

We propose a novel system to tackle this challenge, which leverages redundancy in tweets by conducting two-stage NER for multiple similar tweets. Particularly, it first pre-labels each tweet using a sequential labeler based on the linear Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model. Then it clusters tweets to put tweets with similar content into the same group. Finally, for each cluster it refines the labels of each tweet using an enhanced CRF model that incorporates the cluster level information, i.e., the labels of the current word and its neighboring words across all tweets in the cluster. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated dataset, and show that our method boosts the F1 of the baseline without collectively labeling from 75.4% to 82.5%.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ipm.2012.05.006", "venue": "Inf.

The proposed method uses a fidelity-embedded generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn a denoising function from unpaired training data of low-dose CT (LDCT) and standard-dose CT (SDCT) images, where the denoising function is the optimal generator in the GAN framework. This paper analyzes the f-GAN objective to derive a suitable generator that is optimized by minimizing a weighted sum of two losses: the Kullback-Leibler divergence between an SDCT data distribution and a generated distribution, and the $\\ell _{2}$ loss between the LDCT image and the corresponding generated images (or denoised image). The computed generator reflects the prior belief about SDCT data distribution through training. We observed that the proposed method allows the preservation of fine anomalous features while eliminating noise. The experimental results show that the proposed deep-learning method with unpaired datasets performs comparably to a method using paired datasets.

The aims of this study are: to develop an algorithm for automatic identification of intended jogging periods; and to assess whether the identification performance is improved when using two accelerometers at the hip and ankle, compared to when using only one at either position. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: The study used diarized jogging periods and the corresponding accelerometer data from thirty-nine, 15-year-old adolescents, collected under field conditions, as part of the GINIplus study. The data was obtained from two accelerometers placed at the hip and ankle. Automated feature engineering technique was performed to extract features from the raw accelerometer readings and to select a subset of the most significant features. Four machine learning algorithms were used for classification: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees. Classification was performed using only data from the hip accelerometer, using only data from ankle accelerometer and using data from both accelerometers. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: The reported jogging periods were verified by visual inspection and used as golden standard. After the feature selection and tuning of the classification algorithms, all options provided a classification accuracy of at least 0.99, independent of the applied segmentation strategy with sliding windows of either 60s or 180s. The best matching ratio, i.e. the length of correctly identified jogging periods related to the total time including the missed ones, was up to 0.875. It could be additionally improved up to 0.967 by application of post-classification rules, which considered the duration of breaks and jogging periods. There was no obvious benefit of using two accelerometers, rather almost the same performance could be achieved from either accelerometer position. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Machine learning techniques can be used for automatic activity recognition, as they provide very accurate activity recognition, significantly more accurate than when keeping a diary. Identification of jogging periods in adolescents can be performed using only one accelerometer. Performance-wise there is no significant benefit from using accelerometers on both locations.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5589162", "pubmed_id": "28880923", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0184216", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2752859048", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8186207", "215587597", "26082693", "4441603", "214966550", "9538733", "34900072", "41192596", "23092162", "17904649", "21808448", "6940918", "15410762", "214951930", "19856407", "215183110", "33948720", "5874130", "4062018", "10707611", "13034078", "2112296", "28254656", "16508014", "5423074", "207110862", "20127902", "31919914", "5717605", "215223404", "23616641", "2443266", "379259", "30459832", "16907816", "10659969", "7975492", "198489226", "89141", "15137276", "52874011", "3139622", "5831858", "9059295", "15211534", "14279120", "16739862", "800249", "122499007", "122626010", "119549152", "6499936", "14264834", "14623802", "13968480"], "inbound_citations": ["201967170", "49557195", "204246469", "210845712", "198171593", "203610818", "47004217", "52958908"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11169894"}

In viticulture, there are several applications where bud detection in vineyard images is a necessary task, susceptible of being automated through the use of computer vision methods. A common and effective family of visual detection algorithms are the scanning-window type, that slide a (usually) fixed size window along the original image, classifying each resulting windowed-patch as containing or not containing the target object. The simplicity of these algorithms finds its most challenging aspect in the classification stage. Interested in grapevine buds detection in natural field conditions, this paper presents a classification method for images of grapevine buds ranging 1001600 pixels in diameter, captured in outdoor, under natural field conditions, in winter (i.e., no grape bunches, very few leaves, and dormant buds), without artificial background, and with minimum equipment requirements. The proposed method uses well-known computer vision technologies: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform for calculating low-level features, Bag of Features for building an image descriptor, and Support Vector Machines for training a classifier. When evaluated over images containing buds of at least 100 pixels in diameter, the approach achieves a recall higher than 0.9 and a precision of 0.86 over all windowed-patches covering the whole bud and down to 60% of it, and scaled up to window patches containing a proportion of 2080% of bud versus background pixels.

Data on smallholder maize systems are currently sparse, but satellite remote sensing offers promise for accelerating learning about these systems. Here we document the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build \u201cwall-to-wall\u201d 10 m resolution maps of (i) cropland presence, (ii) maize presence, and (iii) maize yields for the main 2017 maize season in Kenya and Tanzania. Mapping these outcomes at this scale is extremely challenging because of very heterogeneous landscapes, lack of cloud-free satellite imagery, and the low quantity of quality ground-based data in these regions. First, we computed seasonal median composites of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 optical reflectance measures for each pixel in the region, and used them to build both crop/non-crop and maize/non-maize Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Several thousand crop/non-crop labels were collected through an in-house GEE labeler, and thousands of crop type labels from the 2015\u20132017 growing seasons were obtained from various sources. Results show that the crop/non-crop classifier successfully identified cropland with over 85% out-of-sample accuracy in both countries, with Sentinel-1 being particularly useful for prediction. Among the cropped pixels, the maize/non-maize classier had an accuracy of 79% in Tanzania and 63% in Kenya. To map maize yields, we build on past work using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) that utilizes simulations from a crop model to train a regression that predicts yields from observations. Here we advance past approaches by (i) grouping simulations by Global Agro-Environmental Stratification (GAES) zones across the two countries, in order to account for landscape heterogeneity, (ii) utilizing gridded datasets on soil and sowing and harvest dates to setup model simulations in a scalable way; and (iii) utilizing all available satellite observations during the growing season in a parsimonious way by using harmonic regression fits implemented in GEE. SCYM estimates were able to capture about 50% of the variation in the yields at the district level in Western Kenya as measured by objective ground-based crop cuts. Finally, we illustrated the utility of our yield maps with two case studies. First, we document the magnitude and interannual variability of spatial heterogeneity of yields in each district, and how it varies for different parts of the region. Second, we combine our estimates with recently released soil databases in the region to investigate the most important soil constraints in the region. Soil factors explain a high fraction (72%) of variation in predicted yields, with the predominant factor being soil nitrogen levels. Overall, this study illustrates the power of combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the GEE platform, and advanced classification and yield mapping algorithms to advance understanding of smallholder agricultural systems.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2019.04.016", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2943472941", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["11996043", "134082344", "133620065", "58374281", "83954568", "4588626", "49576724", "84537683", "134409674", "154484523", "44012640", "8276976", "85640853", "122840088", "134638494", "20020173", "29062854", "17021916", "4104092", "131674878", "20692766", "26311709", "158266155", "27729513", "90183230", "1269438", "55462167", "44215641", "84338871", "127279286", "155667116", "214872368", "46906047", "132942657", "8950163", "157613730", "17077557", "53369074", "214936383", "6173885", "154392069", "129560440", "11485159"], "inbound_citations": ["210843374", "210843299", "210843190", "210149664", "210999911", "204244316"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:148566646"}

First, we show that with a small number M of random projections of sample points in \u211dN belonging to an unknown K-dimensional Euclidean manifold, the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the sample set can be estimated to high accuracy. Second, we rigorously prove that using only this set of random projections, we can estimate the structure of the underlying manifold.

To make the network handle huge amounts of points, we operate contours in the parametric space rather than raw point space, associated with a parametric chamfer distance.

Typically L2-norm or L1-norm is adopted as a regularization term in SVMs, while other norm-based SVMs, for example, the L0-norm SVM or even the L(infinity)-norm SVM, are rarely seen in the literature. The major reason is that L0-norm describes a discontinuous and nonconvex term, leading to a combinatorially NP-hard optimization problem. In this letter, motivated by Bayesian learning, we propose a novel framework that can implement arbitrary norm-based SVMs in polynomial time. One significant feature of this framework is that only a sequence of sequential minimal optimization problems needs to be solved, thus making it practical in many real applications. The proposed framework is important in the sense that Bayesian priors can be efficiently plugged into most learning methods without knowing the explicit form. Hence, this builds a connection between Bayesian learning and the kernel machines. We derive the theoretical framework, demonstrate how our approach works on the L0-norm SVM as a typical example, and perform a series of experiments to validate its advantages. Experimental results on nine benchmark data sets are very encouraging. The implemented L0-norm is competitive with or even better than the standard L2-norm SVM in terms of accuracy but with a reduced number of support vectors, -9.46% of the number on average.

Classification of wood and leaf components of trees is an essential prerequisite for deriving vital tree attributes, such as wood mass, leaf area index (LAI) and woody-to-total area. Laser scanning emerges to be a promising solution for such a request. Intensity based approaches are widely proposed, as different components of a tree can feature discriminatory optical properties at the operating wavelengths of a sensor system. For geometry based methods, machine learning algorithms are often used to separate wood and leaf points, by providing proper training samples. However, it remains unclear how the chosen machine learning classifier and features used would influence classification results. To this purpose, we compare four popular machine learning classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na\u00a8ive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), for separating wood and leaf points from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. Two trees, an Erytrophleum fordii and a Betula pendula (silver birch) are used to test the impacts from classifier, feature set, and training samples. Our results showed that RF is the best model in terms of accuracy, and local density related features are important.

A proposed prediction with pattern recognition scheme was developed to directly predict the desired levels using simpler classifier models without undergoing regression. The proposed pattern recognition classifier was compared to its regression method using a similar algorithm applied to a real-world energy dataset. A random forest (RF) algorithm which outperformed other widely used machine learning (ML) techniques in previous research was used in both methods. Both schemes used similar parameters for training and testing simulations. After 10-time cross training validation and five averaged repeated runs with random permutation per data splitting, the proposed classifier shows better computation speed and higher classification accuracy than the conventional method. However, when the number of its desired levels increases, its prediction accuracy seems to decrease and approaches the accuracy of the conventional method. The developed energy level prediction, which is computationally inexpensive and has a good classification performance, can serve as an alternative forecasting scheme.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/sym11080956", "venue": "Symmetry", "journal": "Symmetry", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2966111888", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["110838712", "109586244", "111368033", "114561818", "110838712", "109586244", "111368033", "155225617", "108807971", "114561818", "55903698", "62287569", "7403666", "96429080", "110065593", "109507081", "110691982", "63814994", "110329630", "14209447", "108776649", "107251415", "109658267", "70536403", "69699660", "10659969", "89141", "38451751", "133627357"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201263625"}

Nevertheless, a large number of hidden neurons obtained after training is a significant drawback for the effective usage of such classifiers. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose a new approach to prune hidden layer neurons and achieve a fixed-size hidden layer without affecting the classifier\u2019s accuracy and even improving it. The main idea is to leave out non-relevant or very similar neurons to others that are not necessary to achieve a simplified, yet accurate, model. In our proposal, differently from previous works based on genetic algorithms and simulated annealing, we choose only a subset of those neurons generated at random to belong to the hidden layer without weight adjustment or increasing of the hidden neurons. In this work, we compare our proposal called simulated annealing for pruned ELM (SAP-ELM) with pruning methods named optimally pruned ELM, genetic algorithms for pruning ELM and sparse Bayesian ELM. On the basis of our experiments, we can state that SAP-ELM is a promising alternative for classification tasks. We highlight that as our proposal achieves fixed-size models, it can help to solve problems where the memory consuming is crucial, such as embeded systems, and helps to control the maximum size that the models must reach after the training process.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-017-9700-9", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2754467896", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36759737", "45917334", "8715388", "122729427", "7553535", "10293023", "18002763", "60381038", "17292559", "16237702", "60504238", "2891159", "5117817", "14619623", "116858", "18725908", "205939", "22579962", "14607306", "5516512", "7057357", "14528039", "11124791", "13306516", "275551", "1700660", "207104649", "60111935"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46683080"}

To improve this perception, it is essential to inform the driver about the asphalt status, efficiently and as quickly as possible.

For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5\u201321), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field.

It is well known that motion number plays a critical role in the success of multi-body segmentation. Most of the existing methods exploit only motion affinity to segment and determine the number of motions. Motion number estimated in this way is often seriously affected by noise. In this paper, we recast the problem of multi-body segmentation and motion number estimation into an over-segmentation detection problem, and introduce three measures, namely loss of spatial locality (LSL), split ratio (SR) and cluster distance (CD), for over-segmentation detection. A hierarchical clustering method based on motion affinity is applied to split the motion clusters recursively until over-segmentation occurs.

The challenges mainly come from the fact that the UAV view has much wider and changeable landscapes, which hinders the labeling task. In this paper, we propose a meta transfer learning method for adaptive vehicle tracking in UAV videos (MTAVT), which transfers the common features across landscapes, so that it can avoid over-fitting with the limited scale of dataset. Our MTAVT consists of two critical components: a meta learner and a transfer learner. Specifically, meta-learner is employed to adaptively learn the models to extract the sharing features between ground and drone views. The transfer learner is used to learn the domain-shifted features from ground-view to drone-view datasets by optimizing the ground-view models. We further seamlessly incorporate an exemplar-memory curriculum into meta learning by leveraging the memorized models, which serves as the training guidance for sequential sampling. Hence, this curriculum can enforce the meta learner to adapt to the new sequences in the drone-view datasets without losing the previous learned knowledge. Meanwhile, we simplify and stabilize the higher-order gradient training criteria for meta learning by exploring curriculum learning in multiple stages with various domains. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on four public benchmarks and an evaluation dataset from YouTube (to release soon).

The non-gesture model provides a confidence measure that is used as an adaptive threshold to find the start and the end point of meaningful gestures, which are embedded in the input video stream. To reduce the states number of the non-gesture model with HMMs, similar probability distributions states are merged based on relative entropy measure.

Clinicians agree that those suffering from urinary incontinence would greatly benefit from a wearable system that could continually monitor the bladder, providing continuous feedback to the patient. While existing ultrasound-based solutions are highly accurate, they are severely limited by form-factor, battery size, cost and ease of use. In this study the authors propose an alternative bladder-state sensing system, based on Ultra Wideband (UWB) Radar. As part of an initial proof-of-concept, the authors developed one of the first dielectrically and anatomically-representative Finite Difference Time Domain models of the pelvis. These models (one male and one female) are derived from Magnetic Resonance images provided by the IT'IS Foundation. These IT'IS models provide the foundation upon which an anatomically-plausible bladder growth model was constructed. The authors employed accurate multi-pole Debye models to simulate the dielectric properties of each of the pelvic tissues. Two-dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations were completed for a range of bladder volumes. Relevant features were extracted from the FDTD-derived signals using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and then classified using a k-Nearest-Neighbour and Support Vector Machine algorithms (incorporating the Leave-one-out cross-validation approach). Additionally the authors investigated the effects of signal fidelity, noise and antenna movement relative to the target as potential sources of error.

In QSAR, weights are statically fitted to each ligand descriptor with respect to a single endpoint or target. However, computational chemogenomics (CG) has demonstrated benefits of learning from entire grids of data at once, rather than building target-specific QSARs. A possible reason for this is the emergence of inductive knowledge transfer (IT) between targets, providing statistical robustness to the model, with no assumption about the structure of the targets. Relevant protein descriptors in CG should allow one to learn how to dynamically adjust ligand attribute weights with respect to protein structure. Hence, models built through explicit learning (EL) by including protein information, while benefitting from IT enhancement, should provide additional predictive capability, notably for protein deorphanization. This interplay between IT and EL in CG modeling is not sufficiently studied. While IT is likely to occur irrespective of the injected target information, it is not clear whether and when boosting due to EL may occur. EL is only possible if protein description is appropriate to the target set under investigation. The key issue here is the search for evidence of genuine EL exceeding expectations based on pure IT.

This provides a unified framework to generate both IT-enhanced and potentially EL-enabled models, where the difference is toggled by supplied protein information. For EL-enabled models, protein information includes genuine protein descriptors such as typical sequence-based terms, but also the experimentally determined affinity cross-correlation fingerprints. These latter benchmark the expected behavior of a quasi-ideal descriptor capturing the actual functional protein-protein relatedness, and therefore thought to be the most likely to enable EL. EL- and IT-based methods were benchmarked alongside classical QSAR, with respect to cross-validation and deorphanization challenges. A rational method for projecting benchmarked methodologies into a strategy space is given, in the aims that the projection will provide directions for the types of molecule designs possible using a given methodology. While EL-enabled strategies outperform classical QSARs and favorably compare to similar published results, they are, in all respects evaluated herein, not strongly distinguished from IT-enhanced models. Moreover, EL-enabled strategies failed to prove superior in deorphanization challenges. Therefore, this paper raises caution that, contrary to common belief and intuitive expectation, the benefits of chemogenomics models over classical QSAR are quite possibly due less to the injection of protein-related information, and rather impacted more by the effect of inductive transfer, due to simultaneous learning from all of the modeled endpoints. These results show that the field of protein descriptor research needs further improvements to truly realize the expected benefit of EL.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24771144", "doi": "10.1007/s10822-014-9743-1", "venue": "Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design", "journal": "Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2055786859", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6825483", "6617228", "18367632", "9085364", "6841293", "7799130", "207752942", "961425", "42715187", "16193644", "1669355", "16681789", "94799132", "5700466", "24302134", "4792042", "260852", "1595893", "9196184", "9152610", "30349043", "1192563", "37310636", "11384872", "3778477", "115626297", "195863448", "7211907", "3239147", "38026095", "28806763", "13279646", "60452768", "16961506", "24802962", "1715506", "11512459", "1515292", "9062076", "12137513", "6406570", "94390419", "2164679"], "inbound_citations": ["73434718", "677811", "5182431", "24941478", "3412149", "56454144", "3565150", "14529813", "15692073"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37247932"}

Microstructural variability (at cm to m length scales) of vegetation canopies and geomorphic features may modulate the response of FTE vegetation to regional climate changes. Understanding the influence of microstructure on tree function at the FTE is particularly relevant during vulnerable early growth stages. During these stages, individual trees are tightly coupled to conditions of the surface boundary layer, which can be more conducive to growth than the conditions above the boundary layer. Until recently, however, it has been difficult to characterize microstructure in a replicable, transferable manner. This study builds upon substantial research on ecological responses of trees at the FTE to growth environment conditions by integrating high-resolution terrestrial lidar scanning (TLS) to characterize microstructure. Our main goal was to use TLS technology to understand the effects of microstructure on photosynthetic functioning (i.e., chlorophyll fluorescence) of small-stature white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) trees at the FTE. Our specific objectives were to: 1) determine how much variance in photosynthetic functioning is explained by microstructure; 2) identify microstructural metrics that most strongly control variance in photosynthetic functioning; and 3) determine the scales at which microstructural metrics most strongly drive variance in photosynthetic functioning. Random Forest modeling demonstrated that 28% of variance in photosynthetic functioning can be explained through variation in fine-scale environmental conditions that are modulated by microstructure alone. Insolation and canopy roughness were the most important predictors of photosynthetic functioning, and the sensitivity of photosynthetic functioning to canopy roughness was scale-dependent. This suggests that microstructure affects spatial heterogeneity in the boundary layer that may influence carbon assimilation of small-stature spruce trees. This research emphasizes the importance of quantifying microstructure in study systems where fine-scale heterogeneity of the growth environment may modulate plant responses to regional climate change.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.02.019", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural and Forest Meteorology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2912772299", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["129512437", "5851765", "31451852", "87664467", "58374281", "11430078", "89141", "86626329", "38987775", "3626971", "86621988", "84325548", "10892450", "20659444", "5013653", "133269528", "4327120", "129485216", "14864905", "86817423", "25532356", "85020771", "133357770", "129002706", "132638377", "125574087", "1415840", "6230903", "83815421", "140588168", "86781068", "55394044", "129113236", "59519499", "7427354", "55806562", "6234695", "128480754", "52233279", "90117500", "45015003", "8647814", "131490749", "86599764", "32339086", "23741551", "87642285", "84764116", "5021254", "85392619", "123032527", "29167998", "89526852", "56127764", "129658437", "34384963", "38988373", "129445120", "154714897", "86051879", "35615966", "83638928", "34321640", "207001313", "16374587", "132942304", "30609355", "31003136", "84784309", "24374845", "88946239", "40749465", "19269912", "26363912", "33164470", "84143582", "86699761", "29224205", "140639828", "128900503", "85084479", "5323086", "4630243"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91805900"}

Despite its functional significance, computational methods to accurately identify malonylation sites are still lacking and urgently needed. In particular, there is currently no comprehensive analysis and assessment of different features and machine learning (ML) methods that are required for constructing the necessary prediction models. Here, we review, analyze and compare 11 different feature encoding methods, with the goal of extracting key patterns and characteristics from residue sequences of Kmal sites. We identify optimized feature sets, with which four commonly used ML methods (random forest, support vector machines, K-nearest neighbor and logistic regression) and one recently proposed [Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)] are trained on data from three species, namely, Escherichia coli, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, and compared using randomized 10-fold cross-validation tests. We show that integration of the single method-based models through ensemble learning further improves the prediction performance and model robustness on the independent test. When compared to the existing state-of-the-art predictor, MaloPred, the optimal ensemble models were more accurate for all three species (AUC: 0.930, 0.923 and 0.944 for E. coli, M. musculus and H. sapiens, respectively). Using the ensemble models, we developed an accessible online predictor, kmal-sp, available at http://kmalsp.erc.monash.edu/. We hope that this comprehensive survey and the proposed strategy for building more accurate models can serve as a useful guide for inspiring future developments of computational methods for PTM site prediction, expedite the discovery of new malonylation and other PTM types and facilitate hypothesis-driven experimental validation of novel malonylated substrates and malonylation sites.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6954445", "pubmed_id": "30351377", "doi": "10.1093/bib/bby079", "venue": "Briefings in bioinformatics", "journal": "Briefings in bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2888353590", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["27163437", "6933970", "3380296", "26706890", "7291791", "20936294", "13115626", "39354643", "33415748", "664762", "4587157", "3714250", "206037538", "206764015", "5744603", "7810792", "206992372", "2829658", "18659291", "11034725", "18550422", "35388307", "3963747", "1617323", "6851699", "16947591", "205382931", "97358", "7504557", "6176470", "45850644", "6575175", "24339481", "64945032", "24361409", "4346542", "43388205", "1340978", "1289490", "8876238", "16241352", "379259", "89141", "3321295", "3447573", "9045541", "12677753", "7955044", "4650265", "6697674", "18549001", "3864100", "4576871", "64785176", "34931283", "1941985", "4309274", "18553018", "3433171", "14058", "6823830", "257843", "4614847", "7685086", "585745", "214933593"], "inbound_citations": ["202009727", "202016082", "211138374", "215436553", "211548750", "201902429", "204078513", "199550999", "215424492", "167215351"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53036903"}

However, previous approaches of fingerprinting encrypted websites are based on HTTP/1.1, which are not applicable to the widely used HTTP/2. In addition, most of the work only fingerprints the home page of each website, but in fact, users also visit other web pages of the website. To solve the feature compatibility problem, we propose to use the local request and response sequence (LRRS) as features. LRRS can represent the patterns of the encrypted Internet traffic not only based on HTTP/1.1 but also based on HTTP/2 using local packet sequences.

It utilizes a convolution structure to make full use of LRRS sequential features and multi-layer structure to enhance the ability of feature representation.

JTB could provide precise guidance and considerable convenience for both talent recruitment and job seekers for position and salary calibration/prediction. Traditional JTB approaches mainly rely on manual market surveys, which is expensive and labor intensive. Recently, the rapid development of Online Professional graph has accumulated a large number of talent career records, which provides a promising trend for data-driven solutions. However, it is still a challenging task since (1) the job title and job transition (job-hopping) data is messy which contains a lot of subjective and non-standard naming conventions for a same position (\\eg,Programmer, Software Development Engineer, SDE, Implementation Engineer ), (2) there is a large amount of missing title/transition information, and (3) one talent only seeks limited numbers of jobs which brings the incompleteness and randomness for modeling job transition patterns. To overcome these challenges, we aggregate all the records to construct a large-scale Job Title Benchmarking Graph (Job-Graph), where nodes denote job titles affiliated with specific companies and links denote the correlations between jobs. We reformulate the JTB as the task of link prediction over the Job-Graph that matched job titles should have links. Along this line, we propose a collective multi-view representation learning method (Job2Vec) by examining the Job-Graph jointly in (1) graph topology view (the structure of relationships among job titles), (2) semantic view (semantic meaning of job descriptions), (3) job transition balance view (the numbers of bidirectional transitions between two similar-level jobs are close), and (4) job transition duration view (the shorter the average duration of transitions is, the more similar the job titles are).

To tackle this challenge, in this paper a novel method in the SVM framework is proposed to recognize the characters in low quality document images by using local and global features. Firstly, a multi-scale sliding window strategy with a pruning method of character traits is adopted to generate potential character sub-regions. Then, the conventional global feature and state-of-art local feature, namely histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), are extracted to form the representation of the potential character sub-region. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to recognize characters with a late fusion strategy.

In this paper, we apply the appropriate correlation analysis method to detect the relationships between brain regions and genes, and propose \"brain region-gene pairs\" as the multimodal features of the sample. In addition, we put forward a novel data analysis method from technology aspect, cluster evolutionary random forest (CERF), which is suitable for \"brain region-gene pairs\". The idea of clustering evolution is introduced to improve the generalization performance of random forest which is constructed by randomly selecting samples and sample features. Through hierarchical clustering of decision trees in random forest, the decision trees with higher similarity are clustered into one class, and the decision trees with the best performance are retained to enhance the diversity between decision trees. Furthermore, based on CERF, we integrate feature construction, feature selection and sample classification to find the optimal combination of different methods, and design a comprehensive diagnostic framework for AD. The framework is validated by the samples with both fMRI and SNP data from ADNI. The results show that we can effectively identify AD patients and discover some brain regions and genes associated with AD significantly based on this framework.

However, it has been observed that in terms of some attributes, e.g. the number of simple geometric primitives in an image, GANs are not able to learn the target distribution in practice. Motivated by this observation, we discover two specific problems of GANs leading to anomalous generalization behaviour, which we refer to as the sample insufficiency and the pixel-wise combination. For the first problem of sample insufficiency, we show theoretically and empirically that the batchsize of the training samples in practice may be insufficient for the discriminator to learn an accurate discrimination function. It could result in unstable training dynamics for the generator, leading to anomalous generalization. For the second problem of pixel-wise combination, we find that besides recognizing the positive training samples as real, under certain circumstances, the discriminator could be fooled to recognize the pixel-wise combinations (e.g. pixel-wise average) of the positive training samples as real. However, those combinations could be visually different from the real samples in the target distribution. With the fooled discriminator as reference, the generator would obtain biased supervision further, leading to the anomalous generalization behaviour.

While remaining competitive when compared with current methods, MV is a centralized resource for the prediction of functional sites and is interfaced by a powerful web application tailored to facilitate the use of the method and analysis of predictions to non-expert end-users. ::: ::: Availability: http://www.bioinsilico.org/MVORFFIP ::: ::: Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. ::: ::: Contact:naf4@aber.ac.uk; narcis.fernandez@gmail.com", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22563069", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bts269", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2149640119", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["24472037", "9793096", "9870286", "1492423", "60993494", "429669", "795538", "31051761", "10669291", "7821596", "2037478", "16541693", "2377376", "7941509", "6869184", "16676256", "19161044", "11526026", "21911632", "54487395", "1856700", "2528932", "5000093", "41608467", "206405440"], "inbound_citations": ["37344659", "20145406", "189817377", "51676270", "51985602", "215448140", "202031529", "3214122", "6803024", "7756397", "7246499", "52035992", "16865380", "6733616"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:744355"}

While deep learning has enabled recent breakthroughs across a wide spectrum of scene understanding tasks, its applicability to state estimation tasks has been limited due to the direct formulation that renders it incapable of encoding scene-specific constrains. In this work, we propose the VLocNet++ architecture that employs a multitask learning approach to exploit the inter-task relationship between learning semantics, regressing 6-DoF global pose and odometry, for the mutual benefit of each of these tasks. Our network overcomes the aforementioned limitation by simultaneously embedding geometric and semantic knowledge of the world into the pose regression network. We propose a novel adaptive weighted fusion layer to aggregate motion-specific temporal information and to fuse semantic features into the localization stream based on region activations. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised warping technique that uses the relative motion to warp intermediate network representations in the segmentation stream for learning consistent semantics. Finally, we introduce a first-of-a-kind urban outdoor localization dataset with pixel-level semantic labels and multiple loops for training deep networks.

Though IgE epitopes may be conformational or linear, identification of the later is useful especially in food allergens that undergo processing or digestion. Very few computational tools are available for the prediction of linear IgE epitopes. Here we report a prediction system that predicts the exact linear IgE epitope.

Cutting-edge remote sensing technology has a significant role for managing the natural resources as well as the any other applications about the earth observation. Crop monitoring is the one of these applications since remote sensing provides us accurate, up-to-date and cost-effective information about the crop types at the different temporal and spatial resolution. In this study, the potential use of three different vegetation indices of RapidEye imagery on crop type classification as well as the effect of each indices on classification accuracy were investigated. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) are the three vegetation indices used in this study since all of these incorporated the near-infrared (NIR) band. RapidEye imagery is highly demanded and preferred for agricultural and forestry applications since it has red-edge and NIR bands. The study area is located in Aegean region of Turkey. Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was used here for the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification. Original bands of RapidEye imagery were excluded and classification was performed with only three vegetation indices. The contribution of each indices on image classification accuracy was also tested with single band classification. Highest classification accuracy of 87, 46 % was obtained using three vegetation indices. This obtained classification accuracy is higher than the classification accuracy of any dual-combination of these vegetation indices. Results demonstrate that NDRE has the highest contribution on classification accuracy compared to the other vegetation indices and the RapidEye imagery can get satisfactory results of classification accuracy without original bands.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-195-2014", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2155939589", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["128773162", "128373687", "961425", "9467764", "129914394", "85224130", "72191275", "128743152", "119702334", "53127857", "55541951", "131199038", "129910255", "128619277", "7138354", "10043864"], "inbound_citations": ["3542840", "133913830", "212702701", "204739125", "80617422", "202025563", "215499808", "145050550", "54451730"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1272282"}

It normalizes the layer outputs during training using the statistics of each mini-batch. BN accelerates training procedure by allowing to safely utilize large learning rates and alleviates the need for careful initialization of the parameters. In this work, we study BN from the viewpoint of Fisher kernels that arise from generative probability models. We show that assuming samples within a mini-batch are from the same probability density function, then BN is identical to the Fisher vector of a Gaussian distribution. That means batch normalizing transform can be explained in terms of kernels that naturally emerge from the probability density function that models the generative process of the underlying data distribution. Consequently, it promises higher discrimination power for the batch-normalized mini-batch. However, given the rectifying non-linearities employed in CNN architectures, distribution of the layer outputs show an asymmetric characteristic. Therefore, in order for BN to fully benefit from the aforementioned properties, we propose approximating underlying data distribution not with one, but a mixture of Gaussian densities. Deriving Fisher vector for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), reveals that batch normalization can be improved by independently normalizing with respect to the statistics of disentangled sub-populations. We refer to our proposed soft piecewise version of batch normalization as Mixture Normalization (MN). Through extensive set of experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, using both a 5-layers deep CNN and modern Inception-V3 architecture, we show that mixture normalization reduces required number of gradient updates to reach the maximum test accuracy of the batch normalized model by \u223c31%-47% across a variety of training scenarios. Replacing even a few BN modules with MN in the 48-layers deep Inception-V3 architecture is sufficient to not only obtain considerable training acceleration but also better final test accuracy. We show that similar observations are valid for 40 and 100-layers deep DenseNet architectures as well. We complement our study by evaluating the application of mixture normalization to the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where \"mode collapse\" hinders the training process. We solely replace a few batch normalization layers in the generator with our proposed mixture normalization. Our experiments using Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) on CIFAR-10 show that mixture normalized DCGAN not only provides an acceleration of \u223c58% but also reaches lower (better) \"Frechet Inception Distance\" (FID) of 33.35 compared to 37.56 of its batch normalized counterpart.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1806.02892", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30703010", "doi": "10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2895781", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952398987,2962770523,2805157522", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5808102", "206593880", "1023605", "206594692", "9433631", "8236317", "5917270", "4076251", "5462200", "14336127", "15539264", "124992180", "6961711", "5834589", "7967806", "151231", "206593710", "116976027", "207585383", "207252215", "67000854", "12795415", "1782131", "4193919", "44077259", "18268744", "1033682", "15276198", "6773885", "16636683", "49015", "3566398", "12485056", "11758569", "211227", "6200260", "13943041", "18828233", "13002849", "5002792", "6610705", "1687220", "1178891", "6628106", "326772", "40821847", "41278748", "19031640", "1312035", "117058", "20858758", "113099", "44070760"], "inbound_citations": ["209481022", "54026775", "102351532", "211096972"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:47014389"}

Many problems in the real world don't have all data available in the beginning of the training. Therefore it is necessary that the approach is able to integrate new incoming datapoints. Random Forest have been proven to be good in online learning. However the existing approaches do only generate very few trees, which only have a height of five. To overcome this shortcoming this thesis presents several methods to improve the generation of Decision trees, which leads to an algorithm, which can train thousands of tree with a sufficient height. Furthermore the Random Forest were then used in combination with an online sparse Gaussian Process to classify the outliners. These falsely classified points weren't classified correctly by the Random Forest in the first place. This whole approach was then optimized and tested on different datasets. The far most important result was that the presented online approach always yields better results than the offline approach, which is a remarkable result for an online learning approach.

Research into learning from imbalanced class distribution is considered to be one of ten challenging problems in data mining research, and it has increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. In this work, we study the effects of different levels of imbalanced class distribution on bagging predictors by using under-sampling techniques. Despite the popularity of bagging in many real-world applications, some questions have not been clearly answered in the existing research, such as the effect of varying the levels of class distribution on different bagging predictors, e.g., whether bagging is superior to single learners when the levels of class distribution change. Most classification learning algorithms are designed to maximize the overall accuracy rate and assume that training instances are uniformly distributed; however, the overall accuracy does not represent correct prediction on the minority class, which is the class of interest to users. The overall accuracy metric is therefore ineffective for evaluating the performance of classifiers in extremely imbalanced data. This study investigates the effect of varying levels of class distribution on different bagging predictors based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) as a performance metric, using an under-sampling technique on 14 data-sets with imbalanced class distributions. Our experimental results indicate that Decision Table (DTable) and RepTree are the learning algorithms with the best bagging AUC performance. The AUC performances of bagging predictors are statistically superior to single learners, with the exception of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Stump (DStump).", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s13042-012-0125-5", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "mag_id": "1968710286", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10536475"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6488543"}

Therefore, heuristics are needed to construct respective classifiers. This paper proposes a novel heuristic incorporating recent advances from the field of integer programming and demonstrates its effectiveness by means of empirical experimentation.

As the community transitions from traditional preventive maintenance procedures to modern predictive or health-based management systems, areas such as efficient online monitoring and diagnosis schemes based on real-time observations have emerged as key research subjects for engineers. Most diagnostic systems require data from both healthy and faulty conditions in order to properly train their classification algorithms. However, in many situations, normal signals are acquired easily while fault samples are difficult to be gained. In this paper, we present a diagnosis scheme based on the least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). Our modified LS-SVM algorithm is a one-class novelty detector which can differentiate between a normal and faulty condition based only on the normal samples which are easily available. We diagnose a growing crack fault on a planetary gear plate mounted aboard a UH-60 Blackhawk aircraft using this approach.

This work focuses on two of the research problems, namely unknown time varying signal of sign languages in feature extraction stage and computing complexity and time consumption in classification stage due to a very large sign sequences database. In this paper, we propose a combination of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and application of the Single hidden Layer Feedforward Neural networks (SLFNs) trained by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to cope the limitations. DTW has several advantages over other approaches in that it can align the length of the time series data to a same prior size, while ELM is a useful technique for classifying these warped features.

Most graph kernels are based on the decomposition of graphs into a set of patterns. The similarity between two graphs is then deduced from the similarity between corresponding patterns. Kernels based on linear patterns constitute a good trade-off between accuracy performance and computational complexity. In this work, we propose a thorough investigation and comparison of graph kernels based on different linear patterns, namely walks and paths. First, all these kernels are explored in detail, including their mathematical foundations, structures of patterns and computational complexity. Then, experiments are performed on various benchmark datasets exhibiting different types of graphs, including labeled and unlabeled graphs, graphs with different numbers of vertices, graphs with different average vertex degrees, cyclic and acyclic graphs. Finally, for regression and classification tasks, performance and computational complexity of kernels are compared and analyzed, and suggestions are proposed to choose kernels according to the types of graph datasets. This work leads to a clear comparison of strengths and weaknesses of these kernels.

However, many genotoxicity bioassays are inappropriate for detecting chemicals eliciting non-genotoxic mechanisms, such as tumour promotion, this necessitates the use of in vivo rodent carcinogenicity (IVRC) assays. In silico IVRC modelling could potentially address the low throughput and high cost of this assay. We aimed to develop and combine computational QSAR models of novel bioassays for the prediction of IVRC results and compare with existing software. QSAR models were generated from existing Ames (n = 6512), Syrian Hamster Embryonic (SHE, n = 410), ISSCAN rodent carcinogenicity (ISC, n = 834) and GreenScreen GADD45a-GFP (n = 1415) chemical datasets. These models mapped the molecular descriptors of each compound to their respective assay result using machine learning algorithms (adaboost, k-Nearest Neighbours, C.45 Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest). The best performing models were combined with k-Nearest Neighbours to create a cascade model for IVRC prediction. High QSAR model performance was observed from ten time 10-fold cross-validation with above 80% accuracy and 0.85 AUC for each assay dataset.

Communication context refers to the attributes of current communication. Social context refers to the patterns of participation in communication (information roles) and the degree of overlap of friends between two people (strength of ties). A subset of optimal features of the communication and social context is chosen at a given time instant using five different feature selection strategies. The features are thereafter used in a Support Vector Regression framework to predict the intent to communicate and the delay between a pair of individuals.

The LPV state space system is in the Companion Reachable Canonical Form. The output vector coefficients are linear combinations of a set of a possibly infinite number of nonlinear basis functions dependent on the scheduling signal, the state matrix is either time invariant or a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions of the scheduling signal and the input vector is time invariant. This model structure, although simple, can describe accurately the behaviour of many nonlinear SISO systems by an adequate choice of the scheduling signal. It also partially solves the problems of structural bias caused by inaccurate selection of the basis functions and high variance of the estimates due to over-parameterisation. The use of an infinite number of basis functions in the output vector increases the flexibility to describe complex functions and makes it possible to learn the underlying dependencies of these coefficients from the data. A Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approach is used to address the infinite dimension of the output coefficients. Since there is a linear dependence of the output on the output vector coefficients and, on the other hand, the LS-SVM solution is a nonlinear function of the state and input matrix coefficients, the LPV system is identified by minimising a quadratic function of the output function in a reduced parameter space; the minimisation of the error is performed by a separable approach where the parameters of the fixed matrices are calculated using a gradient method.

In actual industrial environments, it is difficult to collect enough real damaged samples, but artificial damaged samples are easy to obtain. In this paper, a novel transfer learning method with convolutional neural network (CNN) from artificial damage to real damage for bearing fault diagnosis is proposed. Firstly, the CNN model is constructed and pre-trained by huge and easily obtained artificial damaged samples. Then, parameters of some layers from the pre-trained CNN model are frozen to save the same feature between artificial damaged samples and real damaged samples. Finally, a small number of real damaged samples are used to fine-tune the model. Experiments on an open bearing fault database showed that the proposed method can not only improve the diagnosis accuracy in the real damage dataset, but also save training time and samples.

In this research paper, the existing challenges faced by a drought forecasting model trained at multiple time-scales are resolved where a new multi-phase, multivariate empirical mode decomposition model integrated with simulated annealing and Kernel ridge regression algorithms (i.e., MEMD-SA-KRR) is designed to attain significantly accurate drought forecasts for 3 agricultural sites (i.e., Faisalabad, Islamabad and Jhelum, located in Pakistan). Utilizing the multi-scalar Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) time series as a target variable for characterization of drought, twelve multivariate datasets (derived from statistically significant lagged combinations of precipitation, temperature & humidity), that are enriched with eight synoptic-scale climate mode indices and periodicity, are utilized in designing a new drought model. The study constructs a hybrid MEMD-SA-KRR model, where firstly, the data are partitioned into their respective training and testing subsets after creating historically lagged SPI at timescale (t \u2013 1). Secondly, the MEMD algorithm is conditioned to demarcate multivariate climate indices from their training and testing sets, separately, into their decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residues. Thirdly, the SA method is employed to decide the most suitable IMFs. Finally, the KRR algorithm is applied to the selected IMFs to forecast multi-scaler SPI, at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-monthly forecast horizon. The results are benchmarked with Random Forest, integrated with MEMD and SA to develop the MEMD-SA-RF equivalent model.

Intuitively, to address domain shift problem, it is crucial to learn domain invariant features across domains, and most existing approaches have concentrated on it. However, they often do not directly constrain the learned features to be class discriminative for both source and target data, which is of vital importance for the final classification. Therefore, in this paper, we put forward a novel feature learning method for domain adaptation to construct both domain invariant and class discriminative representations, referred to as DICD. Specifically, DICD is to learn a latent feature space with important data properties preserved, which reduces the domain difference by jointly matching the marginal and class-conditional distributions of both domains, and simultaneously maximizes the inter-class dispersion and minimizes the intra-class scatter as much as possible. Experiments in this paper have demonstrated that the class discriminative properties will dramatically alleviate the cross-domain distribution inconsistency, which further boosts the classification performance. Moreover, we show that exploring both domain invariance and class discriminativeness of the learned representations can be integrated into one optimization framework, and the optimal solution can be derived effectively by solving a generalized eigen-decomposition problem. Comprehensive experiments on several visual cross-domain classification tasks verify that DICD can outperform the competitors significantly.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29870346", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2018.2839528", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2803106019", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["740063", "6953522", "8548594", "29160099", "16599187", "9112273", "12271421", "6742009", "13798326", "407822", "788838", "13985613", "14536072", "47325215", "1993257", "5941649", "207579947", "206787478", "70831", "17547265", "10613452", "14411304", "12794304", "888650", "1990988", "14739721", "7263397", "195346943", "6318297", "15533789", "60697037", "14171099", "12450925", "31096852", "122725444", "6674407", "206742596", "14701603", "2091854", "14456120", "118828957", "16496273", "6161478", "556999"], "inbound_citations": ["52453713", "214605881", "85517759", "211479388", "211032176", "207947971", "53763041", "201066230", "211730948", "199380838", "208020647", "198161426", "204837684", "53097597", "208648917", "51613426", "75137541", "198131641", "119186109", "209500974"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46932755"}

We then test the performance of our model on part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic relation identification and semantic relatedness, controlling for embedding dimensionality. We find that multi-sense embeddings do improve performance on some tasks (part-of-speech tagging, semantic relation identification, semantic relatedness) but not on others (named entity recognition, various forms of sentiment analysis). We discuss how these differences may be caused by the different role of word sense information in each of the tasks. The results highlight the importance of testing embedding models in real applications.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1506.01070", "acl_id": "D15-1200", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18653/v1/D15-1200", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1010415138,2952802852", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["203662857", "1005694", "53821397", "2434362", "2617020", "351666", "52098500", "436023", "1915014", "372093", "9792203", "16404002", "17048224", "5959482", "577005", "15251438", "7105713", "62139126", "1957433", "753195", "8637155", "2156506", "18309234", "806709", "990233", "3033526", "6009000"], "inbound_citations": ["53080704", "27464032", "52205776", "22141008", "53081791", "6256345", "139106012", "22299001", "3710236", "206686029", "204734300", "51881012", "42254781", "49902474", "6458592", "20892169", "855563", "21732673", "50821773", "86402029", "1490918", "14974539", "20596998", "29486953", "26138698", "52009979", "12928745", "18133407", "16222994", "20830942", "44177914", "209374941", "53295472", "4873022", "53223415", "28343036", "14266822", "30592378", "3081080", "52289318", "202787847", "196174835", "52182104", "49419904", "202768670", "184488400", "13696533", "52076072", "52216759", "119117646", "182952883", "10211692", "19193078", "10694510", "31134884", "13444726", "21714217", "1018613", "22604822", "160009420", "35643001", "46979328", "208157974", "16212021", "202583512", "120164351", "34353891", "18614158", "5091846", "174799681", "214608366", "4612903", "15500016", "2528489", "202719863", "198489777", "3656914", "43304", "52181336", "52225306", "212725472", "49210987", "53046264", "3141649", "201712838", "9914140", "197418609", "19137493", "28848885", "49881509", "4900677", "53493024", "1474820", "10052042", "32993601", "18114929", "5999791", "53624727", "7675312", "14741568", "11101589", "15377479", "28958127", "28909501", "201633105", "4737398", "36139851", "14120418", "199537685"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6222768"}

Based on the measured signal, the type and concentration of the gas can be predicted by pattern recognition algorithms.

From the viewpoint of pattern recognition, the factors make the posterior distribution of the test data drift from that of the training data, thus will degrade the accuracy of the prediction models. In this paper, we propose drift correction autoencoder (DCAE) to address this problem. DCAE learns to model and correct the influential factors explicitly with the help of transfer samples. It generates drift-corrected and discriminative representation of the original data, which can then be applied to various prediction algorithms. We evaluate DCAE on data sets with instrumental variation and complex time-varying drift. Prediction models are trained on samples collected with one device or in the initial time period, then tested on other devices or time periods. Experimental results show that the DCAE outperforms typical drift correction algorithms and autoencoder-based transfer learning methods.

Many researchers have proposed different techniques like DETEX for detecting code smells which have limited precision and recall. To overcome these limitations, a new technique named as SVMCSD has been proposed for the detection of code smells, based on support vector machine learning technique.

The representative samples of ALDC (stem and leaf) were gathered from the surrounding and distant areas of the mercury mines. As a reference method, the total mercury contents in soil and ALDC samples were determined by a direct mercury analyzer incorporating high-temperature decomposition, catalytic adsorption for impurity removal, amalgamation capture, and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Based on the FT-NIR data of ALDC samples, LS-SVM models were established to distinguish mercury-contaminated and ordinary soil. The results of reference analysis showed that the mercury level of the areas surrounding mercury mines (0-3 kilometers, 7.52-88.59 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that of the areas distant from mercury mines (>5 kilometers, 0-0.75 mg/kg). The LS-SVM classification model of ALDC samples was established based on the original spectra, smoothed spectra, second-derivative (D2) spectra, and standard normal transformation (SNV) spectra, respectively. The prediction accuracy of D2-LS-SVM was the highest (0.950). FT-NIR combined with LS-SVM modeling can quickly and accurately identify the contaminated ALDC.

Functional annotation of these genes implicated their roles in immune responses (e.g., betadefensin, microseminoprotein), keratinocyte differentiation/epidermal development (e.g., FLG, CORIN, AQP, LOR, KRT16), inflammation (e.g., IL37, IL27RA, CCL18) and lipid metabolism (e.g., AKR1B10, FAD7, FAR2). Subsequently, we validated a subset of signature genes using quantitative PCR in a mouse model. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified keratinocyte pathway over-represented (P = <0.0006) among the 89 signature genes.

Together, these various layers make up a powerful deep model for gas classification.

Fortunately, there are ample labeled data in some other related source domains. Transfer learning allows knowledge to be transferred from source domains to target domain. In real applications, such as text-image and cross-language transfer learning, the feature spaces of source and target domains are different, that is heterogeneous transfer learning. This paper focuses on heterogeneous transductive transfer learning(HTTL), an approach to improve the performance of unlabeled data in target domain by using some labeled data in heterogeneous source domains. Since the feature spaces of source domains and target domain are different, the key problem is to learn the mapping functions between the heterogeneous source domains and target domain. This paper proposes to learn the mapping functions by unsupervised matching in the different feature spaces. The data in source domains can be re-represented with the mapping functions and transferred to the target domain. Thus, in target domain, there are some labeled data which come from the source domains. Standard machine learning methods such as support vector machine can be used to train classifiers for predicting the labels of unlabeled data in target domain. Moreover, a probabilistic interpretation is derived to verify the robustness of the presented method over certain noises in the utility matrices. A sample complexity bound is given to indicate how many instances are needed to adequately find the mapping functions.

Face recognition is an important and very challenging technique to automatic people recognition. Up to date, there is no technique that provides a robust solution to all situations and different applications that face recognition may encounter. In general, we can make sure that performance of a face recognition system is determined by how to extract feature vector exactly and to classify them into a group accurately. It, therefore, is necessary for us to closely look at the feature extractor and classifier. In this paper, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to play a key role in feature extractor and the SVMs are used to tackle the face recognition problem. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been recently proposed as a new classifier for pattern recognition. We illustrate the potential of SVMs on the Cambridge ORL Face database, which consists of 400 images of 40 individuals, containing quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. The SVMs that have been used included the Linear (LSVM), Polynomial (PSVM), and Radial Basis Function (RBFSVM) SVMs. We provide experimental evidence which show that Polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF) SVMs performs better than Linear SVM on the ORL Face Dataset when both are used with one against all classification.

Effective and efficient detection of such failure may provide early warning to the surrounding human workers and reduce such risk to human beings as much as possible. One of the commonest reasons that cause the failure of the UAV's flight is the physical damage to the propellers. This paper presents a method to detect the propellers' damage only based on the audio noise caused by the UAV's flight. The diagnostic model is developed based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning techniques. The audio data is collected from the UAVs in real time, transformed into the time-frequency spectrogram, and used to train the CNN-based diagnostic model. The developed model is able to detect the abnormal features of the spectrogram and thus the physical damage of the propellers. To reduce the data dependence on the UAV's dynamic models and enable the utilization of the training data from UAVs with different dynamic models, the CNN-based diagnostic model is further augmented by transfer learning. As such, the refinement of the well-trained diagnostic model ground on other UAVs only requires a small amount of UAV's training data.

The idea is to design auxiliary tasks where labels are free to obtain. Most of these tasks end up providing data to learn specific kinds of invariance useful for recognition. In this paper, we propose to exploit different self-supervised approaches to learn representations invariant to (i) inter-instance variations (two objects in the same class should have similar features) and (ii) intra-instance variations (viewpoint, pose, deformations, illumination, etc). Instead of combining two approaches with multi-task learning, we argue to organize and reason the data with multiple variations. Specifically, we propose to generate a graph with millions of objects mined from hundreds of thousands of videos. The objects are connected by two types of edges which correspond to two types of invariance:\"different instances but a similar viewpoint and category\"and\"different viewpoints of the same instance\". By applying simple transitivity on the graph with these edges, we can obtain pairs of images exhibiting richer visual invariance. We use this data to train a Triplet-Siamese network with VGG16 as the base architecture and apply the learned representations to different recognition tasks. For object detection, we achieve 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 using Fast R-CNN (compare to 67.3% with ImageNet pre-training).

One challenge in manufacturing personalized prostheses is the mapping from the curved 3D shape extracted from imaging modalities to the planar 2D leaflet shape that is cut out of the fabrication material. To address this problem, a database was set up to evaluate valve leaflet shape models. First, 3D ultrasound images of ex-vivo porcine valves were acquired under physiologically realistic pressure to extract geometric key parameters describing the individual geometry. In a second step, the valves' leaflets were cut out, spread on an illuminated plate and photographed in this state. From these images, the leaflet shape was extracted using edge detection. This database allows the derivation of a data-driven leaflet model utilizing machine learning, i.e. nonlinear Support Vector Regression (SVR). Additionally, an existing geometric leaflet shape model was evaluated on the dataset. The data-driven approach provided an acceptable leaflet shape estimation and clearly outperformed the existing model.

This use has severe negative health effects, is often either expensive or time consuming, and contributes to global warming. Options for policy interventions include the promotion of improved cook stoves (ICS) and enabling households to switch to more modern fuels, like liquefied petroleum gas. ::: The main aims of this thesis is 1) to explore whether rural households\u2019 fuel use can be modeled in new ways that focus on prediction, 2) to investigate whether area level differences in fuel use may have impacts for ICS programs, and 3) to address new solutions for ICS programs in areas where the current fuel use is mainly collected biomass. ::: Methods used to model fuel use are ordinary linear regression and a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest. Further models are developed in order to evaluate possible implications and proposed solutions for ICS programs based on variations in current fuel use. The papers use data from two different surveys. The first data set is from a survey, carried out in the V\u0129nh Phuc province of northern Vietnam in 2010. The second survey is representative of most of rural Vietnam and was collected in 2002, 2005, and 2008 as part of the Vietnam Rural Electrification program. ::: The results from the regression and Random Forest analysis include new ways to model fuel use, enabling easy and accurate prediction. The results also provide possible alternative explanations for some previous modeling results. The modeling of stove interventions reveals large potential differences between communes, as well as a possible non-linear relationship between stove efficiencies and benefits, but also large uncertainties in estimations depending assumptions of fuel choice. Lastly, a model for a new type of ICS program that offers possibilities to overcome some of the barriers to adoption and sustained use reported by previous studies is evaluated. ::: Combining the conclusions from the respective papers, a possibility of modeling variations in possible outcomes for stove programs, and the effects of such programs based on area descriptions, is found.

It applies relevant knowledge from a pre-trained model (Teacher Model) to the new ones with a small amount of training data, yet without affecting the model accuracy. However, these Teacher Models are normally open in order to facilitate sharing and reuse, which creates an attack plane in transfer learning systems. Among others, recent emerging attacks demonstrate that adversarial inputs can be built with negligible perturbations to the normal inputs. Such inputs can mimic the internal features of the student models directly based on the knowledge of the Teacher Models and cause misclassification in final predictions. ::: In this paper, we propose an effective defence against the above misclassification attacks in transfer learning. First, we propose a distilled differentiator that can address the targeted attacks, where adversarial inputs are misclassified to a specific class. Specifically, this dedicated differentiator is designed with network activation pruning and retraining in a fine-tuned manner, so as to reach high defence rates and high model accuracy. To address the non-targeted attacks that misclassify adversarial inputs to randomly selected classes, we further employ an ensemble structure from the differentiators to cover all possible misclassification. Our evaluations over common image recognition tasks confirm that the student models applying our defence can reject most of the adversarial inputs with a marginal accuracy loss. We also show that our defence outperforms prior approaches in both targeted and non-targeted attacks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.11230", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2970199554", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["8404331", "128088823", "14240373", "67770994", "206597351", "5157373", "49404476", "6706414", "2238772", "7200347", "53059573", "3136364", "44096776", "12387176", "740063", "1090603", "17362994", "2672720", "191074", "2668965", "5922522", "14124313", "15926837", "14580063", "2698863", "206593880", "21946795", "67846878", "49547752", "60600316", "52897637"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201671390"}

Each video-frame is first scanned in real-time to detect approximately upright-frontal faces. The faces found are scaled into image patches of equal size, convolved with a bank of Gabor energy filters, and then passed to a recognition engine that codes facial expressions into 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. We report results on a series of experiments comparing spatial frequency ranges, feature selection techniques, and recognition engines. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost and then training Support Vector Machines on the outputs of the filters selected by AdaBoost. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7-way forced choice was 93% or more correct on two publicly available datasets, the best performance reported so far on these datasets. Surprisingly, registration of internal facial features was not necessary, even though the face detector does not provide precisely registered images. The outputs of the classifier change smoothly as a function of time and thus can be used for unobtrusive motion capture. We developed an end-to-end system that provides facial expression codes at 24 frames per second and animates a computer generated character. In real-time this expression mirror operates down to resolutions of 16 pixels from eye to eye.

Emotion recognition is a challenging task. Inspired by the sophisticated human nervous system, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an efficient machine learning tool to handle this kind of difficult problems. Hence in this paper, an efficient ANN based human emotion recognition system using the features of discriminative facial patches is proposed. First of all, the facial landmark points are detected from the facial expression images and some active patches are considered. Then, dimensionality reduction is performed to obtain the discriminative facial patches and the features are extracted from these patches. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are extracted as the feature vectors.

This allows developers to take proper action, such as adapting the development process or redirecting testing efforts (e.g., using a certain set of testing techniques, or focusing on certain parts of the system). Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) has emerged as a popular method for classifying software defects, but it requires one or more experts to categorize each defect in a quite complex and time-consuming process. In this paper, we evaluate the use of machine learning algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Nearest Centroid, Random Forest and Recurrent Neural Networks) for automatic classification of software defects using ODC, based on unstructured textual bug reports.

This study examines whether the effectiveness of using warfarin among elderly inpatients can be improved when machine learning techniques and data from the laboratory information system are incorporated. Methods: Having employed 288 validated clinical cases in the DDI group and 89 cases in the non-DDI group, we evaluate the prediction performance of seven classification techniques, with and without an Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. Measures including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve are used to evaluate model performance. Results: Decision tree-based classifiers outperform other investigated classifiers in all evaluation measures. The classifiers supplemented with AdaBoost can generally improve the performance. In addition, weight, congestive heart failure, and gender are among the top three critical variables affecting prediction accuracy for the non-DDI group, while age, ALT, and warfarin doses are the most influential factors for the DDI group.

Toward scene recognition, many methods have been proposed. They, however, encounter difficulty to improve the accuracy, mainly due to two limitations: 1) lack of analysis of intrinsic relationships across different scales, say, the initial input and its down-sampled versions and 2) existence of redundant features. This paper develops a semi-supervised learning mechanism to reduce the above two limitations. To address the first limitation, we propose a multitask model to integrate scene images of different resolutions. For the second limitation, we build a model of sparse feature selection-based manifold regularization (SFSMR) to select the optimal information and preserve the underlying manifold structure of data.

However, due to the limitations of experimental Self-interactions detection, one major challenge in the study of prediction SIPs is how to exploit computational approaches for SIPs detection based on evolutionary information contained protein sequence. In the work, we presented a novel computational approach named WELM\u2013LAG, which combined the Weighed-Extreme Learning Machine (WELM) classifier with Local Average Group (LAG) to predict SIPs based on protein sequence. The major improvement of our method lies in presenting an effective feature extraction method used to represent candidate Self-interactions proteins by exploring the evolutionary information embedded in PSI-BLAST-constructed position specific scoring matrix (PSSM); and then employing a reliable and robust WELM classifier to carry out classification. In addition, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach is used to reduce the impact of noise. The WELM\u2013LAG method gave very high average accuracies of 92.94 and 96.74% on yeast and human datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, we compared it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier and other existing methods on human and yeast datasets, respectively. Comparative results indicated that our approach is very promising and may provide a cost-effective alternative for predicting SIPs.

The most important component of a forecasting regime for irrigation is a simple, yet reliable, approach for forecasting crop water demands, which in this paper is represented by the reference or potential evapotranspiration (ETo). In most cases, weather data in the area is limited to a reduced number of variables measured, therefore current or future ETo estimation is restricted. This paper summarizes the results of testing of two proposed forecasting ETo schemes under the mentioned conditions. The first or \"direct\" approach involved forecasting ETo using historically computed ETo values. The second or \"indirect\" approach involved forecasting the required weather parameters for the ETo calculation based on historical data and then computing ETo. An statistical machine learning algorithm, the Multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (MVRVM) is applied to both of the forecastings schemes. The general ETo model used is the 1985 Hargreaves Equation which requires only minimum and maximum daily air temperatures and is thus well suited to regions lacking more comprehensive climatic data. The utility and practicality of the forecasting methodology is demonstrated with an application to an irrigation project in Central Utah. To determine the advantage and suitability of the applied algorithm, another learning machine, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), is used for comparison purposes.

Recently SVM has been actively researched for rank learning and applied to various applications including search engines or relevance feedback systems. A query in such systems is the ranking function F learned by SVM. Once learning a function F or formulating the query, processing the query to find top-k results requires evaluating the entire database by F. So far, there exists no exact indexing solution for SVM functions. Existing top-k query processing algorithms are not applicable to the machine-learned ranking functions, as they often make restrictive assumptions on the query, such as linearity or monotonicity of functions. Existing metric-based or reference-based indexing methods are also not applicable, because data points are invisible in the kernel space (SVM feature space) on which the index must be built. Existing kernel indexing methods return approximate results or fix kernel parameters. This paper proposes an exact indexing solution for SVM functions with varying kernel parameters. We first propose key geometric properties of the kernel space -- ranking instability and ordering stability -- which is crucial for building indices in the kernel space. Based on them, we develop an index structure iKernel and processing algorithms. We then present clustering techniques in the kernel space to enhance the pruning effectiveness of the index. According to our experiments, iKernel is highly effective overall producing 1~5% of evaluation ratio on large data sets.

However, there has been no study attempting to simultaneously discriminate among Healthy Controls (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI (cMCI) and stable AD, using features derived from a single modality, namely MRI. New Method Based on preprocessed MRI images from the organizers of a neuroimaging challenge2, we attempted to quantify the prediction accuracy of multiple morphological MRI features to simultaneously discriminate among HC, MCI, cMCI and AD. We explored the efficacy of a novel scheme that includes multiple feature selections via Random Forest from subsets of the whole set of features (e.g. whole set, left/right hemisphere etc.), Random Forest classification using a fusion approach and ensemble classification via majority voting. From the ADNI database, 60 HC, 60 MCI, 60 cMCI and 60 AD were used as a training set with known labels. An extra dataset of 160 subjects (HC: 40, MCI: 40, cMCI: 40 and AD: 40) was used as an external blind validation dataset to evaluate the proposed machine learning scheme. Results In the second blind dataset, we succeeded in a four-class classification of 61.9% by combining MRI-based features with a Random Forest-based Ensemble Strategy. We achieved the best classification accuracy of all teams that participated in this neuroimaging competition. Comparison with Existing Method(s) The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to simultaneously discriminate among four groups using morphological MRI features for the very first time in the literature. Conclusions Hence, the proposed machine learning scheme can be used to define single and multi-modal biomarkers for AD.

Based on the value of several soil and environment indicators, the agricultural land evaluation methodology is applied to land mapping units in order to compute the suitability index. This index characterizes these land-mapping units. However, there are different methodologies which have been reviewed for land capability and suitability evaluation. In the present study, the potential use of support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm was evaluated for land suitability analysis for rainfed wheat based on FAO land evaluation frameworks (FAO, 1976, 1983, 1985) and the proposed method by Sys et al. (1991). The study area was divided into thirteen land units (with thirty two representative soil profiles) and ten land characteristics including climatic (precipitation, temperature), topographic (relief and slope) and soil-related (texture, CaCO3, OC, coarse fragment, pH, gypsum) parameters were considered to be relevant to rainfed wheat. In this study economic factors have been excluded and moderate management has been assumed. The data points were divided by randomization technique and 80% data was selected to train the model and the remaining 20% was used to test the model. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used as evaluation criteria. The results showed that the corresponding values for RMSE and R2 between the measured and predicted land suitability indices using the SVMs model were 3.72 and 0.84 respectively. Moreover, the most important limiting factors for rainfed wheat cultivation are climatic and topographic conditions, and 84.38% of total lands are classified as S2 class (moderately suitable) while the remaining 15.62% are classified as S3 class (marginally suitable).

Image forgery like splicing and copy-move are very common type of attacks that are easy to execute using sophisticated photo editing tools. As a result, digital forensics has attracted much attention to identify such tampering on digital images. In this paper, a passive (blind) image tampering identification method based on Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) has been proposed. First, the chroma components of an image is divided into fixed sized non-overlapping blocks and 2D block DCT is applied to identify the changes due to forgery in local frequency distribution of the image. Then a texture descriptor, LBP is applied on the magnitude component of the 2D-DCT array to enhance the artifacts introduced by the tampering operation. The resulting LBP image is again divided into non-overlapping blocks. Finally, summations of corresponding inter-cell values of all the LBP blocks are computed and arranged as a feature vector. These features are fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) as kernel to distinguish forged images from authentic ones. The proposed method has been experimented extensively on three publicly available well-known image splicing and copy-move detection benchmark datasets of color images.

Under-sampled data is acquired in parallel imaging to expedite the MRI scan process, which leads to aliased images. Sensitivity Encoding (SENSE) is a widely used technique to reconstruct the artefact free images from the Parallel MRI (pMRI) aliased data. Reconfigurable hardware based architecture for SENSE has a great potential to provide good quality image reconstruction with significantly less computation time. This thesis aimed to investigate and develop a novel parameterized architecture design for SENSE algorithm. The proposed design is implemented on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) platform, which can provide real-time SENSE reconstruction right on the receiver coil data acquisition system with no need to transfer data to the MRI server. Complex multiplier, complex matrix multiplier and pseudo-inverse modules are designed according to the algorithmic needs to increase the efficiency of the system. Furthermore, variable databus widths are used in the data path of the proposed architecture, which leads to reducing the hardware cost and silicon area. The use of eigenvectors decomposition (E-maps) and pre-scan methods for estimating sensitivity maps are also investigated. The reconstruction results are compared with the multi-core CPU and Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) based reconstructions of SENSE. This research also proposed an intelligent and robust classification technique to classify the MRI scans as normal or abnormal and also for validation purpose.

Previous research has focused on convergence behaviors in a static environment, ignoring dynamic cognitive aspects of concept change. Here we investigate concept drift in word learning in story-telling situations. Informed by findings in cognitive neuroscience, we hypothesize that a large ensemble of sparse codes flexibly represents and robustly traces drifting concepts. We experimentally test the population coding hypothesis on children\u2019s cartoon videos. Our results show that learning the meanings of words over time is hard, especially when the concept evolves slowly, but the sparse population coding can handle the concept drift problem effectively while hypothesis elimination and simplistic parametric models have difficulty. Keywords: Cross-situational word learning; statistical language learning; concept drift; meaning change; population coding. Introduction Children learn the meaning of words rapidly and robustly across multiple situations (Smith & Yu, 2008). Computational modeling has served a powerful tool for precise investigation of the hypothesized mechanisms of word learning. Many computational models of word learning have been used to simulate and account for the observed patterns such as reference disambiguation, blocking, and long-term memory (Frank et al., 2009, Kachergis et al., 2010; Vlach & Sandhofer, 2010). Existing computational models for word learning can be broadly divided into hypothesis elimination and associative learning (Fazly et al., 2010). In the hypothesis elimination approach the learning process consists of eliminating incorrect hypotheses about word meaning, on the basis of a combination of a priori knowledge and observations of how words are used to refer to aspects of experience, until the learner converges on a single consistent hypothesis. For instance, Siskind (1996) presented an efficient algorithm for keeping track of just the necessary and possible components of word-meaning hypotheses consistent with a set of examples. A weakness of this approach is that some logically possible hypotheses may be ruled out a priori or the concepts cannot be recovered once they are eliminated. Another approach to computational modeling of word learning is associative learning. Yu (2005), for example, studied a word-object association model in a unified framework of lexical and category learning. This model demonstrated the emergence of patterns observed in early word learning. Xu and Tenenbaum (2007) proposed a probabilistic model of word learning. The Bayesian account aims to explain inductive learning at the level of computational theory rather than to describe psychological processes involved. Fazly et al. (2010) uses a probabilistic framework to propose an incremental associative model that deals with referential uncertainty. The proposed model is demonstrated to converge over time on the most likely meaning of the word in CHILDES data sets. However, this model does not incorporate alignment ambiguity and it is not clear how the model behaves if the concept drifts in the course of learning. Concept drift is a fundamentally important phenomenon in language acquisition. It means that the statistical properties of the target concept, which the learner is trying to learn, change over time (Widmer & Kubat, 1996). For example, a child might think that all birds can fly until he/she observes an ostrich, at which time the child revises the concept of bird. This causes problems because the learning process needs some mechanisms to unlearn or revise the learned concepts. Simple hypothesis elimination cannot account for this since it lacks a mechanism for recovering the eliminated concepts. Both the associative learning and its probabilistic versions have difficulties since they strive to model global patterns, not modeling local patterns that might be necessary at a later stage. Here we propose a computational model of word learning that deals with concept drift under alignment ambiguity and referential uncertainty. The model borrows ideas from neuroscience and uses a population coding (Pouget et al., 2000; Ma et al., 2006). We propose a sparse population- code network in which meanings of the words are represented as a large collection of sparse microcodes. Since each microcode is sparse, it describes a general concept. There are many of the microcodes and, thus statistically, only a few parts of them are updated on a single observation, maintaining stability by the remaining microcodes in the population. We test this population coding hypothesis on naturalistic children\u2019s cartoon video data. To make the experiments more realistic, we use state-of-the-art image processing techniques to represent the scene as a bag of image patches. This is contrasted with the previous studies of cross-situational word learning in which the scene representation adopts hand-coded semantic features. Our experimental results show that learning the meaning of words over time is hard, especially when the concept is drifting slowly. We demonstrate that the sparse population coding can handle the concept drift problem effectively", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proc. 34 th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2012", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2407333647", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17998309", "10122196", "3262559", "16422960", "11562994", "124985575", "122427", "14577201", "1473873", "6000627", "6041420", "15558554", "2103207"], "inbound_citations": ["15757427", "16442906", "410103", "132597361", "15992461", "109939338", "35837739", "58587", "18039179", "164574501", "7338307", "1157443", "14405360", "207148853", "15143048", "17822803"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14890940"}

Nowadays, imaging modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) allow improving the atherosclerosis diagnosis. However, in the recent years, computational techniques, which allow approaching this disease from a mechanical standpoint, have been emerged as an alternative and/or complementary diagnosis techniques, improving the understanding of the cardiovascular pathologies. This Thesis deals with the study of the role of some mechanical factors on atherosclerotic blood vessels within the continuum mechanics framework. In order to achieve this goal, the atherosclerosis disease has been tackled from two different perspectives; from computational and experimental points of view. The Finite Element (FE) method is intensively used throughout this work in order to improve the understanding of the problems at hand. Furthermore, the feasibility of the proposed methodologies as predictive tools for clinicians, which should be one of the most important aims of Computational Biomechanics, is also shown. Regarding computational aspects, this Thesis presents a computational methodology, able to accurately analyze the mechanical environment of atherosclerotic lesions and consequently identify high risk plaques. This is accomplished by means of several finite element idealized parametric studies which predict the influence of the main mechanical and structural aspects of the atheroma plaque vulnerability; geometric risk factors such as the fibrous cap thickness, the stenosis ratio, the lipid core length and width, the remodeling index and the plaque configuration, longitudinal and circumferential residual stresses and presence of microcalcifications. The idealized geometry used in these parametric studies has been validated with a patient specific reconstruction model of human atherosclerotic lesion. Furthermore, considering the important role that the arterial wall compliance and pulsatile blood flow play in the atheroma growth and, in order to reject the effect of fluid shear stress compared to the effect of tensile wall stresses on plaque fracture dynamics, a Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model based in this parametric study is presented. The main drawbacks of specific patient finite element analysis to predict the atheroma plaque vulnerability risk are the huge memory required and the long computation times. Therefore, faster and more efficient methods to detect vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque would greatly enhance the ability of clinicians to diagnose and treat patients at risk. This Thesis presents two potential applications of Machine Learning Techniques (MLT), such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), applied to the detection of vulnerable plaques. The experimental study of the anatomical and histological characteristics and the mechanical properties of both healthy and atherosclerotic murine aortas is also tackled. For this purpose, in situ inflation tests, histological analysis and a non-invasive evaluation of atherosclerosis lesions were carried out on Apolipoprotein E-Deficient (ApoE-/-) and C57BL/6J mice feeding on a hyperlipidic and a normal diet, respectively. Very different pressure stretch curves were obtained and analyzed, pointing out the different behaviour of both groups. Finally, focusing on atheroma plaque growth aspects, a numerical model for atheroma plaque growth including the main biological agents and processes is presented. This model based on reaction-convection-diffusion equations provides us a better understanding of the biological and mechanical interaction processes. Summarizing, these phenomena are as follows; the inflammatory process starts with the penetration of Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol from the circulatory system into the arterial wall, promoted by the effects of local Wall Shear Stress (WSS) on the endothelial cell layer and its effects on volume and solute flux. Part of this LDL is oxidized and becomes pathological. In order to remove it, circulating immune cells (monocytes) are recruited. Once in the intima, the monocytes differentiate into macrophages that ingest by phagocytosis the oxidized LDL. The ingestion of large amounts of oxidized LDL transforms the fatty macrophages into foam cells. Moreover, an increase of macrophage concentration in the intima leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to recruit more macrophages and induce the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima layer. Finally, the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) may secrete a complex extracellular matrix containing collagen. Foam cells, SMCs and collagen are consider responsible for the growth of a subendothelial plaque which eventually emerges in the artery wall.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2524870494", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53691332"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86498986"}

With the advancement in depth sensors, e.g., Kinect, pose estimation with depth image provides more available realistic skeleton stream data. However, the locations of joints are always unstable due to noises. Moreover, as the estimated skeletons of different persons are not the same, the variance of intra-class is large. In this paper, we first expand the coordinate stream of each joint into multi-order streams by fusing hierarchical global information to improve the stability of joint streams.

However, a long-time operation brings about users fatigue, leading to a decrease of performance of the BCI system in practical applications. The characterization of the fatigued mechanism and the improvement of the SSVEP classification accuracy remains a challenging problem of significant importance. In this letter, we first conduct SSVEP experiments to acquire the EEG signals during both normal and fatigued states. Then we develop a novel framework, which integrates the advantages of multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for improving the SSVEP classification accuracy, especially during the fatigued state. The results suggest that the novel framework enables us to obtain a higher SSVEP classification accuracy compared with the method without MEMD. Furthermore, in order to reveal the fatigued behavior, we use the multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE) to analyze the multi-channel EEG signals corresponding to normal and fatigued states. We interestingly find that the MMSE values in the fatigued state are lower than that in the normal state, which reflects the increase of regularity in SSVEP signals during the fatigued state. That is, a greater synchronization of neural assemblies is required to realize cognitive impairment when fatigue happens. The knowledge for the understanding of the brain fatigued behavior underlying SSVEP-based BCI experiments is gained by our analysis.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/122/40010", "venue": null, "journal": "EPL", "mag_id": "2836641395", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126186565"}

In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical feature learning framework for face recognition under makeup changes. We observe that hierarchical structures exist among heterogeneous gaps. That is, features tend to be more invariant on the higher level, and less invariant on the lower level. To better model the structures of domain gaps, we seek for transformations of multi-level features by jointly learning level-wise transformations. Specifically, we adopt both strategies of feature-augmentation and feature-transformation, and combine them in a hierarchical framework. For the feature-augmentation strategy, a rich representation is assembled by features from coarse-to-fine levels. For the featuretransformation strategy, transformations are jointly learned to minimize the domain gap in each level. Further, to preserve the hierarchical structure of domain gap, level-wise regularizations are introduced to model the diverse heterogeneous patterns among different feature levels.

For unrestricted faces in the wild, this is a very challenging task. Besides significant degradation due to images that have large variations in pose, illumination, expression, aging, and occlusions, it also suffers from large-scale ever-expanding data needed to perform one-to-many recognition task. In this paper, we propose a face verification method by learning face similarities using a Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet). Instead of extracting features from each face image separately, our ConvNet model jointly extracts relational visual features from two face images in comparison. We train four hybrid ConvNet models to learn how to distinguish similarities between the face pair of four different face portions and join them at top-layer classifier level. We use binary-class classifier at top-layer level to identify the similarity of face pairs which includes a conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Native Bayes, and another ConvNet. There are 3 face pairing configurations discussed in this paper. Results from experiments using Labeled face in the Wild (LFW) and CelebA datasets indicate that our hybrid ConvNet increases the face verification accuracy by as much as 27% when compared to individual ConvNet approach. We also found that Lateral face pair configuration yields the best LFW test accuracy on a very strict test protocol without any face alignment using MLP as top-layer classifier at 87.89%, which on-par with the state-of-the-arts.

Our objectives were to: 1) identify and delineate individual redberry juniper (Juniperus pinchotii) plants from surrounding live vegetation using the support vector machine method for classifying two-dimensional (2D) geospatial imagery with a 1-m spatial resolution at two sites; and 2) develop regression models relating imagery-derived and fieldmeasured single tree canopy area and diameter for dry AGB estimation. The regression results show that there were very close and significant relationships between field measured juniper plant AGB and canopy area derived from the image classification with r2 > 0.90.

The kTSP prediction rule is the aggregation of voting among such individual two-feature decision rules based on order switching. kTSP, like its predecessor, Top Scoring Pair (TSP), is a parameter-free classifier relying only on ranking of a small subset of features, rendering it robust to noise and potentially easy to interpret in biological terms.

Analyzing such time series transcriptome data can be useful to understand biological mechanisms responding to stress. One important question is which genes are related to which stress types. This question can hardly be answered by analyzing transcriptome from single experiments since too many genes are affected by stress, i.e., too many false positives. Performing integrated analysis of transcriptome from multiple experiments can certainly improve the situation. However, there are only small number of samples available while the dimension, i.e., the number of genes, is very high. Thus, to perform integrated analysis of stress time series data, a new method is needed. In this study, we designed and implemented a novel machine learning method for predicting stress related genes from heterogeneous time series transcriptome data. Our method performs feature embedding of time series data in the form of minimizing data loss, and uses a logical relevance layer that learns a stress-gene correlation weight matrix with cross-entropy and group effect constraint. The weight matrix learned in the training stage is used to predict stress related genes with CMCL (Confident Multiple Choice Learning) loss to prevent parameter overfitting. In experiments with Arabidopsis transcriptome data with four stress types, heat, cold, salt, and drought, our analysis ranked stress related genes higher compared to Fisher\u2019s method with DEG p-values. In addition, our prediction model showed better performance than Random Forest and SVM, in terms of stress type prediction.

Most score-level fusion schemes discussed in the literature require the processing (i.e., feature extraction and matching) of every modality prior to invoking the fusion scheme. This paper presents a framework for dynamic classifier selection and fusion based on the quality of the gallery and probe images associated with each modality with multiple classifiers. The quality assessment algorithm for each biometric modality computes a quality vector for the gallery and probe images that is used for classifier selection. These vectors are used to train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for decision making.

Since fusion is required only when all unimodal classifiers are rejected by the SVM classifiers, the average computational time of the proposed framework is significantly reduced.

This problem is challenging due to the availability of sentence only annotations, the unreliability of concept detectors, and the lack of training samples for many words. Facing these challenges, we propose a Semantic Aware Transcription (SAT) framework based on Random Forest classifiers. It takes concept detection results as input, and outputs a distribution of English words. SAT uses video, sentence pairs for training. It hierarchically learns node splits by grouping semantically similar words, measured by a continuous skip-gram language model. This not only addresses the sparsity of training samples per word, but also yields semantically reasonable errors during transcription. SAT provides a systematic way to measure the relatedness of a concept detector to real words, which helps us understand the relationship between current visual detectors and words in a semantic space.

The objective of this research was to forecast electricity consumption by using hybrid models (mixing the Box-Jenkins modeling and a support vector regression model). Three Rajabhat Universities: Nakorn Ratchatsima, Ubon Ratchathani and Loei, were included in the modeling. Time series data on the energy consumption on a monthly basis, covering the period from January, 2006 to September, 2017, were available on the website of the Energy Ministry. Data for the period of January, 2006 to December, 2016 were used for our research purposes, and R-language based forecast model that we developed was used for analysis. The most suitable model was selected by using the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). The most suitable model obtained from the data series from January to September, 2017 was used to measure the accuracy of the forecast produced. Our results indicated that the proposed model was more efficient, with greater accuracy, in forecasting the energy consumption than the conventional model currently used in the universities participating in the study.

Taken together the features we have used in our method, total contact energies among multiple mutations have a strong impact in predicting resistance as they are crucial in understanding the interactions of HIV mutants.

Time series of different meteorological variables measured over thirteen years in Botucatu were used for training and validating ANN and SVM. Seven different sets of input variables were tested and evaluated, which were chosen based on statistical models reported in the literature. Relative Mean Bias Error (rMBE), Relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE), determination coefficient (R 2 ) and \u201cd\u201d Willmott index were used to evaluate ANN and SVM models. When compared to statistical models which use the same set of input variables (R 2 between 0.22 and 0.78), ANN and SVM show higher values of R 2 (hourly models between 0.52 and 0.88; daily models between 0.42 and 0.91). Considering the input variables, atmospheric transmissivity of global radiation (kt), integrated solar constant (H sc ) and insolation ratio (n/N, n is sunshine duration and N is photoperiod) were the most relevant in ANN and SVM models. The rMBE and rRMSE values in the two time partitions of SVM models are lower than those obtained with ANN. Hourly ANN and SVM models have higher rRMSE values than daily models. Optimal performance with hourly models was obtained with ANN4 h (rMBE = 12.24%, rRMSE = 23.99% and \u201cd\u201d = 0.96) and SVM4 h (rMBE = 1.75%, rRMSE = 20.10% and \u201cd\u201d = 0.96).

Suicide has become a serious worldwide epidemic. Early detection of individual suicide risk in population is important for reducing suicide rates. Traditional methods are ineffective in identifying suicide risk in time, suggesting a need for novel techniques. This paper proposes to detect suicide risk on social media using a Chinese suicide dictionary. Methods. To build the Chinese suicide dictionary, eight researchers were recruited to select initial words from 4,653 posts published on Sina Weibo (the largest social media service provider in China) and two Chinese sentiment dictionaries (HowNet and NTUSD). Then, another three researchers were recruited to filter out irrelevant words. Finally, remaining words were further expanded using a corpus-based method. After building the Chinese suicide dictionary, we tested its performance in identifying suicide risk on Weibo. First, we made a comparison of the performance in both detecting suicidal expression in Weibo posts and evaluating individual levels of suicide risk between the dictionary-based identifications and the expert ratings. Second, to differentiate between individuals with high and non-high scores on self-rating measure of suicide risk (Suicidal Possibility Scale, SPS), we built Support Vector Machines (SVM) models on the Chinese suicide dictionary and the Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (SCLIWC) program, respectively. After that, we made a comparison of the classification performance between two types of SVM models. Results and Discussion. Dictionary-based identifications were significantly correlated with expert ratings in terms of both detecting suicidal expression (r = 0.507) and evaluating individual suicide risk (r = 0.455). For the differentiation between individuals with high and non-high scores on SPS, the Chinese suicide dictionary (t1: F 1 = 0.48; t2: F 1 = 0.56) produced a more accurate identification than SCLIWC (t1: F 1 = 0.41; t2: F 1 = 0.48) on different observation windows. Conclusions. This paper confirms that, using social media, it is possible to implement real-time monitoring individual suicide risk in population.

Traditionally, sediment rating curves (SRCs) based on univariate linear regression of discharge and SSC (or the logarithms thereof) are used but alternative approaches (e.g. fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, etc.) exist. This paper presents a comparison of the applicability of traditional SRCs, generalized linear models (GLMs) and non-parametric regression using Random Forests (RF) and Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) applied to a dataset of SSC obtained for four subcatchments (0\u00b708, 41, 145 and 445 km2) in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The observed SSCs are highly variable and range over six orders of magnitude. For these data, traditional SRCs performed inadequately due to the over-simplification of relating SSC solely to discharge. Instead, the multitude of acting processes required more flexibility to model these nonlinear relationships. Thus, alternative advanced machine learning techniques that have been successfully applied in other disciplines were tested. GLMs provide the option of including other relevant process variables (e.g. rainfall intensities and temporal information) but require the selection of the most appropriate predictors. For the given datasets, the investigated variable selection methods produced inconsistent results. All proposed GLMs showed an inferior performance, whereas RF and QRF proved to be very robust and performed favourably for reproducing sediment dynamics. QRF additionally provides estimates on the accuracy of the predictions and thus allows the assessment of uncertainties in the estimated sediment yield that is not commonly found in other methods. The capabilities of RF and QRF concerning the interpretation of predictor effects are also outlined.

It can threaten thousands of plants with a persistent and propagative manner. Early disease detection is expected to be able to control the disease spread, to facilitate management practice, and further to guarantee accompanying economic benefits. Hyperspectral imaging, a powerful remote sensing tool, has been widely applied in different science fields, especially in plant science domain. Rich spectral information makes disease detection possible before visible disease symptoms showing up. In the paper, a new hyperspectral analysis proximal sensing method based on generative adversarial nets (GAN) is proposed, named as outlier removal auxiliary classifier generative adversarial nets (OR-AC-GAN). It is an all-in-one method, which integrates the tasks of plant segmentation, spectrum classification and image classification. The model focuses on image pixels, which can effectively visualize potential plant disease positions, and keep experts\u2019 attention on these diseased pixels. Meanwhile, this new model can improve the performances of classic spectrum band selection methods, including the maximum variance principle component analysis (MVPCA), fast density-peak-based clustering, and similarity-based unsupervised band selection. Selecting spectrum wavebands reasonably is an important preprocessing step in spectroscopy/hyperspectral analysis applications, which can reduce the computation time for potential in-field applications, affect the prediction results and make the hyperspectral analysis results explainable. In the experiment, the hyperspectral reflectance imaging system covers the spectral range from 395 nm to 1005 nm. The proprosed model makes use of 83 bands to do the analysis. The plant level classification accuracy gets 96.25% before visible symptoms shows up. The pixel prediction false positive rate in healthy plants gets as low as 1.47%. Combining the OR-AC-GAN with three existing band selection algorithms, the performance of these band selection models can be significantly improved. Among them, MVPCA can leverage only 8 spectrum bands to get the same plant level classification accuracy as OR-AC-GAN, and the pixel prediction false positive rate in healthy plants is 1.57%, which is also comparable to OR-AC-GAN. This new model can be potentially transferred to other plant diseases detection applications. Its property to boost the performance of existing band selection methods can also accelerate the in-field applications of hyperspectral imaging technology.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6416251", "pubmed_id": "30867450", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-40066-y", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2922338032", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["85216329", "2823036", "85019598", "109102905", "18000844", "215641634", "113265395", "83885727", "9476837", "84907416", "95981218", "109496516", "15743704", "114694234", "73467710", "54335344", "32058941", "40779805", "3357914", "19629685", "20337877", "28493100", "35777", "5045085", "4943648", "1536455", "12858105", "59336191", "17031414", "10667545", "9993730", "6742904", "785970", "1033682", "195908774", "3074096", "2057420", "1099052", "52112233", "67021928", "9555836", "97350694", "96237169", "84999374", "206550568"], "inbound_citations": ["207892639", "207951675"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:76662262"}

Identifying color laser printers will be a step for media forensics. This paper presents a new method to identify color laser printers with printed color images. Since different printer companies use different manufactural systems, printed documents from different printers have little difference in visual. Analyzing this artifact, we can identify the color laser printers. First, high-frequency components of images are extracted from original images with discrete wavelet transform. After calculating the gray-level co-occurrence matrix of the components, we extract some statistical features. Then, these features are applied to train and classify the support vector machine for identifying the color laser printer. In the experiment, total 2,597 images of 7 printers (HP, Canon, Xerox DCC400, Xerox DCC450, Xerox DCC5560, Xerox DCC6540, Konica), are tested to classify the color laser printer.

The main contribution of this paper is the proposed algorithm, termed as Efficient LOO-CV-based RELM (ELOO-RELM), that can effectively and efficiently update the LOO-CV error with every regularization parameter and automatically select the optimal model with limited user intervention. Rigorous analysis of computational complexity shows that the ELOO-RELM, including the tuning process, can achieve similar efficiency as the original RELM with pre-defined parameter, in which both scale linearly with the size of the training data. An early termination criterion is also introduced to further speed up the learning process. Experimentation studies on benchmark datasets show that the ELOO-RELM can achieve comparable generalization performance as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) with significantly higher learning efficiency.

We model morphology with a novel formulation of Conditional Random Fields, a hierarchical latent-state CRF, to capture the highly varying compartment-based structure of the neurons (soma-axon-dendrites).

This paper presents a novel Joint-bEhavior-and-Social-relaTion-infERable (JESTER) embedding method to leverage the user reviewing behavior and social relations for cold-start fraud review detection.

Thus, a cold-start fraud review can be effectively detected accordingly.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme using tensor super-resolution with adversarial generative nets (TSRGAN), to generate large high-quality images by exploring tensor structures. Essentially, the super resolution process of TSRGAN is based on tensor representation. First, we impose tensor structures for concise image representation, which is superior in capturing the pixel proximity information and the spatial patterns of elementary objects in images, over the vectorization preprocess in existing works. Secondly, we propose TSRGAN that integrates deep convolutional generative adversarial networks and tensor super-resolution in a cascading manner, to generate high-quality images from random distributions. More specifically, we design a tensor super-resolution process that consists of tensor dictionary learning and tensor coefficients learning. Finally, on three datasets, the proposed TSRGAN generates images with more realistic textures, compared with state-of-the-art adversarial autoencoders and super-resolution methods.

Specifically, our model learns a split representation that contains both rotation related and unrelated parts. We train neural networks by jointly predicting image rotations and discriminating individual instances. In particular, our model decouples the rotation discrimination from instance discrimination, which allows us to improve the rotation prediction by mitigating the influence of rotation label noise, as well as discriminate instances without regard to image rotations.

On the analysis front, the equivalence of robustness and regularization, provides a robust optimization interpretation for the success of regularized SVMs. We use the this new robustness interpretation of SVMs to give a new proof of consistency of (kernelized) SVMs, thus establishing robustness as the reason regularized SVMs generalize well.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": "0803.3490", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1577069.1755834", "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol 10, 1485-1510, year 2009", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952392021,2153417333", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35737200", "463216", "14602774", "15917152", "8946639", "1436821", "1918482", "15978850", "16096318", "207165665", "1157797", "18368651", "206787478", "16740132", "1037391", "70866", "2116006", "119361583", "209831924", "16922649", "6356555", "8907195", "118302827", "2240256", "4404806", "61563242", "2074752", "14431545", "1421864", "39159893", "117819015", "53917004", "118825644"], "inbound_citations": ["51613166", "30747182", "19795074", "3757639", "9746839", "6687563", "53115393", "31928041", "2725673", "10732961", "25022743", "47019332", "18218606", "6199691", "9442999", "127392293", "52163004", "53092122", "31144859", "13753923", "17882261", "162168439", "11266629", "112796800", "202636975", "51894817", "195346923", "121944045", "202118219", "11730262", "39489242", "135464475", "81979087", "88522864", "238747", "7502324", "56025076", "211562347", "195785324", "22412689", "173991112", "17000036", "13196621", "119184054", "17260080", "2202800", "16010367", "1139917", "52898014", "69911238", "52944808", "198919398", "13900194", "5895139", "14382897", "9235819", "53717167", "13451211", "3222593", "14519548", "26821646", "10799996", "27756290", "9939024", "39148792", "3305483", "18502625", "15016755", "13698293", "2541531", "17035219", "26752191", "8500572", "6350280", "10298334", "37761350", "182953083", "174797866", "1842392", "210847851", "18746498", "6782109", "207324435", "53389550", "174798269", "14745019", "57373888", "45856872", "29538501", "207064849", "1017150", "9032783", "55727498", "13691940", "51754967", "9901535", "202783714", "189999399", "5671691", "211044046", "7498889", "30637106", "53361747", "1618287", "38189362", "5155923", "16683317", "1710205", "88497105", "2450041", "126164576", "215053183", "212656124", "165163784", "13323943", "8658750", "121186345", "54697097", "7638532", "41226815", "1098420", "36601807", "16370653", "49210302", "37082741", "6295454", "16622672", "88517873", "210023720", "14662401", "49552371", "173991107", "26515482", "43715792", "600755", "134650602", "67855552", "59406334", "58564903", "58007100", "7607796", "67857470", "11852825", "59523629", "35063329", "18786252", "208548469", "3450374", "208138377", "36864073", "15988644", "195883008", "35558930", "10573761", "215649306", "89615542", "52902755", "212628638", "3530250", "2879330", "2649314", "15024318", "18168550", "11832005", "25261621", "8307266", "15054398", "13941991", "6121854", "207949932", "1715443", "189898199", "3659467", "18314334", "7256400", "8598186", "59222776", "36982611", "335556", "19014418", "5707980"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3118889"}

Due to a large number of generated OCT images for each patient, a manual image analysis can be time-consuming and error-prone, which can consequently affect the timeliness and quality of the diagnosis. Therefore, in recent years, a variety of methods, based prevalently on deep learning, have been proposed for the automatic segmentation of retinal layers. In our study, the U-Net type model with a ResNet based encoder, pretrained on ImageNet dataset is utilized. In addition, the model is combined with postprocessing step to obtain segmented layer boundaries. The modified versions of U-Net type model have already been applied to various non-medical imaging segmentation tasks, achieving outstanding results. To investigate whether the pretrained U-Net type model contributes to improvement of retinal layer segmentation, two models are trained and validated on 23 volumes of OCT images with age related macular degeneration (AMD): the U-Net model with pretrained ResNet34 encoder on ImageNet dataset and the original U-Net model, trained from the scratch.

Recently, ensemble learning has been applied to improve the generalization ability of existing anomaly detection methods. In an anomaly ensemble framework, diversity is essential for building a powerful ensemble method to obtain impressive performance. However, most studies use heuristic techniques to improve the diversity of ensembles, and it generally leads to limited diversity. To obtain improved diversity, we propose a diversity aware-based sequential ensemble method (called D-SEM) for anomaly detection. Specifically, our proposed method divides the ensemble diversity into two parts: sample diversity and model diversity. For sample diversity, we introduce the subsampling technique to implement preliminary generation of diverse datasets for training. For model diversity, we design an ensemble-based optimization model to learn base classifiers with improved diversity. Furthermore, an unsupervised diversity measure is proposed to quantitatively assess diversity and an anomaly pruning strategy is utilized to successively eliminate pseudo-anomalies. Based on the inclusion of sample diversity and model diversity, the proposed D-SEM method obtains better generalization ability for anomaly detection.

We assessed the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) to predict the gradual response of Drosophila ORs. We compared a 27-dimensional variant of the EVA descriptor against a set of 1467 descriptors provided by the eDragon software package, and against a 32-dimensional subset thereof that has been proposed as the basis for an odor metric consisting of 32 descriptors (HADDAD).

The low-dimensional EVA and HADDAD feature sets predicted odor-OR interactions with similar accuracy. Adding charge and polarizability information to the EVA descriptor did not improve the results but rather decreased predictive power. Post-hoc in vivo measurements confirmed these results.

Previous efforts to reduce dissolved solids in upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) streams often focused on reducing suspended-sediment transport to streams, but few studies have investigated the relationship between suspended sediment and salinity, or evaluated which watershed characteristics might be associated with this relationship. Are there catchment properties that may help in identifying areas where control of suspended sediment will also reduce salinity transport to streams? A random forests classification analysis was performed on topographic, climate, land cover, geology, rock chemistry, soil, and hydrologic information in 163 UCRB catchments. Two random forests models were developed in this study: one for exploring stream and catchment characteristics associated with stream sites where dissolved solids increase with increasing suspended-sediment concentration, and the other for predicting where these sites are located in unmonitored reaches. Results of variable importance from the exploratory random forests models indicate that no simple source, geochemical process, or transport mechanism can easily explain the relationship between dissolved solids and suspended sediment concentrations at UCRB monitoring sites. Among the most important watershed characteristics in both models were measures of soil hydraulic conductivity, soil erodibility, minimum catchment elevation, catchment area, and the silt component of soil in the catchment. Predictions at key locations in the basin were combined with observations from selected monitoring sites, and presented in map-form to give a complete understanding of where catchment sediment control practices would also benefit control of dissolved solids in streams.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/w10060676", "venue": null, "journal": "Water", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2803913164", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["128791451", "130194171", "42169834", "129649367", "59504945", "129937467", "105729179", "24285580", "129752145", "128504473", "89141", "3626971", "39361255", "14327012", "156523734", "51842487", "17917874", "9417065", "134369579", "127686216", "129620454", "126856569"], "inbound_citations": ["155980866"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134134300"}

The hardness of coated tools is determined by the coating process parameters. Traditionally, optimization to obtain the best coating performance of the parameters in a coating process was done by trial and error approach. However the traditional approach has raised issues with regards to cost and customization. In this research, these two issues were addressed by using a computational intelligence approach to develop a model for predicting the output responses in order to identify the optimal parameters used in coating process. Previous studies have shown that this approach was successfully adopted for optimization purpose in many types of domains. However, it was not yet applied in the coating process domain. Thus, two methods from computational intelligence approach were applied, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The comparisons of the performances of the developed models were conducted based on predictive performance measurements such as percentage error, mean squared error (MSE), co-efficient determination (R2), and model accuracy and complexity. The results showed that, SVM obtained better predictive performances and less complicated in comparison to other prediction models. As a conclusion, SVM has demonstrated its capability in predicting the hardness performance of coating process and outperformed the other models.

We show that by using agglomerative clustering on 5 test multitracks, the entire set of audio features incorrectly clusters 35.08% of the audio tracks, while the subset of audio features incorrectly clusters only 7.89% of the audio tracks. Furthermore, we also show that using the entire set of audio features, ten incorrect subgroups are created.

An effective way to address the inevitable data sparsity in certain applications, such as in low-resource speech language identification, is transfer learning, which uses the knowledge learned from tasks with large labeled data in settings of limited data. Motivated by the fact that various languages share common phonetic and phonotactic characteristics, we explore transfer learning systems that employ various neural network architectures. We leverage readily available large datasets for creating robust instantiations of language identification models using feed-forward neural networks.

AOD can also be predicted by short term forecasts with commonly called Deterministic weather prediction models (DMs). The skill of DMs in reproducing remotely sensed observations when averaged over monthly time scales over West Asia is rather limited due to significant uncertainties in inputs and complexity of dust, which is the dominant type of aerosols in the region. Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs), which require much less computational expenses than DMs, can be used. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) AOD as the representative of response variable, MLAs, especially Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), outperformed DMs on monthly time scale. MLAs have yielded lower prediction error (RMSE) and higher correlation with observations than DMs. In addition, findings disclosed that DMs, especially MACC, have failed to simulate observed AOD values over western Iran where the Zagros Mountains prevent advection of fine dust particles to the east of the study area. Prediction errors of MLAs and DMs along with major DB AOD peaks, over Iraq, can be traced back to the rough resolution of variable datasets, omission of some unknown influential predictors representing the life cycle of dust and/or other aerosols, and scarcity of extreme cases.

In the constrained clustering style algorithms, known labels are first converted to pair wise constraints (Must-Link and Cannot-Link), then a constrained cut is computed as a tradeoff between minimizing the cut cost and maximizing the constraint satisfaction. Both techniques are evaluated by their ability to recover the ground truth labeling, i.e. by 0/1 loss function either directly on the labels or on the pair wise relations derived from the labels. These two fields have developed separately, but in this paper, we show that they are indeed related.

This problem can be largely attributed to the fact that a state representation needs to be learned as a part of learning control policies, which can only be done through fitting expected returns based on observed rewards. While the reward function provides information on the desirability of the state of the world, it does not necessarily provide information on how to distill a good, general representation of that state from the sensory observations. State representation learning objectives can be used to help learn such a representation. While many of these objectives have been proposed, they are typically not directly combined with reinforcement learning algorithms. We investigate several methods for integrating state representation learning into reinforcement learning. In these methods, the state representation learning objectives help regularize the state representation during the reinforcement learning, and the reinforcement learning itself is viewed as a crucial state representation learning objective and allowed to help shape the representation. Using autonomous racing tests in the TORCS simulator, we show how the integrated methods quickly learn policies that generalize to new environments much better than deep reinforcement learning without state representation learning.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/LRA.2018.2800101", "venue": "IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters", "journal": "IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2790924949", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["205242740", "1616437", "352650", "1658773", "17023340", "206945076", "14717992", "5980504", "206548935", "1731857", "16561904", "6026836", "12366835", "7081692", "9226593", "3248358", "6208256", "59809750", "5821299", "13298214", "1907310", "16920486", "22684422", "8693414", "12559116", "4650427", "11965834", "205441266", "5808102", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": ["201103910", "3707619", "85531260", "61153672", "168169937", "212646464", "202561831", "150077659", "57764243", "198985891", "201814270", "203734727", "38464943", "202766622", "53085539", "210971944", "57755115", "54178920", "212982070"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3549024"}

In this paper, we discuss a Twin Neural Network (Twin NN) architecture for learning from large unbalanced datasets. The objective functions of the networks in the Twin NN are designed to realize the idea of the Twin SVM with non-parallel decision boudaries for the respective classes, while also being able to reduce model complexity. The Twin NN optimizes the feature map, allowing for better discrimination between classes. The paper also discusses an extension of the Twin NN for multiclass datasets. This architecture trains as many neural networks as the number of classes, and has the additional advantage that it does not have any hyper-parameter which requires tuning.

In this context, there is a large interest in developing strategies to recommend relevant and useful tags for a target object, improving the quality of the generated tags and of the Information Retrieval (IR) services that use them as data source. Several existing tag recommendation strategies treat the problem as a multiple candidate tag ranking problem, recommending tags that are in top positions of the generated ranking. This motivates the use of Learning-to- Rank (L2R) based strategies to automatically \u201clearn\u201d good tag ranking functions. However, previous work has explored only three di\ufb00erent L2R techniques, namely, Genetic Programming (GP), RankSV M and RankBoost, comparing at most two of them with respect to e\ufb00ectiveness. In contrast, we here perform a much more comprehensive comparative study of the use of L2R techniques for tag recommendation. Speci\ufb01cally, we compare eight di\ufb00erent L2R techniques, namely, Random Forest (RF), MART, \u03bb-MART, ListNet, AdaRank and the three aforementioned techniques, with respect to both e\ufb00ectiveness (i.e., precision, NDCG) and e\ufb03ciency (i.e., time complexity). We perform experiments using real data collected from \ufb01ve popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, Bibsonomy, LastFM, MovieLens, YahooVideo and YouTube. Our results show that the best L2R based strategy signi\ufb01cantly outperforms the best state-of-the-art unsupervised technique (by up to 29% in NDCG). Moreover, unlike existing comparisons of di\ufb00erent L2R techniques in other domains, we \ufb01nd that, for tag recommendation, there is a clear winning group of methods (RF, MART and \u03bb-MART) with a slight advantage of two (RF and \u03bb-MART) over the other, with gains in NDCG ranging from 4% to 12% over the best of the remaining alternatives considered. We also \ufb01nd that recommendation time, despite some variation among the di\ufb00erent methods, is under 1.3 seconds, on average (in the worst case scenario), for all L2R methods, which con\ufb01rms the feasibility of the L2R approach for tag recommendation.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "JIDM", "journal": "JIDM", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1904088687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["57323334", "33520325", "14427846", "89141", "2643537", "207163577", "5763769", "987796", "16692650", "7955044", "343210", "16710202", "5155714", "9551273", "9542680", "14121708", "2627841", "207177737", "207167403", "7564979", "440027", "5552139", "14583978", "1662064"], "inbound_citations": ["7989054", "207835402", "17997022", "16369243", "1062024", "18813971"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38097220"}

Many predicting models were upgraded by academy investigators to predict stock price. Despite this, after reviewing the past research, there are several negative aspects in the previous approaches, namely: (1) stringent statistical hypotheses are essential; (2) human interventions take part in predicting process; and (3) an appropriate range is complex to be discovered. Due to the problems mentioned, we plan to provide a new integrated approach based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). ABC is employed to optimize the technical indicators for forecasting instruments. To achieve a more precise approach, ANFIS has been applied to predict long-run price fluctuations of the stocks. SVM was applied to create the nexus between the stock price and technical indicator and to further decrease the forecasting errors of the presented model, whose performance is examined by five criteria. The comparative outcomes, obtained by running on datasets taken from 50 largest companies of the U.S. Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2018, have clearly demonstrated that the suggested approach outperforms the other methods in accuracy and quality.

It makes use of a face-only photographic view of each patient and might thus have been considered insufficient for an accurate evaluation of the aesthetic result. So far, there are not many studies reporting the value of side-views in the objective evaluation of the aesthetic result after BCCT. Therefore the purpose of this work was to compare the input value of a set of asymmetry measures captured on patients photographic side-views with the aesthetic evaluation obtained by the software (face-view only) and a consensus expert panel classification. Methods: Photographic face-views and bilateral side-views of 63 patients, taken after BCCT, were subjectively evaluated by a panel of experts (consensus), objectively evaluated by BCCT.core software (face-views only) and by an extension of the BCCT.core developed to make use of face and bilateral side-views. We captured a set of previously determined features on face-views with the BCCT.core classic software and a new set of asymmetry measurements were taken over the bilateral side-views: breast size difference, nipple distance to breast contour, nipple distance to thoracic wall, nipple distance evaluation, breast compliance evaluation and breast ptosis difference. An initial classification was given to each patient using features captured from face-views and subsequently bilateral side-views measurements were added and a final result was obtained using specific classification methods for this kind of data, namely, Support Vector Machines (SVM). The aesthetic result was classified in four classes: excellent, good, fair and poor. To test the obtained results, agreement between the consensus expert panel, face-view only evaluation and face and side-views evaluation was computed using a Misclassication Error Rate (MER) and a weighted MER. This method is based on the comparison of the classifications of the consensus (ground truth) and classifier patient result, in that zero means all classifications are correct and 1 means none of the classifications is correct; the weighted MER takes into account the fact that humans tend to use more the middle classes in detriment of extreme classes, which led us to adopt higher costs to the misclassifications of the cases classified as excellent or poor. Results: The test results concerning the misclassification error using face-views only was 0.37 and 0.60 for MER and weighted MER respectively. With the addition of bilateral side-views the misclassification error was 0.32 and 0.53. Conclusions: We have developed a new model for the assessment of the aesthetic outcome of BCCT, with the addition of features obtained from patients\u2019 photographic side-views. Although these preliminary results are better, the difference between the face-view only evaluation and the face-view and side-view evaluation is not statistically significant. However they suggest that asymmetry measures captured on side-views may add some value to the objective evaluation of the aesthetic result after BCCT.

While margin-based strategies have been dominant for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), most methods are based on heuristics and lack a solid theoretical support.

The model change is defined as the difference between the current model parameters and the updated parameters obtained with the enlarged training set. Inspired by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) update rule, we measure the change as the gradient of the loss at a candidate point.

The operating states are forecasted with on-line time series prediction model based on the online combined kernel functions Support Vector Regression (SVR). Compared with batch SVR prediction models, online SVR has a good real-time processing performance. However, it is hard for a single kernel SVR to obtain accurate result for the complicated nonlinear and non-stationary time series. Therefore, a combined online SVR with different kernels containing global and local kernels is developed for fault prediction. For general fault modes, the fault trend feature can be extracted by global kernel. On the other hand, local kernel can reflect and revise the local changes of data characteristics in neighborhood. It has realized better result than the method of the single SVR.

The present study approaches the phenomenon from the predictive analytics perspective by employing contemporary machine learning techniques to discover the most important corruption perception predictors based on enriched/enhanced nonlinear models with a high level of predictive accuracy. Specifically, within the multiclass classification modeling setting that is employed herein, the Random Forest (an ensemble-type machine learning algorithm) is found to be the most accurate prediction/classification model, followed by Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks.

Due to the aggressive nature of this beetle, early detection is critical in its eradication and can be facilitated by species distribution modelling. That said, several issues need to be addressed in order to increase the predictive accuracy. In this study, the effects of sampling bias such as positive spatial autocorrelation and data prevalence (i.e., proportion of presence to absence points) were investigated in an EAB dataset. A filtering distance threshold approximating the EAB's dispersal range was used to minimize the effects of autocorrelation and the most appropriate prevalence was determined during the modelling process. To analyze the impact of environmental and anthropogenic predictors on the distribution of the EAB, logistic regression, Random Forest (RF) and a hybrid of Random Forest and generalized linear models known as the Random Generalized Linear Model (RGLM) were applied to EAB data from 2006 to 2012 across Ontario. Approximately 80% of the EAB samples were used as training, with 20% as validation. Ultimately, three risk maps were created from the 2006\u20132012 EAB data by using the coefficients from logistic regression as weights and an automated risk map tool for the RF and RGLM models. High-risk areas were identified from the risk maps for species prevalence and distribution monitoring. From these, precautionary measures can be implemented to stem the expansion of the beetle and thus reduce the destruction of the Ash tree species. All models identified June wind speed as the most important predictor variable followed by population centres.

The objective of this study is to determine whether an instrumented hammer may be used to retrieve information on the material properties around the osteotome tip. A hammer equipped with a piezoelectric force sensor was used to impact 100 samples of different materials and thicknesses. A model-based inversion technique was developed based on the analysis of two indicators derived from the analysis of the variation of the force as a function of time in order to i) classify the samples depending on their material types, ii) determine the materials stiffness and iii) estimate the samples thicknesses. The model resulting from the classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning techniques can efficiently predict the material of a new sample, with an estimated 89% prediction performance.

Early identification of faults in electrical motors, particularly in induction motors has become necessary in the industrial environment. Among the components of induction motor, bearing plays a crucial role and the fault occurring in it has been considered as the main contributors to the origin of failure. In most of the research work, single hole is considered as a faulty factor, but the requirement to detect the physical location of fault in bearing is becoming necessary and increasing over years. Even though various analysis methods including vibrational analysis have been used to detect the bearing faults, identification and diagnosis of fault still needs further research. Hence, in the present paper, the bearing fault analysis is carried out and an identification method of localization and the number of holes is proposed by considering the physical location of the fault. Experimental results are obtained for two cases of bearing failure; location of fault and number of holes. At first, the frequency domain features are obtained from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of load current.

SMYTHE This volume is a comprehensive presentation of the latest work of Paul Thagard and his research group on coherence theory, an area of inquiry to which the author has made ground-breaking contributions for over a decade. Coherence theory is a peculiar synthesis of philosophy and cognitive science that approaches problems in terms of the satisfaction of multiple constraints within networks of highly interconnected elements. The basic ideas of coherence theory would seem to have broad appeal across a number of areas of contemporary thought. They clearly resonate with the meaning holism of Quine's two dogmas of empiricism in philosophy, with notions of distributed cognition and constraint satisfaction models of decision-making in human cognition, with the current popularity of neural network and connectionist models in the cognitive and neurosciences, and, more generally, with the growing interest in nonlinear dynamics and related phenomena across a wide range of disciplines. The main aim of the present work is to extend the reach of coherence theory beyond its usual applications in cognition and epistemology to questions of ontology, ethics, politics, emotion, social consensus, and probabilistic reasoning. Thagard makes a persuasive if not wholly convincing argument that all of these domains can be thought about in roughly similar ways. At the heart of Thagard's main argument is a surprisingly simple conceptual structure. One begins with a set of elements - propositional and other types of representations - that are linked via numerically weighted relations of coherence (positive constraints) and incoherence (negative constraints). The goal of coherence-based reasoning is to partition the elements into two disjoint sets - accepted and rejected elements - in such a way that overall coherence within each set is maximized. Connectionist algorithms can be applied to compute coherence in an iterative fashion for any completely specified network of elements. The underlying simplicity of this explanatory framework is at first striking, given the wide range of problems to which Thagard subsequently applies it. This initial impression of simplicity quickly evaporates, however, as one reads beyond the introductory chapters. Thagard's basic conceptual structure requires substantial embellishment to deal with various specific issues and areas of application. Thus, we learn that epistemological issues require one to distinguish among five distinct types of coherence: explanatory, analogical, deductive, perceptual, and conceptual. Ethical reasoning adds considerations of deliberative coherence. Understanding emotion requires supplementing relations of cognitive coherence with valence relations and introduces considerations of metacoherence. Consensus formation is based, not just on coherence, but on the vicissitudes of communication and information exchange. Then there is the matter of probabilistic reasoning which, as Thagard shows, can be accommodated within coherence networks only with considerable difficulty. Despite the complexity of the issues it treats, this is not at all a difficult book to read. Thagard has the knack for explaining difficult ideas in readily understandable language. However, his frequent crossing of disciplinary boundaries makes it a challenging task at times to evaluate his theory. Is it primarily a theory of human cognition, of philosophical epistemology, or is it mainly intended as a new procedure for addressing philosophical questions? It is perhaps all of these at once. This kind of blending of psychological and philosophical issues is a familiar feature of the work of contemporary philosophers writing about cognitive science. It is also somewhat reminiscent of the style of thought of many of the great philosophers of the past, who presented their epistemologies as part and parcel of their theories of mind. \u2026", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1037/h0088121", "venue": null, "journal": "Canadian Psychology", "mag_id": "2060679533", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144366369"}

In some regions, solar radiation is not always available throughout the day, or even week, depending on the weather and climate in the area.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm has been widely used in pulmonary nodule recognition, and the algorithm of Multiple Kernel Learning Support Vector Machine (MKL-SVM) has achieved good results therein. Based on grid search, however, the MKL-SVM algorithm needs long optimization time in course of parameter optimization; also its identification accuracy depends on the fineness of grid. In the paper, swarm intelligence is introduced and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is combined with MKL-SVM algorithm to be MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm so as to realize global optimization of parameters rapidly. In order to obtain the global optimal solution, different inertia weights such as constant inertia weight, linear inertia weight, and nonlinear inertia weight are applied to pulmonary nodules recognition. The experimental results show that the model training time of the proposed MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm is only 1/7 of the training time of the MKL-SVM grid search algorithm, achieving better recognition effect. Moreover, Euclidean norm of normalized error vector is proposed to measure the proximity between the average fitness curve and the optimal fitness curve after convergence. Through statistical analysis of the average of 20 times operation results with different inertial weights, it can be seen that the dynamic inertial weight is superior to the constant inertia weight in the MKL-SVM-PSO algorithm. In the dynamic inertial weight algorithm, the parameter optimization time of nonlinear inertia weight is shorter; the average fitness value after convergence is much closer to the optimal fitness value, which is better than the linear inertial weight.

Many engineering applications require the use of real-time decision-making and adaptation to new input. In this context a number of researchers have explored the use of adaptive connectionist systems and their applicability to solve engineering problems. This special issue includes selected contributions from the 13th Engineering Applications of Neural Network conference held in London, UK in 2012 (EANN 2012). The EANN conferences promote neural networks and associated techniques and the significant benefits that can be derived from their use. The conferences are not only for reporting advances, but also for showing how neural networks provide practical solutions in a wide range of applications. The first paper \u2018\u2018Neurocomputing techniques to dynamically forecast spatiotemporal air pollution data\u2019\u2019 by Antonios Papaleonidas and Lazaros Iliadis addresses the application of ANNs to the problem of forecasting dangerous levels of Ozone (O3) concentrations in the city center of Athens and more specifically in the \u2018\u2018Athinas\u2019\u2019 air quality monitoring station. While most existing approaches develop static ANN models optimal only under specific conditions, this work suggests a dynamic flexible and adjustable neural spatiotemporal model. The proposed approach takes in account not only the values of the primitive air pollutants and meteorological measurements, but it is also evaluates the influence of the existing O3 values in monitoring stations close to the one under examination. The results suggest that the optimal ANN model is using data from a small number of measurement\u2019s stations and it is capable of estimating O3 concentrations in real time mod. It also has the capacity of forecasting the same values for future time intervals. The second paper \u2018\u2018Information dynamics based selfadaptive reservoir for delay temporal memory tasks\u2019\u2019 by Sakyasingha Dasgupta, Florentin Worgotter and Poramate Manoonpong, investigates the application of recurrent neural networks of the reservoir computing (RC) type for time-series processing tasks and more specifically for delayed response tasks involving the transient memorization of information (temporal memory). The authors combine a generalized intrinsic plasticity rule with a local information dynamics based schema of reservoir neuron leak adaptation. Utilizing this combination they propose a self-adaptive reservoir (RNN) framework that maintains homeostasis through the generic intrinsic plasticity mechanism. The suggested framework has been evaluated on two standard benchmark tasks and the results demonstrate that the adaptation mechanism clearly outperforms static reservoirs. The authors also demonstrate the application of the self-adaptive reservoir (RNN) to the control of autonomous robotic agents through maze navigation experiments. The results show that the proposed network is effective for reconstructing the original trajectories and has the ability to cope with the variable temporal delay memory problem. The third paper \u2018\u2018Exploratory analysis of mobile phone traffic patterns using 1-dimensional Self Organizing Map (SOM), clustering and anomaly detection\u2019\u2019 by Pekka Kumpulainen, considers the problem of recognizing traffic patterns in continuously evolving mobile networks.

However, as conditions of machines change dynamically with time owing to machine aging, malfunction, or replacement, the concept of capturing the forecasting pattern from the datastream could drift unpredictably, so it is hard to find a robust forecasting method with high precision. Therefore, this work proposes an ensemble learning method with multiple classifier types and diversity for condition-based maintenance in manufacturing industries, to address the bias problem when using only one base classifier type. Aside from manipulating data diversity, this method includes multiple classifier types, dynamic weight adjusting, and databased adaption to concept drifts for offline learning models, to promote precision of the forecasting model and precisely detect and adapt to concept drifts. With these features, the proposed method requires powerful computing resources to efficiently respond to practical condition-based maintenance applications.

However the performance of the system is not optimal because of the computational complexity of the system, which occurs due to high dimensional correlated feature set after feature fusion. In this paper, a two stage feature selection method is proposed. In first stage feature selection, appropriate features are selected and fused together for speech emotion recognition. In second stage feature selection, optimal feature subset selection techniques [sequential forward selection (SFS) and sequential floating forward selection (SFFS)] are used to eliminate the curse of dimensionality problem due to high dimensional feature vector after feature fusion. Finally the emotions are classified by using several classifiers like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The performance of overall emotion recognition system is validated over Berlin and Spanish databases by considering classification rate. An optimal uncorrelated feature set is obtained by using SFS and SFFS individually. Results reveal that SFFS is a better choice as a feature subset selection method because SFS suffers from nesting problem i.e it is difficult to discard a feature after it is retained into the set. SFFS eliminates this nesting problem by making the set not to be fixed at any stage but floating up and down during the selection based on the objective function.

We will show that these gaze patterns (incl. blinking rate) are significantly influenced by the cognitive states of the interlocutors (speaking, listening, thinking, etc.), their respective roles in the conversation (e.g. instruction giver, respondent) as well as their social relationship (e.g. colleague, supervisor). This chapter provides insights into the (micro-)coordination of gaze with other components of attention management as well as methodologies for capturing and modeling behavioral regularities observed in experimental data. A particular emphasis is put on statistical models, which are able to learn behaviors in a data-driven way. We will introduce several statistical models of multimodal behaviors that can be trained on such multimodal signals and generate behaviors given perceptual cues. We will notably compare performances and properties of models which explicitly model the temporal structure of studied signals, and which relate them to internal cognitive states. In particular we study Semi-Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic Bayesian Networks and compare them to classifiers without sequential models (Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees).

In previous work, Hacker et al. found that cluster analysis is a useful tool to understand the underlying spatio-temporal dependencies present in system fault and use logs. However, the cluster analysis used for reducing spatio-temporal dependences should be fast and accurate to understand the underlying stochastic properties of these systems. K-means is a fast cluster analysis method, in which accuracy depends on the use of initialization algorithms that are usually serial and slow. In this paper we present two new parallel strategies for fast seeding K-means cluster analysis. Both strategies were tested on a real problem where the aim was to reduce spatial and temporal dependencies of failures on large supercomputer systems. The performance of both strategies were compared with five existing serial implementations: K-means implementations of 1) Lloyd (L); 2) McQueen (M); and 3) Hartigan - Wong (HW), all of them using Forgy seeding; 4) K-means++; and 5) Neural Gas clustering (NG), a more recent and sophisticated method. Our results show that our new Parallel Competitive Fitness approach reduces the Within Sum of Squares (WSQQ) measure, thus increasing cluster quality of the three K-means implementations: L; M; HW, and is 200 times faster than the existing serial K-means++. The existing serial and our new Parallel K-means++ have the lowest WSQQ. Our new Parallel K-means++ is twice as fast as the existing serial K-means++ method, and is 4 times faster than the NG method. Moreover, our new methods did not generate empty clusters, while NG did.

In this regard, the automated recognition of office activities with an accelerometer can help architects to understand activity patterns, thereby enabling effective space planning for the ABW environment. To the best of our knowledge, however, static office tasks requiring mainly manual activities have not yet been recognized. The study thus aims to determine the feasibility of recognizing seven static and non-static office activities simultaneously using an accelerometer. An experimental investigation was carried out to collect acceleration data from the seven activities. The accuracy of five classifiers (i.e. k-Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Ensemble Classifier), was analyzed with different window sizes. The highest classification accuracy, at 96.1%, was achieved by Ensemble Classifier, with a window size of 4.0 s.

Typically, this is done through filtering and then prioritization of variants for manual curation. However, prioritization of variants in rare disease patients remains a challenging task due to the high degree of variability in phenotype presentation and molecular source of disease. Thus, methods that can identify and/or prioritize variants to be clinically reported in the presence of such variability are of critical importance. Results We tested the application of classification algorithms that ingest variant annotations along with phenotype information for predicting whether a variant will ultimately be clinically reported and returned to a patient. To test the classifiers, we performed a retrospective study on variants that were clinically reported to 237 patients in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. We treated the classifiers as variant prioritization systems and compared them to four variant prioritization algorithms and two single-measure controls. We showed that these classifiers outperformed the other methods with the best classifiers ranking 72% of all reported variants and 94% of reported pathogenic variants in the top 20.

An event extraction mechanism detects and signals transitions between classes; this forms the basis for the third level. As this level only is updated when events occur, it is independent of the time-scale of the lower level interaction.

Machine learning was introduced to address the complex and dynamic nature of natural language. Deep learning gained popularity within the NLU community due to its capability of learning features directly from data, as well as learning from the dynamic nature of natural language. Furthermore, deep learning has shown to be able to learn the hidden feature(s) automatically and outperform most of the other machine learning approaches for NLU. Deep learning models require natural language inputs to be converted to vectors (word embedding). Word2Vec and GloVe are word embeddings which are designed to capture the analogy context-based statistics and provide lexical relations on words. Using the context-based statistical approach does not capture the prior knowledge required to understand language combined with words. Although a deep learning model receives word embedding, language understanding requires Reasoning, Attention and Memory (RAM). RAM are key factors in understanding language. Current deep learning models focus either on reasoning, attention or memory. In order to properly understand a language however, all three factors of RAM should be considered. Also, a language normally has a long sequence. This long sequence creates dependencies which are required in order to understand a language. However, current deep learning models, which are developed to hold longer sequences, either forget or get affected by the vanishing or exploding gradient descent. In this thesis, these three main areas are of focus. A word embedding technique, which integrates analogy context-based statistical and semantic relationships, as well as extracts from a knowledge base to hold enhanced meaning representation, is introduced. Also, a Long Short-Term Reinforced Memory (LSTRM) network is introduced. This addresses RAM and is validated by testing on question answering data sets which require RAM. Finally, a Long Term Memory Network (LTM) is introduced to address language modelling. Good language modelling requires learning from long sequences. Therefore, this thesis demonstrates that integrating semantic knowledge and a knowledge base generates enhanced meaning and deep learning models that are capable of achieving RAM and long-term dependencies so as to improve the capability of NLU.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2999103128", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213411563"}

In this paper, we exemplify how human-interpretable (a.k.a., accountable) extensions can enhance existing algorithms to aid human experts, by introducing a new method for the source printer attribution problem. We leverage the recently proposed Convolutional Texture Gradient Filter (CTGF) algorithm\u2019s ability to capture local printing imperfections to introduce a new method that maps and highlights important attribution features directly onto the investigated printed document. Supported by Random Forest classifiers, we isolate and rank features that are pivotal for differentiating a printer from others, and back-project those features onto the investigated document, giving analysts further evidence about the attribution process.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jvcir.2018.04.002", "venue": "J.
