Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most important methods of machine learning. SVM is a classifier with learning ability. It is broadly applied to image recognition and image processing. Based on machine learning, a parametric optimized SVM classifier for diabetic retinopathy is proposed. Firstly, the classifier uses PCA and KPCA method to extract the prominent features of the image without artificial recognizing the features of the image, eliminates the specific feature extraction method, reduces the algorithm complexity, increases the generalization ability of the algorithm, and greatly improves the image processing speed. Secondly, grid search and genetic algorithm are used to optimize the parameters, avoid the problem of slow operation speed and low classification accuracy due to the large amount of data or the unsuitable selection of kernel parameters.

Moreover, these high numbers of bands are usually highly correlated. Because of these complexities of hyperspectral data, traditional classification strategies have often limited performance in classification of hyperspectral imagery. Referring to the limitation of single classifier in these situations, Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) may have better performance than single classifier. This paper presents a new method for classification of hyperspectral data based on a band clustering strategy through a multiple Support Vector Machine system.

After the band grouping step, the proposed algorithm aims at benefiting from the capabilities of SVM as classification method. So, the proposed approach applies SVM on each band group that is produced in a previous step. Finally, Naive Bayes (NB) as a classifier fusion method combines decisions of SVM classifiers.

The capability of conventional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions and city subsidence has been fully demonstrated, but its application to mining subsidence is limited because of the failure caused by localized surface displacements with strong spatial gradients. In this paper, a new method is presented to utilize SAR pixel Offset Tracking (OT) with a single pair of SAR images to resolve three-dimensional (3D) large surface displacements caused by underground coal mining. Coal mining subsidence theory is utilised to analytically separate the vertical and horizontal components. This method is applied to the Daliuta coal mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, where a dense GPS network is available. Results show the RMS differences of OT derived displacements against GPS in both horizontal and vertical directions are in the sub-centimeter level. In addition, a prediction of mining-induced ground movements is performed with the Support Vector Regression algorithm and RMS differences of 12.4, 13.1 and 14.4 cm are observed compared to GPS, in the vertical, easting and northing directions respectively.

In acquiring a category we learn to label or identify positive and negative instances from a sample of confusable alternatives. Two kinds of internal representation are built up in this learning by \"acquaintance\": (1) an iconic representation that subserves our similarity judgments and (2) an analog/digital feature-filter that picks out the invariant information allowing us to categorize the instances correctly. This second, categorical representation is associated with the category name. Category names then serve as the atomic symbols for a third representational system, the (3) symbolic representations that underlie language and that make it possible for us to learn by \"description.\" Connectionism is one possible mechainsm for learning the sensory invariants underlying categorization and naming. Among the implications of the model are (a) the \"cognitive identity of (current) indiscriminables\": Categories and their representations can only be provisional and approximate, relative to the alternatives encountered to date, rather than \"exact.\" There is also (b) no such thing as an absolute \"feature,\" only those features that are invariant within a particular context of confusable alternatives. Contrary to prevailing \"prototype\" views, however, (c) such provisionally invariant features must underlie successful categorization, and must be \"sufficient\" (at least in the \"satisficing\" sense) to subserve reliable performance with all-or-none, bounded categories, as in CP. Finally, the model brings out some basic limitations of the \"symbol-manipulative\" approach to modeling cognition, showing how (d) symbol meanings must be functionally grounded in nonsymbolic, \"shape-preserving\" representations -- iconic and categorical ones.

One of the greatest challenges in the post-genome era is a complete revelation of human transcriptome with consideration of alternative splicing. Here, we introduce a comparative genomics approach to systemically identify alternative splicing events based on the differential evolutionary conservation between exons and introns and the high-quality annotation of the ENCODE regions. Specifically, we focus on exons that are included in some transcripts but are completely spliced out for others and we call them conditional exons. First, we characterize distinguishing features among conditional exons, constitutive exons and introns. One of the most important features is the position-specific conservation score. There are dramatic differences in conservation scores between conditional exons and constitutive exons. More importantly, the differences are position-specific. For flanking intronic regions, the differences between conditional exons and constitutive exons are also position-specific. Using the Random Forests algorithm, we can classify conditional exons with high specificities (97% for the identification of conditional exons from intron regions and 95% for the classification of known exons) and fair sensitivities (64% and 32% respectively). We applied the method to the human genome and identified 39,640 introns that actually contain conditional exons and classified 8,813 conditional exons from the current RefSeq exon list. Among those, 31,673 introns containing conditional exons and 5,294 conditional exons classified from known exons cannot be inferred from RefSeq, UCSC or Ensembl annotations.

We will call this traditional type of QSAR model an \"activity model\". The activity model can be used to predict the activities of molecules not in the training set. A relatively new subfield for QSAR is domain applicability. The aim is to estimate the reliability of prediction of a specific molecule on a specific activity model. A number of different metrics have been proposed in the literature for this purpose. It is desirable to build a quantitative model of reliability against one or more of these metrics. We can call this an \"error model\". A previous publication from our laboratory (Sheridan J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2012, 52, 814-823.) suggested the simultaneous use of three metrics would be more discriminating than any one metric. An error model could be built in the form of a three-dimensional set of bins. When the number of metrics exceeds three, however, the bin paradigm is not practical. An obvious solution for constructing an error model using multiple metrics is to use a QSAR method, in our case random forest.

For the ten data sets and for the seven metrics we examine here, it appears that it is possible to construct a useful error model using only two metrics (TREE_SD and PREDICTED).

With the Q-learning, the recognizer can attain the optimal solution of identification during the interaction with the texts and contexts. During the processing, a transfer learning approach is utilized to fully take advantage of the knowledge gained in a source task to speed up learning in a different but related target task.

In this paper we present an active and dynamic learning approach to mitigate botnet hidden concept drift attacks. Instead of passively waiting for false negative, this approach could actively find the trend of hidden concept drift attacks using statistical p-values before performance starts to degenerate. And besides periodically retraining, this approach could dynamically reweight predictive features to track the trend of underlying concept drift.

To this end, we formulate the One-Class Support Tensor Machine (OCSTM), which separates most samples of interested class from the origin in the tensor space, with maximal margin. The benefits of the proposed algorithm are twofold. First, the use of direct tensor representation helps to retain the data topology more efficiently. The second benefit is that tensor representation can greatly reduce the number of parameters. It helps overcome the overfitting problem caused mostly by vector-based algorithms and especially suits for high dimensional and small sample size problem.

The Random Forests classifier was used with data consisting of 6 760 soil profiles composed by 19 464 horizons, collected in Mexico. Four methods of modelling the data were tested (i.e., standard depths, n first layers, thickness, and area weighted thickness).

However, in practice, it is unavoidable to have missing data, i.e., missing PET data for many subjects in the ADNI dataset. A straightforward strategy to tackle this challenge is to simply discard subjects with missing PET, but this will significantly reduce the number of training subjects for learning reliable diagnostic models. On the other hand, since different modalities (i.e., MRI and PET) were acquired from the same subject, there often exist underlying relevance between different modalities. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework for AD diagnosis using both MRI and PET data. Specifically, in the first stage, we impute missing PET data based on their corresponding MRI data by using 3D Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-cGAN) to capture their underlying relationship. In the second stage, with the complete MRI and PET (i.e., after imputation for the case of missing PET), we develop a deep multi-instance neural network for AD diagnosis and also mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction. Experimental results on subjects from ADNI demonstrate that our synthesized PET images with 3D-cGAN are reasonable, and also our two-stage deep learning method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in AD diagnosis.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-00931-1_52", "venue": "MICCAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2891669248", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["22094372", "1321097", "15504536", "24060941", "206770979", "206594692", "6628106", "9856627", "37925315", "3272607", "16777465", "22362951"], "inbound_citations": ["211057019", "195785061", "201310377", "199008150", "199064408", "73438212", "203172875", "56475938", "89621143", "202151746", "204028170", "209853495"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52270729"}

Multi-site studies present a valuable opportunity to advance research by pooling data in order to increase sensitivity and statistical power. However images derived from MRI are susceptible to both obvious and non-obvious differences between sites which can introduce bias and subject variance, and so reduce statistical power. To rectify these differences, we propose a data driven approach using a deep learning architecture known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs learn to estimate two distributions, and can then be used to transform examples from one distribution into the other distribution. Here we transform T1-weighted brain images collected from two different sites into MR images from the same site. We evaluate whether our model can reduce site-specific differences without loss of information related to gender (male, female) or clinical diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, healthy). When trained appropriately, our model is able to normalise imaging sets to a common scanner set with less information loss compared to current approaches.

The advantages of RVM over support vector machines are optimized learning and the availability of the probability of a diagnosis. Methods: For evaluation of SAP using RVM, we compared normal eyes (n=189) to glaucoma eyes (n=156). Glaucoma was defined as the presence of glaucomatous optic neurapthy based on evaluation of stereophotographs. The inputs for the RVMs were 52 visual field locations from SAP plus age. For evaluation of HRT optic disk topography using RVM, we compared normal eyes (n=135) to glaucoma eyes (n=95). Glaucoma was defined as repeatable SAP visual field damage. The inputs were 22 global, 84 regional, and 72 sectoral topographic optic disk parameters. Cross validation was used in all training to present to the trained RVMs cases not previously seen by the RVMs. Results: For SAP, the area (\u00b1SD) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using RVM was 0.916\u00b10.016. The sensitivity was 76% at a fixed specificity of 90%. For HRT optic disk topography, the area (\u00b1SD) under the ROC curve using RVM was 0.939\u00b10.016, and the sensitivity was 83% at a fixed specificity of 90%. For each of the test groups, the mean (\u00b1SD) probability of disease in the glaucoma group was significantly higher than the normal group, for SAP: 0.77\u00b10.31 and 0.18\u00b10.21, respectively, and for HRT topography: 0.80\u00b10.31 and 0.13\u00b10.20, respectively. Conclusions: RVMs performed at the level of the best previously reported machine learning classifiers, including support vector machines and mixture of Gaussian.

Therefore, fast and accurate techniques are called to classify large-scale fragments. We propose EnSVM (Ensemble Support Vector Machine) and its advanced method called EnSVMB (EnSVM with BLAST) to accurately classify fragments. EnSVM divides fragments into a large confident (or small diffident) set, based on whether the fragments get consistent (or inconsistent) predictions from linear SVMs trained with different k-mers. Empirical study shows that sensitivity and specificity of EnSVM on confident set are higher than 90% and 97%, but on diffident set are lower than 60% and 75%. To further improve the performance on diffident set, EnSVMB takes advantage of best hits of BLAST to reclassify fragments in that set. Experimental results show EnSVM can efficiently and effectively divide fragments into confident and diffident sets, and EnSVMB achieves higher accuracy, sensitivity and more true positives than related state-of-the-art methods and holds comparable specificity with the best of them.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5573435", "pubmed_id": "28842700", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-09947-y", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2749182114", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14779503", "161283", "7089231", "3662132", "1867079", "6319257", "11252778", "14931915", "1276576", "17510294", "5282256", "28797816", "1970423", "14187135", "18584672", "9863600", "1318300", "3116168", "2167441", "12214710", "11086279", "18481848", "14317314", "28748991", "961425", "207165665", "3053674", "261545"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:205595237"}

Utilizing simulated daytime and nighttime ICESat-2 data from planned ICESat-2 tracks over vegetation conditions in south-east Texas, we investigated the integration of Landsat data and derived products for AGB model and map production. Linear regression models were first used to relate simulated photon-counting lidar (PCL) metrics for 100 m segments along ICESat-2 tracks to reference airborne lidar-estimated AGB over Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in south-east Texas. Random Forest (RF) was then used to create AGB maps from predicted AGB estimates and explanatory data consisting of spectral metrics derived from Landsat TM imagery and land cover and canopy cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Using RF, AGB and AGB uncertainty maps produced at 30 m spatial resolution represented three data scenarios; (1) simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product without the impact of noise (no noise scenario), (2) simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product from data with noise levels associated with daytime operation of ICESat-2 (daytime scenario), and (3) simulated ICESat-2 PCL vegetation product from data with noise levels associated with nighttime operation of ICESat-2 (nighttime scenario).

In this paper, we propose a new neighborhood repulsed metric learning (NRML) method for kinship verification. Motivated by the fact that interclass samples (without a kinship relation) with higher similarity usually lie in a neighborhood and are more easily misclassified than those with lower similarity, we aim to learn a distance metric under which the intraclass samples (with a kinship relation) are pulled as close as possible and interclass samples lying in a neighborhood are repulsed and pushed away as far as possible, simultaneously, such that more discriminative information can be exploited for verification.

The first critical step of counting and classification procedure in- volves segmentation of individual cells in cytological images of thin blood smears. The quality of segmentation has significant impact on the cell type identification, but poor quality, noise, and/or low resolution images make segmentation less reliable.

Two sibs from each sibship were randomly chosen and divided into two data sets, each with 360 unrelated individuals. Within each data set, we applied two machine learning algorithms, Random Forests and RuleFit, to identify the best predictors of having high CAC burden among 17 risk factors and 471 SNPs. Using five-fold cross-validation, both methods had approximately 70% sensitivity and approximately 60% specificity. Prediction accuracies were significantly different from random predictions (P-value<0.001) based on 1,000 permutation tests. Predictability of using 287 tagSNPs was as good as using all 471 SNPs. For Random Forests, among the top 50 predictors, the same eight tagSNPs and 15 risk factors were found in both data sets while eight tagSNPs and 12 risk factors were found in both data sets for RuleFit.

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades.

But since conventional SVMs are originally formulated for binary classification problems, for multiclass problems, the regions in which data cannot be classified exist in the feature space. In this paper, we propose decision-tree-based support vector machines, in which we recursively calculate a hyperplane that separates a class (or some classes) from the others. This can resolve the problem of the conventional SVMs, that is the existence of unclassifiable regions, but a new problem arises. Namely, the division of the feature space depends on the structure of a decision tree. To prevent degradation of generalization ability, more separable class should be separated atthe upper level of a decision tree. We propose four types of decision trees by taking into account the distribution of data in the input space. Using the Euclidean distances between class centers, and Mahalanobis distances, we determine one-to-the-others decision trees and some-classes-to-the-others decision trees.

However, these models suffer from non-universality and uncertainties in setting the tuning parameters. In order to alleviate the aforesaid infirmities in this study, comprehensive modeling was carried out by employing numerous smart computer-aided algorithms including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) as predictors and Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA), Bayesian Regularization (BR), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) and Randomized Polynomial Time (RP) as optimizers. To this end, a wide variety of reliable databanks encompasses more than 1000 data points from eights sets of experimental data was utilized in the training and testing steps of the modeling process. The predictors were integrated with optimization algorithms to assign the optimum tuning parameters of each model. The modeling was implemented in two different manners from the standpoint of models inputs: (1) 2-input (saturation and capillary number); (2) 3-input (saturation, interfacial tension, and capillary number). The results of the comparison between these strategies demonstrate more accuracy of the models when employing three independent parameters as the input (3-input). Among the developed models, the MLP-LMA modeling algorithm outperformed all other models with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.035 and 0.019 for gas and condensate phases, respectively.

In this paper, we theoretically propose two metric functions to measure the distributional difference between real text and generated text. Besides that, a method is put forward to estimate them. First, we evaluate language model with these two functions and find the difference is huge. Then, we try several methods to use the detected discrepancy signal to improve the generator.

The proposed method consists of a pre-processing step where signals are filtered through the Stationary Wavelet Transform for the reduction of possible artefacts. Subsequently, a supervised automatic classification method is implemented for seizure detection, based on the Support Vector Machine Fine Gaussian method. Finally, a post-processing step is implemented in which spatial and temporal thresholds are defined for both online and offline application. In addition, a method that applies sonification techniques is developed. Sonification techniques could speed up the process of interpreting information, allowing rapid clinical intervention and a continuous monitoring of the event. The dataset consists of 30 EEG recordings performed in 24 children with absence seizures, clinically evaluated at the Meyer Children's Hospital in Firenze, Italy.

The Traditional FR methods that based on Visible Spectrum (VS) have facing challenges like pose variation, object illumination, facial disguises, and expression changes. Unfortunately these limitations degrade performance of Face Recognition. To overcome all these limitations, the Infrared Spectrum (IRS) is used in human FR, is chosen due to its inherent nature of being immune towards drastic ambient light changes. This paper presents the design and implement of Human face recognition system based on fusing three spectral images visual face images with near infrared image and thermal images to achieve feature integration in the recognition process and to improve final FR system performance.

SVM is a sophisticated statistical technique that is capable of using complex hypersurfaces to separate the cases with and without pneumonitis. Method and Materials: Two SVM models were built using data from 235 patients with lungcancertreated using radiotherapy (34 diagnosed with pneumonitis). One model (SVMall) selected input features from all dose\u2010volume and non\u2010dose factors. For comparison, the other model (SVMdose) selected input features only from lungdose\u2010volume factors. The models were built with in\u2010house developed software that employed a unique strategy to sequentially add/remove/substitute features. The SVM models were tested using ten\u2010fold cross\u2010validation, wherein 1/10th of the data were tested, in turn, using the model built with the remaining 9/10th of the data. Results: The input features selected to build SVMall were the lung generalized equivalent uniform dose (EUD) with exponents a=1.2, 1.3, 1.4, chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy (yes/no), tumor location (central/peripheral), gender, and histology (adenocarcinoma/other; small cell/other).

Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1) we have designed a novel dynamic correction vector based algorithm; 2) we have proposed new loss functions accordingly.

We carefully develop the clinical motivation behind our approach.

From the plots of the average pattern spectra, it is clear that we have significant differences between the symptomatic and asymptomatic spectra. Here, we note that the morphological measurements appear to be in agreement with the clinical assertion that symptomatic plaques tend to have large lipid cores while the asymptomatic plaques tend to have small lipid cores. ::: ::: The derived pattern spectra were used as classification features with two different classifiers, the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Both classifiers were used for classifying the pattern spectra into either a symptomatic or an asymptomatic class. The highest percentage of correct classifications score was 73.7% for multilevel binary morphological image analysis and 66.8% for gray scale morphological analysis.

So, a new variant of ELM called Weighted Extreme Learning Machine was developed. This technique aimed at handling imbalance data by assigning more weight to minority class and less weight to majority class. The limitation of this technique lied in that it generates weight according to class distribution of training data, thereby, creating dependency on input data.

Therefore, the success of such approach is based on the quality of the extracted set of features. Some studies have proposed the use of features based on Fitness Landscape Analysis (FLA) to characterize optimization problems. However, extracting measures based on FLA usually requires a high computational effort. In a previous work, we have employed meta-heuristic selection on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) using some FLA measures. This research extends our study by including additional FLA meta-features, by using a less costly extraction method, and by considering more QAP instances. In total, we built five multi-label datasets, each composed of meta-features that were extracted by different sampling sizes, and then we used them to train Random Forest classifiers.

However, such approaches have two main drawbacks. First, learning metrics requires often to solve complex and thus computationally very expensive optimization problems. Second, as the evaluation time linearly scales with the size of the data k-NN becomes cumbersome for large-scale problems or real-time applications with limited time budget. To overcome these problems, we propose a metric-based hashing strategy, allowing for both, efficient learning and evaluation. In particular, we adopt an efficient metric learning method for local sensitive hashing that recently demonstrated reasonable results for several large-scale benchmarks. In fact, if the intrinsic structure of the data is exploited by the metric in a meaningful way, using hashing we can compact the feature representation still obtaining competitive results. This leads to a drastically reduced evaluation effort. Results on a variety of challenging benchmarks with rather diverse nature demonstrate the power of our method. These include standard machine learning datasets as well as the challenging Public Figures Face Database.

Since worms generally spread faster than humans can respond, the only viable defence is to automate their detection. ::: ::: Network intrusion detection systems typically detect worms by examining packet or flow logs for known signatures. Not only does this approach mean that new worms cannot be detected until the corresponding signatures are created, but that mutations of known worms will remain undetected because each mutation will usually have a different signature. The intuitive and seemingly most effective solution is to write more generic signatures, but this has been found to increase false alarm rates and is thus impractical. ::: ::: This dissertation investigates the feasibility of using machine learning to automatically detect mutations of known worms. First, it investigates whether Support Vector Machines can detect mutations of known worms. ::: Support Vector Machines have been shown to be well suited to pattern recognition tasks such as text categorisation and hand-written digit recognition. Since detecting worms is effectively a pattern recognition problem, this work investigates how well Support Vector Machines perform at this task. ::: ::: The second part of this dissertation compares Support Vector Machines to other machine learning techniques in detecting worm mutations. ::: Gaussian Processes, unlike Support Vector Machines, automatically return confidence values as part of their result. Since confidence values can be used to reduce false alarm rates, this dissertation determines how Gaussian Process compare to Support Vector Machines in terms of detection accuracy. For further comparison, this work also compares Support Vector Machines to K-nearest neighbours, known for its simplicity and solid results in other domains. ::: ::: The third part of this dissertation investigates the automatic generation of training data. Classifier accuracy depends on good quality training data -- the wider the training data spectrum, the higher the classifier's accuracy. ::: This dissertation describes the design and implementation of a worm mutation generator whose output is fed to the machine learning techniques as training data. This dissertation then evaluates whether the training data can be used to train classifiers of sufficiently high quality to detect worm mutations. ::: ::: The findings of this work demonstrate that Support Vector Machines can be used to detect worm mutations, and that the optimal configuration for detection of worm mutations is to use a linear kernel with unnormalised bi-gram frequency counts. Moreover, the results show that Gaussian Processes and Support Vector Machines exhibit similar accuracy on average in detecting worm mutations, while K-nearest neighbours consistently produces lower quality predictions.

Apart from it, this approach is quite labor-intensive and time-consuming, resulting in short inspection cycles. By taking this into consideration, an automatic supervised learning-based crack detection method has been presented in this paper employing digital images of concrete structures as samples, thereby providing assistance to the inspection process extensively. In this method, images segmentation operation has been achieved using the MATLAB\u00ae Color Thresholder App to distinguish crack free and non-crack free regions as being a pre-processing step. In addition, the manual labeling operation has also been exploited to assign binary class labels to each data set image patches following the overlay operation. Random Forests, a combination of bagging and random subspace algorithms, has been employed and trained by inputting original RGB Training image patches along with the ground truth binary class labels to perform prediction on various concrete surface test images provided without any labels whether it belongs to a crack class or not.

The models dramatically lead to the performance degradation for fault classification. In this paper, a novel bearing fault diagnosis method, domain adaptation by using feature transfer learning (DAFTL) under variable working conditions, is proposed to solve this performance degradation issue. The dataset of normal bearings and faulty bearings are obtained via the fast Fourier transformation of raw vibration signals, under different motor speeds and load conditions. Then, the marginal and conditional distributions are reduced simultaneously between training data and test data by refining pseudo test labels based on the maximum mean discrepancy and domain invariant clustering in a common space. Ultimately, a transferable feature representation for training data and test data is achieved. With the help of the nearest-neighbor classifier built on the transferable features, bearing faults are identified in this common space.

Our study aims to address this issue by developing a set of clearly understandable metrics to assess the performance of sewer deterioration models from an end-user perspective. The developed metrics are used to benchmark the performance of a statistical model, namely, GompitZ based on survival analysis and Markov-chains, and a machine learning model, namely, Random Forest, an ensemble learning method based on decision trees. The models have been trained with the extensive CCTV dataset of the sewer network of Berlin, Germany (115,258 inspections). At network level, both models give satisfactory outcomes with deviations between predicted and inspected condition distributions below 5%. At pipe level, the statistical model does not perform better than a simple random model, which attributes randomly a condition class to each inspected pipe whereas the machine learning model provides satisfying performance. 66.7% of the pipes inspected in bad condition have been predicted correctly. The machine learning approach shows a strong potential for supporting operators in the identification of pipes in critical condition for inspection programs whereas the statistical approach is more adapted to support strategic rehabilitation planning.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2166/hydro.2018.217", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydroinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2808015097", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["108568886", "111311359", "109593897", "110957418", "30321419", "38983855", "15700257", "116737286", "7308660", "16125976", "112002760", "2491118", "110698471", "110397350", "59482438", "107529798", "54912057", "7941851", "7712271", "110907097", "32564288"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:65298778"}

Reasoning about scene images requires the decomposition into semantically meaningful regions over which a graphical model can be imposed. Typically, representational models, learned from data, are defined in terms of a unified energy function over the appearance and structure of the scene-under-investigation. In this chapter, we explore energy functions defined within the context of conditional random fields (CRF) and examine in detail, one learning and inference technique that can be used to reason about the scene. We specifically review methods involving semantic categorization (such as grass, sky, foreground, etc.) and geometric categorization (typically the vertical plane, the ground plane, and the sky plane). CRFs are an effective tool for partitioning images into their constituent semantic or geometric level regions and assigning the appropriate class labels to each region.

Other important properties of the SMA, namely Marshall Flow (MF) and Marshall Quotient (MQ) were also predicted using the best model found. With that goal, the SMA samples were fabricated in a local laboratory and used to generate datasets for the modeling. The considered input parameters were coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen content and cellulose. The predicted targets were Marshall Parameters such as MS, MF and MQ. Models performance assessment was evaluated thanks to criteria such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (R). A Monte Carlo approach with 1000 simulations was used to deduce the statistical results to assess the performance of the three proposed AI models.

SVM is a statistical learning algorithm which minimizes the structural risk for training purposes and can solve the problems of traditional machine learning methods(e.g. over-fitting,dimension disaster,local optimum,et al.). For the implement of algorithm,the historic data of contact travel and coil current were used to predict the future values. In order to predict the mechanical condition, the process of fault diagnosis for HVCBs can be applied. The methods, such as data scale, cross validation and grid search,were adopted to obtain the presetting parameters of algorithm and improve the performance.

Under the goal of low-carbon economy, medium and long term electricity demand forecasting will have very important practical significance. In this paper, a new hybrid electricity demand model framework is characterized as follows: firstly, integration of grey relation degree (GRD) with induced ordered weighted harmonic averaging operator (IOWHA) to propose a new weight determination method of hybrid forecasting model on basis of forecasting accuracy as induced variables is presented; secondly, utilization of the proposed weight determination method to construct the optimal hybrid forecasting model based on extreme learning machine (ELM) forecasting model and multiple regression (MR) model; thirdly, three scenarios in line with the level of realization of various carbon emission targets and dynamic simulation of effect of low-carbon economy on future electricity demand are discussed. The resulting findings show that, the proposed model outperformed and concentrated some monomial forecasting models, especially in boosting the overall instability dramatically.

This approach uses cross-polarized images of bivalve larvae, extracts Gabor and color angle features from each image, and classifies images using a Support Vector Machine. We adapted this method, which was established on hatchery-reared larvae, to identify bivalve larvae from a series of field samples from a Cape Cod estuary in 2009. This method had 98% identification accuracy for four hatchery-reared species. We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to confirm field identifications and to compare accuracies to the software classifications. Image classification of larvae collected in the field had lower accuracies than both the classification of hatchery species and PCR-based identification due to error in visually classifying unknown larvae and variability in larval images from the field. A six-species field training set had the best correspondence to our visual classifications with 75% overall agreement and individual species agreements from 63% to 88%. Larval abundance estimates for a time-series of field samples showed good correspondence with visual methods after correction. Overall, this approach represents a cost- and time-saving alternative to molecular-based identifications and can produce sufficient results to address long-term abundance and transport-based questions on a species-specific level, a rarity in studies of bivalve larvae.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4319/lom.2012.10.538", "venue": null, "journal": "Limnology and Oceanography-methods", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2087130889", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": ["128674003", "46100813", "2715867", "2844897", "15299529", "1755700", "59796057", "55238399", "41631125", "27002000", "55881900", "7553535", "120540807", "83758841", "85748569", "12610611", "126814056", "82125402", "56355085", "13685436", "86449219", "8878617", "84172722", "55537885", "28334029", "54717613", "39321012", "85381507", "5801524", "5535864", "86258112", "128989422", "2619125", "86100586", "42399058", "206097721", "60807209", "89522608", "84506336", "83637860", "15989560", "758563", "3827213", "43678161", "2954890", "40858167", "85626467", "34006292"], "inbound_citations": ["202631973", "40277715", "199070176", "24005666", "27006908", "84580"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55311206"}

Usually, complex models such as Random Forest, neural networks can achieve high prediction accuracy but lack necessary interpretation to their prediction results.

First, we build a predictive model using Random Forest to fit the patient satisfaction data. Second, we utilize local explanation method to provide insights into the Random Forest prediction results so as to discover true reasons behind patient experiences and overall ratings.

McELM has two components: a cog- nitive component and a meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component of McELM is a three-layered extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. The neurons in the hid- den layer of the cognitive component employ the q-Gaussian activation function, while the neurons in the input and output layers are linear. The meta-cognitive component of McELM has a self-regulatory learning mechanism that decides what- to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn in a meta-cogni- tive framework. As the samples in the training set are pre- sented one-by-one, the meta-cognitive component receives the monitory signals from the cognitive component and chooses suitable learning strategies for the sample. Thus, it either deletes the sample, uses the sample to add a new neuron, or updates the output weights based on the sample, or reserves the sample for future use. Therefore, unlike the conventional ELM, the architecture of McELM is not fixed a priori, instead, the network is built during the training pro- cess. While adding a neuron, McELM chooses the centers based on the sample, and the width of the Gaussian function is chosen randomly. The output weights are estimated using the least square estimate based on the hinge-loss error function. The hinge-loss error function facilitates prediction of posterior probabilities better than the mean-square error and is hence preferred to develop the McELM classifier. While updating the network parameters, the output weights are updated using a recursive least square estimate. The performance of McELM is evaluated on a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository.

We apply super-resolution (SR) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to boost the resolution capability of a backscatter X-ray system designed to image buried roots. To overcome limited available backscatter X-ray data for training, we compare three alternatives for training: i) non-plant-root images, ii) plant-root images, and iii) pretraining the model with non-plant-root images and fine-tuning with plant-root images and two deep learning approaches i) Fast Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network and ii) Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network). We evaluate SR performance using signal to noise ratio (SNR) and intersection over union (IoU) metrics when segmenting the SR images. In our experiments, we observe that the studied SR models improve the quality of the low-resolution images (LR) of plant roots of an unseen dataset in terms of SNR. Likewise, we demonstrate that SR pre-processing boosts the performance of a machine learning system trained to separate plant roots from their background. In addition, we show examples of backscatter X-ray images upscaled by using the SR model. The current technology for non-intrusive root imaging acquires noisy and LR images.

However, the intrusiveness, complexity and discomfort of colonoscopy may limit its application and the compliance of patients. Thus, more reliable and convenient diagnostic methods are necessary for CRC screening. Genome instability, especially copy-number variation (CNV), is a hallmark of cancer and has been proved to have potential in clinical application. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We determined the diagnostic potential of chromosomal CNV at the arm level by whole-genome sequencing of CRC plasma samples (n = 32) and healthy controls (n = 38). Arm level CNV was determined and the consistence of arm-level CNV between plasma and tissue was further analyzed. Two methods including regular z score and trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier were applied for detection of colorectal cancer. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In plasma samples of CRC patients, the most frequent deletions were detected on chromosomes 6, 8p, 14q and 1p, and the most frequent amplifications occurred on chromosome 19, 5, 2, 9p and 20p. These arm-level alterations detected in plasma were also observed in tumor tissues. We showed that the specificity of regular z score analysis for the detection of colorectal cancer was 86.8% (33/38), whereas its sensitivity was only 56.3% (18/32). Applying a trained SVM classifier (n = 40 in trained group) as the standard to detect colorectal cancer relevance ratio in the test samples (n = 30), a sensitivity of 91.7% (11/12) and a specificity 88.9% (16/18) were finally reached. Furthermore, all five early CRC patients in stages I and II were successfully detected. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Trained SVM classifier based on arm-level CNVs can be used as a promising method to screen early-stage CRC.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29466793", "doi": "10.1159/000487571", "venue": "Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry", "journal": "Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2791174677", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["15611977", "9704974", "8092720", "11719302", "22483385", "14075293", "10953838", "4384983", "16528656", "25022931", "23165868", "206787478", "16505651", "14658826", "5733220", "18584656", "7894803", "12659213", "4108694", "9224721", "18279686", "23783151", "10695967"], "inbound_citations": ["201630921", "215425982", "210072517", "198192848", "52291394"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3722737"}

The tandem connectionist approach combines several separation methods and it has been used frequently to compensate for the disadvantages of these methods. In this study, we propose associative memory model (AMM)-based linear filtering and a tandem connectionist framework, which applies TF masking followed by linear filtering. By using AMM trained with speech spectra to optimize the separation matrix, the proposed linear filtering method considers the properties of speech that are not considered explicitly in IVA, such as the harmonic components of spectra. TF masking is applied in the proposed tandem connectionist framework to reduce unwanted components that hinder the optimization of the separation matrix, and it is approximated by using a linear separation matrix to reduce nonlinear distortion. The results obtained in simultaneous speech separation experiments demonstrate that although the proposed linear filtering method can increase the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) compared with IVA, the proposed tandem connectionist framework can obtain greater increases in SDR and SIR, and it reduces the phoneme error rate more than the proposed linear filtering method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TASLP.2017.2653941", "venue": "TASLP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2578952999", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16037587", "2158402", "14297352", "15715137", "2852173", "18469215", "6094670", "6368542", "207168299", "57374579", "171208", "9619564", "28819623", "13174065", "11587494", "897844", "5164174", "10141122", "31293408", "8639207", "90315", "14551103", "3046983", "5549923", "14325465", "14521883", "6113778", "17487872", "16736631", "206742483", "6865608", "12777019", "2032998", "18388506", "206796385", "118445785", "207585383", "28521224", "235598", "13074932", "16311994", "206737309", "4228271", "12640199", "9882068", "34297676", "14696335", "61844324", "16981389", "1774023"], "inbound_citations": ["25835963", "61808818"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5892090"}

Previous studies have examined automated and semi-automated filtering approaches that use machine learning (ML) models to assign single E-codes to accident narratives. In this study, our goal was to examine the effectiveness of these approaches for assigning groups of injury codes. This was done for three different types of injury codes (E-code, MIF, and Intent) using several ML models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Long-Short-Term-Memory based Recurrent-Neural-Network). Four filtering strategies were also tested which used the probability of prediction correctness assigned by the Logistic Regression model. These approaches were evaluated for a manually-coded dataset, provided by the Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit containing about half a million injury cases. The results showed very similar performance for the three ML models. The overall sensitivity of each model was quite high and almost identical for E-code (0.81\u20130.82), MIF (0.69\u20130.71), and Intent (0.96\u20130.97).

In this paper, we address the question of how to select an optimal subset of the set of classes, subject to a budget constraint, that will more likely generate good features for other tasks. To accomplish this, we use a submodular set function to model the accuracy achievable on a new task when the features have been learned on a given subset of classes of the source dataset. An optimal subset is identified as the set that maximizes this submodular function. The maximization can be accomplished using an efficient greedy algorithm that comes with guarantees on the optimality of the solution. We empirically validate our submodular model by successfully identifying subsets of classes that produce good features for new tasks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1804.00060", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2796019141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1637703", "1811598", "1200919", "1226440", "492235", "12745316", "11157651", "308212", "9062671", "15963822", "1241368", "59785963", "206594692", "7824159", "1144566", "7214363", "18268744", "195908774", "7249642", "850930", "12389191", "13892622", "905603", "187547", "3626196", "2202933", "8851195", "6383532", "1450294", "14124313", "604334", "8032547", "10774286", "14473882", "5276358", "362467", "3960646", "50698", "8217340"], "inbound_citations": ["186202575"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4557243"}

Antibacterial peptides have the possibility to form a new class of antibiotics to aid in combating bacterial antibiotic resistance. Most machine learning methodologies applied to the task of identifying antimicrobial peptides have applied features representing the presence or absence of certain periodic patterns in the amino acid sequence. This requires considering different periodicities for each feature and leads to a large number of features many of which are likely irrelevant to the classification task at hand. Also as the peptides vary in length it is difficult to develop a feature vector of identical finite length representing all the sequences. An easy way to circumvent both of these problems is provided by recurrent neural networks. In this work we choose to extract a feature vector through the application of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks from features representing individual amino acids within each sequence. The LSTM network recursively iterates along both directions of each amino acid sequence and extracts two finite vectors whose concatenation yields the finite length vector representation of the amino acid sequence. As this is done during the training of the network on the classification task, the representation extracted is more likely to be relevant for distinguishing between the classes.

In the first stage, we use the techniques of Otsu thresholding and mathematical morphology to segment lung parenchyma from lung CT images and extract ROIs in lung parenchyma. In the second stage, a Bayesian classifier is constructed based on the Gaussian mixture Modeling (GMM) of the distribution of visual features of fGGOs to fulfill ROI identification. The parameters in the classifier are estimated from training data by the discriminative learning method of Max-Min posterior Pseudo-probabilities (MMP). A genetic algorithm is further developed to select compact and discriminative features for the classifier. We evaluated the proposed fGGO detection approach through 5-fold cross-validation experiments on a set of 69 lung CT scans that contain 70 fGGOs. The proposed approach achieves the detection sensitivity of 85.7% at the false positive rate of 2.5 per scan, which proves its effectiveness.

Recently, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to discover the optimal parameters of SVM and many versions of PSO are used for this purpose, like: PSO-SVM technique, opposition PSO and SVM which called (OPSO-SVM) technique and AAPSO-SVM technique which represents adaptive acceleration PSO and SVM. In this study, a new hybrid technique based on the combination of \"Accelerated PSO\" and \"OPSO-SVM\" is introduced for face recognition applications. The hybridization can improve the convergence speed in PSO in order to find the optimal parameters of SVM. In the feature extraction process, the PCA algorithm is used for that purpose and the resulted features are delivered to the proposed technique in order to classify the face images. Two human face datasets are used in the experimentation stage such as, SCface dataset and CASIA face dataset in order to validate the performance of the proposed technique.

Thereby, the simultaneous excitation of multiple stress wave types and modes is avoided (or at least reduced), and targeted wave forms can be generated. The new testing system enables the testing and monitoring of foundation piles and utility poles where the top is inaccessible, making the new testing system suitable, for example, for the condition assessment of pile structures with obstructed heads and of poles with live wires.

The aim of this paper is to classify the flying objects in images in a computer vision system, for example, an eagle, kite or airplane. In this thesis, large amounts of data will be analyzed and a behavior model will be built for each object as important steps towards improving and automating the object classification system. The application of this thesis is to reduce the deaths of golden and bald eagles due to wind blades.In this thesis work, a new effective method is presented, namely, a stereo vision system, which is applied in feature selection based on this object classification. Several features are primarily extracted, including the flying height, speed, size and degree of changes in the object parameters. For image processing and feature extraction, the video acquisition is the first and essential step. Due to the limitation both of equipment and location, the captured videos still do not allow for the collection of sufficient data. For the classification of two objects, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Library for Support Vector Machine (LIBSVM) have been employed and implemented in MATLAB. In addition, a preliminary study in relation to the idea of multi-class classification has been conceived and tested by means of an experiment. In relation to building a behavior model, the various feature properties and characteristics were beneficial with regards to developing the accuracy and robustness of the final classification and recognition results. The results gathered from these two methods in terms of SVM and LIBSVM are compared and analyzed in order to identify their differences and to determine a better solution. Additionally, the possible future work for this project will be discussed.Results show that 98% of the flying objects can be currently classified by using OVO SVMs and the OVR SVMs. Based on the results of the classification, 85.82% of the flying objects could be predicted correctly.Key words: machine vision system, object classification, behavior model, stereo vision system, image processing, feature extraction, SVM, LIBSVM, MATLAB", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "598355024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:106706078"}

A latent discriminative model, which combines the strengths of Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Field (LDCRF) and semi-CRF, is proposed to detect new words together with their POS synchronously regardless of the types of new words from Chinese text without being pre-segmented.

The preliminary release of the EADC-ADNI Harmonized Protocol training labels is used as gold standard. The fully automated pipeline consists of a registration using an affine transformation, the extraction of a local bounding box, and the classification of each voxel in two classes (background and hippocampus). The classification is performed slice-by-slice along each of the three orthogonal directions of the 3D-MRI using a Random Forest (RF) classifier, followed by a fusion of the three full segmentations. Dice coefficients obtained by multiple RF (0.87 \u00b1 0.03) are larger than those obtained by a single monolithic RF applied to the entire bounding box, and are comparable to state-of-the-art. A test on an external cohort of 50 T1 MRI scans shows that the presented method is robust and reliable.

The main reason for this is not the immediate effect of the onset of atrial fibrillation over the patient's health (AF detection) but the long-term effects: increase in heart muscle fatigue, increase in thromboembolic and stroke events due to the formation of blood clots and an irregular onset that makes it hard to detect on normal ECG tests. Thus it is necessary for cardiologists to benefit from a robust and precise tool that could predict the onset of such events, in order to prevent them by defibrillation, drug treatment and anti-tachycardia pacing techniques. The automated method to predict the onset PAF is interesting topic to help treating this problem. During recent years several researchers proposed many techniques to predict the onset of PAF.

Process-based crop models are useful tools to evaluate climate change impacts on crop productivity but are usually limited in modelling the effects of ECEs due to over-simplification or vague description of certain process and uncertainties in parameterization. In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid model by incorporating the APSIM model outputs and growth stage-specific ECEs indicators (i.e. frost, drought and heat stress) into the Random Forest (RF) model, with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a benchmark. The results showed that the APSIM + RF hybrid model could explain 81% of the observed yield variations in the New South Wales wheat belt of south-eastern Australia, which had a 33% improvement in modelling accuracy compared to the APSIM model alone and 19% improvement compared to the APSIM + MLR hybrid model. Drought events during the grain-filling and vegetative stages and heat events immediately prior to anthesis were identified as the three most serious ECEs causing yield losses. We then compared the APSIM + RF hybrid model with the APSIM model to estimate the effects of future climate change on wheat yield. It was interesting to find that future yield projected from single APSIM model might have a 1\u201310% overestimation compared to the APSIM + RF hybrid model. The APSIM + RF hybrid model indicated that we were underestimating the effects of climate change and future yield might be lower than predicted using single APSIM informed modelling due to lack of adequately accounting for ECEs-induced yield losses. Increasing heat events around anthesis and grain-filling periods were identified to be major factors causing yield losses in the future. Therefore, we conclude that including the effects of ECEs on crop yield is necessary to accurately assess climate change impacts. We expect our proposed hybrid-modelling approach can be applied to other regions and crops and offer new insights of the effects of ECEs on crop yield.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.05.018", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural and Forest Meteorology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2946844666", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["85674096", "84205863", "83836552", "84952294", "89141", "90417038", "10232013", "28500085", "205455375", "51878174", "85373154", "131983933", "91101565", "53735521", "130524991", "24202950", "158883951", "159121495", "13721712", "92283248", "84884553", "83847094", "159023891", "6471216", "85125260", "155001033", "89886945", "157358297", "33911317", "84562654", "90292859", "84793748", "6740611", "4104092", "6049144", "134654080", "131317603", "42418677", "17709246", "21694871", "16764445", "11960979", "89892479", "84455591", "205247097", "3093707", "128472906", "90985374", "153553447", "22299225", "140622206", "90554871", "157095865", "25320141", "7013480", "121820140", "17274595", "84988431", "30544222", "86082700", "83674430", "205141221", "2766417", "14334699", "18079486", "164551466", "90331814", "17151879", "89276182", "88030411", "84514879", "131905286", "82440137", "43038078", "90842396", "44272548", "106454329", "84936842", "84221662", "11977069"], "inbound_citations": ["210843374", "211629624", "213271282"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:190878783"}

Soil testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the available nutrient status of soil and helps to determine the proper amount of nutrients to be added to a given soil based on its fertility and crop needs. In the current study, the soil test report values are used to classify several significant soil features like village wise soil fertility indices of Available Phosphorus (P), Available Potassium (K), Organic Carbon (OC) and Boron (B), as well as the parameter Soil Reaction (pH). The classification and prediction of the village wise soil parameters aids in reducing wasteful expenditure on fertilizer inputs, increase profitability, save the time of chemical soil analysis experts, improves soil health and environmental quality. These five classification problems are solved using the fast learning classification technique known as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with different activation functions like gaussian radial basis, sine-squared, hyperbolic tangent, triangular basis, and hard limit. After the performance analysis of ELMs with diverse activation functions for these soil parameter classifications, the gaussian radial basis function attains the maximum performance for four out of five problems, which goes above 80% in most of the accuracy rate calculations in every problem, followed by hyperbolic tangent, hard limit, triangular basis, and sine-squared.

Therefore, recent work has turned back to simple and stable regression models that are effective at generation but give up on the sampling mechanism and the latent code representation.

To avoid the social media regulations regarding the hate speech, users usually use some special codes to interact with each other. This study aims to utilize the hate codes to identify the hate speech on the social media data. We used the Indonesian tweets as the dataset.

One of the most important challenges during learning from data streams is reacting to concept drift, i.e. unforeseen changes of the stream's underlying data distribution. Traditional methods always used online learning to handle the concept drift problem. However, online learning requires high time cost during online training. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Kalman filtering approach, which can provide robust concept drift detection, to track concept drift. Once concept drift happens, the online extreme learning machine is applied to update the tracking model, whereas the offline extreme learning machine is used when no concept drift occurs. Based on this idea, we propose a fusion framework to combine online and offline extreme learning machine to efficiently track the data stream.

We constructed a classifier to predict prognosis and identify a subset of patients who can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Experimental Design: We detected expression of 15 immunohistochemistry (IHC) features in tumors from 251 gastric cancer (GC) patients and evaluated the association of their expression level with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Then, integrating multiple clinicopathologic features and IHC features, we used support vector machine (SVM)\u2013based methods to develop a prognostic classifier (GC-SVM classifier) with features. Further validation of the GC-SVM classifier was performed in two validation cohorts of 535 patients. Results: The GC-SVM classifier integrated patient sex, carcinoembryonic antigen, lymph node metastasis, and the protein expression level of eight features, including CD3invasive margin (IM), CD3center of tumor (CT), CD8IM, CD45ROCT, CD57IM, CD66bIM, CD68CT, and CD34. Significant differences were found between the high- and low-GC-SVM patients in 5-year OS and DFS in training and validation cohorts. Multivariate analysis revealed that the GC-SVM classifier was an independent prognostic factor. The classifier had higher predictive accuracy for OS and DFS than TNM stage and can complement the prognostic value of the TNM staging system. Further analysis revealed that stage II and III GC patients with high-GC-SVM were likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions: The newly developed GC-SVM classifier was a powerful predictor of OS and DFS. Moreover, the GC-SVM classifier could predict which patients with stage II and III GC benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

A large body of research work in fault diagnosis has been proposed to identify the root causes of the large dimensional variations on products. These methods are based on a linear relationship between the dimensional measurements of the products and the possible process errors, and assume that the number of measurements is greater than that of process errors. However, in practice, the number of measurements is often less than that of process errors due to economical considerations. This brings a substantial challenge to the fault diagnosis in multistation assembly processes since the problem becomes solving an underdetermined system. In order to tackle this challenge, a fault diagnosis methodology is proposed by integrating the state space model with the enhanced relevance vector machine (RVM) to identify the process faults through the sparse estimate of the variance change of the process errors.

The difficulty mainly comes from the variability and sparsity of human image data, which impairs traditional metric learning models based on point-wise dissimilarity.

The latter cells are morphologically indistinguishable but are known to have functionally important differences in their capacity to stimulate cancer cell growth; this report provides the first accurate spectral discrimination between CAM and ATM cells taken from the same patient. Rapid and accurate discrimination between cell types was achieved, and key wavenumbers were identified which uniquely discriminate between all four cell types. This metrics-based analysis (MA) method is shown to be unique for distinguishing between cancer stromal cells from the same patient. The key wavenumbers differ significantly from those typically found to discriminate between various esophageal cell and tissue types.

Most existing segmentation algorithms use information from four different MRI-sequences, but since this is often not available, there is need for a method able to delineate the different tumour tissues based on a minimal amount of data. We present a novel approach using a Random Forests model combining voxelwise texture and abnormality features on a contrast-enhanced T1 and FLAIR MRI. We transform the two scans into 275 feature maps. A random forest model next calculates the probability to belong to 4 tumour classes or 5 normal classes. Afterwards, a dedicated voxel clustering algorithm provides the final tumour segmentation. We trained our method on the BraTS 2013 database and validated it on the larger BraTS 2017 dataset. We achieve median Dice scores of 40.9% (low-grade glioma) and 75.0% (high-grade glioma) to delineate the active tumour, and 68.4%/80.1% for the total abnormal region including edema. Our fully automated brain tumour segmentation algorithm is able to delineate contrast enhancing tissue and oedema with high accuracy based only on post-contrast T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI, whereas for non-enhancing tumour tissue and necrosis only moderate results are obtained.

Unlike traditional single classifiers, SVA is shown to reveal patient-specific variations within disease groups, which may be important for identifying proclivity to disease progression or disease stability. Salivary expression profiles of IL-1s, IL-6, MMP-8, and MIP-1\u03b1 from 80 patients were analyzed using four classification algorithms (LDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis [LDA], Quadratic Discriminant Analysis [QDA], Naive Bayes Classifier [NBC] and Support Vector Machines [SVM]) as traditional single classifiers and within the SVA framework (SVA-LDA, SVA-QDA, SVA-NB and SVA-SVM). Our findings demonstrate that performance measures (sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) of traditional classification as single classifier were comparable to that of the SVA counterparts using clinical labels of the samples as ground truth. However, unlike traditional single classifier approaches, the normalized ensemble vote-counts from SVA revealed varying proclivity of the subjects for each of the disease groups. More importantly, the SVA identified a subset of gingivitis and periodontitis samples that demonstrated a biological proclivity commensurate with the other clinical group. This subset was confirmed across SVA-LDA, SVA-QDA, SVA-NB and SVA-SVM. Heatmap visualization of their ensemble sets revealed lack of consensus between these subsets and the rest of the samples within the respective disease groups indicating the unique nature of the patients in these subsets. While the source of variation is not known, the results presented clearly elucidate the need for novel approaches that accommodate inherent heterogeneity and personalized variations within disease groups in diagnostic characterization.

The detection is treated as a classification problem, where a discriminative model is trained by computing image features of the target (diver) and underwater scenery. This type of scenery poses great challenges due to its high variability, as it often presents high illumination changes, scarce features and image distortions. For this reason, it is desirable to represent this type of images with multiple type of complementary features. The system scalability is, however, lowered as the number of features types increase as the amount of data to represent queries and indexes also increases. To remedy this, we modified the Nearest Class Mean Forests (NCMF) method, a variant of Random Forests, to integrate as many features types as desired without concerning about scalability and performance decay. The system outperforms the common generative tracking methods which fail to encompass different type of distortions into one model and ignore background information. And in contrast to tracking methods using acoustic sensors which output a single value (distance to the diver), our approach outputs a region encompassing the diver's body; information that can be further exploited to enhance underwater HRI.

A problem with the approach while applied to multispectral images is that it only uses the texture information from selected bands. In this paper, we propose a new multivariate texture measure based on the multivariate variogram. The multivariate texture is computed from all bands of a multispectral image, which characterizes the multivariate spatial autocorrelation among those bands. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed texture measure, the derived multivariate texture image is combined with the spectral data in image classification. The result is compared to classifications using spectral data alone and plus traditional texture images. A machine learning classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is used for image classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of multivariate texture information in multispectral image classification significantly improves the overall accuracy, with 5 to 13.5 percent of improvement, compared to the classification with spectral information alone. The results also show that when incorporated in image classification as an additional band, the multivariate texture results in high overall accuracy, which is comparable with or higher than the best results from the existing single-band and two-band texture measures, such as the variogram, cross variogram and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) based texture. Overall, the multivariate texture provides the useful spatial information for land-cover classification, which is different from the traditional single band texture. Moreover, it avoids the band selection procedure which is prerequisite to traditional texture computation and would help to achieve high accuracy in the most classification tasks.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14358/PERS.75.2.147", "venue": null, "journal": "Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1963832478", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["57911384", "62733133", "207165665", "1079181", "6327665", "42006859", "14727192", "129708869", "22519235", "129648249", "129879737", "59076046", "120010592", "15874442", "10231505", "130968695", "28192939", "131401192", "122562205", "140581855", "146294030", "6906514", "129440004", "87223721", "129803791", "129663205", "27436953", "19883434", "28637672", "7138354", "122016195"], "inbound_citations": ["1344866", "126690387", "10871537", "2633671", "210905117", "208035486", "11456986", "19371687", "16952231", "146050596", "7595928", "6802276"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16478078"}

Rigorous cross-validation tests indicate that the built RF models provide a more favorable prediction performance compared with two state-of-the-art methods, i.e., TMHcon and MEMPACK. Using a strict leave-one-protein-out jackknifing procedure, they were capable of reaching the top L/5 prediction accuracies of 49.5% and 48.8% for two different residue contact definitions, respectively. The predicted residue contacts were further employed to predict interacting helical pairs and achieved the Matthew's correlation coefficients of 0.430 and 0.424, according to two different residue contact definitions, respectively.

Unfortunately, laboratory techniques are inadequate to know these characteristics, which is why numerical methods were developed. Such methods often use computed tomography (CT) scans as input but this technique is plagued by a resolution versus sample size trade-off. Therefore, a super-resolution method using generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) was used to artificially improve the resolution. Firstly, the influence of resolution on pore network properties and single-phase, unsaturated, and two-phase flow was analysed to verify that pores and pore throats become larger on average and surface area decreases with worsening resolution. These observations are reflected in increasingly overestimated single-phase permeability, less moisture uptake at lower capillary pressures, and high residual oil fraction after waterflooding. Therefore, the super-resolution GANs were developed which take low (12 \u00b5m) resolution input and increase the resolution to 4 \u00b5m, which is compared to the expected high-resolution output. These results better predicted pore network properties and fluid flow properties despite the overestimation of porosity. Relevant small pores and pore surfaces are better resolved thus providing better estimates of unsaturated and two-phase flow which can be heavily influenced by flow along pore boundaries and through smaller pores. This study presents the second case in which GANs were applied to a super-resolution problem on geological materials, but it is the first one to apply it directly on raw CT images and to determine the actual impact of a super-resolution method on fluid predictions.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7143904", "pubmed_id": "32204456", "doi": "10.3390/ma13061397", "venue": "Materials", "journal": "Materials", "mag_id": "3011846548", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214630833"}

This is due to the surge of innovative and sophisticated AI techniques applications to highly complex problems as well as the powerful new developments in high speed computing. Various applications of AI in everyday life include machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics, data processing and analysis, etc. The oil and gas industry is not behind either, in fact, AI techniques have recently been applied to estimate PVT properties, optimize production, predict recoverable hydrocarbons, optimize well placement using pattern recognition, optimize hydraulic fracture design, and to aid in reservoir characterization efforts. In this study, three different AI models are trained and used to forecast hydrocarbon production from hydraulically fractured wells. Two vastly used artificial intelligence methods, namely the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are compared to a traditional curve fitting method known as Response Surface Model (RSM) using second order polynomial equations to determine production from shales. The objective of this work is to further explore the potential of AI in the oil and gas industry. Eight parameters are considered as input factors to build the model: reservoir permeability, initial dissolved gas-oil ratio, rock compressibility, gas relative permeability, slope of gas oil ratio, initial reservoir pressure, flowing bottom hole pressure, and hydraulic fracture spacing. The range of values used for these parameters resemble real field scenarios from prolific shale plays such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Niobrara in the United States. Production data consists of oil recovery factor and produced gas-oil ratio (GOR) generated from a generic hydraulically fractured reservoir model using a commercial simulator. The Box-Behnken experiment design was used to minimize the number of simulations for this study. Five time-based models (for production periods of 90 days, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years) and one rate-based model (when oil rate drops to 5 bbl/day/fracture) were considered. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) routine is used in all three surrogate models to obtain the associated model parameters. Models were trained using 80% of all data generated through simulation while 20% was used for testing of the models. All models were evaluated by measuring the goodness of fit through the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). Results show that RSM and LSSVM have very accurate oil recovery forecasting capabilities while LSSVM shows the best performance for complex GOR behavior. Furthermore, all surrogate models are shown to serve as reliable proxy reservoir models useful for fast fluid recovery forecasts and sensitivity analyses.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petlm.2017.11.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Petroleum", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2769325239", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211040991", "211040991", "199506440", "62884764", "203605632"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49359927"}

In present study two artificial intelligence techniques utilized for dust storm prediction in Zabol Area. A 25-year period of climatic records was used. We classified dust events in two classes based on visibility. Doing Gamma Test indicate best arrangement of inputs for model construction.

This paper studies a branch of EBMs, i.e., the energy-based Generative ConvNet (GCN), which minimizes its energy function defined by a bottom-up ConvNet. From the perspective of particle physics, we solve the problem of unstable energy dissipation that might damage the quality of the synthesized samples during the maximum likelihood learning. Specifically, we establish a connection between FRAME model [1] and dynamic physics process and provide a generalized formulation of FRAME in discrete flow with a certain metric measure from particle perspective. To address KL-vanishing issue, we generalize the reformulated GCN from the KL discrete flow with KL divergence measure to a Jordan-Kinderleher-Otto (JKO) discrete flow with Wasserastein distance metric and derive a Wasserastein GCN (w-GCN). To further minimize the learning bias and improve the model generalization, we present a Generalized GCN (GGCN). GGCN introduces a hidden space mapping strategy and employs a normal distribution as hidden space for the reference distribution. Besides, it applies a matching trainable non-linear upsampling function for further generalization. Considering the limitation of the efficiency problem in MCMC based learning of EBMs, an amortized learning are also proposed to improve the learning efficiency. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on several widely-used face and natural image datasets.

However, the robustness as well as the format for such a diagnostic test remains to be determined. As a step towards clinical application of these findings, we have systematically analyzed a published ALL microarray data set using Robust Multi-array Analysis (RMA) and Random Forest (RF).MethodsWe examined published microarray data from 104 ALL patients specimens, that represent six different subgroups defined by cytogenetic features and immunophenotypes. Using the decision-tree based supervised learning algorithm Random Forest (RF), we determined a small set of genes for optimal subgroup distinction and subsequently validated their predictive power in an independent patient cohort.ResultsWe achieved very high overall ALL subgroup prediction accuracies of about 98%, and were able to verify the robustness of these genes in an independent panel of 68 specimens obtained from a different institution and processed in a different laboratory. Our study established that the selection of discriminating genes is strongly dependent on the analysis method. This may have profound implications for clinical use, particularly when the classifier is reduced to a small set of genes. We have demonstrated that as few as 26 genes yield accurate class prediction and importantly, almost 70% of these genes have not been previously identified as essential for class distinction of the six ALL subgroups.ConclusionOur finding supports the feasibility of qRT-PCR technology for standardized diagnostic testing in paediatric ALL and should, in conjunction with conventional cytogenetics lead to a more accurate classification of the disease.

Methods: The methodology is based on the support vector machines algorithm for data classification and it has been applied to the problem of the recognition of malignant melanoma versus dysplastic naevus. Border and colour based features were extracted from digital images of skin lesions acquired under reproducible conditions, using basic image processing techniques. Two alternative classification methods, the statistical discriminant analysis and the application of neural networks were also applied to the same problem and the results are compared. Results: The SVM (Support Vector Machines) algorithm performed quite well achieving 94.1% correct classification, which is better than the performance of the other two classification methodologies. The method of discriminant analysis classified correctly 88% of cases (71% of Malignant Melanoma and 100% of Dysplastic Naevi), while the neural networks performed approximately the same. Conclusion: The use of a computer-based system, like the one described in this paper, is intended to avoid human subjectivity and to perform specific tasks according to a number of criteria.

However, due to the diverse disturbance (e.g., color, noise), the image signal processing, especially the representation of the signal, remains a big challenge. In the human visual system, it has been justified that simple cells in the primary visual cortex are obviously sensitive to vision signals with partial orientation features. In other words, the image signals are extracted and described along the pathway of visual processing. Inspired by this neural mechanism of the primary visual cortex, it is possible to build an image signal-processing model as the neural architecture. In this paper, we presented a method to process the image signal involving a multitude of disturbance. For image signals, we first extracted 4 rivalry pathways via the projection of color. Secondly, we designed an algorithm in which the computing process of the stimulus with partial orientation features can be altered into a process of analytical geometry, resulting in that the signals with orientation features can be extracted and characterized. Finally, through the integration of characterizations from the 4 different rivalry pathways, the image signals can be effectively interpreted and reconstructed. Instead of data-driven methods, the presented approach requires no prior training. With the use of geometric inferences, the method tends to be interpreted and applied in the signal processor. The extraction and integration of rivalry pathways of different colors allow the method to be effective and robust to the signals with the image noise and disturbance of colors. Experimental results showed that the approach can extract and describing the image signal with diverse disturbance.

Compared to the conditional GAN which is recently used for generating samples for HSI classification, the proposed approach has two novel aspects. First, we extend the classic variational generative adversarial network to the semi-supervised context through an ensemble prediction technique. By this way, our model can be trained using limited labeled samples (only 5 samples per class) with a large number of unlabeled samples. Second, we adopt an encoder-decoder network to explicitly learn the relationship between the latent space and the real image space. This property enables our model producing diverse samples by simply varying some latent parameters, which is desirable for enriching the training dataset.

These settlements emerge as planned or spontaneous camps or camp-like structures, characterized by a small-scale physical morphology and high dynamics. Information on the built-up area (BUA; i.e. areas occupied by buildings) in these settlements provides important evidence on the local situation. The objective of this work is to present a generic procedure for the detailed extraction of BUA in complex temporary settlements from very high spatial resolution satellite data collected by different sensor types. The proposed approach is embedded in the methodological framework of object-based image analysis and is compound of i) the computation of an exhaustive set of spectral-spatial features aggregated on multiple hierarchic segmentation scales, ii) filter based feature subset selection and iii) supervised classification using a Random Forest classifier. Experimental results are obtained based on Pleiades multispectral optical and TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagery for six distinct but representative test areas within the refugee camp Al Zaatari in Jordan. The experiments include a detailed assessment of classification accuracy for varying configurations of considered feature types and training data set sizes as well as an analysis of the feature selection (FS) outcomes. We observe that the classification accuracy can be improved by the use of multiple segmentation levels as well as the integration of multi-sensor information and different feature types. In addition, the results show the potential of the applied FS approach for the identification of most relevant features.

Dose warping algorithm and IGRT can usefully determinate morphological variations occurring during treatments and predict possible challenge or requirement of re-planning. Using metaanalysis and developing Predictive Neural Network (PNN) is possible to collect information for perspective treatment evaluation of inappropriate dose delivery or to re-planning care course. Methods: 23 H'N patients, treated using Tomotherapy Unit, were post-processed using deformable hybrid algorithms to generate contours evolution throughout the course. 750 MVCT were elaborated focusing on parotids. For each deformable image registration were generated deformable ROIs and re-mapped to dose grid to accumulate dose. A nomogram was developed to evaluate Volume (V) and Dose (D) variations. Using Moving Average (MA) function and PNN were identified the weeks when re-plan should be predictable. Results: The weekly nomogram provided the percentage of patients affected by V and D deviation respect to the first day of treatment. During 1st week of treatment 95% of patients have a \u0394V=10% and \u0394D=2%. In the 6th week, only 70% of cases remain inside that range. The PNN using Cluster Analysis and Support Vector Machines, highlighted the requirement of warping methods in clinical practice. Validated by 8 patients test cases, PNN allow to classify 2 statistical cluster related to original plan and re-plan requirements. MA with period of 3 and 5 days, predict days of treatment where to locate physics replan. Best statistical benefits can be achieved with evaluation in the 4th week. Conclusion: Body morphing and organ motion during therapy can affect to the dose distribution and induce unexpected or late toxicities. Hybrid deformable registration allows to study the time to re-plan or to adapt treatments.

The predictive quality of the modeling approaches was judged with a leave-one-out validation procedure. There was an average success of 60.9% and 71.7% to assign each site unit to the correct assemblage of fish, and 73% and 84% to explain the variance in species richness, by using CART and RF models, respectively. RF proved to be better than CART in terms of accuracy and efficiency in ecological applications. In any case, the mixed models including both land cover and river characteristic variables were more powerful than either individual one in explaining the endemic fish distribution pattern in the upper Yangtze River. For instance, altitude, slope, length, discharge, runoff, farmland and alpine and sub-alpine meadow played important roles in driving the observed endemic fish assemblage structure, while farmland, slope grassland, discharge, runoff, altitude and drainage area in explaining the observed patterns of endemic species richness. Therefore, the various effects of human activity on natural aquatic ecosystems, in particular, the flow modification of the river and the land use changes may have a considerable effect on the endemic fish distribution patterns on a regional scale.

In this study, we introduce a new method for automated image analysis to extract signals applied to chip-based digital assays. This approach precisely locates each micro-compartment based on the structure design of the chip, thereby eliminating the interference of non-signal noise in the image. Utilizing the principle that the human eyes can distinguish between the positive micro-compartments and the negative micro-compartments, we take the parameters of each micro-compartment together with its surrounding micro-compartments as the training dataset of the Random Forest classifier to classify the micro-compartments and extract valid signals, thus solving the problem caused by the differences among images. Furthermore, we adopted the iteration methodology that adds the output of a model's prediction to the input of the next model's training dataset, until the output of a model's prediction reaches the accuracy we expected, which improves the work efficiency during data training greatly. We demonstrate the method on the dPCR dataset and it performs well without any manual adjustment of settings.

Our best configurations (Support Vector Machines with a second degree polynomial kernel and Maximum Entropy) achieved both after the application of PTCC rules an overall F-measure of 91.06.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "LREC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2758448698", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1085832", "42814798", "5216592", "194951", "16619357", "28510881", "120862597", "14717489", "12456671", "15620379", "725590", "18547394", "7138354", "15843983"], "inbound_citations": ["31563481", "18712054", "15025677", "8581830", "5946539", "41704922"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6686905"}

However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator's output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1612.07828",

The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. Over the past decade there has been a growing effort to introduce neuroscience in primary and secondary schools, however hands-on laboratories have been limited to anatomical or electrophysiological activities. Modern neuroscience research labs are increasingly using computational tools to model circuits of the brain to understand information processing. Here we introduce the use of neurorobots - robots controlled by computer models of biological brains - as an introduction to computational neuroscience in the K-12 classroom. Neurorobotics has enormous potential as an education technology because it combines multiple activities with clear educational benefits including neuroscience, active learning, and robotics. We describe an introductory neurorobot workshop that teaches high school students how to use neurorobots to investigate key concepts in neuroscience, including spiking neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and adaptive action selection. Our do-it-yourself (DIY) neurorobot uses wheels, a camera, a speaker, and a distance sensor to interact with its environment, and can be built from generic parts costing about $150 in under 4 hrs. Our Neurorobot App visualizes the neurorobot's visual input and brain activity in real-time, and enables students to design new brains and deliver dopamine-like reward signals to reinforce chosen behaviors. We have tested the Neurorobot Workshop with high school students (n = 3 workshops, 9 students total) and have found that students were able to complete all exercises in under 3 hrs. In a post-workshop survey, students reported having gained the ability to develop neural networks that perform specific functions, including goal-directed behavior and memory. Here we provide DIY hardware assembly instructions, discuss our open-source Neurorobot App and demonstrate how to teach the Neurorobot Workshop.

Generally, wind turbines are subjected to harsh operating conditions which further yields to damage of the critical components. Hence, health monitoring of key components is a vital task which predicts the damage severity and gives the flexibility to plan the maintenance tasks. Wind turbine condition monitoring is a major area of interest in recent years aiming to improve the life of the machine components simultaneously reducing the operational and maintenance cost. Gearbox in wind turbines has the largest share of downtime among all other components affecting directly the cost of operation and maintenance. In this current investigation, an attempt has been made to diagnose the gear faults by using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) methodology. Two condition monitoring techniques such as vibration analysis and acoustic signal analysis are integrated and the experiments are performed on a laboratory scaled three-stage gearbox having the speed ratio of 48:1. Local gear faults such as tooth chip and tooth root crack are seeded and the response is recorded in the form of vibration and acoustic signals. EMD analysis is implemented and the statistical features are extracted from the acquired data. The representative features are identified using a decision tree algorithm and these are classified using pattern recognition techniques \u2013 Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish between the healthy and faulty classes.

We propose also a compactly supported kernel (GCS kernel) based on a geometric approach. The compactness property enhances the computation of the SVM training using sparse linear algebra algorithms. For local representations, images are described by local image features such as local jets computed on interest points. We propose is the intermediate matching kernel which defines an alignement between the two sets of local features using a matching set. The latter is learned using local features from all training images. A crucial step after designing kernels is to carefully choose hyperparameters. In this research, we addressed also tuning kernel parameters. First we have been interested by generalization error estimation. We introduce a new estimator for the leave-two-out using the mean-field approach. We prove that the proposed estimator is statistically more robust than the leave-one-out ones.

The implementation of a reliable spam email filter becomes more and more important for e-mail users since they have to face with the growing amount of uninvited e-mails. The faults of spam classifiers are characterized by being more and more insufficient to handle huge volumes of relevant emails and to identify and detect the new spam email as example with high performance. The problem in spam classifiers is a huge number of features. Feature selection is an important task in keyword content classification for being among the most popular and effective methods for feature reduction. Accordingly, irrelevant and redundant features that can impede performance would be eliminated. Meta-heuristic optimization is to choose the optimal solution between possible multi-solutions, which respect the aim of this research that is the performance. The other problem is related to ambiguity of the effect of optimization feature selection on multiple classifiers algorithm which are popular used by previous work namely; K-nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machine. Therefore, the aim of this research is to improve the accuracy of feature selection by applying hybrid Water Cycle and Simulated Annealing to optimize results and to evaluate the proposed Spam Detection. The methodology used in this study which consists of groundwork, induction, improvement, evaluation and comparison quality. The cross-validation was used for training and validation dataset and seven datasets were employed in testing the spam classification proposed. The results demonstrate that the meta-heuristic namely water cycle feature selection (WCFS) was employed and three ways of hybridization with Simulated Annealing as a feature selection employed.

The rate of growth of elderly population to the total population is increasing every year. Besides causing injuries, fall may even lead to death if not attended immediately. This demands continuous monitoring of human movements and classifying normal low-level activities from abnormal event like fall. Most of the existing fall detection methods employ traditional classifiers such as decision trees, Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machine etc. These classifiers may miss to cover certain hidden and interesting patterns in the data and thus suffer high false positives rates. Hence, there is a need for a classifier that considers the association between patterns while classifying the input instance. This paper presents a pattern mining based classification algorithm called Frequent Bit Pattern based Associative Classification FBPAC that distinguishes low-level human activities from fall. The proposed system utilizes single tri-axial accelerometer for capturing motion data. Empirical studies are conducted by collecting real data from tri-axial accelerometer.

However, one drawback of the SVM is its rather high classification complexity which scales linearly with the number of Support Vectors (SVs). This is due to the fact that for the classification of one sample, the kernel function has to be evaluated for all SVs. To speed up classification, different approaches have been published, most which of try to reduce the number of SVs. In our work, which is especially suitable for very large datasets, we follow a different approach: as we showed in (Zapien et al. 2006), it is effectively possible to approximate large SVM problems by decomposing the original problem into linear subproblems, where each subproblem can be evaluated in \u03a9(1). This approach is especially successful, when the assumption holds that a large classification problem can be split into mainly easy and only a few hard subproblems. On standard benchmark datasets, this approach achieved great speedups while suffering only sightly in terms of classification accuracy and generalization ability. In this contribution, we extend the methods introduced in (Zapien et al. 2006) using not only linear, but also non-linear subproblems for the decomposition of the original problem which further increases the classification performance with only a little loss in terms of speed.

In an attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the notion that among the deep features generated on all short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action. To this end, we learn a (nonlinear) hyperplane that separates this unknown, yet discriminative, feature from the rest. Applying multiple instance learning in a large-margin setup, we use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the full video segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the features. We formulate a joint objective and an efficient solver that learns these hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers over the hyperplanes.

Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome (GBS) is a potentially fatal autoimmune neurological disorder that has barely been studied with computational techniques and few predictive models have been proposed. In a previous study, single classifiers were successfully used to build a predictive model. We believe that a predictive model is imperative to carry out adequate treatment in patients promptly. We designed three classification experiments: (1) using all four GBS subtypes, (2) One versus All (OVA), and (3) One versus One (OVO). These experiments use a real-world dataset with 129 instances and 16 relevant features. Besides, we compare five state-of-the-art ensemble methods against 15 single classifiers with 30 independent runs. Standard performance measures were used to obtain the best classifier in each experiment. Derived from the experiments, we conclude that Random Forest showed the best results in four GBS subtypes classification, no ensemble method stood out over the rest in OVA classification, and single classifiers outperformed ensemble methods in most cases in OVO classification. This study presents a novel predictive model for classification of four subtypes of Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome. Our model identifies the best method for each classification case.

In fact, oil slicks have specific impact on ocean wave spectra. Initial wave spectra may be characterized by three kinds of waves, big, medium and small, which correspond physically to gravity and gravity-capillary waves. The increase of viscosity is due to the presence of oil damps gravity-capillary waves. This induces a damping of the backscattering to the sensor, but also a damping of the energy of the wave spectra. Thus, local segmentation of wave spectra may help oil slick detection. It can be achieved by the segmentation of a multiscale decomposition of the original SAR image. In this work, a supervised oil slick detection is proposed by using Support Vector Machines into the wavelet decomposition of a SAR image. It performs accurate detection with no consideration to signal stationarity nor to the presence of strong backscatters (such as ship). Moreover, when using normalized SAR images, the kernel expansion may be generalized from one image to an other to make a near unsupervised detection scheme.

Since land cover maps obtained from the classification of remote sensing data are frequently used as input to spatially explicit environmental models, it is important to provide information regarding the classification quality of the produced map. Map quality is generally assessed at the global or class-specific level, using standard methods based on the confusion matrix. Unfortunately, these accuracy measures do not provide information regarding the spatial variability in classification quality. In this paper, we introduce Random Forests for the probabilistic mapping of vegetation from high-dimensional remote sensing data and present a comprehensive methodology to assess and analyze classification uncertainty based on the local probabilities of class membership. We apply this method to SAR image data in order to investigate whether multi-configuration in the dataset decreases the local uncertainty estimates. Polarimetric L- and C-band EMISAR data, acquired in April, May, June and July of 1998, and covering the agricultural Foulum test site in Denmark, are used. Results show that multi-configuration in the dataset decreases the classification uncertainty for the different agricultural crops as compared to the single-configuration alternative. Furthermore, the uncertainty assessment reveals lower confidence for the classification of (mixed) pixels at the field edges, and for some fields an uncertainty pattern is observed which is hypothesized to be caused by field preparation practices and cropping system. This study demonstrates that uncertainty assessment provides valuable information on the performance of land cover classification models, both in space and time. Moreover, uncertainty estimates can be easily assessed when using the Random Forests algorithm.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2012.05.011", "venue": "Int.

The study is embedded in a larger project to evaluate possibilities of multiple-species surveys using biodiversity GRIDs. As a pilot study six GRIDs in diverse ecosystem settings are sampled. Sampling methods used for animal species are point transects for birds and trapping webs for arthropods; additionally a line transects add-on protocol is used at some study areas for amphibians, reptiles and butterflies. Within this framework the task is taken over to develop predictive models for sampled animal species with Random Forests. Additionally the data is analyzed to derive abundance estimates with multiple covariate DISTANCE sampling and occupancy estimates through the software PRESENCE. ::: ::: ::: ::: ::: A total of 5,007 observations from six study areas from all over the world are analyzed in detail. Total sampling time is about 12 weeks. High quality non-random predictive models with a ROC value > 0.5 are gained with Random Forests analysis for 116 described animal narratives. Half of these observations origin from point transect sampling, the other half from trapping web catches. The line transects add-on protocol results in another 3 predictive models. Abundance and occupancy estimates are derived from the data for 46 animal narratives, 23 of those for point transect data, 22 for trapping web data, and 1 for line transect data. Predictive modeling with Random Forests proves to be a very powerful tool. DISTANCE sampling estimates from this study show large confidence interval ranges, but are extremely cost-efficient to gather initial information for multiple species rapidly. PRESENCE estimates are partly unsatisfying because of a large portion of animal narratives with perfect occupancy estimates (Psi = 1.0). It is assumed that this is an effect of small sampling size which will not be problematic for larger amounts of data. This has to be kept in mind when comparing DISTANCE and PRESENCE results. Correlation between DISTANCE and PRESENCE detection probability estimates is negative, while correlation between DISTANCE abundance estimates and PRESENCE occupancy estimates is positive for all but one study area. It is recommended to repeat the comparison when data from more plots is available.

In this work, we present the methodology of the Autoregessive Planet Search (ARPS) project which uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and related statistical models that treat a wide variety of stochastic processes, as well as nonstationarity, to improve detection of new planetary transits. Providing a time series is evenly spaced or can be placed on an evenly spaced grid with missing values, these low-dimensional parametric models can prove very effective. We introduce a planet-search algorithm to detect periodic transits in the residuals after the application of ARIMA models. Our matched-filter algorithm, the Transit Comb Filter (TCF), is closely related to the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares and provides an analogous periodogram. Finally, if a previously identified or simulated sample of planets is available, selected scalar features from different stages of the analysis -- the original light curves, ARIMA fits, TCF periodograms, and folded light curves -- can be collectively used with a multivariate classifier to identify promising candidates while efficiently rejecting false alarms. We use Random Forests for this task, in conjunction with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, to define discovery criteria for new, high fidelity planetary candidates.

Nocturnal hypoxemia is a well-known complication in patients with chronic respiratory disease, and the number of patients receiving HOT has increased in recent years. Many studies have reported that 40% of patients receiving HOT have sleep-related oxygen desaturation. To deal with this situation, a nocturnal pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and control the flow rate of highly concentrated oxygen. However, in some cases, the flow rate is not controlled properly and the same flow rate is adopted both during the day and night. There are several types of nocturnal hypoxemia, and it is difficult to classify these types only according to a subjective assessment of a medical doctor. Furthermore, it is difficult to continuously monitor the measurement results of pulse oximetry, although a flexible treatment depending on the state of hypoxemia is desired. To overcome these difficulties, an automatic classification method for SpO 2 measured by the nocturnal pulse oximetry is proposed in this paper. The proposed method uses the time domain waveform and the frequency characteristics of SpO 2 . The classification performance of the method is evaluated by using 48 measured SpO 2 values from patients receiving the HOT. The classification results are validated with decisions of ten chest physicians.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31946671", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856384", "venue": "2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "journal": "2019 41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2980179523", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["10363575", "2938156", "25623994", "28040393", "25350480", "1219670", "12950939", "13231387", "35001842"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204246877"}

We provide not just bound, but sharp prediction of the asymptotic behavior of SVM that can be determined by a set of nonlinear equations. Based on the analytical results, we propose a new method of selecting tuning parameter which significantly reduces the computational cost. A surprising finding is that SVM achieves its best performance at small value of the tuning parameter under spiked population model.

One of the commonly used generative model-based classifiers for speech recognition is a hidden Markov model. Generative model-based classifiers do not do well for overlapping classes and due to insufficient training data. Dysarthric speech is normally partial or incomplete that leads to improper learning of temporal dynamics. To overcome these issues, we focus on learning features for dysarthric speech recognition that involves recognizing the sequential patterns of varying length utterances. We propose a Generative Model-Driven Feature Learning based discriminative framework that maps the sequence of feature vectors to fixed dimension vector spaces induced by the generative models. The discriminative classifier is built in that vector space. The proposed HMM-based fixed dimensional vector representation provides better discrimination for dysarthric speech than the conventional HMM. We examine the performance of the proposed method to recognize the isolated utterances from the UA-Speech database.

These metrology tools are expensive and the measurement process is time consuming, motivating the need for alternative methods to acquire the same information. Virtual Metrology (VM) methods attempt to provide such alternatives by predicting the required characteristics based on data collected from the tool and work piece, prior to and during the manufacturing process. VM applications have been enabled by advancements in the sensing technology employed in this industry. In this paper, the high sampling rates that have recently become available are exploited to extract a set of features that capture dynamic effects in the tool behavior.

Three-dimensional texture feature values (contourlets), and clinical and computed tomography (CT) imaging data were built into support vector machine (SVM) models to predict lung cancer, using four evaluation methods (disjunctive, conjunctive, voting, and synthetic); sensitivity, specificity, the Youden index, discriminant power (DP), and F value were calculated to assess model effectiveness.

This framework only requires a small amount of local signatures to be shared among distributed sites, eliminating the need of having to transmitting big data. Computation can be done very efficiently via parallel local computation. The error incurred due to distributed computing vanishes when increasing the size of local signatures.

Integration of remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms offers cost-and time-effective approach for spatial prediction of soil properties and crop yield compared to conventional approaches. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the role of remotely sensed images; (ii) compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identify the importance of remotely sensed image-derived variables, in spatial prediction of soil properties and corn yield. This study integrated field based data on five soil properties (i.e., soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and pH) and yield monitor based corn yield data with multispectral aerial images and topographic data, both collected in 2013, from seven fields at the Molly Caren Farm near London, Ohio. Digital elevation model data, at a resolution of 1 m, was used to derive topographic properties of the fields. Multispectral images collected at bare-soil conditions, at a resolution 0.30 m, were used to derive soil and vegetation indices. Models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield using linear regression (LM) and five machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest (RF); Neural Network (NN); Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial and linear kernel functions; Gradient Boosting Model (GBM); and Cubist (CU)) were evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and root mean square error (RMSE). Machine learning algorithms were found to outperform LM algorithm for most of the times with a higher R 2 and lower RMSE. Based on models for seven fields, on average, NN provided the highest accuracy for SOM (R 2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.44) and CEC (R 2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.35); SVM for K (R 2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.49) and Mg (R 2 = 0.22, RMSE = 4.57); and GBM for pH (R 2 = 0.15, RMSE = 0.62). For corn yield, RF consistently outperformed other models and provided higher accuracy (R 2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.97). Soil and vegetation indices based on bare-soil imagery played a more significant role in demonstrating in-field variability of corn yield and soil properties than topographic variables. The accuracy of the models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield observed in this study suggested that the approach of integrating remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms are promising for mapping soil properties and corn yield at a local scale, which can be useful in locating areas of potential concerns and implementing site-specific farming practices.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2018.07.016", "venue": "Comput.

For these purposes, this paper has taken the tendency prediction of the thermal state of BFH as a binary classification problem and constructed a \u03bd-support vector machines (SVMs) model and a probabilistic output model based on \u03bd-SVMs for predicting its tendency change. A highly efficient ordinal-validation algorithm is proposed to combine with the F-score method to single out inputs from all collected blast furnace variables, which are then fed into the constructed models to perform the predictive task. The final predictive results indicate that these two models both can serve as competitive tools for the current predictive task. In particular, for the probabilistic output model, it can give not only the direct result whether the next thermal state will get hot or cool down but also the confidence level for this result. All these results can act as a guide to aid the blast furnace operators for judging the thermal state change of BFH in time and further provide an indication for them to determine the direction of controlling blast furnaces in advance.

In this work, we present an incremental adversarial learning-based framework that allows inferring implicit behaviour, i.e. the natural characteristic of a set of given trajectories. To achieve adversarial learning, a zero-sum game is constructed between a planning algorithm and an adversary - the discriminator. We employ the discriminator within an optimal motion planning algorithm, such that costs can be learned and optimized iteratively, improving the integration of implicit behavior. By combining a cost-based planning approach with trained intrinsic behaviour, this can be be integrated also with other constraints such as obstacles or general cost factors within a single planning framework. We demonstrate the proposed method on a dataset for collision avoidance, as well as for the generation of human-like trajectories from motion capture data.

We propose a set of equations that exactly characterizes the asymptotic behavior of support vector machine. In particular, we give exact formula for (1) the variability of the optimal coefficients, (2) proportion of data points lying on the margin boundary (i.e. number of support vectors), (3) the final objective function value, and (4) expected misclassification error on new data points, which in particular implies exact formula for the optimal tuning parameter given a data generating mechanism.

To do so, we generate artificially transformed samples (i.e., virtual samples) from available prior knowledge. Labeled samples closest to the separating hyperplane with maximum margin (i.e., the Support Vectors) are identified by learning an initial SVM model. The Support Vectors are used for generating virtual samples by perturbing the features to which the model should be invariant. Subsequently, the model is relearned using the Support Vectors and the virtual samples to eventually alter the hyperplane with maximum margin and enhance generalization capabilities of decision functions. In contrast to existing approaches, we establish a self-learning procedure to ultimately prune non-informative virtual samples from a possibly arbitrary invariance generation process to allow for robust and sparse model solutions. The self-learning strategy jointly considers a similarity and margin sampling constraint. In addition, we innovatively explore the invariance generation process in the context of an object-based image analysis framework. Image elements (i.e., pixels) are aggregated to image objects (as represented by segments/superpixels) with a segmentation algorithm. From an initial singular segmentation level, invariances are encoded by varying hyperparameters of the segmentation algorithm in terms of scale and shape. Experimental results are obtained from two very high spatial resolution multispectral data sets acquired over the city of Cologne, Germany, and the Hagadera Refugee Camp, Kenya. Comparative model accuracy evaluations underline the favorable performance properties of the proposed methods especially in settings with very few labeled samples.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.03.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2921468651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204818258", "209516489"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128294950"}

Second, two deep learning methods: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated and implemented on the extracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracy of 85% with about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. The classification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and supervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA). Finally, to validate this study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the traffic accident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loop detectors. It is found that nearly 66% of the accident-related tweets can be located by the accident log and more than 80% of them can be tied to nearby abnormal traffic data.

However, persons with early lung cancer have lower lung cancer-related mortality than those with extensive disease, suggesting early detection and treatment of lung cancer might be beneficial. Computer Tomography is a clinical recommended imaging tool for the detection, diagnosis and follows up of many cancers. The most essential and challenging task for physicians is detection of lesions. Detection of lesions is found to be most difficult because of low contrast of an image or sometimes their residual. This paper is aimed to design computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system which has four different phases for detection of cancerous nodules from lung CT (Computer Tomography) images and they are preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Ant colony optimization as feature selection technique is being used to get more accurate result. Two kinds of machine learning techniques, viz., SVM (Support Vector Machine) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) have been presented which classify the abnormal or normal lung image. ANN has proved that it gives the best accuracy as compared to SVM. The system accuracy using SVM is 93.2% and ANN is 98.40%.

However, the scalar guiding signal is only available after the entire text has been generated and lacks intermediate information about text structure during the generative process. As such, it limits its success when the length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this paper, we propose a new framework, called LeakGAN, to address the problem for long text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own high-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the guidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all generation steps through an additional Manager module, which takes the extracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to guide the Worker module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on synthetic data and various real-world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that LeakGAN is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the performance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any supervision, LeakGAN would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only through the interaction between Manager and Worker.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1709.08624", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963248348,2757836268,2949061076", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6103843", "11212020", "1820089", "9803807", "2210455", "3091656", "1033682", "1697424", "1915014", "17206794", "4669377", "98180", "4857922", "61292046", "11080756", "5986973", "397556", "6844431", "1211821", "1211821", "76564", "6656096", "1169492", "19115634", "4702087", "3439214", "12964363", "14257320", "26668832"], "inbound_citations": ["118684820", "202757910", "211559011", "102486945", "52056574", "214691057", "127953732", "168169995", "53302674", "53687745", "198162057", "210931003", "52100401", "58028789", "207902097", "168169815", "184487660", "207759110", "202592794", "53394762", "202773063", "202767450", "203605747", "197935188", "121337863", "102351048", "53120588", "210882640", "55461757", "209516255", "53297505", "209321704", "210942636", "211014818", "209315287", "209832390", "53160180", "81982679", "197621394", "52292169", "211628872", "46933475", "202708794", "204837560", "208130767", "58005863", "202776689", "208548494", "208548494", "52008979", "211132950", "88493117", "201070608", "202687250", "197463260", "203905453", "52285447", "195883910", "174819514", "202539583", "108287230", "57590015", "56169317", "208290965", "196622491", "211003742", "197859945", "204851983", "202764816", "54457460", "53113638", "166227898", "49330160", "214694085", "210861114", "52009388", "4797268", "196186355", "201725307", "49188736", "52012661", "203605534", "202676190", "204401935", "76665205", "170079223", "204960694", "211118065", "189762150", "53208122", "146120891", "195345672", "214311867", "4785614", "208077138", "201668833", "201103950", "212628561", "162168545", "57373775", "52160797", "21646317", "102353164", "3847983", "199661586", "38384342"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3389583"}

Just one nonzero element in SR coefficient of the testing image is found out based on MP, and the testing image is classified through the location of the nonzero element. To further improve the recognition accuracy, the SVM classifier (SVM-C) is selected. In SVM-C, PCA feature is extracted, and for seeking the linear separating hyperplane, the RBF kernel function is used in mapping the training vectors into high dimensional space.

The challenge lies in formulating effective features and fusing them into a single number to predict the quality score. In this brief, we propose a new approach to address the problem, with the use of singular vectors out of singular value decomposition (SVD) as features for quantifying major structural information in images and then support vector regression (SVR) for automatic prediction of image quality. The feature selection with singular vectors is novel and general for gauging structural changes in images as a good representative of visual quality variations. The use of SVR exploits the advantages of machine learning with the ability to learn complex data patterns for an effective and generalized mapping of features into a desired score, in contrast with the oft-utilized feature pooling process in the existing image quality estimators; this is to overcome the difficulty of model parameter determination for such a system to emulate the related, complex human visual system (HVS) characteristics. Experiments conducted with three independent databases confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in predicting image quality with better alignment with the HVS's perception than the relevant existing work.

Robotic belt grinding experiments are carried out on Inconel 718 alloy workpieces. The belt wear styles are observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The belt wear conditions are quantified by the grinding ability factor. During grinding process, sound signals are obtained concurrently by an omnidirectional capacitance microphone. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Wavelet Decomposition (DWD) are conducted to separate the belt-condition-related sound signals from the raw signals. Then sound features are extracted to establish a novel data-driven model using Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM). The model is developed to predict the belt grinding ability factor. Experimental datasets are used to train and validate the established model. The results show that the grinding sound in high frequency region from 10 to 15 kHz is sensitive to the belt wear conditions, and that the OP-ELM model speedily and accurately predicts the belt grinding ability factor after optimizing the hidden layer numbers and kernel function type. Compared with experimental results, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of the predicted grinding ability factor are less than 0.4% and the maximum absolute percentage errors (MAXE) are within 14%. It is thus concluded that the proposed sound-based monitoring approach using the OP-ELM model is robust in accurately predicting the grinding belt condition despite grinding dynamics involving contact pressures.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2018.05.013", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Materials Processing Technology", "mag_id": "2804183049", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54613738", "198145473"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:139769568"}

We firstly proposed an encoding-based framework for ordinal regression which includes three encoding schemes: single multi-output classifier, multiple binary-classifications with one-against-all (OAA) decomposition method and one-against-one (OAO) method. Then, the SLFN was redesigned for ordinal regression problems based on the proposed framework and the algorithms are trained by the extreme learning machine in which input weights are assigned randomly and output weights can be decided analytically. Lastly widely experiments on three kinds of datasets were carried to test the proposed algorithm. The comparative results with such traditional methods as Gaussian Process for Ordinal Regression (ORGP) and Support Vector for Ordinal Regression (ORSVM) show that ORELM can obtain extremely rapid training speed and good generalization ability.

Through these combination algorithms, alongside Lasso and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), the key features affecting the productivity are filtered out from a 255-dimensional monitoring data set. The continuous mean data cleaning method is proposed according to the characteristics of the filtered data, followed by a clean-up of the feature data to increase smoothness.

As it is valid for all text classification problems, high dimensionality of the feature space is one of the most important concerns for sentiment classification due to accuracy considerations. This study analyses the performance of six recent text feature selection methods for document level sentiment classification using two widely-known classifiers namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB). Three datasets including different types of sentiment data were utilized in the experiments. These datasets are named as Cornell movie review, Sentiment140, and Nine public sentiment. For evaluation, two different success measures namely Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 were used. Also, 3-fold cross-validation is preferred for a fair system performance evaluation. Experiments indicated that distinguishing feature selector (DFS) and discriminative features selection (DFSS) methods are superior to the other four feature selection methods for sentiment classification. The highest classification performances with SVM classifier were obtained when it is combined with DFSS feature selection method in general. On the other hand, highest classification performances with NB classifier were obtained when it is combined with DFS feature selection method.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18038/aubtda.412532", "venue": null, "journal": "Anadolu University Journal of Science and Technology.

Following the standard procedure, we divided video sequences in spatio-temporal cuboids within which we collected statistics on the track lets passing through them. In particular, we quantized orientation and magnitude in a 2-dimensional histogram which encodes the motion patterns expected in each cuboid.

Motivated by the fact that human age labels are chronologically correlated, our proposed LSDML aims to seek a series of hierarchical nonlinear transformations by deep residual network to project face samples to a latent common space, where the similarity of face pairs is equivalently isotonic to the age difference in a ranking-preserving manner. Since traversal access to total negative samples catastrophically costs and leads to suboptimal, our model learns to mine hard meaningful samples in parallel to learning feature similarity, so that the local manifold of face samples is preserved in the transformed subspace. To better improve the performance on the data set that contains few labeled samples, we further extend our LSDML to a multi-source LSDML method, which aims at maximizing the cross-population correlation of different face aging data sets.

The filter coefficients of the wavelet transformation process and the SVM-RB width parameter are simultaneously tailored to best-fit the diagnosis by the hybrid Particle Swarm algorithm.

Demographic and clinical predictors of aphasia recovery have been identified in the literature. However, little attention has been devoted to identifying and distinguishing predictors of improvement for different outcomes, e.g., production of treated vs. untreated materials. These outcomes may rely on different mechanisms, and therefore be predicted by different variables. Furthermore, treatment features are not typically accounted for when studying predictors of aphasia recovery. This is partly due to the small numbers of cases reported in studies, but also to limitations of data analysis techniques usually employed. METHOD. We reviewed the literature on predictors of aphasia recovery, and conducted a meta-analysis of single-case studies designed to assess the efficacy of treatments for verb production. The contribution of demographic, clinical, and treatment-related variables was assessed by means of Random Forests (a machine-learning technique used in classification and regression). Two outcomes were investigated: production of treated (for 142 patients) and untreated verbs (for 166 patients). RESULTS. Improved production of treated verbs was predicted by a three-way interaction of pre-treatment scores on tests for verb comprehension and word repetition, and the frequency of treatment sessions. Improvement in production of untreated verbs was predicted by an interaction including the use of morphological cues, presence of grammatical impairment, pre-treatment scores on a test for noun comprehension and frequency of treatment sessions. CONCLUSION. Improvement in the production of treated verbs occurs frequently. It may depend on restoring access to and/or knowledge of lexeme representations, and requires relative sparing of semantic knowledge (as measured by verb comprehension) and phonological output abilities (including working memory, as measured by word repetition). Improvement in the production of untreated verbs has not been reported very often. It may depend on the nature of impaired language representations, and the type of knowledge engaged by treatment: it is more likely to occur where abstract features (semantic and/or grammatical) are damaged and treated.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5030301", "pubmed_id": "27708568", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2016.00468", "venue": "Front.

In both situations, most classifiers including SVMs will still give a prediction by assigning the test point to one of the classes. However, when a test instance is very close to the decision boundary, the side of the boundary on which the instance lies, and hence the predicted class, will depend in many instances more on the choices of the tuning or training parameters rather than a clear differences in features. Furthermore, if a test instance is substantially different from all instances used during the training, the classical SVM classifiers will still assign it to a class although there is little evidence to support such assignment. In both cases, it is very useful for a classifier to be able to assess its ability to classify a given instance by identifying those regions of the feature space in which the class assignments are less certain. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches based on: i) a geometric uncertainty margin and ii) the convex hulls of the training points in the feature space.

This is particularly a challenging task as equipment can be partially occluded in site video streams and usually come in wide variety of sizes and appearances. The scale and pose of the equipment actions can also significantly vary based on the camera configurations. In the proposed method, a video is initially represented as a collection of spatio-temporal visual features by extracting space-time interest points and describing each feature with a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The algorithm automatically learns the distributions of the spatio-temporal features and action categories using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This strategy handles noisy feature points arisen from typical dynamic backgrounds. Given a video sequence captured from a fixed camera, the multi-class SVM classifier recognizes and localizes equipment actions. For the purpose of evaluation, a new video dataset is introduced which contains 859 sequences from excavator and truck actions. This dataset contains large variations of equipment pose and scale, and has varied backgrounds and levels of occlusion. The experimental results with average accuracies of 86.33% and 98.33% show that our supervised method outperforms previous algorithms for excavator and truck action recognition. The results hold the promise for applicability of the proposed method for construction activity analysis.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aei.2013.09.001", "venue": "Adv.

As the increased occurrence of many serious comorbodity (stroke, IHD, NIDDM) is casually linked to obesity, it represents a huge risk from the public health point of view. Focus should be placed on early identification of risked individuals, which calls for effective screening methods. This is largely hindered by the fact that current diagnostic methods are of either poor predictive value (anthropometric indices etc.) or unavailable for large-scale screenings (BIA, DXA etc.) Our idea to resolve this problem is based on the fact that obesity has a marked effect on many of the routinely used laboratory parameters. An obvious example is the serum level of various blood lipids: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia are often observed in obese people. On the grounds of this fact, we hypothesized that obesity can be predicted using only routine laboratory parameters. Furthermore, we presumed that those are the best parameters to predict obesity (and obesity-associated risk), that best separate manifestly obese and healthy people. Our research aimed to investigate this possibility on adolescent population, as they are the most important from the public health point of view. To that end, we performed a cross-sectional clinical study that included the observation of n=148 male children (aged 12-16 year), consisting of healthy volunteers from four Hungarian secondary schools and obese patients treated with E66.9 \u201cObesity, unspecified\u201d diagnosis.

In both cases it was found that the Random Forest classifier did better than either Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes, and its superior performance was statistically significant. This being so, Random Forest was used not only for classification but also to assess the importance of the measures. For the Watergate case, the most important one proved to be betweenness centrality while for the Caviar Network, it was the effective size of the network. These results are significant because they show that an approach combining machine learning with social network analysis not only can generate accurate classification models but also helps quantify the importance social network variables in modelling verdict outcomes.

In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification of DNA sequences and recognition of the regulatory sequences. For optimal classification, various SVM learning and kernel parameters (hyperparameters) and their optimization methods are analyzed.

Therefore, it is essential to remove the weed regions so that the carrot plants can grow without any interruptions. The process of identifying the weeds become more challenging when both plant and weed regions overlap (inter-leaves). The proposed method takes account of this problem and breaks down the identification mechanism into three major components: Image Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification. In the Image Segmentation stage, K-Means clustering is applied to select the images that will be used for the identification purpose. Next, in the Feature Extraction stage structural information of the weed and leaves will be extracted from the lower unit images. Furthermore, to extract the information from the Region of Interest (ROI), Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HoG) is used to locate and label all the weed and carrot leaves regions. In the Classification stage, Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyzes all the information and labels the regions.

This study presents the first results of a holistic approach, which takes up the combination of customer reviews with evaluation points realized in platform-dependent evaluation systems. Sentiment analysis is regarded as a quinary classification problem. In this study, 5,000 customer evaluations are analyzed with lexicon-based sentiment analysis at document level with the target to predict the evaluation points based on the determined polarity. For sentiment analysis the data mining tool RapidMiner is used and the categorization of the sentiment polarity is realized by using different NLP techniques in combination with the sentiment dictionary SentiWordNet. The supervised learning algorithms k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Random Forest are used for classification and their classification quality is compared.

This study sought to determine Local Climate Zones (LCZs) in Harare metropolitan City, using Landsat 8 multi-spectral and multi-temporal data. The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) and Support Vector Machine classifiers were applied. Training datasets were extracted from Google Earth as prescribed by the WUDAPT procedure. Before image classification, we tested the separability of the LCZs, using the Transformed Divergence Separability Index (TDSI) based on the digitized training datasets and Landsat 8 data. Derived LCZs were then linked with Landsat 8 derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) for the cool and hot seasons. TDSI values greater 1.9 were obtained indicating that LCZs were highly separable. Comparatively, the WUDAPT method produced more accurate LCZs results (Overall accuracy = 95.69%) than the SVM classifier (Overall accuracy = 89.86%) based on seasonal Landsat 8 data. However, SVM derived accuracies were within the acceptable range of at least 80% (overall accuracy) in literature. Further, LST was observed to be high in LCZs with high built-up density and low vegetation proportion, when compared to other zones. Due to high proportion of vegetation, sparsely built areas were at least 1 \u00b0C cooler. Although LCZs are usually linked at 2 m air temperature, they also strongly explain LST distribution.

This \"stationary assumption\", however, does not capture the concept drifting reality in data streams. More recently, a \"learnable assumption\" has been proposed and allows the distribution of each data chunk to evolve randomly. Although this assumption is capable of describing the concept drifting in data streams, it is still inadequate to represent real-world data streams which usually suffer from noisy data as well as the drifting concepts. In this paper, we propose a Realistic Assumption which asserts that the difficulties of mining data streams are mainly caused by both concept drifting and noisy data chunks. Consequently, we present a new Aggregate Ensemble (AE) framework, which trains base classifiers using different learning algorithms on different data chunks. All the base classifiers are then combined to form a classifier ensemble through model averaging.

In the current study, we focused on the method development of using Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. We aimed to effectively extract the essential information present in the large and complex MSI data and enhance the metabolomic data analysis of biological tissues. Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm was used to obtain major patterns of spatial distribution and grouped metabolites with the same spatial distribution patterns. In addition, both supervised and unsupervised ML methods were established to analyze the MSI data. In the supervised ML approach, Random Forest method was selected, and the model was trained using the selected datasets based on the distribution pattern obtained from MCR-ALS analyses. In the unsupervised ML approach, both DBSCAN (Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) were applied to cluster the MSI datasets. It is worth noting that similar patterns of spatial distribution were discovered through MSI data analysis using MCR-ALS, supervised ML, and unsupervised ML.

When the expected syntactic form of the target sentence is dissimilar to its source, translating said source sentence proves more difficult for a translator. The degree of syntactic equivalence between a word-aligned source and target sentence can be derived from the crossing alignment links, averaged by the number of alignments, either at word or at sequence level.

This large data needs to be handled with high accuracy, even in a resource-constrained environment. Objectives: In order to achieve better generalization accuracy while handling data with drifting concepts mainly recurrent drifts, we proposed an ensemble system called Recurring Dynamic Weighted Majority (RDWM). Methods: Our system maintains a primary online ensemble consisting of experts that represent the present concepts and a secondary ensemble that maintains experts representing the old concepts, since the beginning of learning. An effective pruning methodology helps to remove redundant and old classifiers from the system. Findings: Experimental analysis using Stagger dataset shows that our system proves to be the best system for handling dataset containing abrupt as well as recurrent drifts, achieving the best prequential accuracy using an optimal window size. RDWM proves to be highly resource effective as compared to EDDM approach. Experimental evaluation using a real world electricity pricing dataset proves RDWM to be the best system, performing very accurately even in a resource-constrained environment.

These include: 1) ineffective feature extraction (FE) in HSIs due to a single hidden layer neuron network used; 2) ill-posed problems caused by the random input weights and biases; and 3) lack of spatial information for HSIs classification. To tackle the first problem, we construct a multilayer ELM for effective FE from HSIs. The sparse representation is adopted with the multilayer ELM to tackle the ill-posed problem of ELM, which can be solved by the alternative direction method of multipliers. This has resulted in the proposed multilayer sparse ELM (MSELM) model. Considering that the neighboring pixels are more likely from the same class, a local block extension is introduced for MSELM to extract the local spatial information, leading to the local block MSELM (LBMSELM). The loopy belief propagation is also applied to the proposed MSELM and LBMSELM approaches to further utilize the rich spectral and spatial information for improving the classification.

This paper considers the capabilities of some classical and intelligent methods for dust detection from satellite imagery around the Middle East region. In the study of dust detection, MODIS images have been a good candidate due to their suitable spectral and temporal resolution. In this study, physical-based and intelligent methods including decision tree, ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) have been applied to detect dust storms. Among the mentioned approaches, in this paper, SVM method has been implemented for the first time in domain of dust detection studies. Finally, AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) images, which are one the referenced standard products of OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) sensor, have been used to assess the accuracy of all the implemented methods. Since the SVM method can distinguish dust storm over lands and oceans simultaneously, therefore the accuracy of SVM method is achieved better than the other applied approaches.

A crucial component for the effective management of asthma is the adherence of patients to their medication prescription, which can be separated into two distinct and equally important components, i) the adherence of patients to the time schedule for the use of their inhaled medication and ii) their competence in using the inhaler correctly and effectively. Aiming in this direction the current paper investigates three different algorithmic approaches not only for the detection of Metered Dose Inhaler actuations but for the understanding of the overall inhaler technique of patients. More specifically, Short Time Fourier Transform is used as the basis for the extraction of features that are then used for the classification of 4 events (inhaler actuation, patient inhalation, patient exhalation, background noise) using three distinct algorithmic approaches (Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and AdaBoost). The final experimental results demonstrate that Adaboost outperforms the alternative approaches leading to accuracies above 96%.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SSCI.2016.7849898", "venue": "2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)", "journal": "2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2588412659", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37927246", "25652462", "38766552", "14639404", "29057939", "196432370", "55862288", "17033534", "13148853", "47128183", "194951", "89141", "11803458"], "inbound_citations": ["3990989"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17087639"}

After that, we use the connected component algorithm to extract text from the two-color image.

The neural network in our approach consists of a generator sub-network and a discriminator sub-network, which are trained with paired images (scene images and their corresponding two-color images) in an adversarial way.

There are, however, a few hindrances in making an immediate application of SVM for the OCR purpose. First, to construct a well-performing SVM character recognizer has to deal with a large set of training samples (hundreds of thousands in the Chinese OCR, for example). There are two types of SVMs: linear and non-linear SVMs. Training a linear SVM is relatively inexpensive, while training a non-linear SVM is of the order np, where n is the number of training samples and p \u2265 2. Thus, the sheer size of samples has the potential of incurring a high training cost on an OCR application. Second, a normal OCR task also deals with a large number of class types. There are, for example, thousands of character class types being handled in the Chinese OCR. There are also hundreds of them being handled in the English OCR, if touched English letters are considered as separate class types from untouched letters. Since SVM training deals with one pair of class types at a time, we need to train l(l-1)/2 one-against-one (1A1) classifiers (Kerr et al. [1]) or l one-against-others (1AO) classifiers (Bottou et al. [2]), where l is the number of class types. Such a gigantic collection of classifiers not only poses a problem to the training but also to the testing of SVMs. Third, SVM training also involves a number of parameters whose values affect the generalization power of classifiers. This means that searching for optimal parameter values is necessary and it constitutes another heavy load to the SVM training. The above three factors, when put together, will demand months of computing time to complete a whole round of conventional SVM trainings, including linear and non-linear SVM trainings, and also demands an unusual amount of time in conducting a conventional online OCR task.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/52227", "venue": "Advances in Character Recognition", "journal": "Advances in Character Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1483428061", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59718844", "60993494", "15951891", "16574614", "206420153", "89141", "10647875", "36833670", "43718465", "6919065", "3116168", "6256522", "1204938"], "inbound_citations": ["215022366", "342041", "5125716", "169031830"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18088197"}

However, traditional models degrade significantly due to sparsity problem because travelers only have limited visiting behaviors. Through a detailed analysis of real-world check-data, we observe 1) the phenomenon of travelers' interest drift and transfer co-exist between hometown and current city; 2) differences between popular POIs among locals and travelers. Motivated by this, we propose a POI Recommendation framework with User Interest Drift and Transfer (PR-UIDT), which jointly considers above two factors when designing user and POI latent vector. In this framework, user vector is divided into a city-independent part and another city-dependent part, and POI is represented as two independent vectors for locals and travelers, respectively. To evaluate the proposed framework, we implement it with a square error based matrix factorization model and a ranking error based matrix factorization model, respectively, and conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of PR-UIDT framework, with a relative improvement of 0.4% ~ 20.5% over several state-of-the-art baselines, as well as the practicality of applying this framework to real-world applications and multi-city scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce a novel person Re-ID task called unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID, which only needs the within-camera (intra-camera) label information but not cross-camera (inter-camera) labels which are more expensive to obtain. In real-world applications, the intra-camera label information can be easily captured by tracking algorithms or few manual annotations. In this situation, the main challenge becomes the distribution discrepancy across different camera views, caused by the various body pose, occlusion, image resolution, illumination conditions, and background noises in different cameras. To address this situation, we propose a novel Adversarial Camera Alignment Network (ACAN) for unsupervised cross-camera person Re-ID. It consists of the camera-alignment task and the supervised within-camera learning task. To achieve the camera alignment, we develop a Multi-Camera Adversarial Learning (MCAL) to map images of different cameras into a shared subspace. Particularly, we investigate two different schemes, including the existing GRL (i.e., gradient reversal layer) scheme and the proposed scheme called \"other camera equiprobability\" (OCE), to conduct the multi-camera adversarial task. Based on this shared subspace, we then leverage the within-camera labels to train the network. Extensive experiments on five large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of ACAN over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised methods that take advantage of labeled source domains and generated images by GAN-based models.

The focus is mainly on the part of the industry that consists of customer service operations.The analysis shows that the industry is mainly affected by high competition and businesses\u2019, that need to provide customer service, choice between internal or external customer service operations. The analysis also indicates that the industry will continue to grow and that there is a trend that companies increasingly choose to outsource their customer service. The development of the technological solutions used in call centers, for example, dialogue systems, are requested by companies as these are important tools to create a well-functioning customer service. Digital systems today have obvious development areas. It is often large international companies or international teams that develop the digital systems used. However, extends the area of \u200b\u200buse for these systems far beyond the call center industry.The second part involves identifying problematic dialogue system utterances using machine learning and is inspired by SpeDial, an EU project aimed at improving dialogue systems. Problematic dialogue system utterances can be considered problematic depending on, for example, that the system misinterprets the user's intention. The aim of the work done in the second part is to investigate what or which machine learning methods in the WEKA tool that are best suited to identify problematic dialogue system utterances.The data used in this work comes from a customer service entrance based on free speech, which means that the user is asked to describe their case to be transferred to the right department within the customer service. Our data has been provided by the company Voice Provider that develops, implements and maintains customer service systems. We came in contact with Voice Provider through the Department of Speech, Music and Hearing (TMH), at the Royal Institute of Technology, that are involved in the SpeDial project. The work initially consisted of preparing the supplied data to enable it to me used by the machine learning tool WEKA\u2019s built-in classifiers, after which six classifiers were selected for further evaluation. The results show that none of the classifiers managed to accomplish the task in a fully satisfactory manner. Whoever the method that was most successful was the Random Forest method. It is difficult to draw any further conclusions from the results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2106913914", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110412768"}

Given this negative effect on forest productivity, spatial prediction of paludification in black spruce stands is important in forest management. Here, we used the Random Forest approach to predict organic layer thickness (OLT) as a proxy of paludification in northeastern Canada, where forests tend to paludify naturally. The RF approach involved regression and classification models using a suite of 20 environmental predictors derived from multiple sources. The performance of each model was evaluated using cross-validation and an independent dataset based on conventional ecological survey maps from a provincial forest inventory. Importance measures of the predictors indicated that slope, topographic position index, spectral bands 4 and 5 from Landsat, latitude, and PALSAR_HH were the most important variables explaining the spatial distribution of OLT for both models. Cross-validated relative root mean square error (\u00b1 standard deviation) for the regression model was estimated at 20.66% \u00b1 0.576, with R2 of 0.41 \u00b1 0.020, whereas the average out-of-bag error for the classification model was estimated at 44.75%. However, both models performed better in predicting high risk of paludification (OLT values >40 cm). With predicted OLT values averaging 44.07 \u00b1 16.80 cm (range 4.25\u2013104.58 cm), the spatial patterns were in accordance with the results of previous studies at the national and landscape scale. These results highlight that ecological types such as black spruce\u2013sphagnum on thin-to-thick organic deposit, with ombrotrophic drainage, are particularly prone to paludification (OLT depth > 40 cm) throughout the study area.

Although there has been previous research on focus assessment in the spatial or wavelet domains, there are few previous studies that combine all of the methods of spatial and wavelet domains. Since all of the previous focus assessments in the spatial or wavelet domain methods have disadvantages, such as being affected by illumination variation, etc., we propose a new focus assessment method by combining the spatial and wavelet domain methods for the gaze-tracking camera. This research is novel in the following three ways, in comparison with the previous methods. First, the proposed focus assessment method combines the advantages of spatial and wavelet domain methods by using e-support vector regression (SVR) with a symmetrical Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel. In order to prevent the focus score from being affected by a change in image brightness, both linear and nonlinear normalizations are adopted in the focus score calculation. Second, based on the camera optics, we mathematically prove the reason for the increase in the focus score in the case of daytime images or a brighter illuminator compared to nighttime images or a darker illuminator. Third, we propose a new criterion to compare the accuracies of the focus measurement methods. This criterion is based on the ratio of relative overlapping amount (standard deviation of focus score) between two adjacent positions along the Z-axis to the entire range of focus score variety between these two points.

Features from multi-modal images, however, require more CPU time and memory, for extraction, training and classification. In this study, we examine what image features are useful for segmenting GTV in multi-modal images. Methods: Eight cases of high grade brain tumor from MICCAI 2013 for brain tumor segmentation competition were examined. In each case, images of co-registered four MRI modalities: Flair, T1, T1 contrast and T2, as well as the ground truth are provided in the data set. Three cases were used for probing important features and the other five cases were for evaluation of segmentations with the selected features. Besides original image intensity, additional 7 candidate features were extracted: minimum, maximum, gradient, entropy, spot, ripple and edge, resulting in a 32-D (4 x 8) feature vector for each voxel. For selecting important features, a random forest with 100 decision trees was trained using 32-D features from the 3 probing cases. The top ranked features reported by the random forest were selected and used in a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based semi-automatic method we previously developed to segment the 5 testing cases. Dice coefficent metric to the ground truth are reported and compared to intensity-only segmentation using the same segmentation method. Results: The feature selection random forest ranked intensity, minimum, maximum and entropy the most important features across all 4 MRI modalities. With the selected features (16-D), the CRF segmentation of 5 test cases yielded Dice coefficent 0.847\u00b10.114 (mean\u00b11SD), significantly better (p =0.016) than the Dice coefficient 0.797\u00b10.135 of intensity-only (4-D) CRF segmentation. Conclusion: Multi-modal image features selected by a machine learning method can improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation significantly when compared with intensity-only features.

The image data were taken from worn surfaces images of cast iron specimens subjected to abrasion wear tests. These images were classified into two groups, identified with the severe and mild labels, according to the wear rate results found during the wear tests. The surface features of worn surfaces images were coded as a dense Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor and thus classifier models were herein implemented to obtain a learning model of wear severity. Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest were the classifier models used, which span the family of classifiers from fast to robust implementations. An evaluation of the classifier capacity to identify those images corresponding to the severe and mild wear regimes was made by following a k-fold cross validation strategy. The qualitative characterization of worn surfaces images through the HOG computation and the application of classifier models allow predicting well whether a mild or a severe abrasive wear regimes operated. The proposed approach achieves more than 80% of accuracy in almost all HOG configuration and for the different classifiers herein evaluated.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.wear.2018.11.028", "venue": null, "journal": "Wear", "mag_id": "2940116336", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["174817738"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:146409642"}

The proposed algorithm works in three major steps, in the first step text clusters are created using software bug textual attributes data and followed by the second step in which cluster labels are generated using label induction for each cluster, and in the third step, the cluster labels are mapped against the bug taxonomic terms to identify the appropriate categories of the bug clusters. The cluster labels are generated using frequent and meaningful terms present in the bug attributes, for the bugs belonging to the bug clusters.

A challenge of modern business intelligence applications is analyzing and querying data seamlessly across structured and unstructured sources. This requires the development of automated techniques for extracting structured records from text sources and resolving entity mentions in data from various sources. The success of any automated method for extraction and integration depends on how effectively it unifies diverse clues in the unstructured source and in existing structured databases. We argue that statistical learning techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) provide a accurate, elegant and principled framework for tackling these tasks. Given the inherent noise in real-world sources, it is important to capture the uncertainty of the above operations via imprecise data models.

In this work, first a large set of invariant spatiotemporal features is extracted from skeleton joints (retrieved from depth sensor) in motion and evaluated as baseline performance.

However, standard SVR adopts a global and fixed e-margin, which cannot adequately tolerate and utilize the time-varying day-to-day traffic variation. In this work, on the ground of stochastic modeling of day-to-day traffic variation, an adaptive SVR short-term traffic forecasting model is proposed. A bi-level model is established to describe the traffic variation, which combines the time-varying characteristic to the day-to-day traffic variation. The obtained time-varying deviation is then integrated into SVR to construct an adaptive e-margin, in which both local and normalized factors are considered.

State-of-the-art approaches, including both the incrementally updated classifiers and the ensemble classifiers, have proved that model update is a very costly process. In this paper, we show that reducing model granularity reduces the update cost, as models of fine granularity enable us to efficiently pinpoint local components in the model that are affected by the concept drift. It also enables us to derive new model components to reflect the current data distribution, thus avoiding expensive updates on a global scale. Furthermore, those actionable alerts being monitored are usually rare occurrences. The existing stream classifiers cannot handle this problem.

Existing approaches usually learn a single metric in the embedding space for all available data points, which may have a very complex non-uniform distribution with different notions of similarity between objects, e.g. appearance, shape, color or semantic meaning. Approaches for learning a single distance metric often struggle to encode all different types of relationships and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose a novel easy-to-implement divide and conquer approach for deep metric learning, which significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of metric learning. Our approach utilizes the embedding space more efficiently by jointly splitting the embedding space and data into K smaller sub-problems. It divides both, the data and the embedding space into K subsets and learns K separate distance metrics in the non-overlapping subspaces of the embedding space, defined by groups of neurons in the embedding layer of the neural network. The proposed approach increases the convergence speed and improves generalization since the complexity of each sub-problem is reduced compared to the original one. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin in retrieval, clustering and re-identification tasks on CUB200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, In-shop Clothes and PKU VehicleID datasets.

We highlight the results from AUV-based multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry / backscatter and digital optical imagery from the DISCOL area acquired during research cruise SO242 in 2015. AUV bathymetry reveals a morphologically complex seafloor with rough terrain in seamount areas and low-relief variations in sedimentary abyssal plains which are covered in Mn-nodules. Backscatter provides valuable information about the seafloor type and particularly about the influence of Mn-nodules on the response of the transmitted acoustic signal. Primarily, Mn-nodule abundances were determined by means of automated nodule detection on AUV seafloor imagery and nodule metrics such as nodules m\u22122 were calculated automatically for each image allowing further spatial analysis within GIS in conjunction with the acoustic data. AUV-based backscatter was clustered using both raw data and corrected backscatter mosaics. ::: ::: In total, two unsupervised methods and one machine learning approach were utilized for backscatter classification and Mn-nodule predictive mapping. Bayesian statistical analysis was applied to the raw backscatter values resulting in six acoustic classes. In addition, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) clustering was applied to the backscatter mosaic and its statistics (mean, mode, 10th, and 90th quantiles) suggesting an optimum of six clusters as well. Part of the nodule metrics data was combined with bathymetry, bathymetric derivatives and backscatter statistics for predictive mapping of the Mn-nodule density using a Random Forest classifier. Results indicate that acoustic classes, predictions from Random Forest model and image-based nodule metrics show very similar spatial distribution patterns with acoustic classes hence capturing most of the fine-scale Mn-nodule variability. Backscatter classes reflect areas with homogeneous nodule density. A strong influence of mean backscatter, fine scale BPI and concavity of the bathymetry on nodule prediction is seen. These observations imply that nodule densities are generally affected by local micro-bathymetry in a way that is not yet fully understood. However, it can be concluded that the spatial occurrence of Mn-covered areas can be sufficiently analysed by means of acoustic classification and multivariate predictive mapping allowing to determine the spatial nodule density in a much more robust way than previously possible.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/bg-2018-60", "venue": null, "journal": "Biogeosciences Discussions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2788208590", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["131203723", "129747046", "1225025", "129931918", "62739295", "64791877", "140648699", "128899156", "129195423", "129038956", "60360358", "131131531", "10887636", "13969706", "4575445", "129302689", "121147587"], "inbound_citations": ["67766677"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54538409"}

Here we evaluate these relationships using a range of machine-learning algorithms applied to orifice meter data from a pipeline flowing from the Cheshmeh Khosh Iranian oil field. Correlation coefficients indicate that (Q v ) has weak to moderate positive correlations with T, P, and \u03bc, a strong positive correlation with the \u0394P\u02c60.5, and a weak negative correlation with oil specific gravity.

A profiler that is capable of modeling the execution of tasks and predicting their runtime accurately, therefore, becomes an essential part of any Workflow Management System (WMS). With the emergence of multi-tenant Workflow as a Service (WaaS) platforms that use clouds for deploying scientific workflows, task runtime prediction becomes more challenging because it requires the processing of a significant amount of data in a near real-time scenario while dealing with the performance variability of cloud resources. Hence, relying on methods such as profiling tasks' execution data using basic statistical description (e.g., mean, standard deviation) or batch offline regression techniques to estimate the runtime may not be suitable for such environments. In this paper, we propose an online incremental learning approach to predict the runtime of tasks in scientific workflows in clouds.

Early identification of software modules that are likely to be faulty helps practitioners take timely actions to improve these modules' quality and reduce development costs in the remainder of the development process. To this end, module faultiness estimation models can be built at any point during development by using measures collected up to that time. Models available in later phases are expected to be more accurate than those available in earlier phases. However, waiting until late in the development process may reduce the impact of the effectiveness and efficacy of any software quality improvement actions and increase their cost. Aims. Our goal is to investigate to what extent using software code measures along with software design measures helps improve the accuracy of module faultiness estimation with respect to using software design measures alone. Method. We built faultiness estimation models---by using Binary Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees---for 54 datasets from the PROMISE repository. These datasets contain design and code measures and faultiness data of software modules of real-life projects. We compared the models built by using the code measures and design measures together against the models built by using design measures alone via a few accuracy indicators. Results. The results indicate that the models built by using code measures and design measures together are only slightly more accurate than the models built by using design measures alone. Conclusions. Our analysis shows that measures that can be obtained during design can provide models that are almost as accurate as models that can be achieved in later development phases.

The weighting parameters of the multiple ranking functions are updated by minimizing a quadratic objective function constrained by the triplet. The approach unifies the learning algorithm for the most commonly used ranking functions. Thus, multiple features with their own ranking function can easily be employed in the ranking module without feature reconstruction. The method is computationally inexpensive and appropriate for large-scale e-commerce image retrieval applications. Customized ranking functions are well supported.

The starting hypothesis states that complementing behavioural data with other more relevant data (regarding learning outcomes) can lead to a better analysis of the learning process, that is, in particular it is possible to early predict the student final performance. A learning platform has been spe cially developed to collect data not just from the usage but also related to the way students learn and progress in training activities. Data of both types are used to build a progressive predictive system for helping in the learning process. This model is based on a classifier that uses the Support Vector Machine technique. As a result, the system obtains a weekly classification of each student as the probability of belonging to one of three classes: high, medium and low performance. The results show that, supplementing behavioural data with learning data allows us to obtain better predictions about the results of the students in a learning system.

The direction of sound was determined in this study, which allowed hearing impaired individuals to perceive where sounds originated. This study also determined whether something was being spoken loudly near the hearing impaired individual. In this manner, it was intended that they should be able to recognize panic conditions more quickly. The developed wearable system has four microphone inlets, two vibration motor outlets, and four Light Emitting Diode (LED) outlets. The vibration of motors placed on the right and left fingertips permits the indication of the direction of sound through specific vibration frequencies. This study applies the ReliefF feature selection method to evaluate every feature in comparison to other features and determine which features are more effective in the classification phase. This study primarily selects the best feature extraction and classification methods. Then, the prototype device has been tested using these selected methods on themselves. ReliefF feature selection methods are used in the studies; the success of K nearest neighborhood (Knn) classification had a 93% success rate and classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM) had a 94% success rate. At close range, SVM and two of the best feature methods were used and returned a 98% success rate. When testing our wearable devices on users in real time, we used a classification technique to detect the direction and our wearable devices responded in 0.68 s; this saves power in comparison to traditional direction detection methods. Meanwhile, if there was an echo in an indoor environment, the success rate increased; the echo canceller was disabled in environments without an echo to save power. We also compared our system with the localization algorithm based on the microphone array; the wearable device that we developed had a high success rate and it produced faster results at lower cost than other methods.

We consider the l2, 1-norm regularized regression model for joint feature selection from multiple tasks, which can be derived in the probabilistic framework by assuming a suitable prior from the exponential family. One appealing feature of the l2, 1-norm regularization is that it encourages multiple predictors to share similar sparsity patterns. However, the resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve due to the non-smoothness of the l2, 1-norm regularization. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the computation by reformulating it as two equivalent smooth convex optimization problems which are then solved via the Nesterov's method---an optimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization. A key building block in solving the reformulations is the Euclidean projection. We show that the Euclidean projection for the first reformulation can be analytically computed, while the Euclidean projection for the second one can be computed in linear time.

These features can be used to perform tasks such as link prediction, classification and clustering on graphs. Knowledge graphs provide rich semantics encoded in the edge and node types. Meta-paths consist of these types and abstract paths in the graph. Until now, meta-paths can only be used as categorical features with high redundancy and are therefore unsuitable for machine learning models. We propose meta-path embeddings to solve this problem by learning semantical and compact vector representations of them. Current graph embedding methods only embed nodes and edge types and therefore miss semantics encoded in the combination of them. Our method embeds meta-paths using the skipgram model with an extension to deal with the redundancy and high amount of meta-paths in big knowledge graphs.

Toward this issue, the solution accuracy is expressed with the total mean absolute relative residual for all samples, R(%).

In this work, we propose Mic2Mic -- a machine-learned system component -- which resides in the inference pipeline of audio models and at real-time reduces the variability in audio data caused by microphone-specific factors. Two key considerations for the design of Mic2Mic were: a) to decouple the problem of microphone variability from the audio task, and b) put a minimal burden on end-users to provide training data. With these in mind, we apply the principles of cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to learn Mic2Mic using unlabeled and unpaired data collected from different microphones.

Specifically, ManiNetCluster employs manifold learning to match local and non-linear structures among the networks of different states, to identify cross-network linkages. By applying ManiNetCluster to the developmental gene expression datasets across model organisms (e.g., worm, fruit fly), we found that our tool significantly better aligns the orthologous genes than existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating the non-linear interactions between evolutionary functions in development. Moreover, we applied ManiNetCluster to a series of transcriptomes measured in the green alga Chlamy-domonas reinhardtii, to determine the function links between various metabolic processes between the light and dark periods of a diurnally cycling culture. For example, we identify a number of genes putatively regulating processes across each lighting regime, and how comparative analyses between ManiNetCluster and other clustering tools can provide additional insights.

In this paper, we present a fully automated detection and segmentation pipeline using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). We investigated the robustness of the cGAN model against adding Gaussian noise or removing noise from the training data. Based on the detection and segmentation metrics, de-noising did not show a significant improvement.

First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models\u2014Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)\u2014for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service\u2019s Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the

A useful piece of information for scheduling jobs, typically not available, is the extent to which applications will use available resources once they are executed. This paper comparatively assesses the suitability of several machine learning techniques for predicting spatio temporal utilization of resources by applications. Modern machine learning techniques able to handle large number of attributes are used, taking into account application- and system-specific attributes (e.g., CPU micro architecture, size and speed of memory and storage, input data characteristics and input parameters). The work also extends an existing classification tree algorithm, called Predicting Query Runtime (PQR), to the regression problem by allowing the leaves of the tree to select the best regression method for each collection of data on leaves. The new method (PQR2) yields the best average percentage error, predicting execution time, memory and disk consumption for two bioinformatics applications, BLAST and RAxML, deployed on scenarios that differ in system and usage. In specific scenarios where usage is a non-linear function of system and application attributes, certain configurations of two other machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors, also yield competitive results. In addition, experiments show that the inclusion of system performance and application-specific attributes also improves the performance of machine learning algorithms investigated.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CCGRID.2010.98", "venue": "2010 10th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing", "journal": "2010 10th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2157777898", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10352473", "15830203", "9522077", "27137817", "9079907", "7492166", "1555002", "2237472", "739829", "2150258", "14441902", "13864758", "18683182", "140109802", "207165665", "743542", "16733223", "2214159", "14437072"], "inbound_citations": ["13662098", "49183962", "52194601", "198180023", "15417383", "5522451", "23830994", "12084304", "46929238", "22918686", "15943297", "18385299", "9627744", "3833400", "18785896", "8439783", "17562636", "204840908", "184486745", "65253081", "30222045", "16233755", "7696501", "19178579", "61810022", "14374774", "16154055", "17393276", "3892238", "17873088", "203655994", "51923202", "54611007", "7684608", "7880495", "761158", "44162383", "14708388", "34398159", "7352819", "199379385", "7519777", "16719845", "211684721", "46971876", "18185635", "15838257", "7430673", "10604083", "198180017", "8331852", "51926871", "17295006", "8933720", "3398285", "8455105", "55092701", "174796785", "1566980", "203579756", "166220246", "212422619", "58671121", "192639957", "17053033", "199439243", "29773972", "9054335", "6685274", "171095380", "18161210", "15999764", "36799343", "155108684", "52959262", "214946121", "13949421", "52865414", "11266199", "11070935", "44157560", "52022706", "52900220", "204509195", "3640307", "44767373"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14328733"}

Specifically, transfer learning from the task of object recognition is exploited to more effectively train good features for material classification. The approach of transfer learning using convnets yields significantly higher recognition rates when compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. We then analyze the relative contribution of reflectance and shading information by a decomposition of the image into its intrinsic components.

Given a digitized frame of a propagating wave, SCA constructs a highly accurate representation of the front and the back of the wave, piecewise interpolates this representation with cubic splines, and subjects the result to an accurate curvature analysis. This analysis is more comprehensive than methods based on spiral-tip tracking, as it considers the entire wave front and back. To increase the smoothness of the resulting symbolic representation, the SCA uses weighted overlapping of adjacent segments which increases the smoothness at join points. SCA has been applied to a number of representative types of spiral waves, and, for each type, a distinct curvature evolution in time (signature) has been identified. Distinct signatures have also been identified for spiral breakup.

Our experiments on the NSL-KDD dataset show that the proposed model can improve the detection accuracy not only on the test dataset containing mostly known attacks (KDDTest+) but also on the test dataset featuring many novel attacks (KDDTest-21) -- about 2.68\\% improvement on KDDTest+ and 22.02\\% on KDDTest-21 can be achieved, as compared to the traditional ConvNet model.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.02352", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICBDA.2019.8713213", "venue": "2019 IEEE 4th International Conference on Big Data Analytics (ICBDA)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 4th International Conference on Big Data Analytics (ICBDA)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2971489520,2946143596", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206577177", "16748785", "4528546", "6844431", "362467", "18965349", "27653988", "3074096", "52927542", "49416467", "3725747", "3441568", "52988015", "25331286"], "inbound_citations": ["202719023", "210868389"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155107099"}

The well-log data vary greatly in depth domain with higher vertical solution, and the environment and boundary effects of well-log data usually have been corrected in order that the log records at any depth are the contributions from lithology and hydrocarbon. However, the seismic data are recorded in time domain with poor vertical solution. Seismic data d (t0) is usually assumed to be the convolution of a wavelet w (t) with the reflectivity r (t). The convolution model means the seismic data at any given time are the contributions from a time range rather than a point like well-log records. How to incorporate two different domains (time and depth) dataset and two different measurement systems is crucial for our reservoir characterization modeling. The seismic post/pre-stack inversion is one of most important step and gains very popular at oil and gas industries. However only a very small part of both welllog and seismic info can be integrated for our reservoir modeling at current inversion procedure, such as compressional velocity, shear velocity and density are common for AVO application. In fact there are more reservoir parameters evaluated from well-log, such as porosity, volume of shale and water saturation and there are more time-domain and frequency-domain attributes extracted from seismic gathers. It is challenging for us to integrate and honor all these dataset for the reservoir characterization modeling. This paper will present our geostatistical inversion solution to honor well-log data and seismic attributes based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our geostatistical inversion solution is an integrated approach. Firstly, we need to evaluate well logs to calculate the reservoir parameters, such as porosity, water saturation and volume of shale. Secondly, the reservoir parameters and well logs will be converted from depth-domain to time-domain which will be consistent with seismic dataset and seismic attributes. Thirdly, it is crucial to extract time/frequency-domain seismic attributes from stack seismic dataset and pre-stack seismic gathers. Lastly, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) will help us to honor seismic attributes and well-log data to propagate log-derived reservoir property from borehole to 2D/3D space to generate the reservoir characterization model.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2312134410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131086980"}

The class imbalance problem occurs when one class of data severely outnumbers the other classes of data. The classification models learned on Support Vector Machines (SVM) are quite prominent in exhibiting better generalization abilities even in the context of the class imbalance problem. However, it is proved that the high imbalance ratio hinders SVM learning performance. With this concern, this paper presents an empirical study on the viability of SVM in the context of feature selection from moderately and highly unbalanced datasets. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) wrapper feature selection is analyzed in this study and its performance on one document analysis and two biomedical unbalanced datasets is compared with two prominent feature selection methods like Chi-Square (CHI) test and Information Gain (IG) using Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classification models. Findings: From this empirical study two major identifications are reported: 1. For the considered scenarios, classification models learned on IG and CHI test are better performed than SVM-RFE feature selection of high class imbalance setting. 2. The SVM-RFE on rebalanced data yielded better performance than SVM-RFE on original data. Application/Improvements: Considered feature selection methods, including SVM-RFE yielded better performance on oversampled data than SVM-RFE on original data.

The regression based model developed on training/testing datasets of 1952 chemicals and 105 peptides displayed the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.87, 0.84 and 0.87, 0.83 using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest techniques correspondingly. We also explored the peptidomimetics approach, in which the most contributing descriptors of peptides were used to identify chemicals having anti-flavi potential. Conversely, the selected descriptors of chemicals performed well to predict anti-flavi peptides. Moreover, the developed model proved to be highly robust while checked through various approaches like independent validation and decoy datasets. We hope that our web server would prove a useful tool to predict and design the efficient anti-flavi agents.

The conventional approaches cannot generate satisfactory infrared images due to the challenge of this task and many unknown parameters to be determined. In this paper, we proposed a novel multi-branch semantic GAN (MBS-GAN) for infrared image generation from the optical image. In the proposed model, we draw on the idea from Ensemble Learning and propose to use more than one generator to synthesize the infrared images with different semantic information. Specially, we integrate scene classification into image transformation to train models with scene information, which assists learned generation models to capture more semantic characteristics.

Current prognostic models predict treatment outcome with imperfect accuracy and clinically relevant biomarkers are yet to be established that improve upon the existing International Prognostic Scoring system. ::: ::: PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 113 fresh frozen lymph node specimens from classical HL patients by gene expression profiling (Affymetrix UA 133 2.0 Plus) focusing on correlations with treatment outcome. The cohort comprised 100 diagnostic pretreatment and 13 relapse biopsies. Treatment was considered a failure if the lymphoma progressed during therapy or relapsed at any time. Treatment success was defined as absence of progression or relapse. Gene expression findings were validated in paraffin embedded material using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD20 and CD56 in the original 100 cases, in an independent validation cohort of 166 cases and a set of 172 cases using flow cytometric assessment of CD20 and CD56. For our predictive model, we trained a classifier by Simultaneous Multinominal Logistic Regression (SMLR) and assessed relative feature importance using Random Forests. ::: ::: RESULTS: We found underexpression of genes representing a global B cell signature in 18 pretreatment biopsies of patients whose first line systemic chemotherapy failed (p=0.033). These results were independently validated using immunohistochemistry for CD20 in 166 patients. The presence of background B cells in the direct vicinity of Hodgkin Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells favorably affected progression-free survival (p=0.042) in a univariate analysis; however, in multivariate analysis only clinical stage and hemoglobin were independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, down-regulation of genes involved in T cell receptor signaling was associated with failure of first line systemic chemotherapy. In contrast to immunohistochemistry validation, flow cytometry was not sensitive to differences in T (CD3) or B cell (CD20) numbers (p=0.22 and p=0.35, respectively). Under-expression of genes of an NK cell signature in 6 relapse biopsies correlated with failure to secondary therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (p=0.048). IHC accordingly showed complete lack of NK cells in these biopsies. To study the predictive power of gene expression in comparison to clinical risk factors, we identified 103 gene expression probe sets and Ann Arbor stage as the most important features. Importantly, we found 8 probe sets that were more influential than Ann Arbor stage. In comparison to either gene expression or clinical variables alone, combining of the two data sources achieved best performance values for predicting outcome of first line treatment (Receiver Operating Characteristics [ROC]: AUC(combined) = 0.76; AUC(gene expression) = 0.71; AUC(clinical) = 0.69). ::: ::: CONCLUSION: Clinical outcome correlates with the presence of B cells in pretreatment and NK cells in relapse biopsies verifying the importance of the microenvironment for outcome prediction in HL. We were able to validate these findings by IHC and showed that GEP adds to the predictive value of clinical prognostic scoring. Our data suggest that integration of further molecular data, especially those derived from HRS cell enriched specimens, will be of value in helping to inform novel predictive models in Hodgkin lymphoma.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2551684983", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79378126"}

So product reviews classification has grown to be one of the hottest research areas in sentiment analysis.

This is an area with excellent wind conditions, but where the installed wind power capacity at present is limited. The area is characterized by a rugged coastline and complex terrain, which have earlier been shown to lead to high wind power forecast errors. The overall aim of the thesis is to study how this kind of conditions influence wind power forecast errors and to investigate how wind power forecast models can be made more resistant to the challenges these conditions pose. The data basis for the thesis consists of wind observations and NWP wind forecast for 43 sites, all covering the period from January 1 2009 to December 17 2011. The observations and forecasts are transformed into synthetic wind power forecasts and observations by the use of a logarithmic height profile and a generic power curve. Different methods of reducing the wind power forecast errors of the single sites and groups of sites are tested. When applied to \u201cunseen\u201d forecasts (i.e. independent test data) the simpler models tend to out-compete more complicated models of the same kind. This is caused by a combination of noisy data and sparse data for certain wind speeds and wind directions leading to models being easily over-fitted. Still, using a regression model based on information on spatial and temporal dependencies of the forecast errors of groups of sites, a reduction in the group forecast error of 49 % is obtained. The group point forecasts are expanded into probabilistic forecasts using the postprocessing method Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). It is shown how BMA can be used to produce probabilistic forecasts for the lumped power output of groups of sites from the point forecasts for the single-site group members and historical observations and forecasts from a training period. Some ideas for further development of the method for wind power forecasting are presented. Last, the issue of wind power ramps \u2013 large sudden changes in the wind power production \u2013 is addressed. Using a simple method to forecast ramps from wind power forecasts it is found that the methods earlier used to reduce the wind power forecast errors for groups of sites also lead to an increased predictability of wind power ramps. Ramp forecasts are also made using the classification method Random Forests. The method is found to have some very desirable properties, but the current implementation of the method also has some serious problems that need to be solved before the method is a good option for wind power ramp forecasting.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2493526422", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132619720"}

Tool life is a significant criterion in coated abrasive machining since deterioration of abrasive grains increases the surface irregularity and adversely affects the finishing quality. Predicting tool life in real time for coated abrasives not only helps to optimise the utilisation of the tool\u2019s life cycle but also secures the surface quality of finished components. This paper describes the evolution of the abrasive grain degradation in the belt tool with process time and also the development of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) based predictive classification model for in-process sensing of abrasive belt wear for robotized abrasive belt grinding process. With this tool condition monitoring predicting system, the effectiveness of the belt and the surface integrity of the material is secure. The analysis of sensor signals generated by the accelerometer, Acoustic Emission (AE) sensor and force sensor during machining is proposed as a technique for detecting belt tool life states. Various time and frequency domain features are extracted from sensor signals obtained from the accelerometer, acoustic sensor and force sensor mounted on the belt grinding setup. The time and frequency domain features extracted from the signals are simultaneously optimised to obtain a subset with fewer input features using a GA. The classification accuracy of the k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) technique is used as the fitness function for the GA. The subset features extracted from the signals are used to train the SVM in MATLAB. An experimental investigation using four different conditions of tool states is introduced to the SVM and GA for the prediction and classification.

TCF performs via sharing data-independent knowledge and modeling data-dependent effects simultaneously. However, TCF is a batch algorithm and updates the model parameters only once after scanning all data, which might not be efficient enough for real systems. This article proposes a novel and efficient transfer learning algorithm called interaction-rich transfer by collective factorization (iTCF), which extends the efficient collective matrix factorization (CMF) algorithm by providing more interactions between the user-specific latent features. The assumption under iTCF is that the predictability with regards to the same user's rating behaviors in two related data is likely to be similar. Considering the shared predictability, the authors derive novel update rules for iTCF in a stochastic algorithmic framework. The advantages of iTCF include its efficiency compared with TCF, and its higher prediction accuracy compared with CMF. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of iTCF over the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MIS.2014.2", "venue": "IEEE Intelligent Systems", "journal": "IEEE Intelligent Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2044645911", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206742345", "207168823", "5499886", "9253851", "9683534", "467086", "207189532", "14421557", "740063", "10134126", "2342859", "18384114"], "inbound_citations": ["17773811", "202560508", "32993784", "25635084", "16657839", "15081360", "6914186", "15667045", "13404300", "15617068", "58948389"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5803295"}

Web page classification is a type of textual document classification. However, the text contained in web pages is not homogenous since a web page can discuss related but different subjects. Thus, results obtained by a textual classifier on web pages are not as better as those obtained on textual documents. Therefore, we need to use a method to enhance results of those classifiers or more precisely a technique to correct their results. One category of techniques that address this problem is to use the test set hidden underlying information to correct results assigned by a textual classifier. In this paper, we propose a method that belongs to this category. Our method is a Cross Training based Corrective approach (CTC) for web page classification that learns information from the test set in order to fix classes initially assigned by a text classifier on that test set. This adjustment leads to a significant improvement on classification results. We tested our approach using three traditional classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), on four subsets of the Open Directory Project (ODP). Results show that our collective and corrective approach, when applied after SVM, NB or KNN, enhances their classification results by up to 12.39%.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IJCSA", "journal": "IJCSA", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2591905794", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["44971656", "207738357", "52874011", "1836349", "5555015", "2427083", "61730441", "1536643", "14130954", "5658362", "7311285", "577580", "59652114", "59671230", "43685115", "62016134"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15893952"}

The classification results from all the color spaces and all the derive images are input to a greedy machine learning program to verify the necessity of the integration of derivative image data and different color spaces.

In the standard risk management practice, an appropriate assumption about the multivariate probability distribution of the assets composing the portfolio is crucial. Many studies assumed a joint Gaussian distribution for asset returns favouring the correlation coefficient as association measure. However, the empirical evidence contrasts with the assumption of a normal multivariate distribution and, overall, disagrees with a linear measure of association. ::: In particular, to analyse the financial risk by international diversification it is important to look at the lower and upper tail dependence, that is the concordance, respectively, between extremely negative and positive values of the variables. Thus, a multivariate normal distribution assumption for asset returns could exhibit very poor performances, since it does not generally allow for a tail dependence among the marginal variables. ::: The goal of the work is to analyse the whole joint distribution using a Copula-GARCH approach and to measure the lower tail dependence structure focusing on Archimedean copulae ensuring the modelling of both tail dependences without any equality constraint. ::: More specifically, in a financial crisis perspective it is important to prefer assets with a two-by-two low dependence in the lower tail, in order to protect the portfolio against financial risk. Although the approach with copula functions has been recognized to offer good estimates of the tail dependence coefficients, it rapidly becomes cumbersome to apply in a highly-dimensional context, because it requires the optimization of a very complex likelihood function. For this reason, when a large set of assets is available, the choice can be made with a more manageable procedure in terms of the computational burden. Our proposal is based on the algorithmic technique of Random Forest, well-known in the field of data mining. The performance of the proposed procedure is inspected with some simulation studies and, subsequently, applied to real data.

The decoding of neuronal signals is one of the important steps in BMI systems. Existing decoding methods commonly fall into two categories, i.e., linear methods and nonlinear methods. This paper compares the performance between the two kinds of methods in the decoding of motor cortical activities of a monkey. Kalman filter (KF) is chosen as an example of linear methods, and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are two nonlinear approaches evaluated in our work. The experiments are conducted to reconstruct 2D trajectories in a center-out task. The correlation coefficient (CC) and the root mean square error (RMSE) are used to assess the performance. The experimental results show that GRNN and SVR achieve better performance than Kalman filter with average improvements of about 30% in CC and 40% in RMSE. This demonstrates that nonlinear models can better encode the relationship between the neuronal signals and response.

To avoid the problem, the system usually needs to re-learn old instances again. During the learning phase, we cannot make the system recognize new inputs. In contrast, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) memorize new instances only by appending the new instances to its database so that k-NN does not waste learning time. However, k-NN wastes a large amount of resources to record all instances. To solve the problem, the author presents several model-based incremental learning systems for function approximation. Those methods reduce apparent learning time by introducing a sleep phase. Therefore, during the awake phase, the system can recognize known instances and memorize unknown new instances simultaneously. On the other hand, during sleep phase, the system realizes model-selection for reduction of redundant hidden units. This paper presents an extended version of the previous method to improve its generalization ability in addition to applying it to various classification problem. Several benchmark tests show that the new system learns instances quickly, as does k-NN, but uses only about 10% to 50% of the resources of k-NN. The generalization ability also outperforms the k-NN.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1224007", "venue": "Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2003.", "journal": "Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2003.", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2120355167", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["29040420"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62259923"}
