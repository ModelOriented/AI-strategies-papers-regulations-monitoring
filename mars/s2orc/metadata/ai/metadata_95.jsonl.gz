Based on smart structures' nonlinear, parallel features, and the existed intrinsic flaws of conventional neural networks, research on Support Vector Machine (SVM) used to detect damages for smart structures has become one of main researches recently. Aimed at the key and difficult research problem on SVM - the selection and construction of kernel functions, a mixed kernel function used to Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is constructed through analyzing the existed kernel functions of LS-SVM. Based on damage detection for smart structures, the parameters of LS-SVM with the mixed kernel are optimized by Genetic Algorithms (GA), and the detecting results are compared with that of LS-SVM based on RBF kernel. The result shows that, the accuracy of damage detection based on LS-SVM with mixed kernel is higher than that based on LS-SVM with RBF kernel under the same condition.

The model was trained on a realistically large-scale problem, mapping between Chinese orthography and phonology. This split-fovea model replicated the interaction between character regularity and frequency that has been found in Chinese phonetic compound naming tasks. It also provided cross-language support for the hemispheric desynchronization account of dyslexia. Finally, the model predicted different regularity effects between characters with different phonetic radical positions. Introduction Cognitive scientists aim to understand language processing universals. Seidenberg and McClelland\u2019s \u201ctriangle model\u201d of the reading of monosyllabic English words has been substantially developed (e.g. Harm & Seidenberg, 1999). However, there is still little application to languages other than English. The cognitive modelling of the processing of Chinese orthography suffers from an input representativeness problem (cf. Chater & Christiansen, 1999) due to its complexity; there is ongoing debate as to how to represent Chinese characters in a psychologically realistic way. Most of the proposed computational models of Chinese character reading either have not been computationally implemented (e.g. Perfetti & Tan, 1999), or have employed relatively small-scale training data (e.g. Chen & Peng 1994). Cognitive modelling research in Chinese reading thus has lagged behind research in the reading of English. Chinese has a radically different orthography from any alphabetic language. The basic writing units of Chinese are characters, which usually contain meaningful morphemes, instead of the letter-based representations of speech segments found in alphabetic languages. In general, there are four different ways of composing Chinese characters: pictographs, indicatives, ideographs, and semantic-phonetic compounds. A semantic-phonetic compound (or simply a phonetic compound) contains both semantic and phonological information. Such compounds comprise about 81% of the 7,000 most frequent characters in the Chinese dictionary (Li & Kang, 1993). Hence, understanding how Chinese readers recognize these phonetic compounds is an important goal in psycholinguistic cognitive modelling. A phonetic compound can be decomposed into two major components: a semantic component, which bears information about the meaning of the character, and a phonetic component, which may have partial information about the pronunciation of the character. Most phonetic compounds have their semantic radicals on the left and phonetic radicals on the right (SP characters). For example, the character \u201c \u6c90 \u201d means \u201ctaking a bath\u201d in English and is pronounced as \u201cmu4\u201d in Pinyin 1 . It consists of a semantic radical on the left, which means \u201cwater\u201d, and a phonetic radical on the right, which is pronounced the same as the character. We call these characters regular phonetic compounds. Some characters may be pronounced slightly differently from their phonetic radicals, such as \u201c\u67da\u201d. Its phonetic radical \u201c \u7531 \u201d is pronounced as \u201ciou2\u201d in Pinyin. However, \u201c\u67da\u201d has a different tone \u2013 it is pronounced as \u201ciou4\u201d. These characters are referred to as semi-regular phonetic compounds. Finally, there are some characters pronounced very differently from their phonetic radicals, such as \u201c\u6d12\u201d (sa3) and \u201c\u897f\u201d (xi1). We call them irregular phonetic compounds. The opposite structure to an SP character exists, in which the phonetic radical is on the left and the semantic radical is on the right (PS characters). The ratio of SP characters to PS characters is about 9:1 (Hsiao & Shillcock, in preparation). A regularity effect has been found in the processing of Chinese phonetic compounds: Chinese readers name regular characters faster than irregular characters. There is also a frequency by regularity interaction in Chinese, as in English (see, .e.g., Hue, 1992; Liu, Wu & Chou, 1996; Seidenberg, 1985.) Researchers have also studied Chinese character reading in brain-damaged patients (Yin & Butterworth, 1992) and found similar disorders as those found in The Chinese Pinyin system is a spelling system based on the Latin alphabet. The number at the end indicates the tone type.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2585812901", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["144036528", "60808288", "7279603", "4643694", "10301716", "140461655", "39477876", "69842347", "22218635", "1597106", "143694367", "6458378"], "inbound_citations": ["25560311", "18107787", "13003505", "1333415", "20770861", "6442205", "4948213"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4942234"}

However, the margin maximization principle of SVM does not perform ranking optimization but merely classification error minimization. To tackle this problem, we exploit the sparse Bayesian kernel model, namely the relevance vector machine (RVM), as the classifier for semantic concept detection. Based on automatic relevance determination principle, RVM outputs the posterior probabilistic prediction of the semantic concepts. This inference output is optimal for ranking the target video shots, according to the Probabilistic Ranking Principle. The probability output of RVM on individual uni-modal features also facilitates probabilistic fusion of multi-modal evidences to minimize Bayes risk. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that RVM outperforms SVM for video semantic concept detection.

Here we discuss in detail about how we have applied the chicken swarm Optimisation as a feature selection algorithm to the cancer dataset of features in order to predict if the cancer is malignant or benign. Here we also elucidate how the Chicken Swarm Optimization provides better results than several other machine learning models such as Random Forest, k-NN, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines. Feature Selection is a technique used to eliminate the redundant features from a large dataset in order to obtain a better subset of features to use for processing. In order to achieve this, we have used Chicken Swarm Optimization. The chicken swarm optimization algorithm is a bio-inspired algorithm. It attempts to mimic the order of hierarchy and the behavior of chicken swarm in order to optimize the problems. On the basis of these predictions we can also provide quick treatment by using virtual reality simulators that can be helpful for complex oncological surgeries.

Here, building large good datasets is very crucial for learning a reliable detector. However, it is practically challenging due to the diversity of polyp types, expensive inspection, and labor-intensive labeling tasks. For this reason, the polyp datasets usually tend to be imbalanced, i.e., the number of non-polyp samples is much larger than that of polyp samples, and learning with those imbalanced datasets results in a detector biased toward a non-polyp class. In this paper, we propose a data sampling-based boosting framework to learn an unbiased polyp detector from the imbalanced datasets. In our learning scheme, we learn multiple weak classifiers with the datasets rebalanced by up/down sampling, and generate a polyp detector by combining them. In addition, for enhancing discriminability between polyps and non-polyps that have similar appearances, we propose an effective feature learning method using partial least square analysis, and use it for learning compact and discriminative features. Experimental results using challenging datasets show obvious performance improvement over other detectors.

Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in image generation, we adopt GAN to learn the overall distribution of a multivariate time series dataset and to generate the missing values for each sample. Different from image completion where GAN is trained on complete images, we cannot obtain complete time series due to the nature of data recording process. Therefore, a modified Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) model is employed in GAN to model the temporal irregularity of the incomplete time series. Experiments on two multivariate time series datasets show that our method outperforms the baselines in terms of accuracy of missing value imputation.

We model the data stream as consisting of two states: a high-volatility state and a low-volatility state, with transitions taking place to/from these states depending on the level of volatility in the stream. In segments of high volatility an ensemble of online classifiers is used for learning, whereas in low volatility maximum utilization is made of past concepts which are encoded by compact versions of Fourier spectra.

The hyperspectral images in Zhangye are selected as the study zone, and the sample parameter data were acquired based on the high resolution images and the ground survey information, the images were classified with parameter-optimized SVM to obtain the posterior probability graph for each class, and the posterior probability graphs were truncated using the threshold values of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 0.9 for analysis of the accuracy change of ground object classification at different probabilities. The results show that with the increase of truncation probability, the user accuracy in the classification results increases continuously, while the producer accuracy shows a declining tendency, and the overall classification accuracy also shows a declining tendency. The analysis of the posterior probability distribution of various types of ground objects shows that it is difficult to distinguish the posterior probability of some mixed ground objects. The untrained water body targets can be easily distinguished by the truncation probability, but the posterior probabilities of untrained red materials and white materials are mixed together. This shows that there exist some conditions in which the posterior probability of optimized SVM can not directly and effectively indicate the distinction of ground objects. The posterior probability should be used optionally, and at the same time, it is necessary to construct a more robust calculation method for the posterior probability.

This current paper designs Proportional Integral Derivative controller based on Bees Intelligent Algorithm as the optimization technique for nonlinear model of semi-active landing gear system that chooses damping performance of system at touchdown as object function. Optimal setting of controller parameters to achieve favorable time response using numerical software method based on Bees Algorithm is more simple and more effective than other traditional methods such as Ziegler-Nichols and experimental because it does not need high experience and complex calculations and leads to better results. This research develops nonlinear two-dimensional mathematical model to describe landing gear system with oleopneumatic shock absorber and linear tire. Based on this model, the dynamic equations are used to investigate the behavior of an aircraft semi-active landing gear system subject to runway disturbance excitation and the stability conditions of the landing system around static equilibrium position is studied. SIMULINK simulation software is applied to validate the theoretical analysis of system stability. Results of system numerical Simulation with optimized controller using Bees Algorithm in MATLAB software shows that the transmitted impact load to airframe, the vertical vibration of aircraft and time to return static equilibrium position at touchdown are significantly improved.

Therefore, the power quality and reliability of distribution system are of main significance to both users and power system. The switchgears are one of the most widely used components in the distribution network. Consequently, it is necessary to study the reliability of the distribution switchgears. Traditional researches on risk assessment of switchgears hardly considered the potential threat caused by high temperature, high pressure and humid environment, which is quite common in some areas especially the coastal areas of distribution network. In order to forecast the failure rates of switchgears better, the method for failure rate forecasting considering the environmental factors based on Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are advanced in this paper. The related ambient temperature, humidity and the historical failure rate which were obtained from the actual operation distribution data from China Southern Power Grid (CSPG) are normalized firstly. And then create the training function to train the processed data. Next the BPNN and SVR are used to minimize the error between the predicted value and the actual value through iteration. A demonstration based on a coastal city in China is given to prove the validity of the algorithm. The environmental dependency result is compared with the result from the method that only the historical failure rate considered. A general conclusion can be drawn that the SVR method is more accurate than the BPNN method. And it is expected to be widely used in the whole CSPG in the future.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.157", "venue": "ANT/SEIT", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2799360961", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53874653"}

The CTPN detects a text line in a sequence of fine-scale text proposals directly in convolutional feature maps. We develop a vertical anchor mechanism that jointly predicts location and text/non-text score of each fixed-width proposal, considerably improving localization accuracy. The sequential proposals are naturally connected by a recurrent neural network, which is seamlessly incorporated into the convolutional network, resulting in an end-to-end trainable model. This allows the CTPN to explore rich context information of image, making it powerful to detect extremely ambiguous text. The CTPN works reliably on multi-scale and multi-language text without further post-processing, departing from previous bottom-up methods requiring multi-step post filtering.

The developed approaches to structural and physicochemical interpretation do not depend on used machine learning methods that makes it possible to easily interpret traditional \u201cblack box\u201d models like Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. We demonstrated an applicability of the developed interpretation approaches in a number of case studies including classical Hammett and Free-Wilson analysis, as well as several data sets with various physical and biological end-points. A good correspondence of the interpretation results with classical Hammett and Free-Wilson approaches supports validity of the proposed approaches. The analysis of different data sets with different end-points showed three possible scenarios of QSAR models\u2019 interpretation depending on the mechanisms of action for studied compounds that brings us to a conclusion that despite all models are interpretable, not all end-points are. The stereochemical interpretation was applied to the classical Cramer\u2019s set of steroids and to the data set that includes compounds with mixed central and axial chirality. In both cases we demonstrated the substantial contribution of the chiral descriptors in 2.XD QSAR models and revealed certain stereochemical features, which have the biggest contributions to investigated properties.

To address such critical challenges, we developed DiaGRAM (Deep GeneRAtive Multi-task), which is built upon the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

In this paper, we try to alleviate this problem by proposing a new generative network that relies on the use of random discriminators instead of adversarial design. This design helps us to avoid the min-max formulation and leads to an optimization problem that is stable and could be solved efficiently. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using handwritten digits (MNIST) and Fashion products (Fashion-MNIST) data sets.

The concepts of response and damage patterns are introduced and incorporated into a systematic methodology for generating a robust dataset for any damaged building. Incremental dynamic analysis using sequential ground motions is used to evaluate the residual collapse capacity of the damaged structure. Machine learning algorithms are used to map response and damage patterns to the structural safety state (safe or unsafe to occupy) of the building based on an acceptable threshold of residual collapse capacity. Predictive models including classification and regression tree and Random Forests are used to probabilistically identify the structural safety state of an earthquake-damaged building. The proposed framework is applied to a 4-story reinforced concrete special moment frame building. Distinct yet partially overlapping response and damage patterns are found for the damaged building classified as safe and unsafe. High prediction accuracies of 91% and 88% are achieved when the safety state is assessed using response and damage patterns respectively. The proposed framework could be used to rapidly evaluate whether a damaged building remains structurally safe to occupy after a seismic event and can be implemented as a subroutine in community resilience evaluation or building lifecycle performance assessment and optimization.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.strusafe.2017.12.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Structural Safety", "mag_id": "2775484290", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["116533580", "213366929", "208829229", "134733016"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125553296"}

A wide range of face images in different poses, with different expressions and under different lighting conditions are used as a training set to capture the variations of human faces. Experimental results on commonly used CMU data sets show that the SNoW-based approach perform well against methods that use neural networksneural network, Bayesian classifiers, Support Vector Machines and others. To quantify and explain the experimental results, we present a theoretical analysis that shows the advantage of this architecture and traces it to the nature of the update rule used in SNoW, a multiplicative update rule based on the Winnow learning algorithm. In particular, in sparse domains (in which the number of irrelevant features is large) this update rule is shown to be advantageous relative to algorithms that are derived from additive update rules such as Perceptron and Support Vector Machines.

Besides, as the data usually arrive at the nodes sequentially, online detection method that can process streaming data is preferred. In this paper, we formulate a distributed online OCSVM for anomaly detection over networks and get a decentralized cost function. To get the decentralized implementation without transmitting the original data, we use a random approximate function to replace the kernel function.

In shelves, same or similar products are more likely to appear adjacent to each other and displayed in certain arrangements rather than at random. The arrangement of the products on the shelves has a spatial continuity both in brand and metric size. By using this context information, the co-occurrence of the products and the adjacency relations between the products can be statistically modeled.

To reduce the distribution divergence between the source domain and the target domain, many previous studies have been focused on designing and optimizing objective functions with the Euclidean distance to measure dissimilarity between instances. However, in some real-world applications, the Euclidean distance may be inappropriate to capture the intrinsic similarity or dissimilarity between instances. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a metric transfer learning framework (MTLF) to encode metric learning in transfer learning. In MTLF, instance weights are learned and exploited to bridge the distributions of different domains, while Mahalanobis distance is learned simultaneously to maximize the intra-class distances and minimize the inter-class distances for the target domain. Unlike previous work where instance weights and Mahalanobis distance are trained in a pipelined framework that potentially leads to error propagation across different components, MTLF attempts to learn instance weights and a Mahalanobis distance in a parallel framework to make knowledge transfer across domains more effective. Furthermore, we develop general solutions to both classification and regression problems on top of MTLF, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets on object recognition, handwriting recognition, and WiFi location to verify the effectiveness of MTLF compared with a number of state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2017.2669193", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2588646734", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["740063", "14688775", "5984940", "2890796", "2467509", "2680388", "70831", "8153773", "964489", "61294087", "15978939", "206742596", "59566327", "16051475", "29387350", "47325215", "850937", "1990988", "14563054", "6980074", "6953522", "14456120", "12794304", "12134482", "13798326", "1252205", "7419723", "883281", "60697037", "10742222", "3089696", "9238949", "861459", "55485900", "9133542", "4908577", "16496273", "6742009", "2890796", "122725444", "64095012", "16307218"], "inbound_citations": ["51929263", "209496803", "3928689", "167214315", "203606657", "19503720", "77374920", "207848029", "52948589", "202889935", "52154241", "198339906", "215445177", "75137541", "56517312"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2745878"}

Traditionally, various statistical methods were used for modeling crash injury severities. In recent years, machine learning-based methods are becoming popular due to their good predictive performance. However, the machine learning-based models are usually criticized as they perform like a black-box. In this paper, we aim at comparing the predictive performance, including prediction accuracy and estimation of variable importance, among various machine learning and statistical methods with distinct modeling logic for crash severity analysis. The crash severity, road geometry, and traffic flow data were collected at freeway diverge areas in Florida. We estimated two most commonly used statistical methods which were ordered probit (OP) model and multinomial logit model, and four popular machine learning methods, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine. The correct prediction rate for each crash severity level and the overall correct prediction rate were calculated. The results showed that the machine learning methods had higher predicting accuracy than the statistical methods, though they suffered from over-fitting issue. The RF method had the best prediction in overall and severe crashes while OP was the weakest one. We compared variable importance on crash severity via perturbation-based sensitivity analyses. The results showed that the inferences of variable importance from different methods were not always consistent and should be paid careful attention.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2874979", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2897805291", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["30175310", "22114859", "111296800", "36485276", "14637219", "107541602", "110250373", "23051115", "8067295", "37899706", "27608625", "22280097", "40619203", "44493738", "155820941", "9704311", "36494121", "53966851", "109492088", "23209820", "1444402", "3030505", "8824329", "110977917", "28025607", "42040576", "1113964", "12131798", "89141", "52874011", "961425", "8397120"], "inbound_citations": ["211094088"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53280171"}

As a consequence, many techniques to evaluate it have been developed. In particular, the ITU-T adopted in 2001 a technique called Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) to automatically measuring speech quality. PESQ is a well-known and widely used procedure, providing in general an accurate evaluation of perceptual quality by comparing the original and received voice sequences. One obvious inherent limitation of PESQ is, thus, that it requires the original signal (we say the reference), to make its evaluation. This precludes the use of PESQ for assessing the perceived quality in real-time, as the reference is in general not available. In this paper, we describe a procedure for estimating PESQ output working only with measures taken on the network state and properties of the communication system, without any use of the reference. It is based on the use of statistical learning techniques. Specifically, we rely on recent ideas for learning with specific types of neural networks, known under the name of Echo State Networks (ESNs), a member of the class of Reservoir Computing systems. These tools have been proven to be very efficient and robust in many learning tasks. The experimental results obtained show the good accuracy of the resulting procedure, and its capability to give its estimations of speech quality in a real-time context.

In this paper, we have reviewed the case of Twitter and found that spammers contributing to pornographic content follow legitimate Twitter users and send URLs that link users to pornographic sites. Behavioral analysis of such type of spammers has been conducted using graph-based as well as content-based information fetched using simple text operators to study their characteristics. In the present study, about 74,000 tweets containing pornographic adult content posted by around 18,000 users have been collected and analyzed. The analysis shows that the users posting pornographic content fulfill the characteristics of spammers as stated by the rules and guidelines of Twitter. It has been observed that the illegitimate use of social media for spreading social spam has been spreading at a fast pace, with the network companies turning a blind eye toward this growing problem. Clearly, there is an immense requirement to build an effective solution to remove objectionable and slanderous content as stated above from social networking websites to promote and protect public decency and the welfare of children and adults. It is also essential so as to enhance public experience of genuine users using social media and protect them from harm to their public identity on the World Wide Web. Further in this paper, classification of pornographic spammers and genuine users has also been performed using machine learning technique. Experimental results show that Random Forest classifier is able to predict pornographic spammers with a reasonably high accuracy of 91.96 %.

Next, we fit synthetic 3D humans with different body shapes to each pose and render each from 180 camera viewpoints while randomly varying the clothing textures, background and lighting. Generative Adversarial Networks are employed to minimize the gap between synthetic and real image distributions. CNN models are then learned that transfer human poses to a shared high-level invariant space. The learned CNN models are then used as invariant feature extractors from real RGB and depth frames of human action videos and the temporal variations are modelled by Fourier Temporal Pyramid. Finally, linear SVM is used for classification.

SAR and hyperspectral sensors are sensitive to different characteristics of the objects in the scene, i.e. hyperspectral provides information about surface material while SAR provides information about geometrical and dielectric properties of the objects. Hence, combining SAR and Hyperspectral data might allow to resolve the classification ambiguities of man made objects in a complex scene. In this paper supervised feature-based classification methods are used on the hyperspectral and SAR data separately and the results of these classifications are fused. The features used for the classification consist of the original bands for both sensors, the PCA bands for the hyperspectral data, the speckle reduced SAR data and results of various polarimetric decomposition methods from the POLSAR data. Two classification methods were used: a newly developed method which is based on logistic regression (LR) and the classical matched filtering (MF) method. The LR is a supervised multi-variate statistical tool that finds an optimal combination of the input channels for distinguishing one class from all the others. Both classification methods provide, also probability images that give in each pixel the probability or abundance of a given class in that pixel, which can be used in the decision-level fusion. Three types of decision-level fusion are investigated: a weighted majority vote, a method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and one based on a binary decision tree. The methods are applied on data of an urban area in the South of Germany that were acquired in May 2004. The collected data consists of HyMap (VIS-SWIR) and E-SAR data (L-band fullpolarimetric and X-band HH- and VV-polarisation). The detected images included various manmade objects as residences, industrial buildings, forest, agriculture fields, airport and roads in rural-urban and industrial scenes. For calibration and verification ground truth data were collected using ASD spectrometer and digital topographic and cadastral maps of the areas were acquired. An exhaustive comparison of the obtained classification and fusion results is performed. This comparison shows that fusion of PolSAR and hyperspectral data improves significantly urban object recognition.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IbPRIA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2182733048", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["18749523", "16108691", "195708713", "42375192", "140659658", "129030232", "7253793", "128834448", "129241610", "60969287", "128666729", "45060541", "108591249", "16332132", "2923580", "31342511", "109185456", "37817956", "722009", "8693209"], "inbound_citations": ["207825562", "17043214", "3604824", "1849385", "131169381", "120042559"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15018227"}

This study presents new methods for merging fuzzy rules from multiple domains for regression tasks. Two different settings are separately explored: homogeneous and heterogeneous space. In homogeneous situations, knowledge from the source domains is merged in the form of fuzzy rules. In heterogeneous situations, knowledge is merged in the form of both data and fuzzy rules.

Attention operators on graph data enables learnable weights when aggregating information from neighboring nodes. However, graph attention operators (GAOs) consume excessive computational resources, preventing their applications on large graphs. In addition, GAOs belong to the family of soft attention, instead of hard attention, which has been shown to yield better performance. In this work, we propose novel hard graph attention operator (hGAO) and channel-wise graph attention operator (cGAO). hGAO uses the hard attention mechanism by attending to only important nodes. Compared to GAO, hGAO improves performance and saves computational cost by only attending to important nodes. To further reduce the requirements on computational resources, we propose the cGAO that performs attention operations along channels. cGAO avoids the dependency on the adjacency matrix, leading to dramatic reductions in computational resource requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed deep models with the new operators achieve consistently better performance. Comparison results also indicates that hGAO achieves significantly better performance than GAO on both node and graph embedding tasks.

Drought conditions can have an adverse effect on crop yield. Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with classical Machine Learning algorithms are in current use to determine the stress levels. Every spectral band in an HSI does not contain useful information regarding the stress levels. For this reason, some vegetation indices are selected by agricultural researchers, based on reflectance ratios where a significant change in reflectance was observed because of stress. These indices do not always contain significant information because of changes in temperature, humidity or other atmospheric variations in different trials. There is no fixed set of vegetation indices which can be used to estimate stress levels accurately. In this paper, we demonstrated the working of Conditional Covariance Operator (CCM) which is used to select the most significant spectral bands from the collected Hyperspectral data itself. CCM is the most recent of the feature selection methods. This efficient feature selection method is used for the first time in this paper for plant stress analysis in rapid manner. It selects consistent discriminative spectral bands even when training examples per class are less than what other feature selection methods need. It can be seen that the Random Forest classifier model can classify the stress level into three categories (i) normal (ii) mild and (iii) severe stress with an accuracy of 99.7% when only 10 spectral bands are selected.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICACC48162.2019.8986161", "venue": "2019 9th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication (ICACC)", "journal": "2019 9th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication (ICACC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3005983617", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["4569683", "90117032", "53715127", "20500153", "30959326", "19751475", "10797979", "130586609", "121145176", "39826829", "4856097", "97320171", "85264091", "27055219"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211118958"}

Over the past decades, taking as input the SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) attributes, many supervised machine learning algorithms have been proven to be effective for disk failure prediction. However, these approaches heavily rely on the availability of substantial annotated failed disk data which unfortunately exhibits an extreme data imbalance, i.e., the number of failed disks is much smaller than that of healthy ones, resulting in suboptimal performance and even inability at the beginning of their deployment, i.e., cold starting problem. Inspired by the significant success achieved in GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) based anomaly detection, in this paper, we translate disk failure prediction into an anomaly detection problem. Specifically, we develop a novel Semi-supervised method for lifelong disk failure Prediction via Adversarial training, called SPA. The distinguishing feature of SPA from existing supervised approaches is that SPA is only trained on healthy disks, which avoids the traditional limitations of imbalance in datasets and eliminates the cold starting problem. Furthermore, a novel 2D image-like representation technique is proposed to enable the deployment of deep learning techniques and the automatic feature extraction.

Uncertainty of each SDM was assessed with TSS (Ture Skill Statistics) and AUC (the Area under the curve) value of ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analyses. To reduce model uncertainty, we combined 9 single SDMs weighted by TSS and resulted in an ensemble forecast, a TSS weighted ensemble. We predicted future distributions of Hedera rhombea under future climate conditions for the period of 2050 (2040\u223c2060), which were estimated with HadGEM2-AO. RF (Random Forest), GBM (Generalized Boosted Model) and TSS weighted ensemble model showed higher prediction accuracies (AUC > 0.95, TSS > 0.80) than other SDMs. Based on the projections of TSS weighted ensemble, potential habitats under current climate conditions showed a discrepancy with actual habitats, especially in the northern distribution limit. The observed northern boundary of Hedera rhombea is Ulsan in the eastern Korean Peninsula, but the projected limit was eastern coast of Gangwon province. Geomorphological conditions and the dispersal limitations mediated by birds, the lack of bird habitats at eastern coast of Gangwon Province, account for such discrepancy. In general, potential habitats of Hedera rhombea expanded under future climate conditions, but the extent of expansions depend on RCP scenarios.

Despite their practical relevance, very few generic methods exist to solve HFS problems. Instead, many approaches either focus on two-stage problems or the application of simple dispatching rules. Moreover, the majority of authors assume identical parallel machines, which reduces the complexity of machine assignment to a large extent. If a real world case is studied, solution methods are often customized and not adaptable to other settings. Most common decomposition approaches are critical path-related or only focus on possible permutations of job indices while utilizing simple machine assignment rules [1]. Lately, machine learning (ML) has been applied to different scheduling problems. A common application is the selection of best dispatching rules based on the state of systems parameters. We propose an alternative ML-based approach to makespan or flowtime minimization that is suitable for different configurations regarding the number of stages and number of unrelated machines per stage. To speed up the scheduling process, we apply ML in one step of our solution method: We train Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with optimal machine assignments and makespan or flowtime values for fixed batch sizes and randomly generated processing time matrices. Afterwards, we use the trained NN and SVM to predict optimal makespan or flowtime values and machine assignments for all partial job sequences (batches) based on a given processing time matrix.

To learn to use the user profiles effectively is one of the most challenging tasks when developing an IF system. With the document selection criteria better defined based on the users\u2019 needs, filtering large streams of information can be more efficient and effective. To learn the user profiles, term-based approaches have been widely used in the IF community because of their simplicity and directness. Term-based approaches are relatively well established. However, these approaches have problems when dealing with polysemy and synonymy, which often lead to an information overload problem. Recently, pattern-based approaches (or Pattern Taxonomy Models (PTM) [160]) have been proposed for IF by the data mining community. These approaches are better at capturing sematic information and have shown encouraging results for improving the effectiveness of the IF system. On the other hand, pattern discovery from large data streams is not computationally efficient. Also, these approaches had to deal with low frequency pattern issues. The measures used by the data mining technique (for example, \u201csupport\u201d and \u201cconfidences\u201d) to learn the profile have turned out to be not suitable for filtering. They can lead to a mismatch problem. This thesis uses the rough set-based reasoning (term-based) and pattern mining approach as a unified framework for information filtering to overcome the aforementioned problems. This system consists of two stages - topic filtering and pattern mining stages. The topic filtering stage is intended to minimize information overloading by filtering out the most likely irrelevant information based on the user profiles. A novel user-profiles learning method and a theoretical model of the threshold setting have been developed by using rough set decision theory. The second stage (pattern mining) aims at solving the problem of the information mismatch. This stage is precision-oriented. A new document-ranking function has been derived by exploiting the patterns in the pattern taxonomy. The most likely relevant documents were assigned higher scores by the ranking function. Because there is a relatively small amount of documents left after the first stage, the computational cost is markedly reduced; at the same time, pattern discoveries yield more accurate results.

Tests were based on the well-known IR bench-marking processes, using the latest version of the Reuters dataset, namely, the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1). The performance of the new two-stage model was compared with both the term-based and data mining-based IF models.

In recent years, segmentation methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCN) have achieved great success in general images. This success is primarily due to the leveraging of large labelled datasets to learn features that correspond to the shallow appearance as well as the deep semantics of the images. However, the dependence on large dataset does not translate well into medical images. To improve the FCN performance for skin lesion segmentations, researchers attempted to use specific cost functions or add post-processing algorithms to refine the coarse boundaries of the FCN results. However, the performance of these methods is heavily reliant on the tuning of many parameters and post-processing techniques. In this paper, we leverage the state-of-the-art image feature learning method of generative adversarial network (GAN) for its inherent ability to produce consistent and realistic image features by using deep neural networks and adversarial learning concept. We improve upon GAN such that skin lesion features can be learned at different level of complexities, in a controlled manner. The outputs from our method is then augmented to the existing FCN training data, thus increasing the overall feature diversity.

It summarizes three of my research projects. ::: ::: We first investigate the role of margins in the phenomenal success of the Boosting Algorithms. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an algorithm for generating an ensemble of hypotheses for classification. The superior out-of-sample performance of AdaBoost has been attributed to the fact that it can generate a classifier which classifies the points with a large margin of confidence. This led to the development of many new algorithms focusing on optimizing the margin of confidence. It was observed that directly optimizing the margins leads to a poor performance. This apparent contradiction has been the topic of a long unresolved debate in the machine-learning community. We introduce new algorithms which are expressly designed to test the margin hypothesis and provide concrete evidence which refutes the margin argument. ::: ::: We then propose a novel algorithm for Adaptive sampling under Monotonicity constraint. The typical learning problem takes examples of the target function as input information and produces a hypothesis that approximates the target as an output. We consider a generalization of this paradigm by taking different types of information as input, and producing only specific properties of the target as output. This is a very common setup which occurs in many different real-life settings where the samples are expensive to obtain. We show experimentally that our algorithm achieves better performance than the existing methods, such as Staircase procedure and PEST. ::: ::: One of the major pitfalls in machine learning research is that of selection bias. This is mostly introduced unconsciously due to the choices made during the learning process, which often lead to over-optimistic estimates of the performance. In the third project, we introduce a new methodology for systematically reducing selection bias. Experiments show that using cloned datasets for model selection can lead to better performance and reduce the selection bias.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7907/GV3D-AB69.", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "197548077", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60110579"}

This was a longitudinal observational study. The main inclusion criteria were patients 18 years old or more with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Every 6 months up to month 24, QoL was recorded using generic and MS-specific questionnaires (MusiQoL and SF-36). At 24 months, individuals were divided into two \u2018disability change\u2019 groups: worsened and not-worsened patients. The RF method was performed based on Breiman\u2019s description. Analyses were performed to determine which QoL scores of SF-36 predicted the MusiQoL index. The average variable importance (AVI) was estimated. A total of 417 (79.6%) patients were defined as not-worsened and 107 (20.4%) as worsened. A clear RS was identified in worsened patients. While the mental score AVI was almost one third higher than the physical score AVI at 12 months, it was 1.5 times lower at 24 months. This work confirms that the RF method offers a useful statistical approach for RS detection. How to integrate the RS in the interpretation of QoL scores remains a challenge for future research.

In particular, we propose to regularize the training process by predicting image rotations. Our method (UDML-SS) jointly learns discriminative embeddings, unsupervised clustering assignments of the embeddings, as well as a self-supervised pretext task.

To avoid over-fitting caused by learning local metric matrices separately in the previous researches, we propose a novel local metric learning method in which we learn a metric matrix for each pair of instances as linear combinations of basis metric matrices defined on different clusters of the input space without any assumption for data set. We get the parameters of the linear combinations by using the relationship between direct distance and anchor~distance between a pair of data points. Additionally, we design a novel expectation-maximization based optimization method to learn the linear combinations and basis metric matrices.

Coastal zones are very dynamic and provide a number of critical ecosystem services, particularly in relation to flood mitigation but they have been found to be difficult to monitor using remotely sensed data. This research analysed combinations of S-band and X-band quad-polarimetric airborne SAR, elevation data and optical remotely sensed imagery. In total 30 variables were analysed. The SAR inputs included backscatter intensity channels and Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Van Zyl decomposition SAR descriptors. Classification was carried out using Random Forest classifiers at two thematic resolutions which generated a general mapping of salt marsh vegetation and a high-resolution mapping of thematically detailed salt marsh vegetation habitats. The results indicate that Random Forest models are able to handle multi-source datasets and generate high classification accuracies. Models based on either SAR or optical RS variables alone were found to be less accurate than models that combining variables from multiple sources. The results show that X-band SAR data provided the best information to map vegetation extent and analysis showed that S-band SAR data was better able to differentiate between different vegetation habitats.

According to the most recent statistics of World Health Organization, there are 360 million persons in the world with disabling hearing loss i.e. (5.3% of the world\u2019s population), around 13 million in the Middle East. Hence, the development of automated systems capable of translating sign languages into words and sentences becomes a necessity. We propose a model to recognize both of static gestures like numbers, letters, ...etc and dynamic gestures which includes movement and motion in performing the signs. Additionally, we propose a segmentation method in order to segment a sequence of continuous signs in real time based on tracking the palm velocity and this is useful in translating not only pre-segmented signs but also continuous sentences. We use an affordable and compact device called Leap Motion controller, which detects and tracks the hands' and fingers' motion and position in an accurate manner. The proposed model applies several machine learning algorithms as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K- Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) depending on two different features sets. This research will increase the chance for the Arabic hearing-impaired and deaf persons to communicate easily using Arabic Sign language(ArSLR). The proposed model works as an interface between hearing-impaired and normal persons who are not familiar with Arabic sign language, overcomes the gap between them and it is also valuable for social respect. The proposed model is applied on Arabic signs with 38 static gestures (28 letters, numbers (1:10) and 16 static words) and 20 dynamic gestures. Features selection process is maintained and we get two different features sets. For static gestures, KNN model dominates other models for both of palm features set and bone features set with accuracy 99 and 98% respectively.

Several scoring systems have been proposed to prognosticate outcomes after ICH, although the original ICH Score is still the most widely used. However, recent research suggests that systemic physiologic factors, such as those included in the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, may also influence outcome. In addition, no scoring systems to date have included premorbid functional status. Therefore, we propose a scoring system that incorporates these factors to prognosticate 3-month and 12-month functional outcomes. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We used the Random Forest machine-learning technique to identify factors from a dataset of more than 200 data points per patient that were most strongly affiliated with functional outcome. We then used linear regression to create an initial model based on these factors and modified weightings to improve accuracy. Our scoring system was compared with the ICH Score for prognosticating functional outcomes. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Two separate scoring systems (Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project 3 [ICHOP3] and ICHOP12) were developed for 3-month and 12-month functional outcomes using Glasgow Coma Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and hematoma volume (3-month only). Patient outcomes were dichotomized into good (mRS score, 0-3) and poor (mRS score, 4-6) categories based on functional status. Areas under the curve in the derivation cohort for predicting mRS score were 0.89 (3-month) and 0.87 (12-month); both were significantly more discriminatory than the original ICH Score. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The ICHOP scores may provide more comprehensive evaluation of a patient's long-term functional prognosis by taking into account systemic physiologic factors as well as premorbid functional status.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5441945", "pubmed_id": "28242488", "doi": "10.1016/j.wneu.2017.02.082", "venue": "World neurosurgery", "journal": "World neurosurgery", "mag_id": "2594086021", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["73437364", "52294122", "203580835", "215411795", "198287500", "163165417", "199056974"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13922145"}

These functions heavily depend on the success of image understanding, and thus large-scale image annotation has received intensive attention in recent years. The collaboration between mobile and cloud opens a new avenue for image annotation, because the heavy computation can be transferred to the cloud for immediately responding user actions. In this paper, we present a scheme for image annotation on the cloud, which transmits mobile images compressed by Hamming compressed sensing to the cloud and conducts semantic annotation through a novel Hessian regularized support vector machine on the cloud. We carefully explained the rationality of Hessian regularization for encoding the local geometry of the compact support of the marginal distribution and proved that Hessian regularized support vector machine in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is equivalent to conduct Hessian regularized support vector machine in the space spanned by the principal components of the kernel principal component analysis.

We hypothesize that poorer stimulus quality causes weaker activity in neurons responsive to the stimulus and more time to elapse between stimulus onset and identification. The weaker activity and increased delay to stimulus identification reduce the necessary strengthening of connections between neurons active before stimulus presentation and neurons active at the time of stimulus identification. We test our hypothesis through a biologically motivated computational model, which performs item recognition, memory formation and memory retrieval. In our simulations, spiking neurons are distributed into pools representing either items or context, in two separate, but connected winner-takes-all (WTA) networks. We include associative, Hebbian learning, by comparing multiple forms of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), which strengthen synapses between coactive neurons during stimulus identification. Synaptic strengthening by STDP can be sufficient to reactivate neurons during recall if their activity during a prior stimulus rose strongly and rapidly. We find that a single poor quality stimulus impairs recall of neighboring stimuli as well as the weak stimulus itself. We demonstrate that within the WTA paradigm of word recognition, reactivation of separate, connected sets of non-word, context cells permits reverse recall. Also, only with such coactive context cells, does slowing the rate of stimulus presentation increase recall probability. We conclude that significant temporal overlap of neural activity patterns, absent from individual WTA networks, is necessary to match behavioral data for word recall.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2901090", "pubmed_id": "20631822", "doi": "10.3389/fnsys.2010.00014", "venue": "Front.

To properly understand the influence of sleep, it is important to know how to detect its disorders such as snoring, wheezing, or sleep apnea. The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive capability of a dual-modality analysis scheme for methods of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) using biosignals captured during sleep. Two logistic regressions constructed using backward stepwise regression to minimize the Akaike information criterion were extensively considered. To evaluate classification correctness, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used. The proposed classification methodology was validated with constructed Random Forests methodology. Breathing sounds and electrocardiograms of 15 study subjects with different degrees of SRBD were captured and analyzed. Our results show that the proposed classification model based on selected parameters for both logistic regressions determine the different types of acoustic events during sleep. The ROC curve indicates that selected parameters can distinguish normal versus abnormal events during sleep with high sensitivity and specificity. The percentage of prediction for defined SRBDs is very high. The initial assumption was that the quality of result is growing with the number of parameters included in the model. The best recognition reached is more than 89% of good predictions. Thus, sleep monitoring of breath leads to the diagnosis of vital function disorders. The proposed methodology helps find a way of snoring rehabilitation, makes decisions concerning future treatment, and has an influence on the sleep quality.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/bams-2017-0003", "venue": null, "journal": "Bio-Algorithms and Med-Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2589199868", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4771007", "74559114", "20999629", "45986077", "18268425", "37819455", "29197390", "15232790", "27580473", "314329", "24073841", "9324927", "25016874", "11103867", "6309422", "19696295", "18947658", "18858479", "7751194", "24077454", "207309649", "12974530", "7366599", "29431524", "5875981", "215629502", "34432904", "38738390"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43645742"}

The algorithm combines SVMs with the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Unlike a classic radial basis function networks or multilayer perceptrons that require the topology of the network to be defined before training, an SVM selects the minimum number of training points, called support vectors, that ensure modeling of the data within the given level of accuracy (a.k.a. insensitivity zone /spl epsi/). It is this property that is exploited as the basis for an image compression algorithm. Here, the SVMs learning algorithm performs the compression in a spectral domain of DCT coefficients, i.e., the SVM approximates the DCT coefficients. The parameters of the SVM are stored in order to recover the image. Results demonstrate that even though there is an extra lossy step compared with the baseline JPEG algorithm, the new algorithm dramatically increases compression for a given image quality; conversely it increases image quality for a given compression ratio.

The basic idea of most distance metric learning methods is to find a space that can optimally separate data points that belong to different categories. However, current methods are mostly based on the single space that only learns one Mahalanobis distance for each data set, which actually fails to perfectly separate different categories in most real-world applications. To improve the accuracy of binary classification, a hierarchical method is proposed in this paper to completely separate different categories by sequentially learning subspace distance metrics. In the proposed method, a base-space distance metric is learned based on a similarity constraint first. Then, for binary classification problems, we formulate the subspace learning problem as a particular Burg Matrix optimization problem that minimizes the Burg Matrix divergence with distance constraints. Moreover, a cyclic projection algorithm is presented to solve the subspace learning problems.

A DAEL model is composed of a CNN feature extractor shared across domains and multiple classifier heads each trained to specialize in a particular source domain.

Both standard spatial and high-dimensional bilateral kernels are considered. Our framework is based on the observation that CRF inference can be achieved via projected gradient descent and consequently, can easily be integrated in deep neural networks to allow for end-to-end training. It is empirically demonstrated that such learned potentials can improve segmentation accuracy and that certain label class interactions are indeed better modelled by a non-Gaussian potential.

However, in real breeding \u03c1 may not be very useful for assessing the quality of the regression in the tails of the distribution, where individuals are chosen for selection. This research used 14 maize and 16 wheat data sets with different trait\u2013environment combinations. Six different models were evaluated by means of a cross-validation scheme (50 random partitions each, with 90% of the individuals in the training set and 10% in the testing set). The predictive accuracy of these algorithms for selecting individuals belonging to the best \u03b1=10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40% of the distribution was estimated using Cohen's kappa coefficient (\u03ba) and an ad hoc measure, which we call relative efficiency (RE), which indicates the expected genetic gain due to selection when individuals are selected based on GS exclusively. We put special emphasis on the analysis for \u03b1=15%, because it is a percentile commonly used in plant breeding programmes (for example, at CIMMYT). We also used \u03c1 as a criterion for overall success. The algorithms used were: Bayesian LASSO (BL), Ridge Regression (RR), Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RHKS), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) with linear (lin) and Gaussian kernels (rbf). The performance of regression methods for selecting the best individuals was compared with that of three supervised classification algorithms: Random Forest Classification (RFC) and Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear (lin) and Gaussian (rbf) kernels. Classification methods were evaluated using the same cross-validation scheme but with the response vector of the original training sets dichotomised using a given threshold. For \u03b1=15%, SVC-lin presented the highest \u03ba coefficients in 13 of the 14 maize data sets, with best values ranging from 0.131 to 0.722 (statistically significant in 9 data sets) and the best RE in the same 13 data sets, with values ranging from 0.393 to 0.948 (statistically significant in 12 data sets). RR produced the best mean for both \u03ba and RE in one data set (0.148 and 0.381, respectively). Regarding the wheat data sets, SVC-lin presented the best \u03ba in 12 of the 16 data sets, with outcomes ranging from 0.280 to 0.580 (statistically significant in 4 data sets) and the best RE in 9 data sets ranging from 0.484 to 0.821 (statistically significant in 5 data sets). SVC-rbf (0.235), RR (0.265) and RHKS (0.422) gave the best \u03ba in one data set each, while RHKS and BL tied for the last one (0.234). Finally, BL presented the best RE in two data sets (0.738 and 0.750), RFR (0.636) and SVC-rbf (0.617) in one and RHKS in the remaining three (0.502, 0.458 and 0.586). The difference between the performance of SVC-lin and that of the rest of the models was not so pronounced at higher percentiles of the distribution. The behaviour of regression and classification algorithms varied markedly when selection was done at different thresholds, that is, \u03ba and RE for each algorithm depended strongly on the selection percentile. Based on the results, we propose classification method as a promising alternative for GS in plant breeding.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4023444", "pubmed_id": "24424163", "doi": "10.1038/hdy.2013.144", "venue": "Heredity", "journal": "Heredity", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2019765809", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "1375712", "144565557", "206787478", "986234", "4695889", "54735661", "16832499", "19136066", "16198540", "1187248", "206970176", "13861754", "84363920", "55571260", "197033322", "6824290", "41695246", "10759276", "13798787", "11797924", "29256219", "87500", "56563878", "119953381", "14349461", "1506528", "53662922", "140109802"], "inbound_citations": ["59143968", "16034416", "209527204", "5086389", "215617041", "215621327", "150071737", "20555662", "58545736", "13651113", "21996843", "18539812", "205455656", "22999823", "278772", "22310685", "51701011", "15738054"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1313474"}

Exploring the Chain Model ::: There is a lot of empirical evidence showing that motor areas of the brain are activated both during action execution and comprehension of action related verbs, or sentences [3]. Interestingly, behavioral research and TMS research show both faciliation and interference when comprehension of motor action related sentences and execution of motor actions take place shortly after each other. This evidence suggests, that there is some relation between language processing and motor areas in the brain, but the nature of this relation is poorly understood [1]. ::: ::: Neurophysiological measurements show, that motor neurons encoding the same motor act exhibit different activation patterns according to the goal of sequence they are a part of. This gave birth to a theory of motor chains. The core idea of this theory is, that short action sequences are represented in brain as chained activation of pools of neurons, where each pool encodes a specific motor act. Chersi et al. [1] proposed a computational chain model aspiring to bring light to the relation between language processing and activation of motor parts. They tested the model by simulating an experiment inspired by previous experiments on human subjects. My goal is to implement the proposed model, replicate the simulated experiment and simulate my own experiment after the first is replicated successfully. ::: ::: The model consists of neuronal pools organized in chains, where the behavior of each pool is described by a firing rate model [2] with time dependent synaptic currents. The first experiment examines the facilitation and interference in activation of brain motor areas when an action is executed shortly after an action related sentence is presented to the subject (model in my case). The delay between stimulus (sentence) and execution is the independent variable and the firing rate of particular motor area is the dependent variable. I expect to observe temporal relation of interference and facilitation to delay as in [1], comparable to results obtained from experiments with human subjects. ::: ::: This exploration is a logical first step for my subsequent research regarding the chain model, which could help entangle the wires connecting language processing and motor areas in the brain and for the use of this kind of models in context of cognitive robotics. ::: ::: !!

With the recent developments in image processing and machine learning methods, the computer vision community is ready to develop the next generation of Human Computer Interaction methods, including Hand Gesture Recognition methods. A comprehensive Hand Gesture Recognition based semantic level Human Computer Interaction framework for uncontrolled environments is proposed in this thesis. The framework contains novel methods for Hand Posture Recognition, Hand Gesture Recognition and Hand Gesture Spotting. ::: ::: The Hand Posture Recognition method in the proposed framework is capable of recognising predefined still hand postures from cluttered backgrounds. Texture features are used in conjunction with Adaptive Boosting to form a novel feature selection scheme, which can effectively detect and select discriminative texture features from the training samples of the posture classes. ::: ::: A novel Hand Tracking method called Adaptive SURF Tracking is proposed in this thesis. Texture key points are used to track multiple hand candidates in the scene. This tracking method matches texture key points of hand candidates within adjacent frames to calculate the movement directions of hand candidates. ::: ::: With the gesture trajectories provided by the Adaptive SURF Tracking method, a novel classi\ufffder called Partition Matrix is introduced to perform gesture classification for uncontrolled environments with multiple hand candidates. The trajectories of all hand candidates extracted from the original video under different frame rates are used to analyse the movements of hand candidates. An alternative gesture classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network is also proposed. The input images of the Neural Network are approximate trajectory images reconstructed from the tracking results of the Adaptive SURF Tracking method. ::: ::: For Hand Gesture Spotting, a forward spotting scheme is introduced to detect the starting and ending points of the prede\ufffdned gestures in the continuously signed gesture videos. A Non-Sign Model is also proposed to simulate meaningless hand movements between the meaningful gestures. ::: ::: The proposed framework can perform well with unconstrained scene settings, including frontal occlusions, background distractions and changing lighting conditions. Moreover, it is invariant to changing scales, speed and locations of the gesture trajectories.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2255774076", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20866523"}

Cartridges containing the fluorescently labeled CTC from this system were reanalyzed using the image cytometer, which acquires images with a TDI camera using a 40\u00d7/0.6 NA objective and lasers as light source.

An automated classifier was developed to classify events into CTC, apoptotic CTC, CTC debris, leukocytes, and debris not related to CTC. A high agreement in classification was obtained between the automated classifier and five expert reviewers. Comparison of images from the same events in CellTracks TDI and CellTracks Analyzer II shows improved resolution in fluorescence images and improved classification by adding bright-field images. Improved detection efficiency for CD45-APC avoids the classification of leukocytes nonspecifically binding to cytokeratin as CTC. The correlation between number of CTC detected in CellTracks TDI and CellTracks Analyzer II is good with a slope of 1.88 and a correlation coefficient of 0.87.

We evaluated the techniques on simulated data generated to mimic global untargeted metabolomics data by incorporating realistic block-wise correlation and partial correlation structures for mimicking the correlations and metabolite clustering generated by biological processes.

In recent years, FAUD has become an attractive task since these slight changes on face reveal some cues of emotions which can then be utilized to infer people\u2019s affective. Many prior works are developed based on physical features of AUs, such as regional occurrence and temporal continuity, but few of them concern the negative impact of individual differences, causing an unrobust result in variant subjects and environments. To deal with the problem, a contrastive feature learning method is proposed to make a convolutional neural network (CNN) learn to extract the contrastive feature which is the difference between the features of a neutral face image and an AU-occurred face image. In this way, the individual information will be mitigated so that it becomes easier to detect AUs according to the features. A great disparity between the number of positive and negative samples, named as data imbalance, makes a serious interference in most detection problems, including FAUD. A lower occurrence rate of an AU leads a more severe data imbalance problem, which results in a biased result for the AU detection.

Optical images stand out from other remote sensing images in object detection due to their higher resolution and more visualized contents. However, most of the popular techniques for ship detection from optical spaceborne images have two shortcomings: 1) Compared with infrared and synthetic aperture radar images, their results are affected by weather conditions, like clouds and ocean waves, and 2) the higher resolution results in larger data volume, which makes processing more difficult. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem by improving segmentation or classification with complicated algorithms. These methods face difficulty in efficiently balancing performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a ship detection approach to solving the aforementioned two issues using wavelet coefficients extracted from JPEG2000 compressed domain combined with deep neural network (DNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compressed domain is adopted for fast ship candidate extraction, DNN is exploited for high-level feature representation and classification, and ELM is used for efficient feature pooling and decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the existing relevant state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method requires less detection time and achieves higher detection accuracy.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2014.2335751", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2003059629", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["25028868", "6033218", "62391583", "62007682", "18392991", "18035763", "132638508", "1937266", "13346240", "59817045", "2309950", "1658773", "207168299", "5108612", "207178999", "17804904", "10546515", "29888510", "4357826", "7402547", "19168380", "245951", "1375993", "60492667", "10672952", "3747652", "116858", "15037168", "16959235", "2661011", "760370", "7028394", "62210240", "2117791", "130535382", "461853", "206590483", "12591063", "16852518", "8924778", "62437194", "17084851", "122725444", "2702042"], "inbound_citations": ["23511178", "35396200", "55820552", "117664248", "201814460", "215056004", "30332427", "30332427", "8885887", "26129723", "30444761", "208039342", "44224424", "56410094", "39901204", "4714560", "52151148", "27357950", "19451201", "4344123", "15714771", "125524585", "133869337", "53230928", "213191820", "67872258", "213116710", "212425933", "32179046", "59441964", "6248822", "206694229", "174820629", "207118592", "43483299", "21659244", "58675424", "54572513", "201069365", "159121599", "52082699", "189857200", "209338876", "18891084", "152282225", "29626919", "33268876", "208033861", "126235007", "23463091", "15346651", "25408545", "2853902", "2036958", "157068250", "15902265", "19894340", "32069155", "34882738", "49193489", "53695220", "28922423", "14569537", "73571600", "195771410", "13185939", "53784218", "8349072", "8349072", "145833328", "19091803", "3792942", "199008850", "202174556", "16761988", "46896770", "9249619", "214317362", "54460068", "9125483", "41114542", "14439386", "3110415", "199579777", "209459734", "19989473", "71152885", "53228322", "15649660", "46894057", "85499374", "150121838", "34962028", "25881523", "85527902", "52053629", "11338424", "26004357", "5883440", "204935253", "3457930", "53243613", "211060042", "53226396", "53997745", "60442838", "106402682", "84178957", "89617408", "71146804", "127155032", "3865302", "126315055", "51933349", "4104791", "3858601", "211553854", "202944452", "213307610", "37933798", "46757675", "125252201", "86540321", "11014017", "208037561", "23042760", "4378414", "59553727", "3554136", "195885560", "214317862", "59236096", "21931379", "52906168", "59230771", "201876830", "9491503", "22795081", "121159347", "211097445", "55302832", "3807684"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7272861"}

GANs also have trouble encoding semantic requirements that make levels interesting and playable. This paper combines a GAN approach to generating individual rooms with a graph grammar approach to combining rooms into a dungeon. The GAN captures design principles of individual rooms, but the graph grammar organizes rooms into a global layout with a sequence of obstacles determined by a designer. Room data from The Legend of Zelda is used to train the GAN. This approach is validated by a user study, showing that GAN dungeons are as enjoyable to play as a level from the original game, and levels generated with a graph grammar alone. However, GAN dungeons have rooms considered more complex, and plain graph grammar's dungeons are considered least complex and challenging. Only the GAN approach creates an extensive supply of both layouts and rooms, where rooms span across the spectrum of those seen in the training set to new creations merging design principles from multiple rooms.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.05065", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3000654067", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27742188", "1033682", "13676024", "203566946", "195780971", "3555094", "203641959", "656585", "207179808", "17411836", "207196957", "16442588", "16064762", "64321464", "203566158", "61257019"], "inbound_citations": ["214743201", "214802584"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210702688"}

Methods: Fifteen participants from Study 1 wore three ActiGraph GT3X+ activity monitors (dominant hip, wrist, and ankle) in freeliving conditions and were directly observed for 2-3 h. The RFLab and SVMLab algorithms were applied to hip, wrist, and ankle accelerometer data for classification of activity type in 20 s intervals. Free-living accelerometer data were used to train SVMFL and RFFL algorithms for classification of activity type. Direct observation data were used to compute percent correct classification for activity type by the different algorithms. The best algorithm was used to predict locomotion time and the RFspeed algorithm was applied to predict locomotion speed. A Pearson product-moment correlation was used to determine the association of predicted with actual locomotion speed (400 m walk speed). Results: Overall classification accuracy using 20 s intervals for the lab-based algorithms was between 49% (wrist) to 55% (ankle) for the SVMLab algorithms, and 49% (wrist) to 54% (ankle) for RFLab algorithms. Overall classification accuracy of SVMFL and RFFL algorithms ranged from 58% (wrist) to 69% (ankle) and from 61% (wrist) to 66% (hip and ankle), respectively.

However, these descriptors are hand-crafted and require intensive human intervention with prior knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely circle convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CCRBM), for unsupervised 3D local feature learning. CCRBM is specially designed to learn from raw 3D representations. It effectively overcomes obstacles such as irregular vertex topology, orientation ambiguity on the 3D surface, and rigid or slightly non-rigid transformation invariance in the hierarchical learning of 3D data that cannot be resolved by the existing deep learning models. Specifically, by introducing the novel circle convolution, CCRBM holds a novel ring-like multi-layer structure to learn 3D local features in a structure preserving manner. Circle convolution convolves across 3D local regions via rotating a novel circular sector convolution window in a consistent circular direction. In the process of circle convolution, extra points are sampled in each 3D local region and projected onto the tangent plane of the center of the region. In this way, the projection distances in each sector window are employed to constitute a novel local raw 3D representation called projection distance distribution (PDD). In addition, to eliminate the initial location ambiguity of a sector window, the Fourier transform modulus is used to transform the PDD into the Fourier domain, which is then conveyed to CCRBM. Experiments using the learned local features are conducted on three aspects: global shape retrieval, partial shape retrieval, and shape correspondence. The experimental results show that the learned local features outperform other state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27608463", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2016.2605920", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2517836489", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18710793", "8086637", "17879431", "7290025", "1175269", "6220017", "549577", "36955642", "12298029", "17391817", "7964594", "1377132", "5832277", "13014994", "393948", "12008458", "195908774", "206741496", "20382199", "23684008", "5797377", "3110415", "15872657", "7673899", "7603689", "6124827", "12922081", "1045322", "1281757", "9784369", "16101700", "12701882", "9117881", "17847588", "11170942", "3817802", "11364671", "16900529", "14481434", "2407217", "206441208", "206592833", "19603871", "2309950", "1658773", "1414576", "6170348", "18260880", "2942954", "119007171", "14645500", "3120191", "8711585", "6034346", "395534", "8166368", "13951041", "9212604", "3136010", "6740475", "16399093", "15591682", "2294366", "30116060", "9426884"], "inbound_citations": ["51897342", "199405439", "19975966", "51613778", "73433953", "53230690", "199064226", "159041805", "202770895", "78094669", "4562636", "198985902", "85502632", "212675638", "52166951", "49658461", "186206572", "212747798"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12810980"}

Despite its importance, post-earthquake reconnaissance and recent experimental studies have highlighted the insufficient safety margins of shear walls. The lack of empirical and mechanics-based models prevents rapid failure mode identification of existing shear walls. This study builds on recent advances in the area of machine learning to determine the failure mode of shear walls as a function of geometric configurations, material properties, and reinforcement details. This study assembles a comprehensive database consisting of 393 experimental results for shear walls with various geometric configurations. Eight machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were evaluated in this study, in order to establish the best prediction model. As a result of detailed evaluation, a machine learning model based on the Random Forest method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method has 86% accuracy in identifying the failure mode of shear walls. This study also demonstrates that aspect ratio, boundary element reinforcement indices, and wall length-to-wall thickness ratio are the critical parameters influencing the failure mode of shear walls. Finally, an open-source data-driven classification model that can be used in design offices across the world is provided in this paper.

Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-OLDA) was used to compress the pretreated spectral data, and then the identification models were built based on Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The near infrared diffuse transmittance spectra analyzes non-uniform samples can achieve the analysis of optical path depth information accumulation, all information of the sample interior can be obtained, so transmittance spectra could identify haploid maize effectively and be desensitized to kernel positions.

The method can be applied in any kind of GAN without interfering with the learning procedure or affecting the learning objective. The central idea is to define a likelihood function that correlates with the quality of the generated images.

Many osteoporotic vertebral fractures (VF) present on images do not come to clinical attention or lead to fracture prevention treatment. Furthermore, DXA vertebral fracture assessments (VFA) are often reported subjectively by a radiologist or other clinician. VFA computer-aided systems offer potential advantages. Methods based on statistical shape models (e.g. active appearance models, AAMs) have been used to segment vertebrae in radiographs and DXA VFA. However, results achieved using AAMs exhibit significant numbers of large errors due to model fitting failure, particularly on more severely fractured vertebrae. We evaluate an alternative algorithm, the Random Forest Regression Voting Constrained Local Model (RFRV-CLMs), which has proved more robust and generalizable than AAMs in annotation of landmarks on various clinical images; we investigate whether this will reduce the number of fitting failures in vertebral segmentation.320 DXA VFA images obtained on various Hologic (Bedford MA) scanners had manual annotations of 405 landmark points of vertebrae T7 to L4, with fracture classifications from an expert radiologist.

Figure 1 shows an example image with manual annotations (left; grade 3 severe and grade 1 mild fractures of L1 and L2, respectively), with automatic annotations for L1 to L3 (right).

The exploitation step aims at returning to the user the maximum number of relevant images in a local region of the feature space. On the other hand, the exploration step aims at driving the search towards different areas of the feature space in order to discover not only relevant images but also informative images. Similar ideas have been proposed with Support Vector Machines, where the choice of the informative images has been driven by the closeness to the decision boundary.

There is a tremendous requirement to study data sets beyond the capability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate and manage within a tolerable elapsed time and also beyond the processing feasibility of the single machine architecture. In addition to the traditional structured data, the new avenue of NoSQL Big Data has urged a call to experimental techniques and technologies that require ventures to re-integrate. It helps to discover large hidden values from huge datasets that are complex, diverse and of a massive scale. In many of the real world applications, classification of imbalanced datasets is the point of priority concern. The standard classifier learning algorithms assume balanced class distribution and equal misclassification costs; as a result, the classification of datasets having imbalanced class distribution has produced a notable drawback in performance obtained by the most standard classifier learning algorithms. Most of the classification methods focus on two-class imbalance problem inspite of multi-class imbalance problem, which exist in real-world domains. A methodology is introduced for single-class/multi-class imbalanced data sets (Lowest vs. Highest\u2014LVH) with enhanced over_sampling (O.S.) techniques (MEre Mean Minority Over_Sampling Technique\u2014MEMMOT, Majority Minority Mix mean\u2014MMMm, Nearest Farthest Neighbor_Mid\u2014NFN-M, Clustering Minority Examples\u2014CME, Majority Minority Cluster Based Under_Over Sampling Technique\u2014MMCBUOS, Updated Class Purity Maximization\u2014UCPM) to improve classification. The study is based on broadly two views: either to compare the enhanced non-cluster techniques to prior work or to have a clustering based approach for advance O.S. techniques. Finally, this balanced data is to be applied to form Random Forest (R.F.) tree for classification. O.S. techniques are projected to apply on imbalanced Big Data using mapreduce environment.

However, the conventional deep computation model involves a large number of parameters. Typically, training a deep computation model with millions of parameters needs high-performance servers with large-scale memory and powerful computing units, limiting the growth of the model size for multimedia feature learning on common devices such as portable CPUs and conventional desktops. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a Tucker deep computation model by using the Tucker decomposition to compress the weight tensors in the full-connected layers for multimedia feature learning.

Finally, the performance of the Tucker deep computation model is evaluated by comparing with the conventional deep computation model on two representative multimedia datasets, that is, CUAVE and SNAE2, in terms of accuracy drop, parameter reduction, and speedup in the experiments.

SRC method emphasizes the role of parsimonious representation in achieving robustness and accurate classification. To enforce sparsity, the linear representation of query sample and training samples is computed using l 1 -minimization which is complex and time consuming. Recently, many studies have proved the robustness of SRC is achieved by the collaborative representation mechanism and not the l 1 sparsity constraint. Thus, the l 1 -norm based representation in SRC classification framework could be replaced by l 2 -norm based representation which is computationally more efficient. This type of classification method is called Collaborative representation based classification (CRC) in the literature. In this paper, an output weight computed from extreme learning machine ELM regarded as a class membership is utilized in conjunction with the classification decision in collaborative representation classifier to improve high classification accuracy over various public available face and speech recognition datasets. The role of ELM is to provide the class membership which denotes the nonlinear similarity of the query sample to training samples from each class. Whereas the CRC provides the linear representation of the query sample and training. The collaborative representation from CRC and class membership from ELM are applied in the regularized residual classification decision to classify the query sample.

So, this paper focuses on automatic extraction of public yet 'hidden' information available in newspaper articles and make it available to the general public. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach, this paper focuses on one type of crime, the theft crime. This work demonstrates how theft-related information can be extracted from newspaper articles from three different countries. The system employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithms to identify locations in sentences. However, not all the locations reported in the article are crime locations. So, it employs Conditional Random Field (CRF), a machine learning approach to classify whether a sentence in an article is a crime location sentence or not. This work compares the performance of four different NERs in the context of identifying locations and their subsequent impact in classifying a sentence as a 'crime location' sentence. It investigates whether a CRF-based classifier model that is trained to identify crime locations from a set of articles can be used to identify articles from another newspaper in the same country (New Zealand). Also, it compares the accuracy of identifying crime location sentences using the developed model in newspapers from two other countries (Australia and India).", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "AWC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2406908035", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18414971", "145392877", "14421062", "2070964", "2651631", "10977241", "15470791", "44985589", "2402112", "7862414", "277918", "59921147", "8310135", "36344640", "60004445", "1859014"], "inbound_citations": ["210116391", "211724366", "22560947", "53248294", "46827085", "24111510", "24087768", "22328162", "18841704", "52009213", "114435867", "11239752", "12387435", "51908345", "212706218", "14240298", "199508652", "13915745", "53283157", "28749201", "25461320", "163159599", "36981360", "85448103", "59526814", "53025455"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14798809"}

However, most existing research works were based on pixels at respective scale, and relatively few studies focused on estimation and multiscale transformation of AGB. We, therefore, developed an innovative object-oriented approach to estimate and transform AGB under multiple scales. First, AGB-correlated spectral, structural, and geographic indicators were derived from multisource data. Subsequently, multiresolution segmentation technology was performed to produce homogeneous geography and spectrum units (HGSUs) at different scales. Finally, AGB at each scale was retrieved based on HGSUs and Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Besides, the utilities of nonspectral variables in modeling were further evaluated. Results showed that the HGSU-oriented approach was effective and advantageous to achieve the AGB estimation and multiscale transformation based only on the same dataset with few user-defined parameters. Structural and geographic variables, especially soil type, vegetation species, and CHM, played important roles in modeling, while the contribution of spectral variables decreased with the increasing scale in general. The HGSUs combined multiple pieces of information such as spectra, texture, vegetation height, soil type, slope, elevation, and land use, and provided a more detailed segmentation, a faster stability speed with increasing regression trees, and a higher accuracy than those based on common image objects segmented only by spectral indicators. Results also evidenced that the RF regression model had the capability to ingest mixed data.

Hyperspectral imaging provides more detailed spectral and spatial information on the land cover than other remote sensing resources. Over the past ten years, traditional and formerly widely accepted statistical classification methods have been superseded by more recent machine learning algorithms, e.g., support vector machines (SVMs), or by multiple classifier systems (MCS). This can be explained by limitations of statistical approaches with regard to high-dimensional data, multimodal classes, and often limited availability of training data. In the presented study, MCSs based on SVM and random feature selection (RFS) are applied to explore the potential of a synergetic use of the two concepts. We investigated how the number of selected features and the size of the MCS influence classification accuracy using two hyperspectral data sets, from different environmental settings. In addition, experiments were conducted with a varying number of training samples. Accuracies are compared with regular SVM and random forests. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the generation of an SVM-based classifier system with RFS significantly improves overall classification accuracy as well as producer's and user's accuracies. In addition, the ensemble strategy results in smoother, i.e., more realistic, classification maps than those from stand-alone SVM.

Such approaches are void from inter-view communications and thus do not guarantee to yield the best possible ensemble classifier on the given sample-view space. This paper proposes a new algorithm for multiclass classification using multi-view assisted supervised learning (MA-AdaBoost). MA-AdaBoost uses adaptive boosting for initially training baseline classifiers on each view. After each boosting round, the classifiers share their classification performances. Based on this communication, weight of an example is ascertained by its classification difficulties across all views. Two versions of MA-AdaBoost are proposed based on the nature of final output of baseline classifiers. Finally, decisions of baseline classifiers are agglomerated based on a novel algorithm of reward assignment. The paper then presents classification comparisons on benchmark UCI datasets and eye samples collected from FERET database. Kappa-error diversity diagrams are also studied. In majority instances, MA-AdaBoost outperforms traditional AdaBoost, variants of AdaBoost, and recent works on supervised collaborative learning with respect to convergence rate of training set and generalization errors. The error-diversity results are also encouraging.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-16811-1_9", "venue": "ACCV", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1431421850", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10360575"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7542086"}

The study stresses the detection of Partial Discharges (PD) as they represent a major source of information related to degradation in the equipment. PD measurement is a widely extended technique for condition monitoring of electrical machines and power cables to avoid catastrophic failures and the consequent blackouts. One of the most important keystones in the interpretation of partial discharges is their separation from other signals considered as not-PD especially in low SNR measurements. In this sense, the OCSVM is an interesting alternative to binary SVMs since it does not need a training set with examples of all the output classes correctly labelled. On the contrary, the OCSVM learns a model of the signals acquired when the equipment is in PD-free mode, defined as a state where no degradation mechanism is active, so one only needs to make sure that the training signals were recorded under this setting. These default mode signals are easier to characterize and acquire in industrial environments than PD and lead to more robust detectors that practically do not need domain adaptation to perform in scenarios prone to different types of PD. In fact, the experimental results show that the performance of the OCSVM is comparable to that achieved by a binary SVM trained using both noise and PD pulses. Finally, the method is successfully applied to a more realistic scenario involving the detection of PD in a damaged distribution power cable.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en11030486", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2792190413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["2643920", "1164633", "107195123", "107144397", "30219327", "37861643", "39518430", "20259677", "109486453", "30219327", "21890618", "207165665", "14727192", "110457403", "108908562", "29853082", "7635678", "10125108", "2110475", "547095", "25570936", "961425", "16759139", "110261651", "22249154"], "inbound_citations": ["57753393", "211120761", "182555502", "115197165"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85441256"}

The performances of the LSMs were assessed and compared based on sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, kappa index, and receiver operating characteristic curves.

However, this is non-trivial due to the need for jointly learning underlying correlations between heterogeneous visual and tag data. The task is made more challenging by inherently sparse and incomplete tags. In this work, we develop a method for modelling the inherent visual data concept structures based on a novel Hierarchical-Multi-Label Random Forest model capable of correlating structured visual and tag information so as to more accurately interpret the visual semantics, e.g. disclosing meaningful visual groups with similar high-level concepts, and recovering missing tags for individual visual data samples. Specifically, our model exploits hierarchically structured tags of different semantic abstractness and multiple tag statistical correlations in addition to modelling visual and tag interactions. As a result, our model is able to discover more accurate semantic correlation between textual tags and visual features, and finally providing favourable visual semantics interpretation even with highly sparse and incomplete tags.

The inductive component experiments with these skills on new problems and uses the data collected in this process to refine the preconditions. Our system achieves this by converting the data collected during the problem solving experiments into the positive and negative examples of preconditions that can be learned with a standard Inductive Logic Programming system.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have shown great superiority on vulnerability assessment in many fields. However, their applications on the relationship analysis between the state features of urban buried gas pipeline network and the corresponding vulnerability level have not yet been reported. This paper proposed a uniform framework of the novel application of SVM and ANN methods to vulnerability assessment of urban buried gas pipeline network, and performed a comparison between these two methods on various aspects. The analysis methodology follows a four-stage procedure. First, various indexes influencing vulnerability are selected and quantified for further data generation process, by which enough training and validation samples are obtained. The architecture, essential algorithms and optimized parameters for the application of these two methods are determined by the next process of model selection. The model selection phase for ANN is far more complex than that for SVM, which makes it easy for ANN to come to over-fitting. The third stage is to train SVM and ANN on the training set and to evaluate the performance on the executions of the validation set. The results show that the training outputs of SVM (MSE = 2.74E-4) are better fitted with the desired outputs than that of ANN (MSE = 1.92E-2). The SVM model (SMAPE = 0.79%) is able to output satisfying values when applied to unknown samples and is more accurate than the ANN model (SMAPE = 8.64%) in prediction. Finally, a sample gas pipeline network was used to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of these two models, where the results are similar and consistent with the reality.

The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66 t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61 t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale.

The detection and interpretation of eQTL requires careful consideration of a range of potentially confounding effects. Particularly population substructure and batch effects may lead to the detection of many false-positive eQTL if not accounted for. Traditionally, most eQTL mapping methods only check for the correlation of single loci with gene expression. In order to detect (epistatic) interactions between distant genetic loci one has to take into account several loci simultaneously. Here, we present the Random Forest regression method as a way of accounting for interacting loci. Next, we introduce analysis methods aiding the biological interpretation of detected eQTL. For example, the notion of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTL has been very useful for interpreting the causes and implications of eQTL in many studies. In addition, Bayesian networks have been used extensively to infer causal relationships among eQTL and between eQTL and other genetic associations (e.g. disease associated loci). Also, the integration of eQTL with complementary information such as physical protein interaction data may significantly improve statistical power and provide insight into possible molecular mechanisms linking the regulator to its target gene.

In many applications, it would be beneficial to obtain an estimate of the uncertainty associated with a new observation and its membership within a particular class. Although statistical classification techniques base decision boundaries according to the probability distributions of the patterns belonging to each class, they are poor at supplying uncertainty information for new observations. Previous research has documented a multiarchitecture, monotonic function neural network model for the representation of uncertainty associated with a new observation for two-class classification. This paper proposes a modification to the monotonic function model to estimate the uncertainty associated with a new observation for multiclass classification. The model, therefore, overcomes a limitation of traditional classifiers that base decisions on sharp classification boundaries. As such, it is believed that this method will have advantages for applications such as biometric recognition in which the estimation of classification uncertainty is an important issue. This approach is based on the transformation of the input pattern vector relative to each classification class. Separate, monotonic, single-output neural networks are then used to represent the \"degree-of-similarity\" between each input pattern vector and each class. An algorithm for the implementation of this approach is proposed and tested with publicly available face-recognition data sets.

This study presents a modified application of a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) to predict tunnel squeezing based on four parameters, that is, diameter (D), buried depth (H), support stiffness (K), and rock tunneling quality index (Q). We compiled a database from the literature, including 117 case histories obtained from different countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan, to train the multiclass SVM model. The proposed model was validated using 8-fold cross validation, and the average error percentage was approximately 11.87%.

Studies have shown that an SDN may experience a high packet loss rate and a long delay in forwarding messages when the OpenFlow channel is overwhelmed by a saturation attack. The existing approaches have focused on the detection of saturation attacks caused by TCP-SYN flooding through periodic analysis of network traffic. However, there are two issues. First, previous approaches are incapable of detecting other types, especially unknown types, of saturation attacks. Second, they rely on predetermined time-window of network traffic and thus are unable to determine what time window of traffic data would be appropriate for effective attack detection. To tackle these problems, this paper first investigates the impact of different time-windows of OpenFlow traffic on the detection performance of three classification algorithms: the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier. We have built and analyzed a total of 150 models on OpenFlow traffic datasets generated from both physical and simulated SDN environments.

A key assumption in supervised learning is that the training and testing data are obtained under the same conditions.

These changes could alter the data distribution in a way that affects the accuracy of the predictive performance models and render them less useful; this phenomenon is referred to as concept drift. Ignoring concept drift can lead to suboptimal resource usage and decreased efficiency when those performance models are deployed for tuning and job scheduling in production systems. To address this issue, we propose a concept-drift-aware predictive modeling approach that comprises two components: (1) an online Bayesian changepoint detection method that can automatically identify the location of events that lead to concept drift in near-real time and (2) a moment-matching transformation inspired by transfer learning that converts the training data collected before the drift to be useful for retraining. We use application input/output performance data collected on Cori, a production supercomputing system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

In this work, we fill this critical gap by presenting DeepASL, a transformative deep learning-based sign language translation technology that enables ubiquitous and non-intrusive American Sign Language (ASL) translation at both word and sentence levels. DeepASL uses infrared light as its sensing mechanism to non-intrusively capture the ASL signs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical bidirectional deep recurrent neural network (HB-RNN) and a probabilistic framework based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for word-level and sentence-level ASL translation respectively. To evaluate its performance, we have collected 7, 306 samples from 11 participants, covering 56 commonly used ASL words and 100 ASL sentences. DeepASL achieves an average 94.5% word-level translation accuracy and an average 8.2% word error rate on translating unseen ASL sentences.

From related work in this domain two main design choices are extracted; what to take as features for news articles and how to couple them with the changes in stock price. This thesis then suggests which different features are possible to extract from articles resulting in a template for features which can deal with negation, favorability, abstracts from companies and uses domain knowledge and synonyms for generalization. To couple the features to changes in stock price a survey is given of several text classiffication techniques from which it is concluded that Support Vector Machines are very suitable for the domain of stock prices and extensive features. The system has been tested with a unique data set of news articles for which results are reported that are signifficantly better than random. The results improve even more when only headlines of news articles are taken into account. Because the system is only tested with closing prices it cannot concluded that it will work in practice but this can be easily tested if stock prices during the days are available. The main suggestions for feature work are to test the system with this data and to improve the filling of the template so it can also be used in other areas of favorability analysis or maybe even to extract interesting information out of texts.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2796259438", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169194934"}

Over the previous decades, researchers have proved the opportunities to automate the initial tumor classification and detection. The shortage of popular datasets of ultrasound images of breast cancer prevents researchers from obtaining a good performance of the classification algorithms. Traditional augmentation approaches are firmly limited, especially in tasks where the images follow strict standards, as in the case of medical datasets. Therefore besides the traditional augmentation, we use a new methodology for data augmentation using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We achieved higher accuracies by integrating traditional with GAN-based augmentation. This paper uses two breast ultrasound image datasets obtained from two various ultrasound systems. The first dataset is our dataset which was collected from Baheya Hospital for Early Detection and Treatment of Women\u2019s Cancer, Cairo (Egypt), we name it (BUSI) referring to Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) dataset. It contains 780 images (133 normal, 437 benign and 210 malignant). While the Dataset (B) is obtained from related work and it has 163 images (110 benign and 53 malignant). To overcome the shortage of public datasets in this field, BUSI dataset will be publicly available for researchers. Moreover, in this paper, deep learning approaches are proposed to be used for breast ultrasound classification. We examine two different methods: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach and a Transfer Learning (TL) approach and we compare their performance with and without augmentation. The results confirm an overall enhancement using augmentation methods with deep learning classification methods (especially transfer learning) when evaluated on the two datasets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14569/ijacsa.2019.0100579", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2947267495", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["58704060", "199615145", "25171325", "31454953", "33252661", "207641677", "8689292", "1033682", "15545473", "7480530", "21158732", "4117071", "11365288", "9430048", "195908774", "42480540", "15886530", "3213277", "4608153", "12219403", "28041841", "3860904", "52305483", "3668673", "52289143", "50786007", "3655281", "3686035", "3672198", "7725346", "4869249", "3719281", "10357686", "15068147", "35419054", "6909411", "13943041", "10894094", "26661612", "3074096", "1799558", "14542261", "6916627", "7801317", "1342687", "904144", "206592484", "56507745", "207752942", "14124313", "206594692", "206593880", "12227989", "3568073", "1099052"], "inbound_citations": ["209432866", "215438105"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:192522112"}

However, the high volume of reviews that are typically published for a single product makes harder for individuals as well as manufacturers to locate the best reviews and understand the true underlying quality of a product. In this paper, we reexamine the impact of reviews on economic outcomes like product sales and see how different factors affect social outcomes such as their perceived usefulness. Our approach explores multiple aspects of review text, such as subjectivity levels, various measures of readability and extent of spelling errors to identify important text-based features. In addition, we also examine multiple reviewer-level features such as average usefulness of past reviews and the self-disclosed identity measures of reviewers that are displayed next to a review. Our econometric analysis reveals that the extent of subjectivity, informativeness, readability, and linguistic correctness in reviews matters in influencing sales and perceived usefulness. Reviews that have a mixture of objective, and highly subjective sentences are negatively associated with product sales, compared to reviews that tend to include only subjective or only objective information. However, such reviews are rated more informative (or helpful) by other users. By using Random Forest-based classifiers, we show that we can accurately predict the impact of reviews on sales and their perceived usefulness. We examine the relative importance of the three broad feature categories: \u201creviewer-related\u201d features, \u201creview subjectivity\u201d features, and \u201creview readability\u201d features, and find that using any of the three feature sets results in a statistically equivalent performance as in the case of using all available features.

Such temporal community structure of MANETs has been shown to be extremely useful in improving the performance of routing and content-based routing in MANETs. However, detecting temporal communities in a completely distributed and real time manner is a hard problem, and it is often performed offline with knowledge of the full network topology over time. We propose CLAN, a distributed and real-time protocol for detecting temporal communities in MANETs. CLAN is an adaptation of the Label Propagation algorithm to distributed and time-varying graphs that MANETs are. A key novel component of CLAN is local rules for community rediscovery as the network evolves. CLAN also uses a weighted version of the network topology where the weights are defined using a novel notion of social entropy to promote stability of communities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that CLAN is quick to converge, incurs minimal overhead and is as effective as centralized approaches to temporal community detection. We also demonstrate how the temporal community structure can be used by designing a hierarchical routing protocol that achieves the delivery ratio of the OLSR routing protocol at a fraction of the overhead.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/MASS.2014.77", "venue": "2014 IEEE 11th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems", "journal": "2014 IEEE 11th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1969479609", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14296830", "14047787", "47350100", "16964916", "18741059", "44711941", "47270", "10211629", "10920772", "534783", "9934296", "15472330", "7650156", "15339472", "13950936", "14368641", "197314", "33388193", "16630414", "1039513", "4420074", "10920772", "17505978", "15240551", "4646743", "14237034", "334423", "61080475", "14310923", "2020925", "4341039"], "inbound_citations": ["209456963", "27378948"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17723429"}

In the best of our knowledge, we do not know several precedent works on Arabic topic identification, which is the task we investigate in this article. The corpus we used is extracted from the daily Arabic newspaper 'Alkhabar', which includes 6000 news articles, corresponding to nearly 3 millions of words covering the topics: local news, sport, international news and economy. According to our experiments, the results are encouraging both for SVM and TFIDF classifier, particularly if we compare them with those found for French language. However we have noticed the superiority of the SVM classifier and its high capability to distinguish topics. In addition we have shown the effect of vocabulary size in results enhancement. Other experiments have been conducted to determine the minimum of words necessary in order to achieve acceptable results.

The result shows that SVM based tagger has outperformed the existing taggers. In the existing POS taggers of Punjabi, the accuracy of POS tagging for unknown words is less than that for known words.

Various metrics (e.g., $F$ -score, area under the ROC curve) are used to evaluate the performances of MTL methods. Most existing MTL methods try to minimize either the misclassified errors for classification or the mean squared errors for regression. In this paper, we propose a method to directly optimize the evaluation metrics for a large family of MTL problems. The formulation of MTL that directly optimizes evaluation metrics is the combination of two parts: 1) a regularizer defined on the weight matrix over all tasks, in order to capture the relatedness of these tasks and 2) a sum of multiple structured hinge losses, each corresponding to a surrogate of some evaluation metric on one task. This formulation is challenging in optimization because both of its parts are nonsmooth. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel optimization procedure based on the alternating direction scheme of multipliers, where we decompose the whole optimization problem into a subproblem corresponding to the regularizer and another subproblem corresponding to the structured hinge losses. For a large family of MTL problems, the first subproblem has closed-form solutions. To solve the second subproblem, we propose an efficient primal-dual algorithm via coordinate ascent. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that, in a large family of MTL problems, the proposed MTL method of directly optimization evaluation metrics has superior performance gains against the corresponding baseline methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28362621", "doi": "10.1109/TCYB.2017.2670608", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2593607551", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13650160", "6617228", "13945520", "10958911", "118890427", "51789432", "1254778", "207752942", "53249418", "2098528", "16193644", "3116168", "12833219", "10407397", "9613358", "10461880", "16727656", "164297", "16185365", "1115550", "12817931", "7894269", "6370879", "15850472", "832721", "22754947", "8329460", "17228944", "9943634", "14655047", "7662718", "14626421", "10590559", "472227", "53722003", "10441288", "2185716", "564746", "8727032", "8007640", "13856501", "53662922", "7265538", "15783377", "4520179", "9717775", "24246005", "13895067", "7423459", "156436", "7984837", "6418451"], "inbound_citations": ["51613355", "51610996"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4380515"}

However, the optimal composition period is unclear as long composition periods (such as compositions lasting half a year) are less informative and short composition periods lead to information redundancy and missing pixels. In this study, we initially acquired daily 30 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series by fusing MODIS, Landsat, Gaofen and Huanjing (HJ) NDVI, and then composited the NDVI time series using four strategies (daily, 8-day, 16-day, and 32-day). We used Random Forest to identify crop types and evaluated the classification performances of the NDVI time series generated from four composition strategies in two studies regions from Xinjiang, China. Results indicated that crop classification performance improved as crop separabilities and classification accuracies increased, and classification uncertainties dropped in the green-up stage of the crops. When using daily NDVI time series, overall accuracies saturated at 113-day and 116-day in Bole and Luntai, and the saturated overall accuracies (OAs) were 86.13% and 91.89%, respectively. Cotton could be identified 40\u223c60 days and 35\u223c45 days earlier than the harvest in Bole and Luntai when using daily, 8-day and 16-day composition NDVI time series since both producer's accuracies (PAs) and user's accuracies (UAs) were higher than 85%. Among the four compositions, the daily NDVI time series generated the highest classification accuracies. Although the 8-day, 16-day and 32-day compositions had similar saturated overall accuracies (around 85% in Bole and 83% in Luntai), the 8-day and 16-day compositions achieved these accuracies around 155-day in Bole and 133-day in Luntai, which were earlier than the 32-day composition (170-day in both Bole and Luntai). Therefore, when the daily NDVI time series cannot be acquired, the 16-day composition is recommended in this study.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5978390", "pubmed_id": "29868265", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.4834", "venue": "PeerJ", "journal": "PeerJ", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2805461187", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["122097967"], "inbound_citations": ["204701353", "211050840", "174800815"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46931401"}

Appropriate shape descriptors are critical for accurate (and efficient) shape retrieval and 3D model classification. Several spectral-based shape descriptors have been introduced by solving various physical equations over a 3D surface model. In this paper, for the first time, we incorporate a specific manifold learning technique, introduced in statistics and machine learning, to develop a global, spectral-based shape descriptor in the computer graphics domain. The proposed descriptor utilizes the Laplacian Eigenmap technique in which the Laplacian eigenvalue problem is discretized using an exponential weighting scheme. As a result, our descriptor eliminates the limitations tied to the existing spectral descriptors, namely dependency on triangular mesh representation and high intra-class quality of 3D models. We also present a straightforward normalization method to obtain a scale-invariant and noise-resistant descriptor.

In this paper, we explore how to best leverage a segmentation model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset of patients images with one disease in order to successfully train a deep learning pathology segmentation model for a different disease, for which only a relatively small patient dataset is available. Specifically, we train a UNet model on a large-scale, proprietary, multi-center, multi-scanner Multiple Sclerosis (MS) clinical trial dataset containing over 3500 multi-modal MRI samples with expert-derived lesion labels. We explore several transfer learning approaches to leverage the learned MS model for the task of multi-class brain tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2018 dataset. Our results indicate that adapting and fine-tuning the encoder and decoder of the network trained on the larger MS dataset leads to improvement in brain tumor segmentation when few instances are available.

For these methods to be useful it is important that users can both choose the best model from the hundreds to thousands of models that are commonly generated for a target, and determine whether this model is likely to be correct. We have developed Random Forest Quality Assessment (RFQAmodel), which assesses whether models produced by a protein structure prediction pipeline have the correct fold. RFQAmodel uses a combination of existing quality assessment scores with two predicted contact map alignment scores. These alignment scores are able to identify correct models for targets that are not otherwise captured. Our classifier was trained on a large set of protein domains that are structurally diverse and evenly balanced in terms of protein features known to have an effect on modelling success, and then tested on a second set of 244 protein domains with a similar spread of properties. When models for each target in this second set were ranked according to the RFQAmodel score, the highest-ranking model had a high-confidence RFQAmodel score for 67 modelling targets, of which 52 had the correct fold. At the other end of the scale RFQAmodel correctly predicted that for 59 targets the highest-ranked model was incorrect. In comparisons to other methods we found that RFQAmodel is better able to identify correct models for targets where only a few of the models are correct. We found that RFQAmodel achieved a similar performance on the model sets for CASP12 and CASP13 free-modelling targets. Finally, by iteratively generating models and running RFQAmodel until a model is produced that is predicted to be correct with high confidence, we demonstrate how such a protocol can be used to focus computational efforts on difficult modelling targets.

In general, there are two ways for multi-task learning. One is to exploit the small set of labeled data from all tasks to learn a shared feature space for knowledge sharing. In this way, the focus is on the labeled training samples while the large amount of unlabeled data is not sufficiently considered. Another way has a focus on how to share model parameters among multiple tasks based on the original features space. Here, the question is whether it is possible to combine the advantages of both approaches and develop a method, which can simultaneously learn a shared subspace for multiple tasks and learn the prediction models in this subspace? To this end, in this paper, we propose a feature representation learning framework, which has the ability in combining the autoencoders, an effective way to learn good representation by using large amount of unlabeled data, and model parameter regularization methods into a unified model for multi-task learning. Specifically, all the tasks share the same encoding and decoding weights to find their latent feature representations, based on which a regularized multi-task softmax regression method is used to find a distinct prediction model for each task. Also, some commonalities are considered in the prediction models according to the relatedness of multiple tasks. There are several advantages of the proposed model: 1) it can make full use of large amount of unlabeled data from all the tasks to learn satisfying representations, 2) the learning of distinct prediction models can benefit from the success of autoencoder, 3) since we incorporate the labeled information into the softmax regression method, so the learning of feature representation is indeed in a semi-supervised manner. Therefore, our model is a semi-supervised autoencoder for multi-task learning (SAML for short). Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the feature representation obtained in this model can be used by other methods to obtain improved results.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2015.22", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2242427765", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13650160", "207178999", "14201947", "5356447", "2098528", "719551", "42639", "12833219", "785634", "15596531", "31164970", "819006", "16670462", "17804904", "16109063", "6418451", "7714800"], "inbound_citations": ["211146495", "203605942", "15048836", "57754744", "18529209", "28701384", "57753539", "210861529", "57756527", "5395708", "215439575", "4714673", "13660878", "20298363", "19770907", "28758189"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6493746"}

In an ecosystem undergoing rapid change, capturing the dynamics of vegetation requires the existing maps of vegetation (such as Alaska Existing Vegetation Type (AKEVT), circa 2000) to be updated based on frequent field based observation of vegetation. A method is needed to transfer the knowledge gained from field-collected observations to a larger area using DNNs.

The results show ~90% accuracy (using the field observations for evaluation) when transfer learning is applied to a siamese network, compared to ~45% accurate when a MLP is trained on the AKEVT and evaluated on the field observations.

It is a real challenge to traditional 3D modeling algorithms. Support vector machine (SVM) based on statistical learning theory has solid theoretical foundation. sphere-shaped SVM (SSSVM) was originally developed for solving some special classification problems. In this paper, it is extended to image 3D modeling which tries to find the smallest hypersphere enclosing target data in high dimensional space by kernel function.

Predictor variables for RF classifications consisted of ten spectral variables, four soil edaphic variables and three topographic variables. We provided a confidence score in terms of obtaining pure land cover at each pixel location by retrieving the classification tree votes. Classification accuracy assessments and predictor variable importance evaluations were conducted based on a repeated stratified sampling approach. Results show that patch stable areas obtained from larger patches are more appropriate to be used as sample data pools to train and validate RF classifiers for historical land cover mapping purposes and it is more reasonable to use patch stable areas as sample pools to map land cover in a year closer to the present rather than years further back in time. The percentage of obtained high confidence prediction pixels across the study area ranges from 71.18% in 1988 to 73.48% in 2013. The repeated stratified sampling approach is necessary in terms of reducing the positive bias in the estimated classification accuracy caused by the possible selections of training and validation pixels from the same patch stable areas.

These types of insect pests have a possibility of causing 100% product loss in wheat production. This insect type consists of members from Pentatomidea and Heterotoptera.

Wheat bugs prefer plantations not only for feeding but also for breeding. In the absence of control measures, wheat plantations can become overpopulated with sunn pest. Recently cultural control and biological control studies have gained attention. These control method groups are preferred over chemical control, because of healthcare reasons. Moreover, integrated control methods can be projected as the feature of the pest control, as precision agriculture applications spread. Today, beginning from the spring, plant protection experts watch for sunn pest awakening to try to avoid possible sunn pest attack. Additionally, chemical poisons are sprayed on plantations for protection reasons. These hazardous insecticides are known to be seriously damaging to human health, fauna and flora. Therefore, precision techniques for spotting these pests gained undeniable importance. Audio detection, recognition and classification methods have been used for decision making about creatures. To present day, these methods are used on insects, pests, birds, reptiles etc. successfully. In this work, a successful sound detection algorithm is applied to sound recordings of different sunn pest classes on an embedded system.

Thus, a data mining technique is applied for clustering elements configure the proposed supply chain using operational specifications related to each layer of the supply chain. The applicability of the proposed model is shown in a case study. Wang and Wang (8) suggested that cluster analysis could be used to cluster all suppliers and to establish a supplier evaluation index, to effectively manage suppliers. Bottani and Rizzi (9) pointed out that suppliers with similar characteristics could be clustered by using cluster analysis to reduce supplier combinations.

RNN perform back-propagation of error through time that permits learning patterns through an arbitrary depth in the time series. This means that even though we provide a time window of data as the input dimension to the RNN, it can match pattern through time that extends further than the provided current time window because it has recurrent connections.

We present a novel methodology combining Geographic Information Systems (GIS), solar models and a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, Random Forests, to estimate the potential for rooftop PV solar energy at the scale of a country. We use a hierarchical approach which divides the computation of the final potential into several steps. Each step is reached by estimating multiple variables of interest using widely available data, and combining these variables into potential values. The method for estimating each variable of interest is as follows: (1) collect all the data related to the variable, (2) train a Random Forest model based on the collected data and (3) use the model to predict the variables in unknown locations. The variables of interest include available area for PV installation on rooftops, shape, slope and direction of rooftops, global solar horizontal and tilted radiations, as well as shading factors over rooftops. The study focuses on Switzerland and provides the rooftop PV technical potential for each (200 \u00d7 200) [m2] pixel of a grid covering the entire country. The methodology, however, is generalizable to any region for which similar data is available and could therefore be useful for researchers, energy service companies, stockholders and municipalities to assess the rooftop PV capacity of the region.

To solve the problem that the EM image cannot be accurately segmented due to the complexity of the submicroscopic structure of nerve cells, and the loss and blurring of the boundary, an EM image segmentation method of nerve cells based on Conditional Random Field model is proposed. Firstly, the initial seed points of organelle and background to be segmented are automatically selected by superpixel clustering, and then the probability density distribution of target and background which selected as seed points is estimated by Gaussian Mixture Model. Then the energy function of superpixel features is established by using Conditional Random Field model. Finally, the automatic segmentation of nerve cell image is realized by minimizing the energy function. The effect of the automatically segmented nerve cell target and background is compared with that of the manually segmented images.

Unlike many previous learning tasks, we focus on how to use labeled data from one feature space to enhance the classification of other entirely different learning spaces. For example, we might wish to use labeled text data to help learn a model for classifying image data, when the labeled images are difficult to obtain. An important aspect of translated learning is to build a \"bridge\" to link one feature space (known as the \"source space\") to another space (known as the \"target space\") through a translator in order to migrate the knowledge from source to target. The translated learning solution uses a language model to link the class labels to the features in the source spaces, which in turn is translated to the features in the target spaces. Finally, this chain of linkages is completed by tracing back to the instances in the target spaces. We show that this path of linkage can be modeled using a Markov chain and risk minimization.

The Self-Growing and Self-Organized Neural Gas (SGONG) network is then used to cluster adaptively the extracted BRISK descriptors for generating visual words. The histogram of visual words is further calculated to form the appearance feature of the sign text. For eliminating the color differences and further highlighting the histogram similarity of all colors of signs, a color invariant histogram, called CIHS histogram, is presented to represent the color information of the sign text.

Since the emergence of AlexNet every winning submission of the ImageNet challenge has employed end-to-end representation learning, and due to the utility of good representations for transfer learning, representation learning has become as an important and distinct task from supervised learning. At present, this distinction is inconsequential, as supervised methods are state-of-the-art in learning transferable representations. But recent work has shown that generative models can also be powerful agents of representation learning. Will the representations learned from these generative methods ever rival the quality of those from their supervised competitors? In this work, we argue in the affirmative, that from an information theoretic perspective, generative models have greater potential for representation learning. Based on several experimentally validated assumptions, we show that supervised learning is upper bounded in its capacity for representation learning in ways that certain generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not.

The Fourier descriptor technique is used to extract the features of PLR waveform shapes of pupillograms and their amplitudes. To detect those patients affected by AMD using the extracted features, multidimensional scaling (MDS) and clustering techniques were used to emphasize stimuli and subject differences. The detection performance of AMD using the features and the MDS technique shows only a qualitative tendency, however. To evaluate the detection performance quantitatively, a set of combined features was created to evaluate characteristics of the PLR waveform shapes in detail. Classification performance was compared across three categories (AMD patients, aged, and healthy subjects) using the Random Forest method, and weighted values were optimized using variations of the classification error rates. The results show that the error rates for healthy pupils and AMD-affected pupils were low when the value of the coefficient for a combination of PLR amplitudes and features of waveforms was optimized as 1.5.

A complete and accurate catalog of every variant of each protein-coding gene (the transcriptome) allows biologists to understand how the organism's macro scale traits (phenotypes) are related to its genome sequence. Finding genes in whole genomes, however, is difficult. Eukaryotic genomes are huge sequences, consisting of hundreds of millions to billions of nucleotides. The fraction of this sequence that defines protein-coding genes is very small (for example \u223c25% in fly and only \u223c3% in human) and scattered throughout the genome in short (\u223c100-200 nucleotide) subsequences called exons. In the last 10 years great advances have been made in solving the computational problem of finding genes in whole genome sequence (Brent 2008). These methods make use evidence from the genome sequence itself as well as homology information from related genomes and direct evidence of transcription in the form of aligned cDNA sequences. ::: Recently two powerful new experimental methods for directly querying the transcriptome have come into widespread use, whole genome tiling arrays and \"next generation\" short read sequencing technologies. How best to make use of the data provided by these methods for finding protein-coding genes, however, is unclear. This dissertation explores one way of combining traditional computational gene finding algorithms with these new data sources to produce better predictions of gene structures.

For example, deep convolutional networks are becoming the default option for difficult tasks on large datasets, such as image and speech recognition.

This is achieved by training such networks using the \u2018Extreme Learning Machine\u2019 (ELM) approach, which also enables a very rapid training time (\u223c 10 minutes). Adding distortions, as is common practise for MNIST, reduces error rates even further. Our methods are also shown to be capable of achieving less than 5.5% error rates on the NORB image database. To achieve these results, we introduce several enhancements to the standard ELM algorithm, which individually and in combination can significantly improve performance. The main innovation is to ensure each hidden-unit operates only on a randomly sized and positioned patch of each image. This form of random \u2018receptive field\u2019 sampling of the input ensures the input weight matrix is sparse, with about 90% of weights equal to zero.

The research, which began in 2011, was completed over a two-year period. The students and activities in Component Design, an existing junior-level course at the University of Colorado at Boulder served as the research focus.

First, samples are mapped to a high-dimensional space of points to construct an adjacency matrix, and we can obtain eigenvectors describing the feature of the samples by decomposing the matrix. Finally, use eigenvectors as inputs of the SVM (Support Vector Machine) and KNN (K nearest neighbor) classifiers to classify gene expression profile.

We propose an new approximation approach to SP-HO-CRFs that resolves these problems. Our approach is a multi-layer CRF framework that inherits the simplicity from pairwise CRFs by formulating both the higher-order and pairwise cues into the same pairwise potentials in the first layer. Essentially, this approach provides accuracy enhancement on the basis of pairwise CRFs without training by reusing their pre-trained parameters and/or weights. The proposed multi-layer approach performs especially well in delineating the boundary details (boarders) of object categories such as \"trees\" and \"bushes\".

Often, T IR resolution is not suitable for monitoring crop conditions of individual fields or the impacts of land cover changes that are at significantly finer spatial scales. Consequently, thermal sharpening techniques have been developed to sharpen T IR imagery to shortwave band pixel resolutions. One of the most classic thermal sharpening technique is T sHARP . It uses a relationship between land surface temperature and normalized vegetation index (N DV I). However, there are several studies that prove that a single relationship between T IR and N DV I may only exist for a limited class of landscape. Our work hypothesis stated that it is possible to improve the spatial resolution of T IR imagery considering a relationship between vegetation and several soil spectral indexes and T IR as well the spatial context information. In this work, the potential of Superpixels (SP ) combined with Regression Random Forest (RRF ) is used to augmenting the spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 T IR (Band 10 and 11) imagery to their visible (V IS) spatial resolution. The SP allows to consider the contextual information over the land cover, and RF allows to integrate in a unique model the relationship between five spectral indices and T IR data.

Owing to its powerful capacity in solving nonlinearity problems, support vector machine (SVM) method has been widely used as a classification tool. Traditional SVMs, however, assume that each feature of a sample contributes equally to classification accuracy, which is not necessarily true in real applications. In addition, the parameters of SVM and the kernel function also affect classification accuracy. In this study, immune feature weighted SVM (IFWSVM) method was proposed. Immune algorithm (IA) was then introduced in searching for the optimal feature weights and the parameters simultaneously. IFWSVM was used to multiclassify five different mental tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results showed that IFWSVM has better performance than traditional SVM.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMAG.2010.2072775", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Magnetics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Magnetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2101751541", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["8728123", "32095475", "9076563", "38852082", "7158603", "6455208", "12262284", "14251558", "194951", "7665376", "13346274", "35670355"], "inbound_citations": ["24818197", "39368567", "6682153", "140219376", "13902491", "10478850", "42465373", "16057935", "14873739", "16169452", "127099713", "204815984", "346241", "215404932", "17786360", "18603494", "124450365", "17914943", "9838460", "9636986", "122746974", "14718059", "10506026", "16520360"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9555444"}

The two-degrees-of-freedom control scheme is intended to better allocate control actions throughout the power unit startup. The feed forward control path implements a neurofuzzy system that approximates the plant inverse static behavior and generates a control action to support wide-range operation. The feedback control path implements a neurofuzzy PI controller that compensates for uncertainties and small deviations about the intended acceleration pattern. Both control paths complement each other. Feedforward lessens the control effort on the feedback control, and feedback compensates for the transient dynamics not considered by feedforward control.

It must be different from the exact solution if some situations are ignored or not considered in scheduling problem such as changing processing time, uncertain capability of storage, possibility of human decision, unpredicted accident and so on. Inchoate research on FJSP (Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem) concentrated on the simple application of integer programming and simulation, which can hardly be used to solve the complex scheduling problem. With the development of related fields and theory of optimization, a great many methods and techniques have been adopted into JSP. Operational research predigests the JSP into a mathematical programming model, using branch-and-bound method and dynamic programming algorithm to realize optimization or approximate optimization. However, OR only suits to simple scheduling problem (Philips et al., 1987). Based on theory of control, Gershwin and his fellows expatiate comprehensively the adoption of theory of control in manufacturing system. Limited to the capability of modeling, a lot of predigestion to the environment is a must; the practice to get the optimum solution expands with a exponential characteristic (Juanqi, 1998).

It can smooth the disadvantages of mathematical programming and simulation. Based on the system status and deterministic objective of optimization, effective heuristic research and concurrent fuzzy reasoning are conducted to choose the optimum solution and support online decision.

Technically, we first map the known part of the affine nonlinear systems into high dimensional feature spaces and derive the form of approximate solution. Then the original problem is formulated as an approximation problem via kernel trick with LS-SVMs. Furthermore, the approximation of the known part can be expressed via some linear equations with coefficient matrices as coupling square matrices, and the unknown part can be identified by its relationship to the known part and the approximate solution of affine nonlinear systems.

In particular, human learners are capable of learning both from feedback on their performance at a task and also from direct verbal instruction, provided by a knowledgeable teacher. These two sources of knowledge, induction over experiences and the reception of instructions, can interact to solve complex learning problems. ::: This research presents a general computational model of such instructed learning--of learning involving the integration of induction and instruction. This model is wholly connectionist in nature, being composed of a modular artificial neural network. Thus, the model extends standard connectionist learning beyond induction to incorporate explicit advice taking. A central feature of this model is the representation of explicit instructed knowledge in the dynamic activation space of a recurrent attractor network, while inductively acquired knowledge is encoded in the usual way, in the weight space of network connections. This allows for the rapid modification of behavior in response to instructions while still maintaining the process of slow learning from experience. Also, in the context of examining this model, several insights into the limitations of connectionist attractor networks arise and are investigated in detail. ::: The model is validated against human experimental data involving an established interference effect in instructed category learning. When provided with an explicit rule for categorizing visual stimulus items, followed by practice at applying the rule on a particular collection of labeled examples, human learners will sometimes come to violate the given rule as a result of the practice session, even if the practice items are labeled in a manner perfectly consistent with the given rule. For some stimuli, the similarity of the item to previously viewed practice items comes to dominate over instruction following, causing a decrease in rule following accuracy. The proposed model is shown to exhibit this interference effect, and results from new instructed category learning experiments with human learners are reported.

Consider for example that a customer is searching for flights from London to New York, traveling next week on Tuesday and coming back on Saturday. This search request is then processed by a travel provider (e.g., an online travel agent) that proposes between 50 and 100 different alternatives (itineraries) to the customer. The itineraries have different attributes, among others: number of stops, total trip duration, and price. The question is: \u201cwhich one is (probably) going to be selected by the customer?\u201d There is a growing interest within the travel industry in better understanding how customers choose between different itineraries when searching for flights. Such an understanding can help travel providers, either airlines or travel agents, to better adapt their offer to market conditions and customer needs, thus increasing their revenue. This can be used for filtering alternatives, sorting them or even for changing some attributes in real-time (e.g., change the price). The field of customer choice modelling is dominated by traditional statistical approaches, such as the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, that are linear with respect to features and are tightly bound to their assumptions about the distribution of error (Gaussian, Gumbel, etc.). While these models offer the dual advantages of simplicity and readability, they lack flexibility to handle correlations between alternatives or non-linearity in the effect of alternative attributes. A large part of the existing modelling work focuses in adapting these modelled distributions, so that they can match observed behaviour. Nested (NL) and Cross-Nested (CNL) Logit models are good examples of this: they add terms for highly specific feature interactions, so that substitution patterns between sub-groups of alternatives can be captured. In this work, we present an alternative modelling approach based on machine learning techniques. The selected machine learning methods do not require any assumption about the distribution of errors, they can also create non-linear relationships between feature values and the target class, include collinear features, and have more modelling flexibility in general. In particular, we have chosen to work with Random Forests. Random Forests are ensembles of decision trees which aggregate their predictions. A decision tree is a tree of nodes, each of which applies a linear threshold to a single variable. Each decision tree in a random forest receives a random subset of the input features, and then generates a tree deterministically from those features. In fact, Random Forests are well adapted for our problem as model bifurcations (branches) automatically partition the customers into segments and, at the same time, it captures nonlinearities relationships within attributes of alternatives and characteristics of the decision maker. Indeed, there are two main segments to be taken into account for our particular problem: business and leisure air passengers behave very different when it comes to book flights. Business passenger tends to favour alternatives with convenient schedules like shorter connection times and time preferences, while leisure passengers are very price sensitive, in other words they can accept a longer connection time if this is reflected in a lower price of the tickets. The problem is that the \u201csegment\u201d is not explicitly known when the customer is searching, however it could be derived by combining different factors. For example, industry experts know that business passengers have a tendency to book with less anticipation and are not predisposed to stay on Saturdays nights. In spite of this, these are not \u201cblack or white\u201d rules, so this reinforce the need for a model able to detect these rules depending on the data and actual customer behaviour. Another observed advantage is that Random Forests are also fairly quick to train and very quick to predict, which enables fast iteration. As a matter of fact, our numerical experiments show that Machine Learning methods were faster than MNL for the learning process, both using public libraries with default parameters. We trained and tested our models on a dataset consisting of flight searches and bookings on six European markets, extracted from GDS (global distribution system) logs. The choice set consists of the results of a flight search request. Each search request includes between 10 and 250 different itineraries, one of which has been booked by the customer. Choice sets are regrouped by Origin and Destination market. Our main experiments consist in comparing MNL vs Machine Learning. We evaluate the performance of the different models by comparing their prediction of fractional shares of choices against the actual distribution of choices. It should be noted that in our data set the alternatives are not fixed from one shopping session (choice situation) to the next, we compare the predicted and actual market share of groups of alternatives, such as flight numbers, flights from one airline, or flights departing during a specific time window. These KPIs are particularly useful, as they are often the final result expected from the model. Our general finding is that, on most origin and destination markets, machine learning models outperform MNL on all relevant metrics. In particular, we found a reduction in the error of airline prediction of more than 70% on four of the six markets we considered. We also find that training a model on several markets at once results in similar performance \u2013 something which could greatly help in scaling the models to a large amount of markets. The main conclusion of our work is thus that non-linear machine learning methods such as the ones we present here can provide clear benefits to some choice modelling applications, such as air travel itinerary choice by passengers, notably thanks to the better handling of non-linearity, overall greater flexibility they provide, and fast learning computation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jocm.2018.02.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of choice modelling", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2616943032", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "7955044", "153296073", "16190154", "117457799", "1804750", "63838119", "157518570"], "inbound_citations": ["204960740", "1275471", "202750348", "56895562", "211258921", "53218720", "182952304", "59843097", "52912157"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55585316"}

In this condition, we propose an image rain removal algorithm based on the depth of field and sparse coding. The algorithm includes four steps: image decomposition, dictionary learning, atomic clustering based on Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Machine, image revising based on the depth of field saliency map. Firstly, the image is decomposed by using the combination of bilateral filtering and short-time Fourier transform, so that the contour in the low-frequency part of the image can be better preserved. The depth of field saliency map of the image is utilized to eliminate the rain residues in the low frequency components, and also to solve the problem of mis-matching the background and the rain streaks with the same gradient in the high frequency components.

In bio-medical field, many researches in GP are focused on the recognition of cancerous cells and also on gene expression profiling data. In this research, the aim is to study the performance of GP on the survival prediction of a small sample size of oral cancer prognosis dataset, which is the first study in the field of oral cancer prognosis. ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: GP is applied on an oral cancer dataset that contains 31 cases collected from the Malaysia Oral Cancer Database and Tissue Bank System (MOCDTBS). The feature subsets that is automatically selected through GP were noted and the influences of this subset on the results of GP were recorded. In addition, a comparison between the GP performance and that of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) are also done in order to verify the predictive capabilities of the GP. ::: ::: ::: RESULT ::: The result shows that GP performed the best (average accuracy of 83.87% and average AUROC of 0.8341) when the features selected are smoking, drinking, chewing, histological differentiation of SCC, and oncogene p63. In addition, based on the comparison results, we found that the GP outperformed the SVM and LR in oral cancer prognosis. ::: ::: ::: DISCUSSION ::: Some of the features in the dataset are found to be statistically co-related. This is because the accuracy of the GP prediction drops when one of the feature in the best feature subset is excluded. Thus, GP provides an automatic feature selection function, which chooses features that are highly correlated to the prognosis of oral cancer. This makes GP an ideal prediction model for cancer clinical and genomic data that can be used to aid physicians in their decision making stage of diagnosis or prognosis.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5036111", "pubmed_id": "27688975", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.2482", "venue": "PeerJ", "journal": "PeerJ", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2522022887", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["2622598", "41834393", "6719315", "39440887", "23777212", "9250341", "11325052", "2073035", "22032940", "3002923", "72126982", "44695250", "1352566", "152172881", "614806"], "inbound_citations": ["192637660", "195814371", "54209054", "53287795"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1506999"}

Intuitively, an introspective classification framework\u2014i.e. one which moderates its predictions by an estimate of how well it is placed to make a call in a particular situation\u2014is particularly well suited to this task.

In order to evaluate the possibility of emotion recognition using a non-contact system for vital signs monitoring, we herein present a continuous wave radar based on the respiratory signal acquisition. An experimental set up was designed to acquire the respiratory signal while participants were watching videos that elicited different emotions (fear, happiness and a neutral condition).

The experiment was conducted to validate the system at two levels: the signal acquisition and the emotion recognition levels. Vital sign was analysed and the three emotions were identified using different classification algorithms. Furthermore, the classifier performance was compared, having in mind the signal acquired by both systems. Three different classification algorithms were used: the support-vector machine, K-nearest neighbour and the Random Forest.

Newfoundland is among the richest Canadian province in terms of different wetland classes. Herbaceous wetlands cover extensive areas of the Avalon Peninsula, which are the habitat of a number of animal and plant species. In this study, a novel hierarchical object-based Random Forest (RF) classification approach is proposed for discriminating between different wetland classes in a sub-region located in the north eastern portion of the Avalon Peninsula. Particularly, multi-polarization and multi-frequency SAR data, including X-band TerraSAR-X single polarized (HH), L-band ALOS-2 dual polarized (HH/HV), and C-band RADARSAT-2 fully polarized images, were applied in different classification levels. First, a SAR backscatter analysis of different land cover types was performed by training data and used in Level-I classification to separate water from non-water classes. This was followed by Level-II classification, wherein the water class was further divided into shallow- and deep-water classes, and the non-water class was partitioned into herbaceous and non-herbaceous classes. In Level-III classification, the herbaceous class was further divided into bog, fen, and marsh classes, while the non-herbaceous class was subsequently partitioned into urban, upland, and swamp classes. In Level-II and -III classifications, different polarimetric decomposition approaches, including Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi decompositions, and Kennaugh matrix elements were extracted to aid the RF classifier. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were determined in each classification level for evaluating the classification results. The importance of input features was also determined using the variable importance obtained by RF. It was found that the Kennaugh matrix elements, Yamaguchi, and Freeman-Durden decompositions were the most important parameters for wetland classification in this study.

The transmission takes place between a vehicle and a RoadSide Unit (RSU) at a given distance and with a given transmission rate. The RSU computes the statistics of the receptions and is able to compute the percentage of successful transmissions versus the distance between the vehicle and the RSU and the transmission rate. Starting from this statistic, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) scheme can produce a model. Then, given a transmission rate and a distance between the vehicle and the RSU, the SVM technique can estimate the probability of a succcessful reception. This probability can be used to build an adaptive technique which optimizes the expected throughput between the vehicle and the RSU. Instead of using transmission values of a real experiment, we use the results of an analytical model of CSMA that is customized for 1D VANETs. The model we adopt to perform this task uses a Matern selection process to mimic the transmission in a CSMA IEEE 802.11p VANET. With this model we obtain a closed formula for the probability of successful transmissions.

Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) has emerged as one of the principled method of addressing missing data. This paper provides comparison of MICE using various methods to deal with missing values. The chained equations approach is very flexible and can handle various types of data such as continuous or binary as well as various missing data patterns. Objectives: To discuss commonly used techniques for handling missing data and common issues that could arise when these techniques are used. In particular, we will focus on different approaches of one of the most popular methods, Multiple Imputation using Chained Equations (MICE). Methods/Statistical Analysis: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation is a statistical method for addressing missing value imputation. The paper will focus on Multiple Imputation using Predictive Mean Matching, Multiple Random Forest Regression Imputation, Multiple Bayesian Regression Imputation, Multiple Linear Regression using Non-Bayesian Imputation, Multiple Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Multiple Linear Regression with Bootstrap Imputation which provides a general framework for analyzing data with missing values. Findings: We have chosen to explore Multiple Imputation using MICE through an examination of sample data set. Our analysis confirms that the power of Multiple Imputations lies in getting smaller standard errors and narrower confidence intervals. The smaller is the standard error and narrower is the confidence interval; the predicted value is more accurate, thus, minimizing the bias and inefficiency considerably. In our results from sample data set, it has been observed that standard error and mean confidence interval length is the least in case of Multiple Imputation combined with Bayesian Regression. Also, it is obvious from the density plot that the imputed values are more close to the observed values in this method than other methods. Even in case of random forest, the results are quite close to Bayesian Regression.

Characterization of the global changes in low-molecular weight compounds which constitute the 'metabolic network' of cells (metabolome) is now possible by using a 'metabolomics' approach. Metabolomic profiling has special advantages over transcriptomics and proteomics since the metabolic network is downstream from gene expression and protein synthesis, and thus more closely reflects cell activity at a functional level. This study was conducted to determine if metabolomic profiling of the amniotic fluid can identify women with spontaneous PTL at risk for preterm delivery, regardless of the presence or absence of intraamniotic infection/inflammation (IAI). ::: ::: ::: STUDY DESIGN ::: Two retrospective cross-sectional studies were conducted, including three groups of pregnant women with spontaneous PTL and intact membranes: (1) PTL who delivered at term; (2) PTL without IAI who delivered preterm; and (3) PTL with IAI who delivered preterm. The first was an exploratory study that included 16, 19, and 20 patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The second study included 40, 33, and 40 patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

In this paper, a hybrid deep architecture named Long-term Recurrent Convolutional LSTM Network (LR-ConvLSTM) is proposed. The model is composed of Convolutional LSTM layers to extract features inside a high-level state, and extra LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies between high-level states. We evaluate our model on the Opportunity dataset that has once been used in public activity recognition challenge. The results show that the proposed model has a good performance both in time series classification and prediction tasks.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIGCOM.2017.13", "venue": "2017 3rd International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications (BIGCOM)", "journal": "2017 3rd International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications (BIGCOM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2769504394", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10042024", "14862572", "15641618", "206741496", "3356463", "12008458", "43680425", "214890197", "16130453", "898670", "206592152", "7118498"], "inbound_citations": ["133152466", "210907711", "201068732", "199058227", "146082476"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12698057"}

This usually happens by breaking the target data into small chunks and encoding them into DNS queries. The malicious DNS queries are then communicated from the target to the attacker machine. These DNS queries will finally be decoded and put together at the attacker side to recover the breached data. Since DNS is a fundamental service, it cannot be blocked in order to mitigate these DNS tunneling attacks. Conventional signature-based intrusion detection systems are not very effective to detect these anomalies, either. Using some of the available DNS tunneling tools we first show how this phenomenon can occur.

Various change detection algorithms have been proposed, each employing different techniques to characterise abrupt disturbance events and longer term trends. However, results can vary significantly, depending on the algorithm, parameters and the spectral index (or indices) chosen. This mismatch in results has led to researchers hypothesizing that an ensemble based approach may increase accuracy. In this study we assess two change detection algorithms (LandTrendr and the R package strucchange), each with three indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI, the Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR, and Tasseled Cap Wetness or TCW). We test their ability to detect abrupt disturbances in sclerophyll forests over a 29 year time period, and subsequently evaluate a number of ensembles, using simple fusion rules and Random Forests models. A total of 4087 manually interpreted reference pixels, sampled from 9 million ha of forest, were used for training and validation. In addition, we assess the effects of priming the Random Forests classifier with confusing cases (commission errors from the time series algorithms). Our results clearly show that ensembles combining multiple change detection techniques out-perform any one method. Our most accurate Random Forests model, using an ensemble of all 6 algorithm outputs, along with 3 bi-temporal change rasters (change in NBR, NDVI and TCW), had an overall error rate of 7%, compared with the most accurate single algorithm/index approach (LandTrendr with NBR), which had an overall error of 21%. Our findings also indicate that acceptable results (14% error) can be achieved without the use of traditional change detection algorithms, by using robust reference data and Random Forests classification. However, by priming the classifier with confusing cases informed by the change detection algorithms, commission errors decreased substantially, at the expense of slight increases in omission errors. In fact, a Random Forests ensemble, using the primed training data and only 3 bi-temporal change rasters, was more accurate than any one individual algorithm, with an overall error of 11%. By including some additional metrics derived from Landsat time series (e.g. 2 year changes and overall means) this error was further reduced to 8%. Given that most change detection algorithms have large processing requirements, this suggests that algorithms can be applied to a sample of pixels only, for the sole purpose of training a machine learning classifier.

We show that our proposed model can also be viewed as a robust version of manifold regularized robust PCA, where the quality of the graph plays a critical role. The proposed model is able to boost the performance of data clustering, semisupervised classification, and data recovery significantly, primarily due to two key factors: 1) enhanced low-rank recovery by exploiting the graph smoothness assumption, 2) improved graph construction by exploiting clean data recovered by robust PCA. Thus, it boosts the clustering, semi-supervised classification, and data recovery performance overall.

The behaviour of diagnostic models could be sensitive with regard to the amount of features, and significant features can represent the problem better than the entire set. Consequently, algorithms to identify these features are valuable contributions. This work deals with the feature selection problem through attribute clustering. The proposed algorithm is inspired by existing approaches, where the relative dependency between attributes is used to calculate dissimilarity values. The centroids of the created clusters are selected as representative attributes. The selection algorithm uses a random process for proposing centroid candidates, in this way, the inherent exploration in random search is included. A hierarchical procedure is proposed for implementing this algorithm. In each level of the hierarchy, the entire set of available attributes is split in disjoint sets and the selection process is applied on each subset. Once the significant attributes are proposed for each subset, a new set of available attributes is created and the selection process runs again in the next level. The hierarchical implementation aims to refine the search space in each level on a reduced set of selected attributes, while the computational time-consumption is improved also.

The increase in email traffic comes also with an increase in the use of emails for illegitimate purposes to commit all sort of crimes. Phishing, spamming, email bombing, threatening, cyber bullying, racial vilification, child pornography, viruses and malware propagation, and sexual harassments are common examples of email abuses. Terrorist groups and criminal gangs are also using email systems as a safe channel for their communication. The alarming increase in the number of cybercrime incidents using email is mostly due to the fact that email can be easily anonymized. The problem of email authorship attribution is to identify the most plausible author of an anonymous email from a group of potential suspects. Most previous contributions employed a traditional classification approach, such as decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify the author and studied the effects of different writing style features on the classification accuracy. However, little attention has been given on ensuring the quality of the evidence. In this work, we introduce an innovative data mining method to capture the write-print of every suspect and model it as combinations of features that occur frequently in the suspect's emails. This notion is called frequent pattern, which has proven to be effective in many data mining applications, but has not been applied to the problem of authorship attribution. Unlike traditional approaches, the extracted write-print by our method is unique among the suspects and, therefore, provides convincing and credible evidence for presenting it in a court of law.

Related work: Quite a few studies [3, 4, 6] have been proposed to model inter-camera dependency across non-overlapping camera views. Learning time-delayed correlations among disjoint cameras in crowded public scenarios is a non-trivial task: (1) the time gaps between camera views are unknown therefore activities in two related views may occur at arbitrary time delays with high uncertainty; (2) the features are inevitably noisy, ambiguous, and may vary drastically across views owning to illumination condition, camera angles, and changes in object pose. Most state-ofthe-art methods typically hand pick a few features tailored to the target environment, with the hope that those chosen features contain robust and sufficient statistics for correlating the time-delayed activity patterns across disjoint views. These manual approaches to hard selection of features are neither principled nor generalisable to different scene context. Our solution: In this study, we wish to examine the concept that visual features should be coded and selected automatically for robust and accurate time-delayed dependency learning. The contributions of this study are two-fold: (1) We present a systematic study and evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of supervised and unsupervised feature coding methods to facilitate the learning of inter-camera activity pattern dependencies. (2) We systematically evaluate the sensitivity of inter-camera time delayed dependency learning given different training video sizes and region decomposition qualities. These factors are critical for accurate dependency learning but have been largely ignored by the published existing work in the literature. Approach overview: We employ the Random Forest [2] as the supervised feature coding approach. In particular, given a set of localised features extracted from a region, together with people count training label over time, we first train a regression forest to learn the non-linear mapping between the crowd density and the corresponding low-level features. Given unseen data, we then construct a time series based on the predicted crowd density \u0177 obtained from the regression forest (RF pred), the treestructured code (tree code) [5], or the combination of the two. As for unsupervised coding scheme, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [1] to map the low-level features into codewords that capture the topic distribution, whereby an image region patch (document) d is treated as a collection of j = 1 . . .Ni features (words). To form the unsupervised feature codes, given a sequence of localised feature vectors detected from a region, we first perform quantisation on each feature to generate a bag-of-word representation for all image patches. Similar to text documents, these bag-of-word represented image patches are fed into the LDA, which gives us a topic-based representation. Once having the topic-based code (topic code), we perform k-means quantisation on them, producing the final compact topic-based code, and concatenate them over time to form a time series. To solve the problem of using the feature codes for learning intercamera dependencies, we adopt the Time Delayed Mutual Information (TDMI) proposed in [3] due to its reported effectiveness and simplicity. The input to TDMI are time series generated from either the supervised or the unsupervised coding scheme. In addition to measuring deviation error in transition time, we propose a new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of different coding methods, called Mutual Information Margin (MIM):", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5244/C.26.94", "venue": "BMVC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1974722997", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16335589", "205499985", "3177797", "89141", "9059102", "2623493", "17606900", "121598", "14449726", "1138597", "2054652", "11117513", "211123177", "18018217", "14915716", "6387937", "11529166", "10872115", "262002", "10886660", "604536", "13120829", "8443684", "11904287", "14100761", "9952140", "9342979", "14457153", "16631931", "14290733", "4243635", "62091811", "4231589"], "inbound_citations": ["37791199", "27982911", "14034098", "2185196"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8918550"}

However, on-site nondestructive safety inspection of steel reinforcement wires inside poles is very difficult. In this study, we developed an application that classifies the magnetic field signals of multiple channels, as measured from the actual poles. Initially, the signal data were gathered by inserting sensors into the poles, and these data were then used to learn the patterns of safe and damaged features. These features were then processed with the isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) dimensionality reduction algorithm. Subsequently, the resulting reduced data were processed with a random forest classification algorithm. The proposed method could elucidate whether the internal wires of the poles were broken or not according to actual sensor data.

One popular decoding implementation is to use a CTC model to predict the phone posteriors at each frame and then perform Viterbi beam search on a modified WFST network.

In this paper, the peaky posterior property of CTC is carefully investigated and it is found that ignoring blank frames will not introduce additional search errors. Based on this phenomenon, a novel phone synchronous decoding framework is proposed by removing tremendous search redundancy due to blank frames, which results in significant search speed up. The framework naturally leads to an extremely compact phone-level acoustic space representation: CTC lattice. With CTC lattice, efficient and effective modular speech recognition approaches, second pass rescoring for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition LVCSR, and phone-based keyword spotting KWS, are also proposed in this paper. Experiments showed that phone synchronous decoding can achieve 3-4 times search speed up without performance degradation compared to frame synchronous decoding.

Just as importantly, the stringent specificity required of diagnostic tests for these low prevalence diseases creates unique challenges. A diagnostic test which identified these rare diseases early in a significant number of patients without creating a large number of false positive results would be clinically important and would deliver health-economic benefits. However, there is great difficulty in precisely quantifying such signals for large numbers of low abundance proteins. Our group therefore created a highly multiplexed proteomic assay which is continuously expanding in breadth. It currently measures 825 proteins simultaneously from ~15ul blood, with throughput of 300 samples/day. The average dynamic range of each protein in the assay is >3 logs \u2014 with nearly seven logs of dynamic range achieved through multiple dilutions \u2014 and the median lower limit of quantification is below 1 pM. The median coefficient of variation for each protein is Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the USA. While the 5-year survival is only 5%, this has shown to be increased by early surgical intervention. Plasma samples were analyzed in a prospectively designed case:control study from 143 cases of pancreatic cancer and 116 controls of a similar age and gender distribution. 25% of each group was retained as a blinded verification set. In the training set, 47 markers were significantly different at a false-discovery-rate corrected value of p Other decision thresholds relevant to symptomatic patients enable a sensitivity-driven approach of 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity. The results of this test using the high specificity decision threshold will deliver a positive predictive value of greater than 10% in a population with a disease prevalence of 0.4% or more. Additionally, when the test is used in symptomatic subjects as a differential diagnostic, non-invasive, rapid and sensitive detection of pancreatic cancer enables swift clinical decisions for treatment of this aggressive disease. The second rare cancer analyzed in this clinical series was malignant pleural mesothelioma, which is an aggressive, asbestos-related pulmonary cancer. This disease causes an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 deaths per year worldwide. Between 1940 and 1979, approximately 27.5 million people were occupationally exposed to asbestos in the United States. The incidence of pleural mesothelioma in the US is 3,000 new cases/year and will not peak for another 20 years. Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20-40 years from asbestos exposure, but once diagnosed this aggressive disease is often fatal within 14 months. Because diagnosis is difficult, most patients present at a clinically advanced stage where possibility of cure is minimal. Therefore, we have conducted a broad search for new serum biomarkers with our aptamer-based proteomic platform and defined a classifier for the detection of mesothelioma in asbestos exposed individuals. Serum samples were analyzed with the aptamer proteomics platform in a prospectively designed case:control study of 357 serum samples obtained from patients diagnosed with mesothelioma or lung cancer compared to asbestos exposed controls, high risk smokers and benign lung disease. These samples were divided into a training and test set for classifier development and verification. The objective of the study was to discover proteins which are involved in mesothelioma and to develop algorithms and classifiers for the disease. The initial results are promising. Nineteen significant biomarkers were discovered. Classifiers were built with subsets of these biomarkers resulting in an AUC of 0.95 or better with an overall accuracy of 93%. Applying a 13-plex Random Forest classifier to the blinded test set resulted in a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 80% for distinction of asbestos exposed controls from mesothelioma.

This dissertation aims to provide a system of network security monitoring and analysis based on the Big Data technologies. ::: First, I present an extensive survey of the network flow applications that covers past research perspectives, methodologies, and a discussion of challenges and future works. Then, I present system design of the network security monitoring and analysis platform based on the Big Data technologies. Components of this system include Flume and Kafka for real time distributed data collection, Storm for real time streaming distributed data processing, Cassandra for NoSQL data storage, data processing, and user interfaces. The system supports real time continuous network monitoring, interactive visualization, network measurement, and advanced network modeling to classify host roles based on host behaviors and to identify a particular user among the other users. ::: It is critical to continuously monitor the network status and network security threats in real time, but it is a challenge to process these large amount of data in real time. I demonstrate how the Big Data security system designed in this dissertation supports such features. For instance, querying a network host 24 hours network traffic took 56 milliseconds round-trip. Another usage of the network flow data is to measure the contents and usage of the network. I demonstrate how this Big Data system provides understanding of the usage of anonymity technologies on the campus Internet.

The fundamental description of a connectionist network lies at a level between the processing level and the physiological level. At this level, connectionism involves a characteristic departure from modularity, and a correlative absence of syntactic structure.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that solves target hitting problems, by iteratively approximating capture basins at successive costs. We show that, by a simple change of variables, minimising a cost may be reduced to the problem of time minimisation, and hence a recursive backward procedure can be set. Two variants of the algorithm are derived, one providing an approximation from inside (the approximation is included in the actual capture basin) and one providing a outer approximation, which allows one to assess the approximation error. We use a machine learning algorithm (as a particular case, we consider Support Vector Machines) trained on points of a grid with boolean labels, and we state the conditions on the machine learning procedure that guarantee the convergence of the approximations towards the actual capture basin when the resolution of the grid decreases to 0. Moreover, we define a control procedure which uses the set of capture basin approximations to drive a point into the target. When using the inner approximation, the procedure guarantees to hit the target, and when the resolution of the grid tends to 0, the controller tends to the optimal one (minimizing the cost to hit the target).

In this study, we recorded neural spike activities in monkey brain using microelectrode arrays implanted directly on the surface of the inferior temporal cortex, a brain area crucial for visual object recognition.

This paper has shown that leveraging multi-view information is able to provide a rich and comprehensive description. One of the core problems is how to sufficiently represent multi-view data in the analysis. In this paper, we introduce a tensor-based representation learning method for multi-view clustering (tRLMvC) that can unify heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-view feature spaces to a low-dimensional shared latent feature space and improve multi-view clustering performance. To sufficiently capture plenty multi-view information, the tRLMvC represents multi-view data as a third-order tensor, expresses each tensorial data point as a sparse $t$ -linear combination of all data points with $t$ -product, and constructs a self-expressive tensor through reconstruction coefficients. The low-dimensional multi-view data representation in the shared latent feature space can be obtained via Tucker decomposition on the self-expressive tensor. These two parts are iteratively performed so that the interaction between self-expressive tensor learning and its factorization can be enhanced and the new representation can be effectively generated for clustering purpose. We conduct extensive experiments on eight multi-view data sets and compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art methods.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and style control mechanisms, such as Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), have proved particularly effective in this context, culminating in the state-of-the-art StyleGAN architecture. While such models are able to learn diverse distributions, provided a sufficiently large training set, they are not well-suited for scenarios where the distribution of the training data exhibits a multi-modal behavior. In such cases, reshaping a uniform or normal distribution over the latent space into a complex multi-modal distribution in the data domain is challenging, and the quality of the generated samples may suffer as a result. Furthermore, the different modes are entangled with the other attributes of the data, and thus, mode transitions cannot be well controlled via continuous style parameters. In this paper, we introduce uMM-GAN, a novel architecture designed to better model such multi-modal distributions, in an unsupervised fashion. Building upon the StyleGAN architecture, our network learns multiple modes, in a completely unsupervised manner, and combines them using a set of learned weights. Quite strikingly, we show that this approach is capable of homing onto the natural modes in the training set, and effectively approximates the complex distribution as a superposition of multiple simple ones. We demonstrate that uMM-GAN copes better with multi-modal distributions, while at the same time disentangling between the modes and their style, thereby providing an independent degree of control over the generated content.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.03640", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2999820041", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52133351", "52889459", "1327363", "1033682", "24527328", "326772", "6576859", "3568073", "211022860", "46933230", "49657329", "51904575", "211005773", "12803511", "52188737", "1099052", "208077053", "11758569"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210165057"}

Some of these approaches use the user's knowledge to guide the exploration according to what is defined (thought) as interesting by the user. However, this definition is done before the process starts. Therefore, the user must know what may be and what may not be interesting to him/her. This work proposes a general association rule post-processing approach that extracts the user's knowledge during the post-processing phase. That way, the user does not need to have a prior knowledge in the database. For that, the proposed approach models the association rules in a network, uses its measures to suggest rules to be classified by the user and, then, propagates these classifications to the entire network using transductive learning algorithms. Therefore, this approach treats the post-processing problem as a classification task.

Our initial schedule was to publish the special issue on ELM and applications with about 15 articles and to report the recent development of ELM theory and applications as well as the challenges in designing, analysing and implementing the algorithms and systems. However, after rigorously reviewing all of received papers on the basis of innovativeness and relevance for all NCA readers, we realized that many of them were high quality and finally selected 30 top papers. After getting the permission from Editor-inChief, Professor John MacIntyre, we are very happy to present these selected top papers in two special issues. The following is the brief introduction of 15 articles in the special issue: Extreme Learning Machine and Applications (II). In \u2018\u2018Fault detection and diagnosis method for batch process based on ELM-based fault feature phase identification\u2019\u2019, the authors propose a fault detection and diagnosis algorithm for batch processes with ELM methodology. In this work, ELM is first utilized to identify the feature phases for each fault, and the whole batch is divided into a few \u2018\u2018short stages\u2019\u2019. The multiway Fisher discriminant analysis (MFDA) models are then built for these divided \u2018\u2018short stages\u2019\u2019 to perform fault detection and diagnosis for a batch process. The simulation results have shown the excellent performance of the algorithm for the fault detection in a hydrostatic testing process. In \u2018\u2018Multiplekernel-learning-based extreme learning machine for classification design\u2019\u2019, the authors develop two multiple kernel classifiers. The first one is based on a convex combination of the given base kernels, while the second one uses a convex combination of the so-called equivalent kernels. Experimental results have shown that, for a large number of data sets, the proposed classifiers are fast, accurate and easily trained. In \u2018\u2018Variational Bayesian extreme learning machine\u2019\u2019, the authors present a Bayesian probabilistic model based on ELM to avoid the ill-posed problem in input\u2013hidden node matrix. Both the regression experiments and classification experiments have clearly shown the excellent performance compared with a few existing ELMbased schemes. In \u2018\u2018A recurrent neural network for modelling crack growth of aluminium alloy\u2019\u2019, the authors develop a new recurrent neural model for crack growth process of aluminium alloy. It has been shown that a recurrent neural network with the feedback loops at the output layer is constructed to model the dynamic relationship between the crack growth and cyclic stress excitations of aluminium alloy. The extreme learning machine is then used to uniformly randomly assign the input weights in a proper range and globally optimize both the output weights and feedback parameters, to ensure that the dynamics of crack growth under variable amplitude loading can be accurately modelled. The simulations with experimental data have shown excellent results. In \u2018\u2018Extend semi-supervised ELM and a frame work\u2019\u2019, the authors analyse the semi-supervised ELM (SELM) indepth and propose an extended SELM algorithm that can efficiently solve the classification problems with a small number of labelled samples. The simulation results have shown excellent classification performance compared with both ELM and SELM algorithms.

Moreover, available methods typically calculate the weights and estimate the labels in the original input space, which typically contains noise and corruption. Thus, the en-coded similarities and manifold smoothness may be inaccurate for label estimation. In this paper, we present effective schemes for resolving these issues and propose a novel and robust semi-supervised classification algorithm, namely, the tri-ple-matrix-recovery-based robust auto-weighted label propa-gation framework (ALP-TMR). Our ALP-TMR introduces a triple matrix recovery mechanism to remove noise or mixed signs from the estimated soft labels and improve the robustness to noise and outliers in the steps of assigning weights and pre-dicting the labels simultaneously. Our method can jointly re-cover the underlying clean data, clean labels and clean weighting spaces by decomposing the original data, predicted soft labels or weights into a clean part plus an error part by fitting noise. In addition, ALP-TMR integrates the au-to-weighting process by minimizing reconstruction errors over the recovered clean data and clean soft labels, which can en-code the weights more accurately to improve both data rep-resentation and classification. By classifying samples in the recovered clean label and weight spaces, one can potentially improve the label prediction results.

Existing methods face a challenge in explaining and tracing derived results. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Inter-Region Tax Evasion Detection method based on Transfer Learning (IRTED-TL), which is optimized to simultaneously augment training data and induce interpretability into the detection model. We exploit evasion-related knowledge in one region and leverage transfer learning techniques to reinforce the tax evasion detection tasks of other regions in which training examples are lacking. We provide a unified framework that takes advantage of auxiliary data using a transfer learning mechanism and builds an interpretable classifier for inter-region tax evasion detection.

In this work, fractal analysis is explored in order to discriminate between pathological and healthy retinal texture. After a deep preprocessing step, in which spatial and colour normalization are performed, the fractal dimension is extracted locally by computing the Hurst exponent (H) along different directions. The greyscale image is described by the increments of the fractional Brownian motion model and the H parameter is computed by linear regression in the frequency domain. The ability of fractal dimension to detect pathological tissues is demonstrated using a home-made system, based on fractal analysis and Support Vector Machine, able to achieve around a 70% and 83% of accuracy in E-OPHTHA and DIARETDB1 public databases respectively. In a second experiment, the fractal descriptor is combined with texture information, extracted by the Local Binary Patterns, improving the bright lesion detection.

Familiarity is the first step towards recognition memory. We have previously demonstrated using unsupervised neural network simulations that familiarity detection of complex patterns emerges in generic cortical microcircuits with bidirectional synaptic plasticity. It is therefore meaningful to conduct similar experiments on biological neuronal networks to validate these results. Studies of learning and memory in dissociated rodent neuronal cultures remain inconclusive to date. Synchronized network bursts (SNBs) that occur spontaneously and periodically have been speculated to be an intervening factor. By optogenetically stimulating cultured cortical networks with random dot movies, we were able to reduce the occurrence of SNBs, after which an ability for familiarity detection emerged: previously seen patterns elicited higher firing rates than novel ones. Differences in firing rate were distributed over the entire network, suggesting that familiarity detection is a system level property. We also studied the change in SNB patterns following familiarity encoding. Support Vector Machine classification results indicate that SNBs may be facilitating memory consolidation of the learned pattern. In addition, using a novel network connectivity probing method, we were able to trace the change in synaptic efficacy induced by familiarity encoding, providing insights on the long-term impact of having SNBs in the cultures.Significance Statement Studies of memory mechanisms in neuronal networks formed by cultured neurons have been complicated by spontaneously occurring synchronized network bursts (SNBs), which prevent encoding of stimulus information. We have developed an optogenetic method to suppress SNBs using random dot stimuli, which allowed us to demonstrate the ability of cultured cortical networks to detect a familiar input. Whereas SNBs interfere with familiarity encoding, they may facilitate memory consolidation.

However, until now, few studies have addressed the problem of how to deal with MLDs having a large number of labels. This characteristic can be defined as high dimensionality in the label space (output attributes), in contrast to the traditional high dimensionality problem, which is usually focused on the feature space (by means of feature selection) or sample space (by means of instance selection). The purpose of this paper is to analyze dimensionality in the label space in MLDs, and to present a transformation methodology based on the use of association rules to discover label dependencies. These dependencies are used to reduce the label space, to ease the work of any MLC algorithm, and to infer the deleted labels in a final postprocessing stage.

Numerical experiments are performed on a benchmark dataset consisting of pedestrian and non-pedestrian (labelled) images captured in outdoor urban environments and indicate that the model built by combining features extracted with Kernel Descriptors from multi-modality images performs better than using single modality images.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SYNASC.2014.42", "venue": "2014 16th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing", "journal": "2014 16th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2026447488", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14239489", "206590483", "3116168", "461853", "206591283", "2715202", "6644398", "111221069", "2475434", "6783368", "6674407", "5274356", "7138354", "203671952", "14652562"], "inbound_citations": ["10026507", "14591138"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18275576"}

One of the advantages of DCNNs is their representation robust- ness to object locations, which is useful for object recognition tasks. However, this also discards spatial information, which is useful when dealing with topological information of the image (e.g. scene parsing, face recognition). Adopting graphical models (GMs) to incorporate spatial and contextual information into the DCNNs is expected to improve the performance of DCNN-based computer vision tasks. Recent research has shown that combining DCNNs and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) can significantly improve scene parsing accuracy. This is achieved either through the combination of their independent outputs or through their application as a cascade. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to incorporate CRFs deeper inside DCNNs by modeling a CRF as a DCNN layer which is pluggable into any layer of a DCNN. This implants spatial and contextual information into the DCNN, allowing end-to-end training, better controlling the spatial constraints and improving segmentation accuracy.

Operating on representation spaces, these networks lack the ability to operate in the original spaces (text or image), which makes it difficult to visualize the crossmodal function, and do not generalize well to unseen data. Recently, generative adversarial networks have gained popularity and have been used for generating realistic synthetic data and for obtaining high-level, single-modal latent representation spaces.

We propose a Spatial Group-wise Enhance (SGE) module that can adjust the importance of each sub-feature by generating an attention factor for each spatial location in each semantic group, so that every individual group can autonomously enhance its learnt expression and suppress possible noise. The attention factors are only guided by the similarities between the global and local feature descriptors inside each group, thus the design of SGE module is extremely lightweight with \\emph{almost no extra parameters and calculations}. Despite being trained with only category supervisions, the SGE component is extremely effective in highlighting multiple active areas with various high-order semantics (such as the dog's eyes, nose, etc.).

The most popular approaches to this challenge make use of the simplifying assumption that similar functional molecules, or proteins, sometimes have similar composition, or sequence. However, these algorithms often fail to identify remote homologs (proteins with similar function but dissimilar sequence) which often are a significant fraction of the total homolog collection for a given sequence. We introduce a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based tool to detect homology using semi-supervised iterative learning (SVM-HUSTLE) that identifies significantly more remote homologs than current state-of-the-art sequence or cluster-based methods. As opposed to building profiles or position specific scoring matrices, SVM-HUSTLE builds an SVM classifier for a query sequence by training on a collection of representative high-confidence training sets, recruits additional sequences and assigns a statistical measure of homology between a pair of sequences. SVM-HUSTLE combines principles of semi-supervised learning theory with statistical sampling to create many concurrent classifiers to iteratively detect and refine, on-the-fly, patterns indicating homology. ::: ::: Results: When compared against existing methods for identifying protein homologs (BLAST, PSI-BLAST, COMPASS, PROF_SIM, RANKPROP and their variants) on two different benchmark datasets SVM-HUSTLE significantly outperforms each of the above methods using the most stringent ROC1 statistic with P-values less than 1e-20.

First, we imitate the feature-based transfer learning framework to transfer the distorted images as the related domain, which enriches the distorted samples. Second, to extract high-level spatiotemporal features of the distorted videos, a six-layer CNN with the acknowledged learning ability is pretrained and finetuned by the common features of the distorted image blocks (IBs) and video blocks (VBs), respectively. Notably, the labels of the distorted IBs and VBs are predicted by the classic FR metrics. Finally, based on saliency maps and the entropy function, we conduct a pooling stage to obtain the quality scores of the distorted videos by weighting the block-level scores predicted by the trained CNN. In particular, we introduce a preprocessing and a postprocessing to reduce the impact of inaccurate labels predicted by the FR-VQA metric.

However, microarray data classification is still a challenging task since there are often a huge number of genes but a small number of samples in gene expression data. As a result, a computational method for reducing the dimension of microarray data is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a computational gene selection model for microarray data classification via adaptive hypergraph embedded dictionary learning (AHEDL). Specifically, a dictionary is learned from the feature space of original high dimensional microarray data, and this learned dictionary is used to represent original genes with a reconstruction coefficient matrix. Then we use a l2, 1-norm regularization to impose the row sparsity on the coefficient matrix for selecting discriminate genes. Meanwhile, in order to capture the localmanifold geometrical structure of original microarray data in a high-order manner, a hypergraph is adaptively learned and embedded into the model.

{"paper_id": "112529130", "title": "Adaptive control of compliant robots with Reservoir Computing", "authors": [{"first": "Tim", "middle": [], "last": "Waegeman", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "In modern society, robots are increasingly used to handle dangerous, repetitive and/or heavy tasks with high precision. Because of the nature of the tasks, either being dangerous, high precision or simply repetitive, robots are usually constructed with high torque motors and sturdy materials, that makes them dangerous for humans to handle. In a car-manufacturing company, for example, a large cage is placed around the robot\u2019s workspace that prevents humans from entering its vicinity. In the last few decades, efforts have been made to improve human-robot interaction. Often the movement of robots is characterized as not being smooth and clearly dividable into sub-movements. This makes their movement rather unpredictable for humans. So, there exists an opportunity to improve the motion generation of robots to enhance human-robot interaction. One interesting research direction is that of imitation learning. Here, human motions are recorded and demonstrated to the robot. Although the robot is able to reproduce such movements, it cannot be generalized to other situations. Therefore, a dynamical system approach is proposed where the recorded motions are embedded into the dynamics of the system. Shaping these nonlinear dynamics, according to recorded motions, allows for dynamical system to generalize beyond demonstration. As a result, the robot can generate motions of other situations not included in the recorded human demonstrations. ::: In this dissertation, a Reservoir Computing approach is used to create a dynamical system in which such demonstrations are embedded. Reservoir Computing systems are Recurrent Neural Network-based approaches that are efficiently trained by considering only the training of the readout connections and retaining all other connections of such a network unchanged given their initial randomly chosen values. Although they have been used to embed periodic motions before, they were extended to embed discrete motions, or both. This work describes how such a motion pattern-generating system is built, investigates the nature of the underlying dynamics and evaluates their robustness in the face of perturbations. Additionally, a dynamical system approach to obstacle avoidance is proposed that is based on vector fields in the presence of repellers. This technique can be used to extend the motion abilities of the robot without need for changing the trained Motion Pattern Generator (MPG). Therefore, this approach can be applied in real-time on any system that generates a certain movement trajectory. ::: Assume that the MPG system is implemented on an industrial robotic arm, similar to the ones used in a car factory. Even though the obstacle avoidance strategy presented is able to modify the generated motion of the robot\u2019s gripper in such a way that it avoids obstacles, it does not guarantee that other parts of the robot cannot collide with a human. To prevent this, engineers have started to use advanced control algorithms that measure the amount of torque that is applied on the robot. This allows the robot to be aware of external perturbations. However, it turns out that, even with fast control loops, the adaptation to compensate for a sudden perturbation, is too slow to prevent high interaction forces. To reduce such forces, researchers started to use mechanical elements that are passively compliant (e.g., springs) and light-weight flexible materials to construct robots. Although such compliant robots are much safer and inherently energy efficient to use, their control becomes much harder. Most control approaches use model information about the robot (e.g., weight distribution and shape). However, when constructing a compliant robot it is hard to determine the dynamics of these materials. Therefore, a model-free adaptive control framework is proposed that assumes no prior knowledge about the robot. By interacting with the robot it learns an inverse robot model that is used as controller. The more it interacts, the better the control be- comes. Appropriately, this framework is called Inverse Modeling Adaptive (IMA) control framework. I have evaluated the IMA controller\u2019s tracking ability on sev- eral tasks, investigating its model independence and stability. Furthermore, I have shown its fast learning ability and comparable performance to taskspecific designed controllers. ::: Given both the MPG and IMA controllers, it is possible to improve the inter- actability of a compliant robot in a human-friendly environment. When the robot is to perform human-like motions for a large set of tasks, we need to demonstrate motion examples of all these tasks. However, biological research concerning the motion generation of animals and humans revealed that a limited set of motion patterns, called motion primitives, are modulated and combined to generate advanced motor/motion skills that humans and animals exhibit. Inspired by these interesting findings, I investigate if a single motion primitive indeed can be modulated to achieve a desired motion behavior. By some elementary experiments, where an MPG is controlled by an IMA controller, a proof of concept is presented. Furthermore, a general hierarchy is introduced that describes how a robot can be controlled in a biology-inspired manner. I also investigated how motion primitives can be combined to produce a desired motion. However, I was unable to get more advanced implementations to work. The results of some simple experiments are presented in the appendix. Another approach I investigated assumes that the primitives themselves are undefined. Instead, only a high-level description is given, which describes that every primitive on average should contribute equally, while still allowing for a single primitive to specialize in a part of the motion generation. Without defining the behavior of a primitive, only a set of untrained IMA controllers is used of which each will represent a single primitive. As a result of the high-level heuristic description, the task space is tiled into sub-regions in an unsupervised manner. Resulting in controllers that indeed represent a part of the motion generation. I have applied this Modular Architecture with Control Primitives (MACOP) on an inverse kinematic learning task and investigated the emerged primitives. Thanks to the tiling of the task space, it becomes possible to control redundant systems, because redundant solutions can be spread over several control primitives. Within each sub region of the task space, a specific control primitive is more accurate than in other regions allowing for the task complexity to be distributed over several less complex tasks. ::: Finally, I extend the use of an IMA-controller, which is tracking controller, to the control of under-actuated systems. By using a sample-based planning algorithm it becomes possible to explore the system dynamics in which a path to a desired state can be planned. Afterwards, MACOP is used to incorporate feedback and to learn the necessary control commands corresponding to the planned state space trajectory, even if it contains errors. As a result, the under-actuated control of a cart pole system was achieved. Furthermore, I presented the concept of a simulation based control framework that allows the learning of the system dynamics, planning and feedback control iteratively and simultaneously.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2300668509", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112529130"}

Importantly, the study also shows that the OSRE method benefits from SVM specific characteristics, being able to extract less rules from SVM than from equivalent ANN models.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-17313-4_4", "venue": "ADMA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1533179223", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17646156", "44239286", "1059822", "14051456", "13224413", "1570684", "11940402", "13508833", "206459266", "59699060", "43471744", "368033"], "inbound_citations": ["185473", "17308355", "15475630", "202592400", "53237071", "8289099", "15079051"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16446613"}

Connectionist models, loosely based on neural information processing, have been successful in capturing a range of developmental phenomena, in particular on-line within-task category learning by young infants. Here we describe two new models. One demonstrates how age dependent changes in neural receptive field sizes can explain observed changes in on-line category learning between 3 and 10 months of age. The other aims to reconcile two conflicting views of infant categorization by focusing on the different task requirements of preferential looking and manual exploration studies. A dual-memory hypothesis posits that within-task category learning that drives looking time behaviors is based on a fast-learning memory system, whereas categorization based on background experience and assessed by paradigms requiring complex motor behavior relies on a second, slow-learning system.

Moreover, manual diagnosis of skin disease is often subjective, time-consuming, and required more human effort. Thus, there is a need to develop a computer-aided system that automatically diagnoses the skin disease problem.

At present, the research on the source cell-phone identification in clean conditions has achieved good results, but that in noisy environments is not ideal. This paper proposes a novel source cell-phone identification system suitable for both clean and noisy environments using spectral distribution features of constant Q transform (CQT) domain and multi-scene training method. Based on the analysis, it is found that the identification difficulty lies in different models of cell-phones of the same brand, and their tiny differences are mainly in the middle and low frequency bands. Therefore, this paper extracts spectral distribution features from the CQT domain, which has a higher frequency resolution in the mid-low frequency. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feature, four classification techniques of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neuron Network-Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (RNN-BLSTM) are used to identify the source recording device. Experimental results show that the features proposed in this paper have superior performance. Compared with Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and linear frequency cepstral coefficient (LFCC), it enhances the accuracy of cell-phones within the same brand, whether the speech to be tested comprises clean speech files or noisy speech files.

A round of improvement consists of a generative phase, in which we use GANs and metaheuristics to generate instances ; an evaluation phase in which we calculate the detection rate of those newly generated attacks ; and a training phase, in which we train the IDS with those attacks. We have evaluated the SIGMA method for four standard machine learning classification algorithms acting as IDS, with a combination of GAN and a hybrid local-search and genetic algorithm, to generate new datasets of attacks.

To this end, we implement AutoPhase: a framework that takes a program and uses deep reinforcement learning to find a sequence of compilation passes that minimizes its execution time. Without loss of generality, we construct this framework in the context of the LLVM compiler toolchain and target high-level synthesis programs. We use random forests to quantify the correlation between the effectiveness of a given pass and the program's features. This helps us reduce the search space by avoiding phase orderings that are unlikely to improve the performance of a given program. We compare the performance of AutoPhase to state-of-the-art algorithms that address the phase-ordering problem. In our evaluation, we show that AutoPhase improves circuit performance by 28% when compared to using the -O3 compiler flag, and achieves competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, while requiring fewer samples.

In this paper, we propose a hash based method for large scale nonparallel support vector machine prediction(HNPSVM). Our key idea of this method is that we use an approximal decision function instead of exact decision function by computing the Hamming distance between hashing the normal to the hyperplane of the classifier and the features. This method benefits nonparallel support vector(NPSVM) prediction in three aspects. First, it enhances the prediction accuracy using an flexible and general method. Second, the proposed HNPSVM reduce storage cost owing to the compact binary hash representation. Last, HNPSVM can speed up the computation of classification function. Moreover, we prove that the classification results of a hash based NPSVM classifier converge to the results of the exact NPSVM classifier as the number of binary hash functions tends to infinity.

Specifically, eight GLCM texture features (mean, variance, homogeneity, dissimilarity, contrast, entropy, angular second moment, and correlation) were first calculated from IKONOS NIR band (Band 4) to determine an optimal window size (13 \u00d7 13) and an optimal direction (45\u00b0).

Next, an optimal distance value (5) and an optimal neighborhood rule (Queen\u2019s case) were determined for calculating the four Gi features from the four IKONOS MS bands. Finally, different RF classification results of the three forest health conditions were created: (1) an overall accuracy (OA) of 79.5% produced using the four MS band reflectances only; (2) an OA of 97.1% created with the eight GLCM features calculated from IKONOS Band 4 with the optimal window size of 13 \u00d7 13 and direction 45\u00b0; (3) an OA of 93.3% created with the all 32 GLCM features calculated from the four IKONOS MS bands with a window size of 13 \u00d7 13 and direction of 45\u00b0; (4) an OA of 94.0% created using the four Gi features calculated from the four IKONOS MS bands with the optimal distance value of 5 and Queen\u2019s neighborhood rule; and (5) an OA of 96.9% created with the combined 16 spectral (four), spatial (four), and textural (eight) features.

In this study, soil compressibility prediction models are enhanced by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, and the performances of those correlations are tested via field verification in terms of settlement calculation. The field verification portion of the study consists of identifying sites with borings, consolidation tests, and measured settlement from overlying load. Soil layers, within the influence zone of settlement, are tested to obtain soil index parameters. Once a complete soil profile has been established, a series of settlement analyses were performed. Settlement predictions were made based on both predicted and measured Cr for each soil layer. An additional settlement prediction was made using a rule of thumb equating Cc to Cr. The predicted settlements were then compared to the measured settlement taken in close proximity. Upon conclusion, using the Cr and Cc correlations provides comparable settlement predictions compared to measured settlement and the predicted Cr (using a correlation from predicted Cc) exhibits the strongest settlement predictions.

Due to the huge amount and genetic diversity, although many algorithms have been proposed, the promoter recognition are rather complex with the performance still limited by low sensitivity and highly false positives. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning method for predicting promoter. First, the function motifs in different regions of Human promoter sequences have been recognized using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The optimum number of GMM is given by the fuzzy cluster recognition algorithm based on fuzzy likelihood function without prior knowledge.

Detecting the head-shoulder appearance is an attractive way for pedestrian detection, especially in scenes with crowd, heavy occlusion or large camera tilt angles. However, the head-shoulder part contains less information than the full human body, which requires better feature extraction to ensure the effectiveness of the detection. This paper proposes a head-shoulder detection method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). According to the characteristics of the head and shoulders, our method integrates a structure-sensitive ROI pooling layer into the CNN architecture. The proposed CNN is trained in a multi-task scheme with classification and localization outputs. Furthermore, the convolutional layers of the network are pre-trained using a triplet loss to capture better features of the head-shoulder appearance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy of the proposed method is 89.6% when the IoU threshold is 0.5. Our method obtains close results to the state-of-the-art method Faster R-CNN while outperforming it in speed. Even when the number of extracted candidate regions increases, the increased detection time is negligible. In addition, when the IoU threshold is greater than 0.6, the average accuracy of our method is higher than that of Faster R-CNN, which indicates that our results have higher IoU with ground truth.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-71607-7_12", "venue": "ICIG", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2781409998", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31301017"}

However, VAE models typically produce blurry outputs when faced with sub-optimal conditioning of the input, and GANs are known to be unstable for large output sizes. In addition, the output videos of these models are difficult to evaluate, partly because the GAN loss function is not an accurate measure of convergence. In this work, we propose using a state-of-the-art neural flow generator called Glow to generate videos conditioned on a textual label, one frame at a time. Neural flow models are more stable than standard GANs, as they only optimize a single cross entropy loss function, which is monotonic and avoids the circular convergence issues of the GAN minimax objective. In addition, we also show how to condition Glow on external context, while still preserving the invertible nature of each \"flow\" layer. Finally, we evaluate the proposed Glow model by calculating cross entropy on a held-out validation set of videos, in order to compare multiple versions of the proposed model via an ablation study.

This paper provides an integrative overview of recent empirical and computational work on acquired dyslexia within the context of the primary systems framework as implemented in connectionist neuropsychological models.

Recent case-series behavioural evidence concerning pure alexia, phonological dyslexia and surface dyslexia that supports this perspective is presented. Lesion simulations of these findings within connectionist models of reading demonstrate the viability of this approach. The commitment of such models to learnt representations allows them to capture key aspects of performance in each type of acquired dyslexia, particularly the associated non-reading deficits, the role of relearning and the influence of individual differences in the premorbid state of the reading system.

These problems are especially pronounced for approaches that transform MLL problems into a set of binary classification problems for which Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used. On the other hand, the most efficient approaches to MLL, based on decision trees, have clearly lower predictive performance. We propose a hybrid decision tree architecture, where the leaves do not give multi-label predictions directly, but rather utilize local SVM-based classifiers giving multi-label predictions. A binary relevance architecture is employed in the leaves, where a binary SVM classifier is built for each of the labels relevant to that particular leaf.

In this paper, we present a comparative study of three popular pre-trained CNN models: AlexNet, VGG-16 and VGG-19. We address the problem of palmprint identification in low-quality imagery and apply Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with all of the compared models. For the comparison, we use the MOHI palmprint image database whose images are characterized by low contrast, shadows, and varying illumination, scale, translation and rotation. Another, high-quality database called COEP is also considered to study the recognition gap between high-quality and low-quality imagery. Our experiments show that the deeper pre-trained CNN models, e.g., VGG-16 and VGG-19, tend to extract highly distinguishable features that recognize low-quality palmprints more efficiently than the less deep networks such as AlexNet. Furthermore, our experiments on the two databases using various models demonstrate that the features extracted from lower-level fully connected layers provide higher recognition rates than higher-layer features.

In this paper, we propose a new framework for inferring boundaries from color and depth information. Even with depth information, it is not a trivial task to find and classify boundaries. Real-world depth images are noisy, especially at object boundaries, where our task is focused. Our approach uses features from both the color (which are sharp at object boundaries) and depth images (for providing geometric cues) to detect boundaries and classify them as occlusion or connected boundaries. We propose depth features based on surface fitting from sparse point clouds, and perform inference with a Conditional Random Field. One advantage of our approach is that occlusion and connected boundaries are identified with a single, common model.

The NF controller employs a simplified fuzzy algorithm which is based on a multi-layer neural network. The modeling network is used as an estimator which can identify the vehicle dynamic model parameters and provide the NF controller with learning signals. A plant model is used initially to tune the parameters of the NF controller using a set of fuzzy control rules. A semi-active suspension system, utilised for vibration control tests, is modelled in simulation and tested with results obtained from vehicle experiments. Significant dynamic nonlinearity is inherent in the plant due to the suspension dynamics. The NF controller results are compared with a conventional fuzzy logic (FL) controller and an open loop passive suspension system. It is found that the NF controller performance is satisfactory and the resultant reduction of vehicle vibration is improved, in the presence of the dynamic complexities of the plant. The method proposed has several advantages over others presented in the literature. In order to verify simulation results, a test vehicle fitted with a semiactive suspension measurement and control system was experimented with under different vehicle speeds and road surfaces. In addition, a semi-active suspension and a passive suspension were also experimented. The test results coincide closely with those obtained from simulation. These results show that the semi-active suspension methodology exhibits good performance leading to reduction of vehicle vibration.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1504/IJVAS.2003.003538", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Vehicle Autonomous Systems", "mag_id": "2026558637", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16056750"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109606995"}

Therefore, understanding these manifestations is crucial for conversational analysis and for modeling human\u2013machine dialogs. The goal of this study is to design computational models to classify overlapping speech segments of dyadic conversations into competitive vs. non-competitive acts using lexical and acoustic cues, as well as their surrounding context.

We observe that lexical word-embedding features significantly increase the overall F1-measure compared to both acoustic and bag-of-ngrams lexical representations, suggesting that lexical information can be utilized as a powerful cue for overlap classification.

Neural networks have shown great promise over the last two decades in modeling nonlinear time series. But the issue of nonconvex optimization ensues when two or more hidden layers are required for highly complex phenomena.

Early diagnosis confers many benefits, including improved care and access to effective treatment. However, it is still a medical challenge due to the lack of an efficient and inexpensive way to assess cognitive function [1]. Although research on data from Neuroimaging and Brain Initiative and the advancement in data analytics has greatly enhanced our understanding of the underlying disease process, there is still a lack of complete knowledge regarding the indicative biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease. Recently, computer aided diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and AD with functional brain images using machine learning methods has become popular. However, the prediction accuracy remains unoptimistic, with prediction accuracy ranging from 60% to 88% [2,3,6]. Among them, support vector machine is the most popular classifier. However, because of the relatively small sample size and the amount of noise in functional brain imaging data, a single classifier cannot achieve high classification performance. Instead of using a global classifier, in this work, we aim to improve AD prediction accuracy by combining three different classifiers using weighted and unweighted schemes. We rank image-derived features according to their importance to the classification performance and show that the top ranked features are localized in the brain areas which have been found to associate with the progression of AD.

No single technique is capable of providing reliable and accurate positioning in all contexts. In order to operate reliably across different contexts, a multi-sensor navigation system is required to detect its operating context and reconfigure the techniques accordingly. This paper aims to determine the behavioural and environmental contexts together, building the foundation of a context-adaptive navigation system. Both behavioural and environmental context detection results are presented. A hierarchical behavioural recognition scheme is proposed, within which the broad classes of human activities and vehicle motions are detected using measurements from accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers and the barometer on a smartphone by decision trees (DT) and Relevance Vector Machines (RVM).

In order to estimate user's favorite musical pieces, our method utilizes his/her EEG signals for calculating new audio features suitable for representing the user's music preference. Specifically, projection, which transforms original audio features into the features reflecting the preference, is calculated by applying kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to the audio features and the EEG features which are extracted from the user's EEG signals during listening to favorite musical pieces. By using the obtained projection, the new EEG-based audio features can be derived since this projection provides the best correlation between the user's EEG signals and their corresponding audio signals. Thus, successful estimation of user's favorite musical pieces via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the new audio features becomes feasible. Since our method does not need acquisition of EEG signals for obtaining new audio features from new musical pieces after calculating the projection, this indicates the high practicability of our method.

Combined with accurate learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, they allow us to directly encode rich syntactic data in our learning problems without requiring an explicit feature mapping function or deep specific domain knowledge. ::: ::: However, as other very high dimensional kernel families, they come with two major drawbacks: first, the computational complexity induced by the dual representation makes them unpractical for very large datasets or for situations where very fast classifiers are necessary, e.g. real time systems or web applications; second, their implicit nature somehow limits their scientific appeal, as the implicit models that we learn cannot cast new light on the studied problems. ::: ::: As a possible solution to these two problems, this Thesis presents an approach to feature selection for tree kernel functions in the context of Support Vector learning, based on a greedy exploration of the fragment space. Features are selected according to a gradient norm preservation criterion, i.e. we select the heaviest features that account for a large percentage of the gradient norm, and are explicitly modeled and represented. The result of the feature extraction process is a data structure that can be used to decode the input structured data, i.e. to explicitly describe a tree in terms of its more relevant fragments. ::: ::: We present theoretical insights that justify the adopted strategy and detail the algorithms and data structures used to explore the feature space and store the most relevant features.

Previous approaches showcase the inability of even deep neural networks to learn informative representations across domain shift. This problem is more severe for tasks where acquiring hand labeled data is extremely hard and tedious. In this work, we focus on adapting the representations learned by segmentation networks across synthetic and real domains. Contrary to previous approaches that use a simple adversarial objective or superpixel information to aid the process, we propose an approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that brings the embeddings closer in the learned feature space. To showcase the generality and scalability of our approach, we show that we can achieve state of the art results on two challenging scenarios of synthetic to real domain adaptation.

The originally proposed anatomical FAT definition characterizes a connection between Broca's territory and anterior supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas in the Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG). Here we propose an extended definition of the FAT (the exFAT) that propagates more anteriorly into the SFG. A sample of 834 subjects from the WU-Minn HCP 900 subjects data release (S900) was selected. The bilateral exFATs were reconstructed for the whole sample using an automated pipeline and thresholded adjusted tract volumes were calculated. A laterality test was performed on the whole sample. The frontal cortex has known implications on superior cognitive functions, so here we evaluate the implications of exFAT volume on performance in a language task and on a set of working memory tasks. Two sub-samples of 70 subjects each were drawn from the S900 sample by selecting the 35 top-performers and 35 bottom-performers for both language and working memory tasks. Additional laterality tests were performed on each subsample. We did not find the exFAT to be lateralized in any of the samples. We found statistically significant differences in left adjusted exFAT volume between top-performers and bottom-performers in the language task. We also found statistically significant differences in right adjusted exFAT volume between top-performers and bottom-performers for 2-back working memory tasks. To check for the predictive power of the exFAT volumes as correlates for performance, we ran a repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation procedure based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that was capable of correctly classifying holdout subjects to their corresponding group (top-performer vs bottom-performer) with an average accuracy of 74.5% for language task performance based on left exFAT volume and an accuracy of 64.2% for Working Memory performance based on right exFAT volume.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6070228", "pubmed_id": "30067818", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0200786", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2885317503", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["14754867", "2234415", "4648544", "207649394", "30314184", "8458118", "1876947", "20201971", "34929174", "6031917", "1682554", "9922807", "29426973", "7652329", "215185515", "44585683", "7971251", "59820893", "10659969", "2913643", "12370312"], "inbound_citations": ["196634675"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51892594"}

First, a UDF cannot take a set of tuples as input or as output, which restricts the modeling capability for complex applications, and the tuple-wise pipelined UDF execution often leads to inefficiency and rules out the potential for enabling data-parallel computation inside the function. Next, the UDFs coded in non-SQL language such as C, either involve hard-to-follow DBMS internal system calls for interacting with the query executor, or sacrifice performance by converting input objects to strings. ::: ::: To solve the above problems, we realized the notion of Relation Valued Function (RVF) in an industry-scale database engine.

We here provide a more general approach to automatically classify USVs using deep neural networks (DNN). We classified the sex of the emitting mouse (C57Bl/6) based on the vocalization\u2019s spectrogram, reaching unprecedented performance (~84% correct) in comparison with other techniques (Support Vector Machines: 64%, Ridge regression: 52%). Vocalization characteristics of individual mice only contribute mildly, and sex-only classification reaches ~78%.

Splitting estimation into two DNNs, from spectrograms to features (57-82%) and features to sex (67%) does not reach the single-step performance. In summary, the emitter\u2019s sex can be successfully predicted from their spectrograms using DNNs, excelling over other classification techniques.

Similarly, a pixel-wise classification solely based on the spectral content can be performed, but it lacks information on the structure of the features in the image. An extension is proposed in this paper in order to overcome these dual problems. The proposed method is based on the data fusion of the morphological information and the original hyperspectral data: the two vectors of attributes are concatenated.

Although information is in general only explicitly available for compounds reported to react, it is possible to derive information about substructures that do not react in the reported reactions. Both types of information (positive and negative) can be used to train machine learning techniques to predict if a compound reacts or not with a specific reagent. The whole process was implemented with two databases of reactions, one involving BuNH2 as the reagent, and the other NaCNBH3. Negative information was derived using MOLMAP molecular descriptors, and classification models were developed with Random Forests also based on MOLMAP descriptors. MOLMAP descriptors were based exclusively on calculated physicochemical features of molecules. Correct predictions were achieved for approximately 90% of independent test sets. While NaCNBH3 is a selective reducing reagent widely used in organic synthesis, BuNH2 is a nucleophile that mimics the reactivity of the lysine side chain (involved in an initiating step of the mechanism leading to skin sensitization).", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19468693", "doi": "10.1007/s10822-009-9275-2", "venue": "Journal of computer-aided molecular design", "journal": "Journal of computer-aided molecular design", "mag_id": "1986637211", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["205264340", "29165891", "206657585", "215022324", "205624311", "11357682", "23272956", "21837752"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19807102"}

Most existing research is focused on extraction of sentiment features through analysis of lexical and syntactic features that are expressed explicitly through words, emoticons, exclamation marks etc. Single machine learning classifiers are usually employed by these approaches for tweet sentiment classification. In this paper, we introduce a semantic feature model that utilizes co-occurrence statistics and latent contextual semantic relationships between words in tweets. These semantic features are combined with prior polarity score features and n-grams features as a sentiment feature set of tweets. The feature set is incorporated into an ensemble classifier formed by Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and Random Forest for training and predicting sentiment classification labels. Five Twitter datasets are used in our evaluation and the performance of the model is compared with a word n-grams model as a baseline.

Indicators that efficiently link post-fire recovery with a timely decision on landscape management can play a key role in the governance of fire risk. We describe a framework to evaluate post-fire recovery based on remotely-sensed measures of relative vegetation recovery, calculated from satellite NDVI time-series. Three indicators are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI), measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a measure of the short-term recovery rate. We used Random Forest (RF) models to predict the observed recovery patterns and ranked the predictive importance of several candidate explanatory factors. The performance of RF models ranged from good (CRRI, RTI) to moderate (HRT). Three sets of predictive variables consistently ranked higher: fire traits, landscape composition, and post-fire climatic conditions. The relative contribution of individual variables was different across recovery indicators. These results show that proposed indicators seem to capture different facets of the post-fire recovery process. The short-term recovery indicator (HRT) was linked to landscape composition and post-fire climate. Thus, HRT expresses the speed of initial recovery, related to differences in fire-response traits of vegetation and to climatic conditions immediately following fire. The mid-term recovery indicator (RTI) was mainly influenced by fire traits and post-fire climatic conditions. This indicator captures multiple interacting effects that shape the recovery process related to fire severity, vegetation type and post-fire conditions. Finally, the long-term recovery indicator (CRRI) was clearly more influenced by fire attributes related to severity than by vegetation type and structure or by post-fire climatic conditions. Overall, our results suggest that a combination of biotic processes (driven by plant life-history traits) and abiotic filters (e.g., post-fire climate) determine the early post-fire recovery process. Conversely, the mid to long-term recovery response (expressing its completeness) is driven by the depletion of resilience capacity and by the amount of change in vegetation structure and functioning modulated by spatial differences in fire severity. Our results strongly suggest that an indicator-based approach grounded on satellite time-series of vegetation indices can effectively cover various facets of post-fire recovery.

One drawback of kNN is that it performs poorly when class distributions are overlapping. Recently, local probability center (LPC) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem; its main idea is giving weight to samples according to their posterior probability. However, LPC performs poorly when the value of k is very small and the higher-dimensional datasets are used. To deal with this problem, this paper suggests that the gradient of the posterior probability function can be estimated under sufficient assumption. The theoretic property is beneficial to faithfully calculate the inner product of two vectors. To increase the performance in high-dimensional datasets, the multidimensional Parzen window and Euler-Richardson method are utilized, and a new classifier based on local probability centers is developed in this paper.

To leverage the kernel-based methods developed for Euclidean space, several recent methods have been proposed to embed the Grassmann manifold into a high dimensional Hilbert space by exploiting the well established Project Metric, which can approximate the Riemannian geometry of Grassmann manifold. Nevertheless, they inevitably introduce the drawbacks from traditional kernel-based methods such as implicit map and high computational cost to the Grassmann manifold. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel method to learn the Projection Metric directly on Grassmann manifold rather than in Hilbert space. From the perspective of manifold learning, our method can be regarded as performing a geometry-aware dimensionality reduction from the original Grassmann manifold to a lower-dimensional, more discriminative Grassmann manifold where more favorable classification can be achieved.

We further identify two challenges that developers need to address. The first problem is that the labels of training data are inevitably noisy due to difficulties of annotating thousands hours of data. The second problem lies in the continuous nature of human activities, which violates the independence assumption made by many learning algorithms. We approach the first problem of noisy labeling in the multiple-label framework, and develop a conditional Markov Models to take temporal context into consideration.

Potential of three different AISC techniques, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Genetic Programming (GP), is explored. The estimated surface SMC is validated with the field soil moisture values in both bare and vegetated lands (< 30 cm height). Different techniques have their own merits and demerits; however, we recommend GP to be most useful due to its other features. For example, GP provides the mathematical relationship, importance and sensitivity of each individual input to the surface SMC. This helps us to quantify the contribution of quad-polarized backscattering coefficients and soil texture information.

This requires carrying out a detailed analysis of the various characteristics of real time electrical signals through a set of signal processing techniques . PQ distortions due to environmental factors, such as change in wind speed and solar irradiations are considered in this work. Signal features are extracted for various voltage sag/swell signals using S-Transform, while signal-classification is done by Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) technique. A 17-bus test system is modeled using the open source software, Open Distribution System Simulator (OpenDSS). Smart converter control is realized with inputs received from signal classifier, so as to initiate proper grid-support functions. Controlled actions realized are Volt-VAr and Volt-Watt functions. The performance of the control functions is tested for varying levels of solar and wind penetrations.

Laplacian Support Vector Machine (LapSVM) is a representative of these methods and an extension of the traditional SVM by optimizing a new objective additionally appended Laplacian regularizer. The regularizer utilizes the local linear patches to approximate the data manifold structure and assumes the same label of the data on each patch. Though LapSVM has shown more effective classification performance than SVM experimentally, it in fact concerns more the locality than the globality of data manifold due to the Laplacian regularizer itself. As a result, LapSVM is relatively sensitive to the local change of the data and cannot characterize the manifold quite faithfully. In this paper, we design an alternative regularizer, termed as Glocalization Pursuit Regularizer. The new regularizer introduces a natural global structure measure to grasp the global and local manifold information as simultaneously as possible, which can be proved to make the representation of the manifold more compact than the Laplacian regularizer. We further introduce the new regularizer into SVM to develop an alternative graph-based SVM, called as Glocalization Pursuit Support Vector Machine (GPSVM). GPSVM not only inherits the advantages of both SVM and LapSVM but also uses the structural information more reasonably to guide the classifier design. The experiments both on the toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the better classification performance of our proposed GPSVM compared with SVM and LapSVM.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00521-010-0448-7", "venue": "Neural Computing and Applications", "journal": "Neural Computing and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1980150873", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3118640", "9218939", "13231727", "18501843", "60577818", "15514452", "11845688", "455073", "17131876", "508435", "700775", "1052837", "5896838", "25522624", "118947079", "14727192", "19641543"], "inbound_citations": ["25881571", "18968869", "4836772", "25194647"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12716808"}

GAN is a powerful tool that can implicitly learn unknown data distributions in an unsupervised manner. From the observation that GAN discriminator is highly influenced by pixels where objects appear, we analyze the internal layers of discriminator and visualize the activated pixels. Our important finding is that high image diversity of GAN, which is a main goal in GAN research, is ironically disadvantageous for object localization, because such discriminators focus not only on the target object, but also on the various objects, such as background objects. Based on extensive evaluations and experimental studies, we show the image diversity and localization performance have a negative correlation. In addition, our approach achieves meaningful accuracy for unsupervised object co-localization using publicly available benchmark datasets, even comparable to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised approach.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1806.00236", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2850232725", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10328909", "206594738", "2141740", "195908774", "4071727", "14124313", "206592484", "206594692", "1241368", "6789015", "8098518", "10592859", "7286956", "5864138", "8579046", "2057420", "10894094", "37428828", "11758569", "12039270", "17629679", "1699107", "14091235", "624940", "504491", "1450294", "206592664", "9173222", "374346", "15019293", "9728578", "976598", "3448187", "3967803", "2930547", "18828233", "3398677", "3366315", "5808102", "8236317", "6447277", "1099052"], "inbound_citations": ["77394338"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49650784"}

The task is to classify an unlabeled \u201ctarget\u201d dataset by leveraging a labeled \u201csource\u201d dataset that comes from a slightly similar distribution. We propose metric-based adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (M-ADDA) which performs two main steps. First, it uses a metric learning approach to train the source model on the source dataset by optimizing the triplet loss function. This results in clusters where embeddings of the same label are close to each other and those with different labels are far from one another. Next, it uses the adversarial approach (as that used in ADDA (Tzeng et al. Adversarial discriminative domain adaptation, 2017, [36])) to make the extracted features from the source and target datasets indistinguishable. Simultaneously, we optimize a novel loss function that encourages the target dataset\u2019s embeddings to form clusters. While ADDA and M-ADDA use similar architectures, we show that M-ADDA performs significantly better on the digits adaptation datasets of MNIST and USPS. This suggests that using metric learning for domain adaptation can lead to large improvements in classification accuracy for the domain adaptation task.

The available methods for protein fold recognition are limited by the low fold-coverage and/or low prediction accuracies. We describe here a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based method for protein fold prediction with high prediction accuracy and high fold-coverage. The new method of fold prediction with high fold-coverage was developed by training and testing on a large number of folds in order to make the method suitable for large scale fold predictions. However, presence of large number of folds in the training set made the classification task difficult as a consequence of increased complexity involved in binary classifications of SVMs. In order to overcome this complexity we adopted a hierarchical approach where fold-prediction is made in two steps. At the first step structural class of the query is predicted and at the second step fold is predicted within the predicted structural class. This decreased the complexity of the classification problem and also improved the overall fold prediction accuracy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first taxonomic fold recognition method to cover over 700 protein-folds and gives prediction accuracy of around 70% on a benchmark dataset. Since the new method gives rise to state of the art prediction performance and hence can be very useful for structural characterization of proteins discovered in various genomes.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/jib-2011-185", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["8469410", "6823830", "1653309", "9728696", "11983482", "7935407", "23373242", "2389639", "35497357", "52874011", "961425", "765861", "6869184", "14855409", "17815381", "12669405", "1077643"], "inbound_citations": ["40245855", "40245855", "18379309", "59233918"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201016168"}

Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm lacks the detailed and unique description of the object and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection algorithm based on a multiscale conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). The generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multigranularity structure in the generator network. A multiscale shared convolution structure is adopted in the discriminator network to further supervise training the generator. Finally, the Monte Carlo search technique is introduced to search the intermediate state of the generator, and the result is sent to the discriminator for comparison. Compared with the existing work, our model achieved 82.43\\% pixel accuracy and an average intersection-over-union (IOU) of 0.6218, and the detection of the track reached 95.01\\% accuracy in the downhole roadway scene test set.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.08177", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2937421984", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1033682", "12803511", "6200260", "8191987", "8758543", "206593710", "980236", "3439214", "8758543", "980236", "6656096", "4855369", "30962846", "3268342", "7920870"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119311489"}
