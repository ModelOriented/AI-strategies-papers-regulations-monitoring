The suppression of impulsive noise is a classic problem in nonlinear processing, and the SVM are especially useful in this type of processing. In this new approach we use the classification and the regression based on SVM. By using the classifier we select the noisy pixels into the images and by using the regression we obtain a reconstruction value based on the neighboring pixels. The results obtained are comparable and, a lot of times, better than those from another \"state-of-art\" techniques. Besides, this new technique can be applied successfully to images with high noise ratios while maintaining the visual quality and the low reconstruction error. 1. INTRODUCTION Some times the images that we received have added an impulsive noise. This impulsive noise can be due to a noisy transmission channel or to imperfections of the sensor with which we obtain the images so that in some points a saturation takes place. The linear techniques are little effective in the reduction of this type of noise and as alternative they nonlinear techniques appear. A well-known nonlinear method is the median filter. The main disadvantage of this method is that it is applied on all the points of the image regardless of they are noisy or not. Then a blurring effect is produced specially with high rates of noise. This defect is common to other techniques dedicated to the elimination of impulsive noise. In [1] appears a technique in which substitution in the considered noisy pixels is made and the detection of these noisy pixels is implemented by means of the comparison with certain thresholds. The noisy pixels are replaced by means of a modified median filter, that in that work is called Rank Ordered Mean (ROM) and that does not use the noisy pixel to calculate the median. In this work, we made a similar scheme but the detection and the substitution of noisy pixels is made with SVM. Our method provides excellent results in \"Peak Signal to Noise Ratio\" (PSNR), that measures the reconstruction error, and in visual quality and maintenance of the edges even for very high rates of noise.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "200823940", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18614754", "122708670", "1221898"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116989099"}

Conventional GTL approaches first construct a fixed subject-wise graph based on the similarities of observed features (i.e., extracted from imaging data) in the feature domain, and then follow the established graph to propagate the existing labels from training to testing data in the label domain. However, such a graph is exclusively learned in the feature domain and may not be necessarily optimal in the label domain. This may eventually undermine the classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a progressive GTL (pGTL) method to progressively find an intrinsic data representation. To achieve this, our pGTL method iteratively (1) refines the subject-wise relationships observed in the feature domain using the learned intrinsic data representation in the label domain, (2) updates the intrinsic data representation from the refined subject-wise relationships, and (3) verifies the intrinsic data representation on the training data, in order to guarantee an optimal classification on the new testing data. Furthermore, we extend our pGTL to incorporate multi-modal imaging data, to improve the classification accuracy and robustness as multi-modal imaging data can provide complementary information.

In this paper, we describe a method for gender recognition at a distance based on visual texture analysis of gait energy images (GEIs). These images summarize the structural and dynamical variations of the subject's silhouette during one gait cycle. Texture analysis and feature extraction are based on histogram calculation of fuzzy local binary pattern (FLBP), which describes the relative intensities of each pixel with surrounding neighbors. Unlike the original LBP, each pixel can contribute, with different weights, to more than one bin in the histogram of occurring codes. The classification model uses support vector machines with linear kernel function. The performance of the proposed approach is intensively evaluated and compared with other texture on CASIA B multiview gait database. We also consider the variation of some conditions such as clothing and carried objects.

Many microarray experiments have been designed to investigate the genetic mechanisms of cancer, and analytical approaches have been applied in order to classify different types of cancer or distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue. However, microarrays are high-dimensional datasets with high levels of noise and this causes problems when using machine learning methods. A popular approach to this problem is to search for a set of features that will simplify the structure and to some degree remove the noise from the data. The most widely used approach to feature extraction is principal component analysis (PCA) which assumes a multivariate Gaussian model of the data. More recently, non-linear methods have been investigated. Among these, manifold learning algorithms, for example Isomap, aim to project the data from a higher dimensional space onto a lower dimension one. We have proposed a priori manifold learning for finding a manifold in which a representative set of microarray data is fused with relevant data taken from the KEGG pathway database. Once the manifold has been constructed the raw microarray data is projected onto it and clustering and classification can take place. In contrast to earlier fusion based methods, the prior knowledge from the KEGG databases is not used in, and does not bias the classification process\u2014it merely acts as an aid to find the best space in which to search the data.

For the collection of behavioral data collection, IR signals of AC remote were collected, based on which various AC adjustment behaviors (on\u2013off, set-point temperature) that determines energy use, use rate, and set-point temperature were analyzed. Using the analysis, the AC use behavior was defined as on\u2013off state prediction, and the difference between indoor and outdoor temperature was suggested as the standard for expressing AC use rate. Further, analyzing the duration of AC operation for each set-point temperature revealed that there are differences in AC operation propensities of respective units. Next, the collected data was used to predict and test AC on\u2013off state. Three prediction algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine) were applied, and the results of the cross-validation was evaluated using three criteria: F-measure, Cohen\u2019s Kappa, on\u2013off frequency. Results showed superior prediction performance of Random Forest.

The model is applicable to classification problems with undirected graphs, intractable for standard classification CRFs. The model representation of GCRFBC is extended by latent variables which yield some appealing properties. Thanks to the GCRF latent structure, the model becomes tractable, efficient and open to improvements previously applied to GCRF regression models. In addition, the model allows for reduction of noise, that might appear if structures were defined directly between discrete outputs. Additionally, two different forms of the algorithm are presented: GCRFBCb (GCRGBC - Bayesian) and GCRFBCnb (GCRFBC - non Bayesian). The extended method of local variational approximation of sigmoid function is used for solving empirical Bayes in Bayesian GCRFBCb variant, whereas MAP value of latent variables is the basis for learning and inference in the GCRFBCnb variant. The inference in GCRFBCb is solved by Newton-Cotes formulas for one-dimensional integration. Both models are evaluated on synthetic data and real-world data.

The model was used to predict the status of coastal ecosystems resulting from different management alternatives by the MPA \"Isola di Bergeggi\" to mitigate potential effects of a close commercial harbor. Introduction - The implementation of Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) has the primary aim of developing conservation strategies able to tackle the multiplicity of human pressures, thus maintaining ecosystems integrity along with the services they provide. In this regard, the EU Marine Strategy Directive recommends the implementation of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) that should provide conservation managers with a cartographic decision-support tool for finding efficient solutions (Bianchi, 2008). We developed a spatially-explicit and flexible approach for MSP to assess the relationships between a suite of human pressures and the status of marine coastal ecosystems. Such approach was used to visualize the expected outcomes of alternative management scenarios for an emblematic case study: a coastal zone where the newly established Marine Protected Area \"Isola di Bergeggi\" will have to coexist with the planned extension of a close commercial harbor. Materials and methods - Our approach comprised four main steps: i) GIS (Geographical Information System) mapping of human pressures and their intensities, ii) GIS mapping of marine territory status, iii) modeling of the relationships between human pressures and marine territory status, iv) using the model calibrated in step 3 to build maps of expected marine territory status according to expected or planned variations in human pressures (Fig. 1). The map of the study area was divided into parcels of 250 m 2 and for each parcel the intensity of each human pressure was quantified by expert evaluations and fuzzy decision tools considering two criteria (type of pressures and distance from their source). For each parcel, we then used field data collected for a previous study (Bianchi et al., 2007) to compute an index of marine territory status. This is inspired by the methodology proposed by Bellan et al. (1985) and represents the ecological distance from the historical description of the marine habitats of the Mediterranean Sea (Peres and Picard, 1964). The relationship between human pressures and marine territory status was modeled by means of Random Forest (RF) technique (Cutler et al., 2007). In order to predict the effects of potential management alternatives by the MPA in the environmental context due to the harbor expansion, four scenarios were developed by eliciting experts.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2559314637", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["10054599", "3626971"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55465850"}

The proposed, experienced deep-RL framework can guarantee high end-to-end reliability and low end-to-end latency, under explicit data rate constraints, for each wireless without any models of or assumptions on the users' traffic. In particular, in order to enable the deep-RL framework to account for extreme network conditions and operate in highly reliable systems, a new approach based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed. This GAN approach is used to pre-train the deep-RL framework using a mix of real and synthetic data, thus creating an experienced deep-RL framework that has been exposed to a broad range of network conditions. Formally, the URLLC resource allocation problem is posed as a power minimization problem under reliability, latency, and rate constraints. To solve this problem using experienced deep-RL, first, the rate of each user is determined. Then, these rates are mapped to the resource block and power allocation vectors of the studied wireless system. Finally, the end-to-end reliability and latency of each user are used as feedback to the deep-RL framework. It is then shown that at the fixed-point of the deep-RL algorithm, the reliability and latency of the users are near-optimal. Moreover, for the proposed GAN approach, a theoretical limit for the generator output is analytically derived. Simulation results show how the proposed approach can achieve near-optimal performance within the rate-reliability-latency region, depending on the network and service requirements. The results also show that the proposed experienced deep-RL framework is able to remove the transient training time that makes conventional deep-RL methods unsuitable for URLLC.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.03264", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2986246022", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["198169226", "8834036", "38958784", "67856161", "7942157", "29873442", "19121365", "2600739", "4958405", "54438850", "24155875", "50781788", "52296958", "43934501", "53773702", "4566356", "214411324", "3492538", "9234057", "49183164", "51906056", "47303449", "58004713", "1730595", "205242740", "16326763", "28695052", "30099687", "49558625", "71145024", "173991167", "9856587", "27205073", "9166388", "8229065", "1033682", "49685480"], "inbound_citations": ["214605679"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207847425"}

Extraction of features from the face images during face recognition is a very challenging task. Hence, proper selection of appropriate feature extraction algorithms is vital in this regard. Many robust feature extraction techniques do exist. But their proper selection and combination also plays an utmost role. In this study, 2D face recognition was achieved using the combination of local binary pattern (LBP), principal component analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Along with retaining most of the information, PCA is used to reduce multidimensional data to lower dimensions. LBP was mainly used to tackle the problems arising due to expressions. As the facial expression changes, the effect gets prevalent on the rest of the organs of the face. Similarly, the intensity of the corresponding pixels of images also changes.

To remedy this, we address the problem of blur, noise, and compression robust image generation. Our objective is to learn a non-degraded image generator directly from degraded images without prior knowledge of image degradation. The recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) already provides a solution to the problem of noise degradation. Therefore, we first focus on blur and compression degradations. We propose blur robust GAN (BR-GAN) and compression robust GAN (CR-GAN), which learn a kernel generator and quality factor generator, respectively, with non-degraded image generators. Owing to the irreversible blur and compression characteristics, adjusting their strengths is non-trivial. Therefore, we incorporate switching architectures that can adapt the strengths in a data-driven manner. Based on BR-GAN, NR-GAN, and CR-GAN, we further propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN), which unifies these three models into a single model with additionally introduced adaptive consistency losses that suppress the uncertainty caused by the combination.

The bottleneck of designing the protein representation method is that native proteins have different lengths. Motivated by the success of the pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) proposed by Chou, we applied this approach for protein remote homology detection.

Shade-matching was performed using shade tabs. For the hardware, the typically used intraoral camera was modified to apply the cross-polarization scheme and block the light from outside, which can lead to shade-matching errors. For reliable experiments, a precise robot arm with \u00b10.1 mm position repeatability and a specially designed jig to fix the position of the VITA 3D-master (3D) shade tabs were used. For consistent color performance, color calibration was performed with five standard colors having color values as the mean color values of the five shade tabs of the 3D. By using the SVM algorithm, hyperplanes and support vectors for 3D shade tabs were obtained with a database organized using five developed devices. Subsequently, shade matching was performed by measuring 3D shade tabs, as opposed to real teeth, with three additional devices. On average, more than 90% matching accuracy and a less than 1% failure rate were achieved with all devices for 10 measurements. In addition, we compared the classification algorithm with other classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors, using the leave-pair-out cross-validation method to verify the classification performance of the SVM algorithm. Our proposed scheme can be an optimum solution for the quantitative measurement of tooth color with high accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6165317", "pubmed_id": "30213046", "doi": "10.3390/s18093051", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2891325305", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["20092004", "43669708", "23625567", "14961293", "36191169", "46760676", "44311894", "24023070", "19778728", "25668303", "5884230", "23502933", "39760305", "28280035", "41952040", "205944801", "43746555", "12603905", "26075754", "7006538", "52874011", "20642514", "14281988", "32285718", "20854465", "26037465", "120080101", "31039418", "41400443", "15333637", "22921730", "120775405", "33929365", "23532100", "68679133"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52273863"}

Breast cancer is the second commonest type of cancer in the world, and the commonest among women, corresponding to 22% of the new cases every year. This work presents a new computational methodology, which helps the specialists in the detection of breast masses based on the breast density. The proposed methodology is divided into stages with the objective of overcoming several difficulties associated with the detection of masses. In many of these stages, we brought contributions to the areas. The first stage is intended to detect the type of density of the breast, which can be either dense or non-dense. We proposed an adaptive algorithm capable of analyzing and image and telling if it is dense or non-dense. The first stage consists in the segmentation of the regions that look like masses. We propose a novel use of the micro-genetic algorithm to create a texture proximity mask and select the regions suspect of containing lesions. The next stage is the reduction of false positives, which were generated in the previous stage. To this end, we proposed two new approaches. The first reduction of false positives used DBSCAN and a proximity ranking of the textures extracted from the ROIs. In the second reduction of false positives, the resulting regions have their textures analyzed by the combination of Phylogenetic Trees, Local Binary Patterns and Support Vector Machines (SVM). A micro-genetic algorithm was used to choose the suspect regions that generate the best training models and maximize the classification of masses and non-masses used in the SVM.

A major challenge in VPR is to handle changes of environmental conditions including weather, season and illumination. Most VPR methods try to improve the place recognition performance by ignoring the environmental factors, leading to decreased accuracy decreases when environmental conditions change significantly, such as day versus night. To this end, we propose an end-to-end conditional visual place recognition method. Specifically, we introduce the multi-domain feature learning method (MDFL) to capture multiple attribute-descriptions for a given place, and then use a feature detaching module to separate the environmental condition-related features from those that are not.

The changes caused by ASD are associated with different age- and sex-related patterns in neuroimaging data.

In this paper, we propose a novel sparse multiview task-centralized (Sparse-MVTC) ensemble classification method for image-based ASD diagnosis. Specifically, with the age and sex information of each subject, we formulate the classification as a multitask learning problem, where each task corresponds to learning upon a specific age/sex group. We also extract multiview features per subject to better reveal the FC changes. Then, in Sparse-MVTC learning, we select a certain central task and treat the rest as auxiliary tasks. By considering both task-task and view-view relationships between the central task and each auxiliary task, we can learn better upon the entire dataset. Finally, by selecting the central task, in turn, we are able to derive multiple classifiers for each task/group. An ensemble strategy is further adopted, such that the final diagnosis can be integrated for each subject.

The problem is aggravated for handheld systems by introducing operator motion and by the position uncertainty. Even though aggregating consecutive GPR samples to form multi-sample features seems to be an intuitively sensible approach to improve Pd/Pf, determining multi-sample features that are robust to the operator motion and position uncertainty is a formidable task. In this paper, we propose an ATR method to identify mines based on handheld GPR data collected for regional processing, where systematic operator motion is required and perhaps some position information is collected along with the data. The regional processing is intended to be conducted after other initial detection methods have identified an area for further interrogation. In this study, we will use GPR data that were collected by a robotic arm. In order for the developed ATR method to be applicable to data collected by human operators, which have greater position uncertainty, we focus on features that can still be used either directly or with minor modification when accurate sensor positions are not available.

In the present paper, the application of the Cross Entropy (CE) method to the ICFMO is described. The CE method was initially developed for rare event simulation, and adapted to combinatorial and continuous optimization. Unlike the several metaheuristics biologically or physically inspired that have been applied to the ICFMO, the CE is an algorithm based on statistics and information theory, specifically on the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or cross entropy). Notwithstanding the high level theory underlying the algorithm, its implementation mainly comprises the sampling of candidate solutions at each iteration with an update of parameters for generating the random sample in the next iteration given by the analysis of an elite group within the sample. Thus, it is possible to drive the algorithm to optimal or near optimal solutions iteratively. The CE algorithm was applied to the optimization of the 7th cycle of Angra 1 Nuclear Power Plant, in Brazil.

To overcome the computational complexity, the number of input phasor measurements is reduced by a statistical approach based on class separability and correlation coefficient indices. In the classification stage, support vector machines (SVMs) are used as weak classifiers and a strong classifier is constructed as the linear combination of many weak SVM classifiers.

Word morphology is important in Uyghur part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, POS tagging performance suffers from error propagation of morphological analyzers. To address this problem, we propose a few models for POS tagging: conditional random fields (CRF), long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM networks (BI-LSTM), LSTM networks with a CRF layer, and BI-LSTM networks with a CRF layer. These models do not depend on stemming and word disambiguation for Uyghur and combine hand-crafted features with neural network models.

This can result in models with increased bias towards the majority class (minority-class instances predicted as being in the majority class). Data sampling, a process which changes the dataset through removing or adding instances to improve the class balance, can be used to improve the performance of such models on imbalanced data. However, it is not clear what target balance level should be used with data sampling, and what influence class imbalance alone has on classification performance (compared to other issues such as difficulty of learning from the data and dataset size). To resolve this, we propose the Balance-Aware Subsampling technique, which allows researchers to directly compare different balance levels of a dataset while keeping all other factors (such as dataset size and the actual dataset in question) constant. Thus, any changes in performance can be attributed solely to the chosen balance level. We demonstrate this technique using six datasets from the field of bioinformatics, and we also consider three different subsample sizes (that is, the size of the dataset used for building a model) so we can observe the effect of this parameter on classification performance. Our results show that within each level of class imbalance, the average AUC value increases as the subsample size increases. The key exception is the 20:80 (minority:majority) balance level, for which the average AUC value decreases as the subsample size increases from 80 to 120. We also find that within each subsample size, the average AUC value increases as the minority distribution increases, although this does not completely hold for subsample size 40 (in which case, the Naive Bayes and Random Forest learners show greater performance at the 35:65 balance level than at 50:50), and in general there is not a significant improvement between the 35:65 and 50:50 balance levels.

To detect overeating passively, a machine learning framework was designed to detect and accurately count the number of feeding gestures during an eating episode to characterize each eating episode with a feeding gesture count using a 6-axis inertial wrist-worn sensor. Moreover, detecting feeding gestures is useful to aid in end-of-day dietary recalls. It has been shown that feeding gesture count correlates with caloric intake; the more one eats, the more calories one is likely consuming. Recent research has shown promise in passively detecting feeding gestures, but this effort focuses on bridging detection of feeding gesture count and identifying overeating episodes. This paper presents results on three experiments: highly structured (participants pretending to eat), in-lab structured with confounding activities (participants eating while performing other scripted activities), and unstructured overeating (participants induced to overeat while watching television and eating their favorite foods). Our experiment successfully induced overeating in 50% of the participants, showing a correlation between feeding gesture count and caloric intake in unstructured eating (r=.79, p-value=.007). Results provide an approximate upper bound on feeding gesture classification using exact segmentation techniques, and show improvement when compared to prior sliding window techniques. Results also suggest the importance of stressing the challenge of accurate segmentation over identifying the accurate classification technique in detection of feeding gestures. Since participant-dependent models provide optimal results, a motif-based time-point fusion classification (MTFC) framework is proposed using spectral energy density, K-Spectral Centroid Clustering, symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX), a Random Forest classifier (trained on segmented motifs) and a time-point classifier fusion technique to show reliable classification of feeding gestures (75% F-measure), and a 94% accuracy of feeding gesture count in the unstructured eating experiment, resulting in a root mean square error of 2.9 feeding gestures.

Specifically, a hierarchical face analysis forest is learned to perform classification of pose and expression at the top level, while performing landmark positions regression at the bottom level. On one hand, the estimated pose and expression provide strong shape prior to constrain the variation of landmark positions. On the other hand, more discriminative shape-related features could be extracted from the estimated landmark positions to further improve the predictions of pose and expression. This relatedness of face analysis tasks is iteratively exploited through several cascaded hierarchical face analysis forests until convergence.

However, this line of work is conditioned by the quality of the reconstruction.

It is possible to interpolate around these images obtaining a sequence of new plausible synthetic images that cannot be generated from the latent space.

However, for semi-supervised learning---one of the most recent learning algorithms---this is not as available as in conventional supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, it is assumed that the dataset is given with only a few labeled data points. Therefore, holding out some of labeled data points for validation is not easy. The lack of labeled data points, furthermore, makes it difficult to estimate the degree of noise in the dataset. To circumvent the addressed difficulties, we propose to employ ensemble learning and graph sharpening. The former replaces the hyperparameter selection procedure to an ensemble network of the committee members trained with various values of hyperparameter.

Continuous EEG was registrated during the first 7 days of ICU admission. Patient outcome at 12 months was dichotomized as poor (Extended Glasgow Outcome Score, GOSE 1\u20132) or good (GOSE 3\u20138).

Their way of understanding belief places them in a long tradition of philosophers who conceive of mind and cognition as the same thing, a tradition that includes people as diverse as Descartes, Fodor, Churchland, and virtually all current cognitive scientists and cognitive neuroscientists. An alternative perspective on the nature of belief was championed by Ryle and is currently exemplified by Dennett's neo-instrumentalism.

Beliefs are not discrete inner causal entities.

Recently, studies have attempted to estimate affective movie content with computational features, but results have been mixed, one of the main reasons being a lack of data on perceptual stylistic and aesthetic attributes of film, which would provide a ground truth for the features. The distinctions between energetic and tense arousal as well as perceived and felt affect are also often neglected. In this study, we present a data set of ratings by 73 viewers of 83 stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes for a selection of movie clips containing complete scenes taken from mainstream movies. The affective attributes include the temporal progression of perceived and felt valence and arousal within the clips. The data set is aimed to be used to train algorithms that predict viewer assessments based on low-level computational features. With this data set, we performed a baseline study modeling the relation between a large selection of low-level computational features (i.e., visual, auditory, and temporal) and perceptual stylistic, aesthetic, and affective attributes of movie clips. Two algorithms were compared in a realistic prediction scenario: linear regression and the neural-network-based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Felt and perceived affect as well as stylistic attributes were shown to be equally easy to predict, whereas the prediction of aesthetic attributes failed. The performance of the ELM predictor was overall found to be slightly better than the linear regression.

While most approaches aim for analyzing sustained phonation conditions, the proposed method allows for a clinically adequate analysis of both dynamic as well as sustained phonation paradigms. Materials and methods The analysis procedure is based on a spatio-temporal visualization technique, the phonovibrogram, that facilitates the documentation of the visible laryngeal dynamics. From the phonovibrogram, a low-dimensional set of features is computed using a principle component analysis strategy that quantifies the type of vibration patterns, irregularity, lateral symmetry and synchronicity, as a function of time. Two different test bench data sets are used to validate the approach: ( I ) 150 healthy and pathologic subjects examined during sustained phonation. ( II ) 20 healthy and pathologic subjects that were examined twice: during sustained phonation and a glissando from a low to a higher fundamental frequency. In order to assess the discriminative power of the extracted features, a Support Vector Machine is trained to distinguish between physiologic and pathologic vibrations. The results for sustained phonation sequences are compared to the previous approach. Finally, the classification performance of the stationary analyzing procedure is compared to the transient analysis of the glissando maneuver. Results For the first test bench the proposed procedure outperformed the previous approach (proposed feature set: accuracy: 91.3%, sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 97%, previous approach: accuracy: 89.3%, sensitivity: 76%, specificity: 96%). Comparing the classification performance of the second test bench further corroborates that analyzing transient paradigms provides clear additional diagnostic value (glissando maneuver: accuracy: 90%, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 80%, sustained phonation: accuracy: 75%, sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 70%). Conclusions The incorporation of parameters describing the temporal evolvement of vocal fold vibration clearly improves the automatic identification of pathologic vibration patterns. Furthermore, incorporating a dynamic phonation paradigm provides additional valuable information about the underlying laryngeal dynamics that cannot be derived from sustained conditions. The proposed generalized approach provides a better overall classification performance than the previous approach, and hence constitutes a new advantageous tool for an improved clinical diagnosis of voice disorders.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26597002", "doi": "10.1016/j.artmed.2015.10.002", "venue": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "journal": "Artificial intelligence in medicine", "mag_id": "1828197959", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["1482054", "211077050"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27166483"}

To achieve this primary research goal is to find the smallest set of genes that can ensure high accuracy in classification using supervised machine learning algorithms. The significance of finding the minimum subset is three fold: (a) The computational burden and noise arising from irrelevant genes are much reduced; (b) the cost for cancer testing is reduced significantly as it simplifies the gene expression tests to include only a very small number of genes rather than thousands of genes; (c) it calls for more investigation into the probable biological relationship between these small numbers of genes and cancer development and treatment. Approach: The proposed method involves two steps. In the first step, some important genes are chosen with the help of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ranking scheme. In the second step, the classification capability is tested for all simple combinations of those important genes using a better classifier.

The GNG output is then used in a 3D feature extraction method. We have performed a deep study in which we quantitatively show that the use of GNG improves the 3D feature extraction method. We also show that our method can be applied to any kind of 3D data. The 3D features obtained are used as input in an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-like method to compute the 6DoF movement performed by a mobile robot. A comparison with standard ICP is performed, showing that the use of GNG improves the results. Final results of 3D mapping from the egomotion calculated are also shown.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22386789", "doi": "10.1016/j.neunet.2012.02.014", "venue": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2108646795", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["13852741", "21874346", "7883142", "9140602", "11727421", "36192994", "19332319", "7317620", "5404314", "1203932", "14463066", "36503330", "1446354", "108514003", "7505679", "62220864", "116577525", "6550443", "537330", "3812750", "6254259", "16478741", "852708", "15495694", "9910981", "55920812", "17934019", "38454771", "1578845", "14817019"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13022520"}

To circumvent this problem, we propose a two-stage process which firstly trains a High-to-Low Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to learn how to degrade and downsample high-resolution images requiring, during training, only unpaired high and low-resolution images. Once this is achieved, the output of this network is used to train a Low-to-High GAN for image super-resolution using this time paired low- and high-resolution images. Our main result is that this network can be now used to efectively increase the quality of real-world low-resolution images.

Two key criteria are explicitly considered for the magic closet system. One criterion is to wear properly, e.g., compared to suit pants, it is more decent to wear a cocktail dress for a banquet occasion. The other criterion is to wear aesthetically, e.g., a red T-shirt matches better white pants than green pants. To narrow the semantic gap between the low-level visual features and the high-level occasion categories, we propose to adopt middle-level clothing attributes (e.g., clothing category, color, pattern) as a bridge. More specifically, the clothing attributes are treated as latent variables in our proposed latent Support Vector Machine (SVM) based recommendation model.

A SAN, containing spectral, textural, and shape features, is used to study the Bayesian network structure, in contrast to methods which only use spectral features. The classification results of the proposed SAN-BNC are compared with those of the spectral-based Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), the SAN-based MLC, and the SAN-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) using Guangzhou as a case study.

Traditional approaches generally extract the spatial-temporal representation of the skeleton sequences with well-designed hand-crafted features. In this paper, in order to recognize actions according to the relative motion between the limbs and the trunk, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical RNN for skeleton-based action recognition. We divide human skeleton into five main parts in terms of the human physical structure, and then feed them to five independent subnets for local feature extraction. After the following hierarchical feature fusion and extraction from local to global, dimensions of the final temporal dynamics representations are reduced to the same number of action categories in the corresponding data set through a single-layer perceptron. In addition, the output of the perceptron is temporally accumulated as the input of a softmax layer for classification. Random scale and rotation transformations are employed to improve the robustness during training. We compare with five other deep RNN variants derived from our model in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed network.

Intuitively, translation invariance should be a fundamental requirement for any reasonable image metric, but few metric learning or subspace methods are aware of the TI property when dealing with images. We propose to solve the quadratic metric learning problem in the transform domain based on the result of (1). The solution is guaranteed to be translation invariant. The TI assumption simplifies the optimization problems considerably. Specifically, it reduces the number of optimization parameters from of O(n2) to O(n); it turns the semi-definite constraint on a matrix to a bound constraint on a function; it applies to multi-dimensional data without having to be stacked to vectors. Experimental results show that the TI solutions are generally on par with the non-TI solutions. Specifically, the TI solutions usually favor small sample size and small reduction dimension.

Diversity and volume of samples add to the complexity of the problem. We explore the efficacy of neural network based classification techniques in discriminating between stars and quasars using GALEX and SDSS photometric data. Both sources have compact optical morphology but are very different in nature and are at very different distances. We have used those objects with associated spectroscopic information as our training-set and built neural network and ensemble classifiers that appropriately classify photometric samples without associated spectroscopic labels. Catalogs comprising of samples labelled using our classifiers can be further used in studies of photometric sources.

Both the objective function and the feasible domain are defined within a known rectangular domain. The objective function might be nonconvex, computationally expensive, and without analytic expression. Moreover, the feasible domain boundaries are not explicitly defined, but can be determined via oracle calls (feasible or not) and learned as the algorithm proceeds. To solve this class of optimization problems, the proposed algorithm, in each iteration, approximates the feasible domain boundary by incorporating a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier model as an approximation for the non-computable constraint function, which characterizes the feasible domain. The uncertainty associated with this surrogate is modeled using an artificially-generated uncertainty function built on the framework of Delaunay triangulation.

RC provides an efficient way to train recurrent neural networks by letting the recurrent part of the network (called reservoir) be fixed while only a linear readout output layer is trained. The proposed RC framework builds upon the notion of navigation attractor or behavior that can be embedded in the high-dimensional space of the reservoir after learning. The learning of multiple behaviors is possible because the dynamic robot behavior, consisting of a sensory-motor sequence, can be linearly discriminated in the high-dimensional nonlinear space of the dynamic reservoir. Three learning approaches for navigation behaviors are shown in this paper. The first approach learns multiple behaviors based on the examples of navigation behaviors generated by a supervisor, while the second approach learns goal-directed navigation behaviors based only on rewards.

For nonlinear classification problem, FSVMs can achieve good performance by reducing the effect of outliers. In this paper, a new fuzzy membership function is proposed to Japanese dependency analysis. We train an initial classifier with a small training set.

However, when a database is very large, the methods generate too many rules, which makes domain experts interpret all the rules. Moreover, since rules only shows the relations between attribute-value pairs, it is very difficult to capture the relations between concepts or among induced rules. In order to solve this problem, many kinds of visualization has been introduced. Rough set theory has a technique on conflict analysis with qualitative distance obtained from attributes, which gives graphical relations between class or rules. On the other hand, statistical methods have a graphical model method, which gives graphical relations between attributes by using partial coefficients or other indices. In this paper, we introduce a new approach which combines conflict analysis and graphical modeling. The results show that the combination of these two methods gives the other type of visualization of rules, which gives also a formal mathematical model for rule visualization.\u00a9 (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Thus, a comprehensive contextual understanding of cited references is necessary. For this purpose, numerous techniques have been proposed that tap the power of artificial intelligence models to detect important or incidental (non-important) citations in full text scholarly publications. In this paper, we compare and build upon on four state-of-the-art models that detect important citations using 450 manually annotated citations by experts - randomly selected from 20,527 papers from the Association for Computational Linguistics corpus. Of the total 64 unique features proposed by the four selected state-of-the-art models, the top 29 were chosen using the Extra-Trees classifier. These were then fed it to our supervised machine learning based models: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine. The RF model outperforms existing selected systems by more than 10%, with 89% precision-recall curve.

However, generalization ability of ANN has some limitations, and application of SVM in large scale function approximation problems is limited during optimization. In this paper, least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is proposed to simulate stress-strain relationship of clay. LSSVM is a robust type of SVM, maintains the good features of SVM and also has its own unique advantages. LSSVM offers an effective alternative for mimicking constitutive modeling of clay. The good performance of the LSSVM models is demonstrated by learning and prediction of constitutive relationship of Fujinomori clay under undrained and drained conditions. In the present study, three versions of LSSVM models are built by considering more history points. The results prove that the LSSVM based models are superior to Modified Cam-clay model.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5829/idosi.ije.2015.28.11b.04", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Engineering, Transactions B: Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2288958914", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["120686851", "26176848", "55004705", "110978241", "62153503", "121005637", "122587185", "129795360", "120526466", "110441902", "7138354", "129372847", "207579947", "19196574", "97790357", "93579887", "53795924", "122234735", "131735863"], "inbound_citations": ["139677090", "136224287", "131848877"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124138757"}

Particularly, in this scenario, the feature representations have to be invariant to non-uniform illumination, shape of the nuclei, stage of maturity, change in topology due to rotation, scale and shifting. This paper proposes a new white blood cell feature representation which aims at increasing robustness to those challenges. The proposed feature representation is designed based on L-moments (L-skewness, L-mean, L-scale and L-kurtosis) of the Radon projection of segmented nuclei shape. Coupled with Linear Discriminant Analysis, the proposed feature representation has been shown to be highly effective at encoding the discriminative properties of the white blood cells, and invariant to intra-class cell variations. Support Vector Machine (SVM) based (ones-vs-all) schema and a classification tree are applied to separate the multiple classes of cells. The proposed approach is evaluated for a 10-class problem. It achieves an average classification accuracy of 97.23% and outperforms all other feature representations, including bispectral invariant, local binary pattern, and histogram of oriented gradients using the same classifier on the same dataset. The proposed method is also compared and benchmarked with the other 12 existing techniques for classification of white blood cells into 10 classes over the same datasets and the results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in comparison with other approaches.

However, it has received scarce attention relatively to other applications. The methodologies presented hereby are aimed at event-based analysis of multimedia content, which is achieved from three perspectives, namely (i) event recognition in single images, (ii) event recognition in personal photo collections and (iii) fusion of social media information and satellite imagery for natural disaster detection. A close look at the relevant literature suggests that more attention has been paid to event recognition in single images. Event recognition in personal photo collection has also received a number of interesting solutions. Natural disaster detection in images from social media and satellite imagery, however, is relatively new. As a matter of fact, many issues remain unsolved mostly due to the heterogeneity, multi-modality and the unstructured nature of the data. In this dissertation, such open problems are presented and analyzed. New perspectives and approaches are suggested, alongside a detailed experimental validation and analysis. In details, our contribution is multi-fold. On the one hand, we aim at demonstrating that the fusion of different feature extraction and classification strategies can outperform the single methods by jointly exploiting the learning capabilities of individual deep models. On the other side, we analyze the importance of event-salient objects and local image regions in event recognition. We also present a novel framework for event recognition in personal photo collections. Moreover, we also present our system JORD, and our Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based fusion of social media and satellite images for natural disaster detection.

Nevertheless, these methods usually suffer a decay in performance when input data are highly unbalanced, that is positive examples are significantly less than negatives. This scenario characterizes in particular the most specific classes of the ontology, which are the classes more far from the root classes and that better describe the functions of genes. ::: Methods. To address these items, we propose a regularization of a Hopfield-based cost- sensitive algorithm, COSNet, recently proposed to predict gene functions [5]. This algorithm, although designed to manage the imbalance in labeled data, tends to predict an excessively high proportion of positives when data are particularly unbalanced (that is in particular on most specific classes). By adding a term to the energy function of the network, we are able in modifying the dynamics in order to prevent the number of positives becomes too large. This energy term is minimized when the proportion of positive neurons (current positive rate) resembles the rate of positive labels in the training set (expected positive rate). The higher the difference between current and expected positive rates, the more the penalty to the energy function. We call this regularized version R-COSNet. ::: Results. We tested R-COSNet on the prediction of yeast genes, by using four different data sets and the classes of the FunCat ontology [6]. This ontology is structured in forest of trees, in which each node belong to one of the six levels of specificity. Level 1 refers to the root nodes, level i to nodes at distance i from the root. The considered classes are those with at least 20 positives and are spanned from level 1 to level 5. We compared our methods with a label propagation algorithm, LP-Zhu [2], and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with probabilistic output [4]. ::: In Figure 1 we report the results in terms of F-score averaged across the functional classes belonging to the level 4 and level 5 of the hierarchy. ::: References ::: ::: 1.

With the second order LMDP and the Intersection Kernel Support Vector Machines classifier, the classification accuracies of the severe fatigue are over 90 in the holdout and cross-validation experiments, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method in automatically understanding the driver's conditions towards the human-centric driver fatigue monitoring system.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3233/IFS-151779", "venue": "Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems", "journal": "Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems", "mag_id": "1953733247", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199019196", "52193334"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26813090"}

This paper presents a generic data-driven prognostics framework using the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for the offline training process and the Similarity-Based Interpolation (SBI) for the online prediction process. The RVM is a state-of-the-art technique for statistical regression that provides regression coefficients in the form of probabilistic distribution functions (PDFs). Within the proposed prognostics framework, the system health degradation process can be characterized by two health index systems: Physics Health Index (PHI) and Virtual Health Index (VHI). In the offline training process, the RVM is employed for a supervised statistical learning with system training dataset to build background health knowledge (e.g., a predictive health degradation curve) of system units in a statistical form. With this background knowledge, the SBI is then proposed for predicting and continuously updating the RUL in a statistical manner in the online prediction process.

Software vulnerabilities in these systems become easier than ever to be exploited by cybercriminals. Although fuzz testing is an effective technique to detect memory corruption induced vulnerabilities, it requires in-depth analysis of the typically massive crashes, which impedes the in-time identification and patching of potentially disastrous vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a new approach that can efficiently classify crashes based on their exploitability, which facilitates the human analysts to prioritize the crashes to be examined and hence accelerate the discovery of vulnerabilities. A compact fingerprint for the dynamic execution trace of each crashing input is firstly generated based on n-gram analysis and feature hashing.

Continuous wavelet representation of the signal derivative of the corneal pulse was considered with a complex Gaussian derivative function chosen as mother wavelet.

In addition, the quality of the acoustic environment plays an important role in urban as well as in rural and natural spaces, since it has been proven to affect biodiversity. In this paper, we demonstrate how efficiently assessing soundscape quality can be applied to real recordings from various sites. The evaluation of the qualitative attributes of the soundscape is carried out combining space-sound-human presence. The mapping of the extracted feature statistics to the perceived soundscape quality level is achieved through a Support Vector Machine Regression model. Extensive experiments have been carried out on a real-world dataset and the resulting performance evaluation proves that the proposed architecture can be applied to assess the soundscape quality of both natural and urban spaces.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2769493.2769501", "venue": "PETRA '15", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2007041967", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["107410416", "108002023", "744551", "5543127", "17850486", "17978192", "141185911", "198954356", "60076811", "60401636", "110888768", "109999959", "11175565", "60973856", "2419638", "110486296", "22903852"], "inbound_citations": ["54513279"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12641792"}

While within-task classification accuracies were high for WM tasks (average: 95% - 97 %), cross-task classification performances were not significant over chance level.

This method may be viewed as subspace iteration combined with a model reduction procedure. Specifically, starting with a test solution, the method solves a reduced model to obtain a more precise solution, and it repeats this process until sufficient accuracy is achieved. The reduced model is obtained by projecting the full model onto a subspace that is spanned by the dominant modes of an extended data ensemble. The learning procedure is computed in the online stage, as opposed to being computed offline, which is used in many projection-based model reduction techniques that require prior calculations or experiments. After providing an error bound of the classical POD-Galerkin method in terms of the projection error and the initial condition error, we prove that the sequence of approximate solutions converge to the actual solution of the original system as long as the vector field of the full model is locally Lipschitz on an open set that contains the solution trajectory. Good accuracy of the proposed method has been demonstrated in two numerical examples, from a linear advection-diffusion equation to a nonlinear Burgers equation. In order to save computational cost, the SIRM method is extended to a local model reduction approach by partitioning the entire time domain into several subintervals and obtaining a series of local reduced models of much lower dimensionality. The accuracy and efficiency of the local SIRM are shown through the numerical simulation of the Navier--Stokes equation in a lid-driven cavity flow problem.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": "1210.2975", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1137/130927723", "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Dynamical Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949474597,2034703222", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["122599816", "117896525", "7716718", "18074003", "17658716", "3172267", "2129332", "6983498", "32226277", "118065500", "14161477", "122018220", "122478321", "12155655", "6241853", "15869984", "123212338", "16569477", "121754238", "14390740"], "inbound_citations": ["11014659", "2937121", "119605261", "53699606", "11248642", "67855519", "15104432", "6902320", "5827513"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14511792"}

To overcome these disadvantages, we proposed to automatically learn an adaptive distance metric by a graph based semi-supervised learning model for DTI segmentation. An original discriminative distance vector was first formulated by combining both geometry and orientation distances derived from diffusion tensors. The kernel metric over the original distance and labels of all voxels were then simultaneously optimized in a graph based semi-supervised learning approach. Finally, the optimization task was efficiently solved with an iterative gradient descent method to achieve the optimal solution. With our approach, an adaptive distance metric could be available for each specific segmentation task. Experiments on synthetic and real brain DTI datasets were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed distance metric learning approach. The performance of our approach was compared with three classical metrics in the graph based semi-supervised learning framework.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3961296", "pubmed_id": "24651858", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0092069", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2058757077", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["13610594", "144779781", "14120097", "10900800", "11962942", "951792", "1681108", "34497742", "3083839", "37667456", "7564561", "32724414", "15514260", "20649299", "32129291", "11456110", "2168005", "35131304", "32653308", "11489285", "19333885", "16902217", "14397939", "28391117", "401761", "28009408", "43846694", "61205178", "13393915", "10302744", "277037", "23379600", "31866170", "6501978", "10071378", "37527688", "6786325", "10589121", "7329667", "14994241", "14660088", "508435", "17644249", "14022107", "15589440", "34120297", "25385768", "37091655", "8666953", "9709306", "14446127", "27628978", "223528", "14370883", "26401796", "16788152", "14410985"], "inbound_citations": ["214924188", "1534153", "17873760", "13697153"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12024480"}

Our thesis in this paper is that if a certain family of connectionist hypotheses turn out to be right, they will surely count as revolutionary, even on stringent pre-Kuhnian standards. There is no question that connectionism has already brought about major changes in the way many cognitive scientists conceive of cognition. However, as we see it, what makes certain kinds of connectionist models genuinely revolutionary is the support they lend to a thoroughgoing eliminativism about some of the central posits of common sense (or \u2018folk\u2019) psychology. Our focus in this paper will be on beliefs or propositional memories, though the argument generalizes straightforwardly to all the other propositional attitudes.

The study shows that grassland, cropland, woodland, water area and sandy land changed significantly during this period. The analysis of Land cover/use in the Horqin sandy land reveals two separate specific trends between the first 16 years (1985\u20132000) and the subsequent 17 years (2001\u2013 2017).

Firstly, the roller bearing vibration acceleration signal is decomposed by FEEMD to extract IMFs. Secondly, IMF correntropy matrix (IMFCM) as the fault feature matrix is calculated from the AM-correntropy model of the primary vibration signal and IMFs. Furthermore, depending on LSSVM, the fault identification results of the roller bearing are obtained. Through the bearing identification experiments in stationary rotating conditions, it was verified that IMFCM generates more stable and higher diagnosis accuracy than conventional fault features such as energy moment, fuzzy entropy, and spectral kurtosis. Additionally, it proves that IMFCM has more diagnosis robustness than conventional fault features under cross-mixed roller bearing operating conditions. The diagnosis accuracy was more than 84% for the cross-mixed operating condition, which is much higher than the traditional features.

Previous multi-spectral image acquisition systems were of limited use for endoscopy due to (i) the necessary spatial scanning of push-broom approaches or (ii) the impractical long switching times of liquid crystal tunable filters. Recent technological advances in the field of tuneable filters, in particular fast acousto-optical tunable filters (AOTF), make switching times below 1ms feasible. Thus, AOTFs represent a suitable technology for the acquisition of hyper-spectral image and multi-spectral video data with excellent spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we propose a hyper-spectral imaging endoscope using a fast AOTF synchronized with a highly sensitive EMCCD camera for the detection of cancerous tissue. The setup demonstrates that the acquisition of hyper-spectral image and multi-spectral video data is feasible and enables the augmentation of endoscopic videos with overlays indicating cancerous tissue regions. Using hyper-spectral measurements from biopsies acquired with the setup in a clinical environment it is shown that the spectral characteristic of cancerous regions is tissue dependent. Even a sophisticated classifier such as a Support Vector Machines (SVM) or a Mixture of Gaussian Classifier (MOGC) cannot generalize the discriminative information if the training set contains measurements from different tissue types (e.g. larynx vs. parotid). In contrast, a training data selection scheme that chooses similar training sets for a given test set achieves a better prediction accuracy using an approach based on a Quadratic Discriminant Classifier (QDC) with the important advantage of improved robustness and less liability to overtraining.

In light of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, we propose a hybridisation of symbolic and subsymbolic methods to capitalise on the best features of each. ::: We implement such a hybrid system, called RACHEL, which incorporates techniques from Teleo-Reactive Planning, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Inductive Logic Programming. RACHEL uses a novel behaviour representation, as Reinforcement-Learnt Teleo-operators which define the behaviours in terms of their desired consequences but leave the implementation of the policies to be learnt by reinforcement learning. An RL-TOP is a symbolic description of the purpose of a behaviour, and is used by RACHEL as a planning operator and as the definition of a reward function. ::: Two new hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced, Planned Hierarchical Semi-Markov Q-Learning and Teleo-Reactive Q-Learning. The former is an extension of the Hierarchical Semi-Markov Q-Learning algorithm to use computer generated plans in place of task-hierarchies (which are commonly provided by the trainer). The latter is an elaboration of the algorithm to include more intelligent behaviour termination. The knowledge contained in the plan is used to determine when an executing behaviour is no longer appropriate, resulting in more efficient policies. ::: Incomplete descriptions of the effects of behaviours can lead the planner to make false assumptions in building plans. As behaviours are learnt not implemented, not every effect of actions can be known in advance. RACHEL implements a \u201creflector\u201d which monitors for such unwanted side-effects. Using ILP, it learns to predict when they will occur, and so repair its plans to avoid them. ::: Together, the components of RACHEL form a system which is able to receive will achieve its goals, learn concrete policies and optimal choices of behaviour, discover and predict any unwanted side-effects that result and repair its plans to avoid them.

Setting out from two basic substructures, random walks and trees, we propose a new family of context-dependent random walk graph kernels and a new family of tree pattern graph matching kernels. In our context-dependent graph kernels, context information is incorporated into primary random walk groups. A multiple kernel learning algorithm with a proposed l1,2-norm regularization is applied to combine context-dependent graph kernels of different orders. This improves the similarity measurement between graphs. In our tree-pattern graph matching kernel, a quadratic optimization with a sparse constraint is proposed to select the correctly matched tree-pattern groups. This augments the discriminative power of the tree-pattern graph matching. We apply the proposed kernels to human action recognition, where each action is represented by two graphs which record the spatiotemporal relations between local feature vectors. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kernels for recognizing human actions.

In recent years, a broad array of materials property databases have emerged as part of a digital transformation of materials science. However, recent technological advances in ML are not fully exploited because of the insufficient volume and diversity of materials data. An ML framework called \"transfer learning\" has considerable potential to overcome the problem of limited amounts of materials data. Transfer learning relies on the concept that various property types, such as physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties, are physically interrelated. For a given target property to be predicted from a limited supply of training data, models of related proxy properties are pretrained using sufficient data; these models capture common features relevant to the target task. Repurposing of such machine-acquired features on the target task yields outstanding prediction performance even with exceedingly small data sets, as if highly experienced human experts can make rational inferences even for considerably less experienced tasks. In this study, to facilitate widespread use of transfer learning, we develop a pretrained model library called XenonPy.MDL. In this first release, the library comprises more than 140 000 pretrained models for various properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic crystalline materials. Along with these pretrained models, we describe some outstanding successes of transfer learning in different scenarios such as building models with only dozens of materials data, increasing the ability of extrapolative prediction through a strategic model transfer, and so on.

Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate the the adequacy of these document properties for malware detection and the durability of these features across new malware variants. Our analysis shows that the Random Forests classification method, an ensemble classifier that randomly selects features for each individual classification tree, yields the best detection rates, even on previously unseen malware. Indeed, using multiple datasets containing an aggregate of over 5,000 unique malicious documents and over 100,000 benign ones, our classification rates remain well above 99% while maintaining low false positives of 0.2% or less for different classification parameters and experimental scenarios. Moreover, the classifier has the ability to detect documents crafted for targeted attacks and separate them from broadly distributed malicious PDF documents. Remarkably, we also discovered that by artificially reducing the influence of the top features in the classifier, we can still achieve a high rate of detection in an adversarial setting where the attacker is aware of both the top features utilized in the classifier and our normality model.

However, most correntropy-based models either have too simple descriptions of the correntropy or require too many parameters to adjust in advance, which is likely to cause poor performance since the correntropy fails to reflect the probability distributions of the signals. Therefore, in this paper, a novel correntropy-based extreme learning machine (ELM) called ECC-ELM has been proposed to provide a more robust training strategy based on the newly developed multi-kernel correntropy with the parameters that are generated using cooperative evolution. To achieve an accurate description of the correntropy, the method adopts a cooperative evolution which optimizes the bandwidths by switching delayed particle swarm optimization (SDPSO) and generates the corresponding influence coefficients that minimizes the minimum integrated error (MIE) to adaptively provide the best solution. The simulated experiments and real-world applications show that cooperative evolution can achieve the optimal solution which provides an accurate description on the probability distribution of the current error in the model. Therefore, the multi-kernel correntropy that is built with the optimal solution results in more robustness against the noise and outliers when training the model, which increases the accuracy of the predictions compared with other methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/e21090912", "venue": "Entropy", "journal": "Entropy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2973657001", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["199407782", "201269786", "11423002", "199579838", "195883811", "201250498", "198933209", "199406139", "199022952", "199584571", "199582119", "155502728", "199740177", "197537821", "199657426", "198910403", "206797001", "16062797", "6595865", "109493723", "198930111", "199586982", "198931148", "199658137", "125357052", "20301316", "27197656", "182315181", "108362718", "106407034", "115197083", "69361297", "25696080", "164996039", "145957435", "69947231", "53103508", "70341008", "155909421", "15873697", "6446081", "196622203", "21701330", "3909100", "51610556", "17517752", "41622042", "2891159", "15037168", "206757279", "1417306", "53608180", "115676093", "16272269", "13669437", "7461219", "59849738"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204206445"}

We are often able to use multitemporal, hyperspectral, and/or full polarization of microwave radar images. In addition, it has become the general consensus that texture analysis plays an important role in remote sensing. It has been found in several publications that texture analysis was applied to each layer separately; however, this procedure requires a significant amount of computation and produces a massive volume of data. One alternative, and perhaps a better procedure, is to arrange the images into a multi-layered structure and perform texture analysis within some sort of three-dimensional domain. This manuscript extends the concepts of the gray level of co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analysis applied for a single image to a multi-layered set of images, referred to in this paper as 3DGLCM. We then presented an interpretation of the 3DGLCM within the context of building damage identification. A set of 3DGLCM-based features were computed and evaluated as well. As a result, it was observed that some texture features have certain similarities with other methods proposed in previous studies, whereas other features have not been used before. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in learning and detecting collapsed buildings using 3DGLCM-based features. Thus, the empirical evaluation focuses on the identification of collapsed buildings caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, where individual polarized TerraSAR-X intensity images are used to compute the texture features, and the collapsed buildings caused by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, where LIDAR-based digital surface models are used to compute the texture features. Extensive datasets consisting of building damage states that have been visually inspected by local authorities and research teams are used to set up the training and testing subsets. Furthermore, the proposed texture features are compared with features commonly used to identify collapsed buildings. The study concludes that an SVM trained with 3DGLCM-based features identifies collapsed buildings with high accuracy and outperforms an SVM trained with common features used in previous studies.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.01.008", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2909779496", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211097186", "210843034", "207909990", "204701048", "211211753"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128334073"}

The time sequences are obtained from Turbo Propulsion Engines in their nominal conditions and two faulty conditions. Typically there is paucity of faulty exemplars and the challenge is to come up with algorithms which work reasonably well under such circumstances. Also, normalization of data plays a significant role in determining the performance of the classifiers used for FDD in terms of their detection rate and false positives. In particular spherical normalization has been explored considering the advantage of its superior normalization properties. Given sparse training data how well each of these algorithms performs is shown by means of tests performed on time series data collected at normal and faulty modes from a turbofan gas turbine propulsion engine and the results are presented.Copyright \u00a9 2007 by ASME", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/GT2007-27843", "venue": "Volume 1: Turbo Expo 2007", "journal": "Volume 1: Turbo Expo 2007", "mag_id": "2027545995", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108640400"}

In neuroscience, it has been confirmed that a single neuron can adaptively change its intrinsic excitability to fit various synaptic inputs. This mechanism is called intrinsic plasticity (IP) mechanism in the literature. This adaptive adjustment of neuronal response to external inputs is believed to maximize input-output mutual information. Meanwhile, the existence of multi-clustered structure with small-world-like property in the brain has been strongly supported by many neurophysiological experiments. Thus, it is advisable to consider both the intrinsic plasticity and multi-clustered structure of a reservoir network, rather than a random network with a non-adaptive reservoir response. In this paper, reservoir models with neuronal intrinsic plasticity and multi-clustered structure are investigated. The effects of two types of IP rules on the performance of several computational tasks have been investigated in detail by combining neuronal IP with multi-clustered reservoir structures. The first type is the Triesch\u2019s IP rule, which drives the output activities of neurons to approximate exponential distributions; another is the Li\u2019s IP rule, which generates a Gaussian distribution of neuronal firing. Results show that both the multi-clustered structures and IP rules can improve the computational accuracy of reservoir computing. However, before the application of the IP rules, the enhancement of computational performance for multi-clustered reservoirs is minor. Both IP rules contribute to improvement of the computational performance, where the Li\u2019s IP rule is more advantageous than the Triesch\u2019s IP. The results indicate that the combination of multi-clustered reservoir structures and IP learning can increase the dynamic diversity of reservoir states, especially for the IP\u2019s learning. The adaptive tuning of reservoir states based on IP improves the dynamic complexity of neuronal activity, which helps train output weights. This biologically inspired reservoir model may give insights for the optimization of reservoir computing.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-017-9467-3", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2610941829", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2184251", "14740600", "7420805", "16142613", "10240863", "9160177", "38579718", "15744481", "24910191", "41841515", "121219449", "19617244", "7910932", "43839409", "7910932", "120236233", "41841515", "215204158", "14535839", "10246742", "933530", "9953398", "13940550", "39792267", "15141924", "15424085", "2717936", "40426301", "6772438"], "inbound_citations": ["49655645"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22454205"}

Secondly, two structures based on the multi-grained scanning to transform the raw features into high-dimensional feature vectors and integrate the diverse data were proposed in our study. Thirdly, the original deep and time-consuming architecture of cascade forest was improved by a feature optimization operation, which emphasized the most discriminative features across layers.

A reasonably parsimonious model used eight predictors to describe aspen's climate profile. Classification errors averaged 4.5%, most of which were errors of commission. The model was driven primarily by three variables: an annual dryness index, the ratio of summer to annual precipitation, and an interaction of growing season precipitation with the summer\u2013winter temperature differential. Projecting the contemporary climate profile into the future climate provided by three General Circulation Models and two scenarios (SRES A2 and either B1 or B2) suggested that the area occupied by the profile should diminish rapidly over the course of the century, 6\u201341% by the decade surrounding 2030, 40\u201375% for that surrounding 2060, and 46\u201394% for 2090. The relevance of the climate profile to understanding climate-based responses is illustrated by relating trends in climate to the recent incidence of sudden aspen dieback that has plagued portions of the aspen distribution.

Whereas, malignant melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly type of skin cancer, and its incidence has been quickly increasing over the last years. The detection of the malignant melanoma in its early stages with dermoscopic images reduces the mortality considerably, hence this a crucial issue for the dermatologists. However, their interpretation is time consuming and subjective, even for trained dermatologists. The current computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are mainly noninteractive in nature and their prediction represents just a cue for the dermatologist, as the final decision regarding the likelihood of the presence of a melanoma is left exclusively to him/her. Recently, developing CAD schemes that use image retrieval approach to search for the clinically relevant and visually similar lesions has been attracting research interest. Although preliminary studies have suggested that using retrieval might improve dermatologists' performance and/or increase their confidence in the decision making, this technology is still in the early development stage with lack of benchmark evaluation in ground-truth datasets to compare retrieval effectiveness. A CAD system based on both classification and retrieval would be more effective and robust. This work is focusing on by addressing the various issues related to the development of such an integrated and interactive CAD system by performing automatic lesion segmentation with an adaptive thresholding and region growing approach, extracting invariant features from lesions and classifying and retrieving those using Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and a similarity fusion approach.

As society becomes increasingly reliant on electricity, the rapid and effective monitoring of power line safety is critical. In particular, accurately knowing the current geometric and thermal status of power lines and identifying possible encroachments is the most important task in the power line risk management process. To facilitate this task, the correct identification of key objects comprising a power line corridor scene from remotely sensed data is the first important step. In recent years, airborne lidar has been successfully adopted as a cost-effective and accurate data source for mapping the power line corridors. However, in today's practice, the classification of power line objects using lidar data still relies on labor-intensive data manipulation, and its automation is urgently required. To address this problem, this paper proposes a point-based supervised classification method, which enables the identification of five utility corridor objects (wires, pylons, vegetation, buildings, and low objects) using airborne lidar data. A total of 21 features were investigated to illustrate the horizontal and vertical properties of power line objects. A non-parametric discriminative classifier, Random Forests model, was trained with refined features to label raw laser point clouds. The proposed classifier showed 91.04 percent sample-weighted and 90.07 percent class-weighted classification accuracy, which indicates it could be highly valuable for large-scale, rapid compilations of corridor maps. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed classifier suggested that when compared, training with class-balanced samples improves classification performance over training with unbalanced samples, particularly with corridor objects such as wires and pylons.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14358/pers.79.9.821", "venue": null, "journal": "Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2334845011", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["133256142", "134131123", "53667290", "58962173", "25555946", "53612895", "31603451", "2678364", "58675315", "195488788", "54996890", "71151368", "53019834", "69306362"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131004996"}

Simulations suggest that the integration of distributional, phonological, and prosodic cues can promote better, faster and more uniform learning of syntactic structure in simple recurrent networks (SRN\u2019s) Recent studies have shown that similar results can be obtained with sensorimotor cues (Howell, Jankowicz & Becker, 2005). The addition of semantic cues like hard, soft, sweet, indoor, in-kitchen, does-fly, pleasant, and man-made, can promote syntactic learning in SRN\u2019s. These categories are very abstract and must to some degree be learned prior to syntactic learning for the argument to work. And thus the methodology faces another type of bootstrapping problem. A possible way to overcome this problem is to go to the source itself: the raw input from our surrounding sensorimotor world, and explore radically unsupervised language learning based on recordings of co- occurring language and sensorimotor data. One rich source of such data is vision. The problem of using vision is that it has its own bootstrapping problems in the dichotomy of object and scene. This problem can be solved in various ways. One way is to relax this dichotomy and not make a strict structural analysis of the scene, but just look at the \u201cgist\u201d of a scene. The gist can then in turn give probabilistic information about scene and object: If the gist is forest-like we might be seeing a tree and if it is tree-like we might be seeing a forest (Torralba, Murphy, Freeman & Rubin, 2003). For a language learning task the gist of a scene might be enough. Children probably don\u2019t need full object recognition to learn language. They will use any kind of statistics they can get from the outside world. Method The gist cues for the present simulation are 3430 feature vectors of length 80, extracted with the steerable pyramid method from a set of real world images from 20 different scenes collected with a head mounted webcam (available on cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Vision/placeRecognition.html) Three SRN\u2019s were trained on 4000 random sentences on a grammar similar to Christiansen & Dale\u2019s (2001), but with only 19 tokens since the number of scenes is only 20. The first network has an input layer consisting of a localist representation of a word (19 nodes) and a visual gist (80 nodes) and a hidden layer consisting of 160 nodes and an output layer with the next word to be predicted. To each input word we attach a random gist belonging to that word\u2019s scene type. The second (control) network has a random gist from any scene type and the third (control) network has no gists at all and is just the pure language learning task. Results On each network 100 simulations with 100 epochs each were run with new random word/scene couplings every time and the networks were tested on a 1000 novel word/scene couplings. The gist network performed significantly better (p<.001, t-test on MSE on the last 20 epochs) than the two control networks with an MSE of .03 on the training sentences and .04 on novel sentences. The random gist control performed at.06/.1 and the small no-gist network at The coupling of words and gists are admittedly a bit arbitrary and the experiment assumes that the visual system can provide word-sized gists from full complex scenes and relate these directly to words. In the future we would like to make more complex simulations that directly relate whole scenes to whole sentences, if we can find such data. But we find that the current simulations demonstrate that it might be possible to pursue the direction set out by Howell, Jankowicz & Becker (2005) in a more data-driven fashion, using data directly from our sensorimotor world rather than abstract representations.

The objective of this paper was to define the best machine learning algorithm that is able to classify the incidence CBN as a function of Landsat 8 OLI images in different atmospheric correction methods. Landsat 8 OLI images were acquired at the dates closest to sampling anthracnose field data at three times corresponding to grain filling period and were submitted to atmospheric corrections by DOS, ATCOR, and 6SV methods. The images classified by the algorithms of machine learning, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron and Naive Bayes were tested 30 times in random sampling. Given the overall accuracy of each test, the algorithms were evaluated using the Friedman and Nemenyi tests to identify the statistical difference in the treatments. The obtained results indicated that the overall accuracy and the balanced accuracy index were on an average around 0.55 and 0.45, respectively, for the Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms in the ATCOR atmospheric correction. According to the Friedman and Nemenyi tests, both algorithms were defined as the best classifiers.

The common lesion analysis tasks like segmentation and classification are mainly based on supervised learning with well-paired image-level or voxel-level labels. However, labeling the lesion in medical images is laborious requiring highly specialized knowledge. Inspired by the fact that radiologists make diagnoses based on expert knowledge on \"healthiness\" and \"unhealthiness\" developed from extensive experience, we propose an medical image synthesis model named abnormal-to-normal translation generative adversarial network (ANT-GAN) to predict a normal-looking medical image based on its abnormal-looking counterpart without the need of paired data for training. Unlike typical GANs, whose aim is to generate realistic samples with variations, our more restrictive model aims at producing the underlying normal-looking image corresponding to an image containing lesions, and thus requires a specialized design. With an ability to segment normal from abnormal tissue, our model is able to generate a highly realistic lesion-free medical image based on its true lesion-containing counterpart. Being able to provide a \"normal\" version of a medical image (possibly the same image if there is no illness) is not only an intriguing topic, but also can serve as a pre-processing and provide useful side information for medical imaging tasks like lesion segmentation or classification validated by our experiments.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1810.10850", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2898116875", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["20833368", "3697707", "3699622", "51989956", "3429309", "5022170", "1033682", "206594692", "6758477", "6200260", "980236", "211227", "9494752", "2088679", "10627900", "1739295", "16628328", "3719281", "17427022", "50786007", "14124313", "19151693", "11187747", "41805341", "4811901", "1082740", "29157946", "3597027", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["58981955", "67788816"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53032488"}

For such studies, the first step is to acquire 3D point clouds of urban form such as by airborne lidar sensors. There is a technical question in respect of pixel and object based building classification approaches on time series lidar data as to which approach is more appropriate for comparing volumetric indicators of 3D urban development sustainability over time. This paper aims to answer this question by comparing the results of building classification of bi-temporal airborne lidar datasets using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm and an object-based classification tool in ERDAS software. The results show that the omission errors for classified building points are not similar for the same buildings in the bi-temporal lidar data sets. This inconsistency affects the measurement of volumetric descriptors of 3D urban form over time. Therefore, two change detection methods of image differencing and SVM are also evaluated. While the level of noise in the SVM change detection results is lower than occurring in results derived by image differencing, the magnitude of change cannot be determined using SVM. Therefore, we conclude that a combination of change detection methods is preferred for spatio-temporal urban analyses.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.308", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2626141992", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["24630782", "9299147", "132791917", "110098226", "23544307", "32284283", "14082033", "119897915", "129787412", "2357415", "32215408", "129558405", "123380001", "129780613", "15798997", "14283205", "16308066", "53375648", "17240833", "18451813", "46046451"], "inbound_citations": ["191149425", "86602277", "202102242", "116425779", "128362984", "195355987"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7984379"}

A Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) with two layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machine is the generative model that is used to generate stochastic features and input weights for the discriminative model. A discriminative Functional Link Network (FLN) uses these features to approximate the nonlinear relationship between a set of features and their classes. FLN has three layers, namely, the input layer, the enhancement layer and the output layer. In a DBFLN, the features generated at the two hidden layers of the DBM act as the input features and the enhancement layer responses of the FLN. The output weights of the FLN are then estimated as a solution to a linear programming problem through pseudo-inverse. We first evaluate the performance of the DBFLN on three benchmark multi-category classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository, namely, the image segmentation problem, the vehicle classification problem and the glass identification problem. Performance study results on the benchmark classification problems show that DBFLN is an efficient classifier. We then use the DBFLN to classify the images in the TID2013 data set, based on their depth of distortions. The TID2013 data set comprises of 25 images, each with 5 levels of 24 distortion types. In all, the data set has 3000 images, which can be classified based on the depth of distortion. Thus, the IQA classification problem is defined as classifying the distorted images into one of the 5 classes (depending on the depth of distortion) using human visual image metrics as the input features. The performance of the DBFLN in classifying the image quality is compared with those of Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machines, Random Vector Functional Link Network, and Deep Belief Network.

{"paper_id": "65062257", "title": "Breast Cancer Analysis in DCE-MRI", "authors": [{"first": "Gabriele", "middle": [], "last": "Piantadosi", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common women tumour worldwide, about 2 million new cases diagnosed each year (second most common cancer overall). This disease represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women. Early detection of breast cancer is one of the key factors in determining the prognosis for women with malignant tumours. The standard diagnostic tool for the detection of breast cancer is x-ray mammography. The disadvantage of this method is its low specificity, especially in the case of radiographically dense breast tissue (young or under-forty women), or in the presence of scars and implants within the breast. ::: ::: Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) has demonstrated a great potential in the screening of high-risk women for breast cancer, in staging newly diagnosed patients and in assessing therapy effects. ::: ::: However, due to the large amount of information, DCE-MRI manual examination is error prone and can hardly be inspected without the use of a Computer-Aided Detection and Diagnosis (CAD) system. Breast imaging analysis is made harder by the dynamical characteristics of soft tissues since any patient movements (such as involuntary due to breathing) may affect the voxel-by-voxel dynamical analysis. ::: ::: Breast DCE-MRI computer-aided analysis needs a pre-processing stage to identify breast parenchyma and reduce motion artefacts. Among the major issues in developing CAD for breast DCE-MRI, there is the detection and classification of lesions according to their aggressiveness. Moreover, it would be convenient to determine those subjects who are likely to not respond to the treatment so that a modification may be applied as soon as possible, relieving them from potentially unnecessary or toxic treatments. ::: ::: In this thesis, an automated CAD system is presented. The proposed CAD aims to support radiologist in lesion detection, diagnosis and therapy assessment after a suitable preprocessing stage. ::: ::: Segmentation of breast parenchyma has been addressed relying on fuzzy binary clustering, breast anatomical priors and morphological refinements. The breast mask extraction module combines three 2D Fuzzy C-Means clustering (executed from the three projection, axial, coronal and transversal) and geometrical breast anatomy characterization. In particular, seven well-defined key-points have been considered in order to accurately segment breast parenchyma from air and chest-wall. ::: ::: To diminish the effects of involuntary movement artefacts, it is usual to apply a motion correction of the DCE-MRI volumes before of any data analysis. However, there is no evidence that a single Motion Correction Technique (MCT) can handle different deformations - small or large, rigid or non-rigid - and different patients or tissues. Therefore, it would be useful to develop a quality index (QI) to evaluate the performance of different MCTs. The existent QI might not be adequate to deal with DCE-MRI data because of the intensity variation due to contrast media. Therefore, in developing a novel QI, the underlying idea is that once DCE-MRI data have been realigned using a specific MCT, the dynamic course of the signal intensity should be as close as possible to physiological models, such as the currently accepted ones (e.g. Tofts-Kermode, Extended Tofts-Kermode, Hayton-Brady, Gamma Capillary Transit Time, etc.). The motion correction module ranks all the MCTs, using the QI, selects the best MCT and applies a correction before of further data analysis. ::: ::: The proposed lesion detection module performs the segmentation of lesions in Regions of Interest (ROIs) by means of classification at a pixel level. It is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained with dynamic features, extracted from a suitably pre-selected area by using a pixel-based approach. The pre-selection mask strongly improves the final result. ::: ::: The lesion classification module evaluates the malignity of each ROI by means of 3D textural features. The Local Binary Patterns descriptor has been used in the Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) configuration. A Random Forest has been used to achieve the final classification into a benignant or malignant lesion. ::: ::: The therapy assessment stage aims to predict the patient primary tumour recurrence to support the physician in the evaluation of the therapy effects and benefits. For each patient which has at least a malignant lesion, the recurrence of the disease has been evaluated by means of a multiple classifiers system. A set of dynamic, textural, clinicopathologic and pharmacokinetic features have been used to assess the probability of recurrence for the lesions. ::: ::: Finally, to improve the usability of the proposed work, we developed a framework for tele-medicine that allows advanced medical image remote analysis in a secure and versatile client-server environment, at a low cost. The benefits of using the proposed framework will be presented in a real-case scenario where OsiriX, a wide-spread medical image analysis software, is allowed to perform advanced remote image processing in a simple manner over a secure channel. ::: ::: The proposed CAD system have been tested on real breast DCE-MRI data for the available protocols. The breast mask extraction stage shows a median segmentation accuracy and Dice similarity index of 98% (+/-0,49) and 93% %(+/-1,48) respectively and 100% of neoplastic lesion coverage. The motion correction module is able to rank the MCTs with an accordance of 74% with a 'reference ranking'. Moreover, by only using 40% of the available volume, the computational load is reduced selecting always the best MCT. The automatic detection maximises the area of correctly detected lesions while minimising the number of false alarms with an accuracy of 99% and the lesions are, then, diagnosed according to their stage with an accuracy of 85%. The therapy assessment module provides a forecasting of the tumour recurrence with an accuracy of 78% and an AUC of 79%. Each module has been evaluated by a leave-one-patient-out approach, and results show a confidence level of 95% (p<0.05). ::: ::: Finally, the proposed remote architecture showed a very low transmission overhead which settles on about 2.5% for the widespread 10\\100 Mbps.

The results show that: the forecast and actual value are comfortably approximate, and can well indicate the trends of e-commerce sales forecast; the error between forecast and actual value from this method is smaller than the forecast error from common least square support vector machine method and BP neural network method.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIC.2009.127", "venue": "2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science", "journal": "2009 Second International Conference on Information and Computing Science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2113722222", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207579947", "10373909", "14607075", "195682242", "18693026", "14162001"], "inbound_citations": ["10775439", "14207170", "33467330"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42595538"}

However, neural networks-based approaches normally require a large amount of manual annotations for optimising the massive amount of network parameters.

At the end of the CPEC, the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea is being built quickly, providing an important economical route for the flow of Central Asia\u2019s natural resources to the world. Gwadar city is in a rapid urbanization process and will be developed as a modern, world-class port city in the near future. Therefore, monitoring the urbanization process of Gwadar at both high spatial and temporal resolution is vital for its urban planning, city ecosystem management, and the sustainable development of CPEC. The impervious surface percentage (ISP) is an essential quantitative indicator for the assessment of urban development. Through the integration of remote sensing images and ISP estimation models, ISP can be routinely and periodically estimated. However, due to clouds\u2019 influence and spatial\u2013temporal resolution trade-offs in sensor design, it is difficult to estimate the ISP with both high spatial resolution and dense temporal frequency from only one satellite sensor. In recent years, China has launched a series of Earth resource satellites, such as the HJ (Huangjing, which means environment in Chinese)-1A/B constellation, showing great application potential for rapid Earth surface mapping. This study employs the Random Forest (RF) method for a long-term and fine-scale ISP estimation and analysis of the city of Gwadar, based on the density in temporal and multi-source Chinese satellite images. In the method, high spatial resolution ISP reference data partially covering Gwadar city was first extracted from the 1\u20132 meter (m) GF (GaoFen, which means high spatial resolution in Chinese)-1/2 fused images. An RF retrieval model was then built based on the training samples extracted from ISP reference data and multi-temporal 30-m HJ-1A/B satellite images. Lastly, the model was used to generate the 30-m time series ISP from 2009 to 2017 for the whole city area based on the HJ-1A/B images. Results showed that the mean absolute error of the estimated ISP was 6.1\u20138.1% and that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimation results was 12.82\u201315.03%, indicating the consistently high performance of the model.

Uniformly randomly selecting a relation or heuristically selecting the highest score among all incorrect relations are two common methods for generating a negative class in the ranking loss function. However, the majority of the generated negative class can be easily discriminated from positive class and will contribute little towards the training. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we use a neural network as the negative class generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as the discriminator in GANs. Through the alternating optimization of generator and discriminator, the generator is learning to produce more and more discriminable negative classes and the discriminator has to become better as well. This framework is independent of the concrete form of generator and discriminator.

The interpretation of the produced forecast is discussed, and the quality of the model is validated using observations and avalanche bulletins of the recent years.

Hence, we present DiP-SVM, a distribution preserving kernel support vector machine where the first and second order statistics of the entire dataset are retained in each of the partitions.

Many intelligent systems, such as assistive robots, augmented reality trainers or unmanned vehicles, need to know their physical location in the environment in order to fulfill their task. While relying exclusively on natural landmarks for that task is the preferred option, their use is somewhat limited because the proposed methods are complex, require high computational power, and are not reliable in all environments. On the other hand, artificial landmarks can be placed in order to alleviate these problems. In particular, square fiducial markers are one of the most popular tools for camera pose estimation due to their high performance and precision. However, the state-of-the-art methods still perform poorly under difficult image conditions, such as camera defocus, motion blur, small scale or non-uniform lighting.This paper proposes a method to robustly detect this type of landmarks under challenging image conditions present in realistic scenarios. To do so, we re-define the marker identification problem as a classification one based on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Second, we propose a procedure to create a training dataset of synthetically generated images affected by several challenging transformations. Third, we show that, in this problem, a classifier can be trained using exclusively synthetic data, performing well in real and challenging conditions.

Relatively little is known about how to best manage wheat in these unique environments. Research is thus needed to identify \u2018best-bet\u2019 entry points to optimize productivity, but classical parametric analyses offer limited applicability to elucidate the relative importance of the multiple factors and interactions that influence yield under such conditions. This problem is most evident in datasets derived from farmer-participatory research, where missing values and skewed data are common. This paper examines the predictive power of three non-parametric approaches, including linear mixed effects models (LMMs), and two binary recursive partitioning methods: classification and regression trees (CARTs) and Random Forests. We collected yield, crop management, and environmental observations from 422 wheat fields in the 2012\u201313 season, across six production environments spanning southern Bangladesh, where nutrient rates and genotypes were imposed, but management of other production factors varied from farmer to farmer. Fields were grouped into categories including early- and late-sowing, depending on crop establishment before or after December 15, respectively, and in combination, across both early- and late-sowing groups. For each of these groups, we investigated how each non-parametric analysis predicted the factors influencing yield. All three approaches identified nitrogen rate and environment as the most important factors, regardless of sowing category. CART also identified assemblages of high- and low-yielding environments, although those located in saline and warmer thermal zones were not necessarily the lowest yielding, indicating that farmers can optimize crop management to overcome these constraints. The number of days farmers sowed wheat before or after December 15, days to maturity, and the number of irrigations and weedings also influenced yield, though each method weighted these factors differently. LMMs also indicated a slight yield advantage when farmers used stress-tolerant genotypes, though CART and Random Forests did not. One-to-one plots for observed vs. predicted yields from LMMs and Random Forests showed better performance by the former than the latter, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute error for the combined, early- and late-sowing groups, respectively. While the LMMs were superior in this case, Random Forests may still prove useful in the classification and interpretation of farm survey data in which no treatment interventions have been administered.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.agsy.2015.05.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural Systems", "mag_id": "1903041551", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214856374", "158479511", "304207", "21905933", "87795414", "25684406", "125421266", "211476207"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:153812118"}

During their gated radiation treatment,fluoroscopy videos were collected with the same audio coaching. A radiation oncologist delineated the contours including the GTV in the 50% phase 4DCT. The methodology is divided into three steps. First an object\u2010constrained registration has been used to register 4DCT at other phases to the reference 50% phase in order to build a spatial\u2010temporal tumor motion model. Then the 4D motion model has been used as the constraint in the spatial registration and temporal matching of the 4DCT with the fluoroscopy. An Isomap based manifold learning has been used to establish a global matching scheme between the 4DCT phases and fluoroscopy frames. In the last step, the GTV in newly acquired fluoroscopy frames were monitored in real time based on the fast registration between the frame and the DRR of the corresponding 4DCT phase using the global constraint and local image information.Results: The registration between 4DCT phases is within 30 minutes. The 4DCT to fluoroscopy registration and tumor motion monitoring are close to real time. After registration and training, for all 6 patients, the tumor (GTV) in an arbitrary fluoroscopy frame can be tracked with motion error less than 2mm, based on comparison between manually delineated contours in the fluoroscopy and the deformed GTV. Conclusion: The proposed tumor monitoring approach can achieve real time efficiency as well as satisfactory accuracy and precision and has the potential to be used in IGRT to improve setup and tumor tracking accuracy to achieve desired dose coverage.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1118/1.3468022", "venue": null, "journal": "Medical Physics", "mag_id": "2048176126", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121213648"}

Previous studies developed the DSMART algorithm (\u201cDisaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees\u201d) for this purpose. In this study, we tested the sensitivity of DSMART towards the input data by using two different conventional soil maps covering Denmark at scales of 1:1,000,000 and 1:2,000,000. As a potential way to improve the algorithm, we tested an implementation of soil-landscape relationships, using maps of wetlands and soil texture. We also tested two different sampling schemes, generating either a set number of virtual samples per polygon in the input map or a number of virtual samples in proportion to the areas of the polygons. Thirdly, we tested the replacement of the resampling procedure and decision tree model with Random Forest. The original procedure repeated the generation of the virtual samples 50 times, fitting a decision tree in each repetition. We modified it by sampling only once and fitting a Random Forest model. The area-proportional sampling scheme and soil-landscape relationships both improved the accuracy. Random Forest yielded a lower accuracy than the original resampling and decision tree procedure, but was far more computationally efficient. The accuracy also depended strongly on the input maps. In the best case, the algorithm predicted soil types with 18% accuracy and soil groups with 47% accuracy. The results demonstrated that there are several ways to improve the disaggregation of conventional soil maps, and that a suitable approach can provide reliable soil maps at a national extent.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.01.038", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2914042770", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["128885677", "140667116", "113667338", "56035865", "1088806", "89141", "128582335", "16235599", "59409269", "130600195", "54918517", "132673794", "140655150", "140623559", "129158741", "132862616", "3900171", "140550116", "128760105", "134229357", "31323730", "129978305", "3496845", "5262555", "132304241", "129515912", "787741", "33232276", "132576063", "61987452"], "inbound_citations": ["201036823", "164994126", "208260913"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134302737"}

{"paper_id": "739346", "title": "A Framework for Productive, Efficient and Portable Parallel Computing", "authors": [{"first": "Ekaterina", "middle": [], "last": "Gonina", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Author(s): Gonina, Ekaterina | Advisor(s): Keutzer, Kurt | Abstract: Developing efficient parallel implementations and fully utilizing the available resources of parallel platforms is now required for software applications to scale to new generations of processors. Yet, parallel programming remains challeng- ing to programmers due to the requisite low-level knowledge of the underlying hardware and parallel computing constructs. Developing applications that effec- tively utilize parallel hardware is restricted by poor programmer productivity, low-level implementation requirements, and limited portability of the application code. These restrictions in turn impede experimentation with various algorithmic approaches for a given application. Currently, the programming world is divided into two types of programmers: application writers who focus on designing and prototyping applications and algorithms, and efficiency programmers who focus on extracting performance for particular compute kernels. The gap between these two types of programmers is referred to as \"the implementation gap\".In this dissertation, we present a software environment that aims to bridge the implementation gap and enable application writers to productively utilize parallel hardware by reusing the work of efficiency programmers. Specifically, we present PyCASP, a Python-based software framework that automatically maps Python application code to a variety of parallel platforms. PyCASP is an application- domain-specific framework that uses a systematic, pattern-oriented approach to offer a single productive software development environment for application writ- ers. PyCASP targets audio content analysis applications, but our methodology is designed to be applicable to any application domain. Using PyCASP, appli- cations can be prototyped in Python code and our environment enables them to automatically scale their performance to modern parallel processors such as GPUs, multicore CPUs and compute clusters. We use the Selective Embedded JIT Specialization (SEJITS) mechanism to realize the pattern-based design of PyCASP in software. We use SEJITS to implement PyCASP's components and to enable automatic parallelization of specific audio content analysis application patterns on a variety of parallel hardware. By focusing on one application domain, we enable efficient composition of computations using three structural patterns: MapReduce, Iterator and Pipe-and-Filter.To illustrate our approach, we study a set of four example audio content anal- ysis applications that are architected and implemented using PyCASP: a speaker verification system, a speaker diarization system, a music recommendation sys- tem and a video event detection system. We describe the detailed implementa- tion of two computational components of PyCASP: a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) component and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) component and their use in implementing the example applications. We also analyze composition of computations using the three structural patterns and implement the available optimizations for composing computations in audio analysis applications.We evaluate our approach with results on productivity and performance using the two computational components and the four example applications. Our re- sults illustrate that we can prototype the full-functioning applications in Python using 10 \u2212 60\u00d7 less lines of code than equivalent implementations using low-level languages. Our PyCASP components and example applications achieve and of- ten exceed the efficiency of comparable hand-tuned low-level implementations. In addition to specialization, adding the optimizations for composing components in these applications can give up to 30% performance improvement. We show that applications written using PyCASP can be run on multiple parallel hard- ware backends with little or no application code change. PyCASP also enables applications to scale from one desktop GPU to a cluster of GPUs with little pro- grammer effort. Combining all of the specialization and composition techniques, our example applications are able to automatically achieve 50-1000\u00d7 faster-than- real-time performance on both multi-core CPU and GPU platforms and 15.5\u00d7 speedup on 16-node cluster of GPUs showing near-optimal scaling.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2210372538", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11172719", "14668046", "16962502"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:739346"}

A naive or ad hoc choice of values for these can lead to poor performance in terms of generalization error and high complexity of the parameterized models obtained in terms of the number of support vectors identified. The task of searching for optimal hyper-parameters with respect to the aforementioned performance measures is the so-called SVM model selection problem. In this paper we propose a strategy to select optimal SVM models in a dynamic fashion in order to address this problem when knowledge about the environment is updated with new observations and previously parameterized models need to be re-evaluated, and in some cases discarded in favor of revised models. This strategy combines the power of swarm intelligence theory with the conventional grid search method in order to progressively identify and sort out potential solutions using dynamically updated training datasets.

Although Connectionist models (e.g., the recurrent network and its variants) have demonstrated generalization over structured domains, there has not been a clear demonstration of strong systematicity (i.e., generalization across syntactic position). The tensor has been proposed as a way of representing structured objects, however, there has not been an effective learning mechanism (in the strongly systematic sense) to explain how these representations may be acquired. I address this issue through an analysis of tensor learning dynamics. These ideas are then implemented as the tensor-recurrent network which is shown to exhibit strong systematicity on a simple language task.

We use the FPGA\u2019s DSP elements as parallel multiply-accumulators (MACs), a core computation in SVMs. A key feature of the architecture is that it is customized to low precision arithmetic which permits one DSP unit to perform two or more MACs in parallel. Low precision also reduces the required number of parallel off-chip memory accesses by packing multiple data words on the FPGA-memory bus. We have built a prototype using an off-the-shelf PCI-based FPGA card with a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA and 1GB DDR2 memory.

Different from general scenarios, challenges to underwater image recognition are posted by poor image quality, uncontrolled objects and environment, and difficulty in acquiring representative samples. In addition, most existing feature extraction techniques are hindered from automation due to involving human supervision. Toward this end, we propose an underwater fish recognition framework that consists of a fully unsupervised feature learning technique and an error-resilient classifier. Object parts are initialized based on saliency and relaxation labeling to match object parts correctly. A non-rigid part model is then learned based on fitness, separation, and discrimination criteria. For the classifier, an unsupervised clustering approach generates a binary class hierarchy, where each node is a classifier. To exploit information from ambiguous images, the notion of partial classification is introduced to assign coarse labels by optimizing the benefit of indecision made by the classifier.

However, due to the problem of domain shifts and heterogeneous feature representations, the performance of classifiers trained on images may be dramatically degraded for video recognition tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Networks (HiGAN), to enhance recognition in videos (i.e., target domain) by transferring knowledge from images (i.e., source domain).

By taking advantage of these two-level adversarial learning, our method is capable of learning a domain-invariant feature representation of source images and target videos.

A Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) model using a non linear Schrodinger wave equation (SWE) is proposed here to explain the tracking of the Motor Imagery (MI) based EEG signal of the BCI user. It is shown that if the potential field of the SWE is excited by the raw EEG data using a self-organized learning scheme, then the probability density function (pdf) associated with the EEG signal is transferred to the probability amplitude function which is the response of the SWE. In this scheme, the EEG data is encoded in terms of a particle like wave packet which helps to recover the EEG signal by de-noising the raw data. Thus the filtered EEG signal is a wave packet which glides along and moves like a particle. This estimated EEG signal is then fed as an input to the feature extractor to obtain the Hjorth features. These features are then used to train the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The results show that the accuracy of the classifier output using the filtered EEG and the wave packet generated feature is better compared to that using the raw EEG signal. Also, the proposed scheme has been effectively used to predict the user intention which is not clearly observed in the raw EEG data.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2263271256", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61796541"}

To solve the problems of feature heterogeneity and semantic gap of different media data, existing deep cross-media quantization technology provides an efficient and effective solution for cross-media common semantic representation learning. However, due to the fact that social network data often exhibits semantic sparsity, diversity, and contains a lot of noise, the performance of existing cross-media search methods often degrades. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a novel fine-grained cross-media representation learning model with deep quantization attention network for social network cross-media search (CMSL). First, we construct the image-word semantic correlation graph, and perform deep random walks on the graph to realize semantic expansion and semantic embedding learning, which can discover some potential semantic correlations between images and words. Then, in order to discover more fine-grained cross-media semantic correlations, a multi-scale fine-grained cross-media semantic correlation learning method that combines global and local saliency semantic similarity is proposed. Third, the fine-grained cross-media representation, cross-media semantic correlations and binary quantization code are jointly learned by a unified deep quantization attention network, which can preserve both inter-media correlations and intra-media similarities, by minimizing both cross-media correlation loss and binary quantization loss. Experimental results demonstrate that CMSL can generate high-quality cross-media common semantic representation, which yields state-of-the-art cross-media search performance on two benchmark datasets, NUS-WIDE and MIR-Flickr 25k.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3343031.3350892", "venue": "MM '19", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2981862003", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2495132", "16578125", "349730", "26348494", "6055846", "207239085", "1451650", "6305490", "6483070", "207216960", "29158194", "15273903", "2472547", "67919982", "1915014", "3919117", "14040310", "3509328", "206595579", "3994012", "13742759", "53035938", "16579466", "12867189", "40868455", "2286143", "4940623", "2176941", "2719485", "61462908", "16447573", "15514398", "8355505", "25162465", "3051291", "13743530", "14124313", "9492646", "23672393", "51867220", "53037504", "14269196", "54562029", "3307435", "53038027", "4346232", "207242032", "1964982", "19153102", "18308874", "67377187", "16170805"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204837544"}

CRFI has feedback connections that encourage the data consistency at multiple levels of the feature pyramid. On the encoder side of the SegNet, the CRFI combines the input feature maps and convolution block output based on their spatial local similarity, like a trainable bilateral filter. For all networks, 725 2D images (i.e., 29 MRI cases) were used in training; while, 174 2D images (i.e., 6 cases) were used in testing. ::: Results: The SegNet with CRFI achieved the relatively high Dice coefficients (0.76, 0.84, and 0.89) for the peripheral zone, central zone, and whole gland, respectively. Compared with UNet, the SegNet+CRFIs segmentation has generally higher Dice score and showed the robustness in determining the boundaries of anatomical structures compared with the SegNet or UNet segmentation. The SegNet with a CRFI at the end showed the CRFI can correct the segmentation errors from SegNet output, generating smooth and consistent segmentation for the prostate. ::: Conclusion: UNet based deep neural networks demonstrated in this study can perform zonal prostate segmentation, achieving high Dice coefficients compared with those in the literature.

The detection of the PD in a real environment is an important task because it helps technicians to accurately identify fault and therefore it has economical benefits. However, the automatic detection of PD in a real environment has to deal with high interference of background noise. A novel approach of PD detection based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Particle Swarm Intelligence (PSO) is proposed in this paper. Its performance is compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM), Back Propagation (BP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) methods.

In the recent work, there are number of classifiers that are proposed by different researchers to solve this problem. Though many solutions are available, high dimensionality of samples become a major issue. The prime objective of this work is to increase the classification efficiency of agricultural area. This research presents a novel object identification and feature selection algorithm. At the initial stage of the work, Modified Fuzzy Possibilistic C-Means clustering is applied for the proficient segmentation of objects. In addition texture and the spectral features of the segmented image are extracted for efficient vegetation classification and these features are selected based on the Modified Genetic Algorithm based wrapper feature selection algorithm. Finally, vegetation classification is performed by using Mean Weight-Least Squares Twin Support Vector Machine (MW-LSTSVM). Thus the vegetation classification is achieved accurately.

Most often, these abnormalities are initially overlooked using traditional concussion assessment tools. Accordingly, premature return to sport participation may lead to recurrent episodes of concussion, increasing the risk of recurrent concussions with more severe consequences. Sixty-one athletes at high risk for concussion (i.e., collegiate rugby and football players) were recruited and underwent EEG baseline assessment. Thirty of these athletes suffered from concussion and were retested at day 30 postinjury. A number of task-related EEG recordings were conducted. A novel classification algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), was applied as a classifier to identify residual functional abnormalities in athletes suffering from concussion using a multichannel EEG data set. The total accuracy of the classifier using the 10 features was 77.1%. The classifier has a high sensitivity of 96.7% (linear SVM), 80.0% (nonlinear SVM), and a relatively lower but acceptable selectivity of 69.1% (linear SVM) and 75.0% (nonlinear SVM). The major findings of this report are as follows: 1) discriminative features were observed at theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands, 2) the minimal redundancy relevance method was identified as being superior to the univariate -test method in selecting features for the model calculation, 3) the EEG features selected for the classification model are linked to temporal and occipital areas, and 4) postural parameters influence EEG data set and can be used as discriminative features for the classification model. Overall, this report provides sufficient evidence that 10 EEG features selected for final analysis and SVM may be potentially used in clinical practice for automatic classification of athletes with residual brain functional abnormalities following a concussion episode.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18701381", "doi": "10.1109/TNSRE.2008.918422", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2160607244", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["23479701", "11377239", "41150765", "35363948", "40098043", "36012582", "4616153", "22671770", "25029522", "13794429", "24825857", "15656385", "5320782", "31991528", "6200727", "25432424", "45632293", "6944518", "192934", "1561445", "17959677", "1831347", "28637672", "194951", "108453813", "7837086", "206764015", "15943670", "9605092", "44388882", "21601051", "197659745", "9540474", "13593671", "20266756", "13426606", "33238793", "23645973", "73730907", "18983762"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5338983"}

A Fitts' law test involving real-time target acquisition tasks was conducted to compare the usability of the SVM-based control system to that of an artificial neural network (ANN) based method. Performance was assessed using the Fitts' law throughput value as well as additional metrics including completion rate, path efficiency and overshoot. The SVM-based approach outperformed the ANN-based system in every performance measure for able-bodied subjects. The SVM outperformed the ANN in path efficiency and throughput with the first LD subject and in throughput with the second LD subject. The superior performance of the SVM-based system appears to be due to its higher estimation accuracy of all DOFs during inactive and low amplitude segments (these periods were frequent during real-time control).

Here, we propose a robust system which consists of three modules: digital zoom, adaptive skin detection, and hand gesture recognition. The first module detects user face and zooms in so that the face and upper torus take the central part of the image. The second module utilizes the detected user facial color information to detect the other skin color regions like hands. The last module is the most important part for doing both static and dynamic hand gesture recognition. The region of interest next to the detected user face is for fist/waving hand gesture recognition. To classify the dynamic hand gestures under complex background, motion history image and four groups of novel Haar-like features are investigated to classify the dynamic up, down, left, and right hand gestures. A simple efficient algorithm using Support Vector Machine is developed. These defined hand gestures are intuitive and easy for user to control most home appliances.

The growth of the number of seniors put new challenges to health care services, caregivers and family members. One of the major challenges is how to prevent elderly people from falling down. Especially, if the person lives alone, falling can be quite dangerous for his / her health. Falling down can cause serious consequences like broken bones or lost consciousness for elderly people. Therefore, it is of key importance to be able to provide help as soon as possible, or, even try to prevent the incident. Combining video-based surveillance and computer vision techniques could bring us towards intelligent systems that could help to monitor the elderly and raise an alarm in case of unusual and dangerous events. The main question is how to automate fall detection using only video information (like camera network) with application in public health and health services (i.e., elderly houses, hospitals). Generally, when talking about video surveillance systems, there are some elements that would remain the same in every system irrespective of the application. These are: tracking, data association in context of camera network and post-processing based on extracted information (like activity recognition). So, this thesis addresses each of these questions and tries to find a generalized framework that could integrate all the methods in one system. One of the main criterion of the project was to avoid camera calibration that is, correspondence between views should be based on some confidence or probability function between camera views. Therefore, it was decided to adopt a Bayesian framework for multi-target multicamera tracking [1] that fulfills our requirements. When considering a single view from one camera, the system allows to represent each target as a set of samples (or particles) that have probabilistic measures (weights) proportional to the likelihood of the target being at that position. For multi-camera system, one needs to associate corresponding targets among camera views. Gale-Shapley algorithm for finding stable matching between two classes (in our case cameras) was modified for this purpose. For fall detection part, silhouetteand velocity-based set of features were extracted and passed through Support Vector Machine (SVM) to separate fall events from other activities. A set of test videos were recorded using two cameras to test stability of the tracking framework and the reliability of fall detection algorithm. The initial results are encouraging. Further integration of additional features may improve the performance of the system.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2462522215", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["5446967", "7708309"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30101391"}

However, it is also well known that using unlabeled data is not always helpful in SSL algorithms. Thus, in order to select a small amount of helpful unlabeled samples, various selection criteria have been proposed in the literature. One criterion is based on the prediction by an ensemble classifier and the similarity between pairwise training samples. However, because the criterion is only concerned with the distance information among the samples, sometimes it does not work appropriately, particularly when the unlabeled samples are near the boundary. In order to address this concern, a method of training semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs) using selection criterion is investigated; this method is a modified version of that used in SemiBoost.

Previous methods achieve knowledge transfer by detecting a shared low-dimensional feature representation from source domain to target domain. Along this line, many algorithms, e.g., dual transfer learning (DTL), triplex transfer learning (TRi-TL) etc., have been proposed and widely used for text classification. However, we argue that it is difficult for models to distinguish exactly the common concepts or identical concepts across different domains through the existing algorithms, even though source and target domains are related but different. So we propose to use the similar feature clusters as knowledge transfer, that is, we only guarantee the approximate similarity of common word clusters across different domains, rather than the exactly same. Based on the above assumption, the derived association matrices between word clusters and document classes should be slightly different to account for the word clusters variations. To take the above assumptions into account, we propose a novel Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization based transfer learning by linking similar feature clusters (LSF-TL) for sentiment classification, in which an approximate constraint between similar word clusters matrices is added to allow differences while keeping the knowledge transferring function. Besides, LSF-TL also provides the same approximate constraint for the derived clusters association matrices. Then we employ an iterative updating algorithm with sound theoretical proof to find the local optimal solution. Last, we evaluate our method by conducting extensive experiments on Amazon product reviews.

This approach is more dynamic than previous station-based car sharing systems, because users can start their trip wherever a car is available and terminate it anywhere in the operator\u2019s area. Hence, this new form of car sharing is not only appealing to users with the need for a car but also to those who want to speed up their travel. One drawback of this system is that the user does not know in advance if there will be a car available nearby. This work solves this problem by predicting future car availabilities around Points of Interest (POIs) in the city. We train Random Forest models on features from the car sharing and POI datasets in order to generate predictions for the car availability in the near future. By applying this method to car sharing systems in Portland, Seattle and Turin, we are able to outperform the baseline of predicting the last recorded value. Therefore, our predictions can be used by users to inform themselves about future car availability or by car sharing operators to relocate their fleet. In addition, we discover behavioral patterns of users by applying sequence pattern mining to the car sharing data. Results from Portland and Turin show that we can extract different sequences with respect to both, specific POIs and POI categories. Moreover, this work shows that the extracted sequences coincide with sequences from a check-in database, where the users explicitly specify that they are visiting a POI at a given timestamp. Therefore, the discovered sequences of car sharing can be used to study the general movement of citizens. Furthermore, a temporal and spatial contextualization was conducted. Dividing the time of the day into four timeslots, differences in the frequency and confidence of the discovered sequences are found in each of the timeslots. Similarly, we split the area of the car sharing operator into multiple smaller areas and study the sequences extracted for each area. The results suggest that car sharing usage patterns highly depend on the area, as well as the time of the day. The discovered sequences can be used to study origins and destinations of car sharing trips, as well as the general movement of citizens. For instance, this can help the car sharing operator to decide which areas provide a good market to expand to and to discover general mobility patterns.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2995718287", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208094685"}

Our key contribution is to introduce a notion of better transfer learning using multiple ConvNet layer features.

We use AdaBoost.MH classifier to show that one can achieve superior results with Combined ConvNet Layer features against individual ConvNet Layer features.

Using the I* procedure with adequate amount of interaction terms the logistic regression can be made to match performance of random forests in the synthetic data sets where random forests dominate (Sharma, 2011). This makes it seem the interaction miner algorithm along with some minimal sufficient amount of interaction and transformations allow logistic regression to match ensemble performance. This implies that, without a certain amount of dimensionality in the data interaction, miner and logistic regression do not benefit from the interactions.

AF causes a loss in atrial contractile function that favors the formation of thrombi, and thus increases the risk of stroke. Also, AF produces highly irregular and complex temporal dynamics in ventricular response RR intervals. Thus, it is hypothesized that the analysis of RR dynamics could provide predictors for IS. However, these complex and nonlinear dynamics call for the use of advanced multiscale nonlinear signal processing tools. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVES ::: The global aim is to investigate the performance of a recently-proposed multiscale and nonlinear signal processing tool, the scattering transform, in predicting IS for patients suffering from AF. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The heart rate of a cohort of 173 patients from Fujita Health University Hospital in Japan was analyzed with the scattering transform. First, p-values of Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to identify scattering coefficients achieving significant (univariate) discrimination between patients with and without IS. Second, a multivariate procedure for feature selection and classification, the Sparse Support Vector Machine (S-SVM), was applied to predict IS. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Groups of scattering coefficients, located at several time-scales, were identified as significantly higher (p-value < 0.05) in patients who developed IS than in those who did not. Though the overall predictive power of these indices remained moderate (around 60 %), it was found to be much higher when analysis was restricted to patients not taking antithrombotic treatment (around 80 %). Further, S-SVM showed that multivariate classification improves IS prediction, and also indicated that coefficients involved in classification differ for patients with and without antithrombotic treatment. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Scattering coefficients were found to play a significant role in predicting IS, notably for patients not receiving antithrombotic treatment. S-SVM improves IS detection performance and also provides insight on which features are important. Notably, it shows that AF patients not taking antithrombotic treatment are characterized by a slow modulation of RR dynamics in the ULF range and a faster modulation in the HF range.

Carbon fractions are important for modelling soil carbon dynamics for carbon accounting, and as a potential indicator of soil quality. We considered particulate organic carbon (POC), humic organic carbon (HOC) and resistant organic carbon (ROC), which represent fractions of increasing bio-chemical stability. A dataset of 427 NSW profiles with mid-infrared (MIR) derived carbon fractions and a set of 16 predictor variables were applied. Random Forest and multiple linear regression techniques were applied, for depth intervals to 30 cm. The derived models and maps were of moderate strength, with validation results revealing Lin's concordance values for the 0\u201330 cm depth interval of 0.79 for total SOC stocks and 0.60 to 0.74 for the fraction stocks. Maps of mean stocks, and upper and lower 95% prediction intervals are presented. Absolute stocks (in Mg ha \u22121 ) of each fraction have a strong linear relationship with total SOC and are controlled by similar environmental and land management factors, normally increasing in a systematic way with increasingly moist climate (considering rainfall and temperatures), increasing mafic lithology (associated with more fertile, clay rich soils) and less disturbed land uses with higher vegetation cover. The environmental factors influencing the relative proportions of each fraction (% of total SOC) are more complex, but climate and lithology appear to be dominant, in addition to depth in profile. An SOC vulnerability index is mapped over the State, identifying areas where the stored carbon is most vulnerable to land management or environmental change.

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors is an attractive research topic in machine learning and ubiquitous computing over the last few decades, and has extremely practicality in health surveillance, medical assistance, personalized services, etc. However, with the limitation of sensor sampling rate, sustainability, deployment, and other restricted conditions, it is difficult to collect enough and resultful sensor data anywhere, anytime. Therefore, the HAR based on wearable sensors always faces the challenges of the low-data regime under some practical scenarios, which leads to a low accuracy of activity recognition and needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a powerful method for training resultful generative models that could generate very convincing verisimilar images. The framework of GANs and its variants shed many lights on improving the performance of HAR. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial networks framework called SensoryGANs that can effectively generate available sensor data used for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, SensoryGANs is the first unbroken generative adversarial networks applied in generating sensor data in the HAR research field. Firstly, we tried exploring and devising three activity-special GANs models for three human daily activities. Secondly, these specific models are trained with the guidance of unbroken vanilla GANs. Thirdly, the trained generators from adversarial optimization process are used to generate synthetic sensor data. Finally, the synthetic sensor data from SensoryGANs are used to enrich the original authentic sensor datasets, which can improve the performance of target activity recognition model. Meanwhile, we propose three visual evaluation methods for assessing synthetic sensor data produced by the trained generators in SensoryGANs models.

We present theoretical properties of this method and show that this is uniformly consistent in finding the correct feature space under certain generalized assumptions. We present case studies to show that the assumptions are met in most practical situations and also present simulation studies to demonstrate performance of the proposed approach.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "149387564", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["705798", "5885974", "14382930", "14607075", "88520095", "61649919", "122725444", "5142869", "16300742", "17808083", "1673876", "10142996", "123282658", "12633343", "8724475", "118799867", "2860274", "8993541", "7051801", "6130331", "14791297", "10983659", "15379424"], "inbound_citations": ["15127759"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88471562"}

Currently these as-built models are created manually, which is time-consuming. An important step in the automated Scan-to-BIM procedure is the interpretation and classification of point cloud data. This is computationally challenging due to the sheer size of point cloud data for an entire building. Additionally, the variety of objects makes classification problematic. Existing methods integrate prior knowledge from the sensors or environment to improve the results. However, these approaches are therefore often case specific and thus have limited applicability. The goal of this research is to provide a method that is independent of any sensor or scene within a building environment. Furthermore, our method processes the entire building simultaneously, resulting in more distinct local and contextual features. This paper presents a generic approach to automatically identify structural elements for the purposes of Scan-to-BIM. More specifically, a Random Forests classifier is employed for the classification of the floors, ceilings, roofs, walls and beams. As input, our algorithm takes a set of planar primitives that are pre-segmented from the point cloud. This significantly reduces the data while maintaining accuracy. Both contextual and geometric features are used to describe the observed patches. The algorithm is evaluated using realistic data for a wide variety of existing buildings including houses, school facilities, a factory, a castle and a church. The experiments prove that the proposed algorithm is capable of properly labeling 87% of the structural elements with an average precision of 85% in highly cluttered environments without the support of the sensors position. In future work, the classified patches will be processed by class-specific reconstruction algorithms to create BIM geometry.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jobe.2018.04.027", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of building engineering", "mag_id": "2802161643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195809287", "144207769", "209465037", "132639689", "209466215", "86632266", "204266423"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196109091"}

To satisfy the requirement of dual input-to-one output, the encoder of the generator in FuseGAN is designed as a Siamese network. The least square GAN objective is employed to enhance the training stability of FuseGAN, resulting in an accurate confidence map for focus region detection. Also, we exploit the convolutional conditional random fields technique on the confidence map to reach a refined final decision map for better focus region detection.

The goal of this study was to investigate biological themes underlying these signatures, to infer genes of potential mechanistic importance to the CRC recurrence phenotype and to test whether accurate prognostic models can be developed using mechanistically important genes. ::: ::: ::: METHODS AND FINDINGS ::: We investigated eight published CRC gene expression signatures and found no functional convergence in Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. Using a random walk-based approach, we integrated these signatures and publicly available somatic mutation data on a protein-protein interaction network and inferred 487 genes that were plausible candidate molecular underpinnings for the CRC recurrence phenotype. We named the list of 487 genes a NEM signature because it integrated information from Network, Expression, and Mutation. The signature showed significant enrichment in four biological processes closely related to cancer pathophysiology and provided good coverage of known oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and CRC-related signaling pathways. A NEM signature-based Survival Support Vector Machine prognostic model was trained using a microarray gene expression dataset and tested on an independent dataset. The model-based scores showed a 75.7% concordance with the real survival data and separated patients into two groups with significantly different relapse-free survival (p = 0.002).

MoRFs are implicated in important processes including signaling and regulation. However, only a limited number of experimentally validated MoRFs is known, which motivates development of computational methods that predict MoRFs from protein chains. ::: ::: Results: We introduce a new MoRF predictor, MoRFpred, which identifies all MoRF types (\u03b1, \u03b2, coil and complex). We develop a comprehensive dataset of annotated MoRFs to build and empirically compare our method. MoRFpred utilizes a novel design in which annotations generated by sequence alignment are fused with predictions generated by a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which uses a custom designed set of sequence-derived features. The features provide information about evolutionary profiles, selected physiochemical properties of amino acids, and predicted disorder, solvent accessibility and B-factors. Empirical evaluation on several datasets shows that MoRFpred outperforms related methods: \u03b1-MoRF-Pred that predicts \u03b1-MoRFs and ANCHOR which finds disordered regions that become ordered when bound to a globular partner. We show that our predicted (new) MoRF regions have non-random sequence similarity with native MoRFs. We use this observation along with the fact that predictions with higher probability are more accurate to identify putative MoRF regions. We also identify a few sequence-derived hallmarks of MoRFs. They are characterized by dips in the disorder predictions and higher hydrophobicity and stability when compared to adjacent (in the chain) residues. ::: ::: Availability: http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MoRFpred/; http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MoRFpred/Supplement.pdf ::: ::: Contact: lkurgan@ece.ualberta.ca ::: ::: Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3371841", "pubmed_id": "22689782", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bts209", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2168220711", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["120840320", "22269205", "21060086", "8048654", "8698458", "5591848", "121004643", "9298925", "21847636"], "inbound_citations": ["8982559", "2282998", "40859856", "23376493", "59045864", "53603110", "13973229", "215137401", "203886991", "15788609", "215418049", "14955627", "3714505", "215189826", "204946988", "108391535", "48358936", "215485611", "215660798", "162181953", "3703781", "75514", "196630267", "208019731", "207454373", "44181403", "4616407", "24224814", "1078587", "214824418", "2501655", "23880732", "23879704", "39556607", "8881910", "3807036", "4670652", "174812893", "34892650", "13470245", "16498676", "52945944", "214979502", "208167562", "3075301", "14971986", "15409368", "35835604", "2295722", "31364424", "52961041", "202701370", "4020857", "21700875", "54458213", "4477725", "33798203", "205852908", "33086121", "49428064", "21204074", "92678664", "45778186", "9260660", "14035761", "215685833", "14020368", "3449156", "4230557", "215289193", "3342250", "44096492", "73527164", "13883311", "6519462", "274643", "14617272", "658164", "214887785", "10268104", "6360410", "6117721", "67787505", "25653492", "1317527", "14432977", "17074550", "211197086", "3659720", "215661910", "4973603", "22179720", "215528556", "4077573", "2868740", "204772782", "3729987", "214733150", "195804709", "25094349", "5698024", "38597868", "214123234", "109603574", "207911426", "4228278", "59604054"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7599398"}

The survey has four primary parts: a classification of BIAs fromthe biomimetic mechanism, a summary of several typical BIAs from different levels, an overview of current applications of BIAs in mobile robot control, and a description of some possible future directions for research.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4707020", "pubmed_id": "26819582", "doi": "10.1155/2016/3810903", "venue": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "journal": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2197222329", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8589556", "114621423", "7745988", "14591906", "7891732", "55557344", "61764999", "10538053", "4962752", "111117218", "43450255", "122286695", "8000278", "56252899", "4985262", "10374744", "62154210", "4462628", "5573508", "123448532", "31553570", "189888115", "771328", "9878684", "136919142", "32250925", "121078903", "15761839", "62229879", "16745015", "17623702", "62121853", "26688882", "38504424", "16321349", "40824003", "30198960", "3811692", "90287510", "19492785", "21083688", "28518876", "7979617", "35610571", "36628636", "10224713", "17070011", "26379348", "43286009", "6358023", "17492011", "32878192", "124445824", "55148428", "3965565", "20026548", "16428812", "1881816", "2575107", "4492747", "11481102", "61437502", "2039044", "410026", "26688655", "3232994"], "inbound_citations": ["116810016", "9127105", "3974314", "208632665", "22673307", "63960224", "49419030", "6141748", "211533940", "214594645", "49191948", "215107686", "67865557", "215432511", "64753804", "150376299"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8451678"}

SVM can be applied extensively in many fields, such as pattern recognition, regression analysis, and probability estimation. SVM uses optimization with quadratic programming which become unefficient when applied in a high dimensional large dataset. Hence, researchers develop a method by changing SVM formulation with a smoothing technique that called Smooth-SVM (SSVM) which converts quadratic into linear programming. The research then continued by modifying that smooth function into polynomial smooth function forms, such as quadratic polynomial function, fourth polynomial function, piecewise polynomial function and spline function. Compared to the other polynomial smooth functions, piecewise polynomial smooth function has a better performance in plus function. When piecewise polynomial smooth function is applied in SSVM model, it will produce piecewise polynomial smooth support vector machine (PPSSVM). PPSSVM has many advantages compared to other SSVM models and its developments such as better efficiency, precision and higher accuracy in generalization. Two PPSSVM model based on piecewise polynomial function are used in this research which found by Luo (PPSSVM1) and Wu and Wang (PPSSVM2). The performance and the convergence of both models then will be examined theoretically, in order to determine the best model for classification of underdeveloped rural in East Kalimantan.PODES data in 2011 will be used in this research. Teoritical analysis showed that PPSSVM2 has a better performance and konvergence than PPSSVM1. Based on the result of this study, PPSSVM2 is not batter than PPSSVM1.

Such fine-grained data can help manufacturers perform quality control by predicting which manufactured products are at risk of being defective. A predictive analytics system that identifies internal failures in products before they are shipped can result in significant savings for the manufacturer and result in better customer satisfaction. However, predicting internal failures in manufactured products is a challenging machine learning task due to two reasons: (i) the rarity of such failures in modern manufacturing processes, and (ii) the failure of traditional machine learning algorithms to optimize non-convex metrics such as Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) used to measure performance on imbalanced datasets.

NDA is also based on detecting the dominant normal directions to the decision surface. This paper introduces a novel SVM + NDA model which combines these two methods. This can be viewed as an extension to the SVM by incorporating some partially global information about the data, especially, discriminatory information in the normal direction to the decision boundary. This can also be considered as an extension to the NDA where the support vectors improve the choice of \u03ba-nearest neighbors (\u03ba\u2212NN's) on the decision boundary by incorporating local information. Since our model is an extension to both SVM and NDA, it can deal with heteroscedastic and non-normal data. It also avoids the small sample size problem. Moreover, this model can be reduced to the classical SVM model so that the existing SVM programs can be used for easy implementation. An extensive comparison of the SVM + NDA to the LDA, SVM, NDA and the combined SVM and LDA, performed on artificial and real data sets, has shown the advantages and superiority of our proposed model.

The lack of data on the distribution of these significant aquatic plants complicates the quantification of their decreasing tendency. While Mediterranean seagrasses are declining, satellite remote sensing technology is growing at an unprecedented pace, resulting in a wealth of spaceborne image time series. Here, we exploit recent advances in high spatial resolution sensors and machine learning to study Mediterranean seagrasses. We process a multispectral RapidEye time series between 2011 and 2016 to detect interannual seagrass dynamics in 888 submerged hectares of the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece (eastern Mediterranean Sea). We assess the extent change of two Mediterranean seagrass species, the dominant Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, following atmospheric and analytical water column correction, as well as machine learning classification, using Random Forests, of the RapidEye time series. Prior corrections are necessary to untangle the initially weak signal of the submerged seagrass habitats from satellite imagery. The central results of this study show that P. oceanica seagrass area has declined by 4.1%, with a trend of -11.2 ha/yr, while C. nodosa seagrass area has increased by 17.7% with a trend of +18 ha/yr throughout the 5-year study period. Trends of change in spatial distribution of seagrasses in the Thermaikos Gulf site are in line with reported trends in the Mediterranean. Our presented methodology could be a time- and cost-effective method toward the quantitative ecological assessment of seagrass dynamics elsewhere in the future.

It is expected that such a system will play an increasingly important role in enhancing user's experience and can significantly improve the intelligibility of a human computer interaction (HCI) system. For example, a robust gender classification system can provide a basis for passive surveillance and access to a smart building using demographic information or can provide valuable consumer statistics in a public place. The option of an audio cue in addition to the visual cue promises a robust solution with high accuracy and ease-of-use in human computer interaction systems. This paper investigates gender classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The visual (thumbnail frontal face) and the audio (features from speech data) cues were considered for designing the classifier. Three different representations of the data, namely, raw data, principle component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) were used for the experimentation with visual signal. For speech, mel-cepstral coefficient and pitch were used for the experimentation. It was found that the best overall classification rates obtained using the SVM for the visual and speech data were 95.31% and 100%, respectively, on data set collected in laboratory environment. The performance of the SVM was compared with two simple classifiers namely, the nearest prototype neighbor and the k-nearest neighbor on all feature sets. It was found that the SVM outperformed the other two classifiers on all datasets. To further understand the robustness issues, the proposed approach has been applied on a large balanced (roughly equal distribution of gender, ethnicity and age group) data-base consisting of 8000 faces collected in real world environment.

In view of the limitations of individual differences leading to reduce the accuracy of fatigue assessment, this paper proposed a method for driving fatigue assessment based on the feature fusion and transfer learning of electroencephalogram(EEG) and electromyography(EMG). The EEG and cervical EMG signals from 20 healthy subjects were recruited synchronously using the simulated driving platform. The time-frequency analysis method was used to extract the fatigue characteristics of EEG signals and EMG signals. A driver fatigue assessment model based on feature fusion and transfer learning was constructed to achieve effective identification of different drivers' fatigue state. The results showed that the recognition rate of driving fatigue based on the feature fusion and transfer learning of EEG and EMG was higher than traditional support vector machine method, and it could improve the robustness of driving fatigue assessment in different subjects.

{"paper_id": "141133098", "title": "Connectionist and Dual Route-Models of Reading: What Insights Can Be Gained by Synthesizing Both Models?", "authors": [{"first": "Mauro", "middle": ["Ramos", "D.", "J."], "last": "Pereira", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "A brief background to connectionist modelling As an initial starting point it would be useful to briefly outline what connectionist modelling entails. The connectionist approach emerged through developments in computer science, specifically the implementation of computationally explicit models of cognition. Connectionist modelling is inspired by observations of brain structure and information processing, as well as neuronal properties (Ward, 2006). One of the core theoretical assumptions of this approach is that interconnected networks of artificial neurons can represent activity of real neurons and, thus provide useful insights into understanding brain activity and cognitive processes (Mcleod, Plunkett & Rolls, 1998). Thus, in terms of its architecture, the majority of connectionist models attempt to mirror the functional organisation of real neurons (Heinke, Humphreys & Olson, 1999). More specifically, in connectionism neurons are modelled as units (nodes) and neuronal synapses are represented by the connections between nodes or weights. In this way, real neurons' action potential (excitatory or inhibitory) is mirrored by the units' positive or negative activations (Ellis & Humphreys, 1999). The input to the node is summed, and the net input goes through an activation function. Before the connection value is sent to other nodes the activation function must yield the node's activation (see figure 1[Eimas, 2000]). [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Figure 2--Through the above equation one can determine the unit's activation function. The function f is the identity function and is computed as the weighed sum of its units (Gurney, 1997). The net input consist of the weighed sum [[summation].sub.j] [w.sub.ij] [y.sub.j] where i represents the receiving node and wij indicates the weight of the connection form j to i indicates the number of units to be added. This is often represented as neti. The activation function f([net.sub.i]) is the step function of the unit net input. (Gurney, 1997) [y.sub.i] = f([summation over j] [w.sub.ij] [y.sub.ij]) ANNs are perhaps one of the most prominently used connectionist models. One of the obvious advantages of using ANNs is that, unlike traditional computers (serial processing), ANNs process information in parallel fashion across a large number of processing units (Dennis, 2004). This type of computation is often called parallel distributed processing which stresses the parallel nature of cognitive and neuronal processing, as well as its representations (Mcleod, Plunkett & Rolls, 1998). In this way, one can conceive ANNs as essentially adaptive and non-linear systems which emulate biological neural systems. Since that learning in biological systems involves successive changes in synaptic connections between neurons, it is plausible to use ANNs as an information processing paradigm to model brain activity (Gurney, 1997). One of most commonly used ANNs are known as feed-forward network (FFN) which indicates that connections flow in only one direction (from the input to the output layer) and that there are no backwards connections from the output layer (Heinke, Humphreys & Olson, 1999; Ward, 2008). This type of network architecture is multilayered and with one internal or \"hidden\" layer. The strengths of this type of ANNs are that the system is adjusted at each step by comparing the desired output with the actual output (Muller, Reinhardt & Strickland, 1995). This process enables the training of ANNs so that it performs a function through an input/output map (see figure 3). During the training phase the ANN's parameters change and adapt according to an implicit internal constraint known as the learning rule (Fausett, 1994). Typically, when a feed-forward ANNs is presented with an input, and a corresponding target or output, this type of training is known as supervised. In this particular type of ANNs, an error consists of the difference between the system output and the desired parameters. \u2026", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Social & Psychological Sciences", "mag_id": "131355832", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:141133098"}

Previous approaches have only concentrated on classification and put less effort into localization of human interactions. In addition, they rely on hand-designed features (e.g. SIFT, HOG), or human poses or human joints to model human interactions. A disadvantage of such approaches is that it is difficult and time consuming to extend these features to different datasets in the real world. In this paper, we approach the problem of human interaction classification and temporal localization with unsupervised feature learning. Motivated by the well-known Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) in natural image statistics and the convolution technique, we introduce a three-layer convolutional ISA network to learn hierarchical invariant features from videos. Using the invariant features learned by the three-layer convolutional ISA network, we build a bag-of-features (BOF) representation for videos. We then apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify human interactions, and employ a sliding window technique to localize interactions temporally. We also evaluate the performance of classification and temporal localization on video sequences of the UT-Interaction dataset and Hollywood dataset. The encouraging results on classification show that our three-layer convolutional ISA network is able to learn features which are effective to represent complex activities such as human interactions in realistic environments.

However, it still can not deal with patients with dense breast nor with tumor size less than 2 mm. Thermography-based breast cancer approach can address these problems.

While Big Data is one of the interesting contexts, then training a new PSVM with the new data structure is time-consuming.

The key innovation in our work is that a single set of network parameters, within a carefully designed network architecture, may be used to describe mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces and between different finite-dimensional approximations of those spaces. We formulate approximation of the infinite-dimensional mapping by composing nonlinear activation functions and a class of integral operators. The kernel integration is computed by message passing on graph networks. This approach has substantial practical consequences which we will illustrate in the context of mappings between input data to partial differential equations (PDEs) and their solutions. In this context, such learned networks can generalize among different approximation methods for the PDE (such as finite difference or finite element methods) and among approximations corresponding to different underlying levels of resolution and discretization.

The automatic segmentation of the GBM on TEM images by computerized technology can provide clinicians with clear information about glomerular ultrastructural lesions. The GBM region on the TEM image is not only complicated and changeable in shape but also has a low contrast and wide distribution of grayscale. Consequently, extracting image features and obtaining excellent segmentation results are difficult. To address this problem, we introduce a random forest- (RF-) based machine learning method, namely, RF stacks (RFS), to realize automatic segmentation. Specifically, this work proposes a two-level integrated RFS that is more complicated than a one-level integrated RF to improve accuracy and generalization performance. The integrated strategies include training integration and testing integration. Training integration can derive a full-view RFS1 by simultaneously sampling several images of different grayscale ranges in the train phase. Testing integration can derive a zoom-view RFS2 by separately sampling the images of different grayscale ranges and integrating the results in the test phase. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed RFS can be used to automatically segment different morphologies and gray-level basement membranes.

When used in tandem with the SIPS on clinical high risk participants, the EPSI increased the combined PPV to 86.6%. The SVM classified as FEP/converters only 1% of individuals in non-clinical and 4% of clinical low risk populations. Sensitivity of the EPSI, however, was 51% at the default cut-off. Discussion The EPSI identifies, comparably to the SIPS but in less time and with fewer resources, individuals who are either at very high risk to develop a psychotic disorder within 12 months or who are already psychotic. At its default cut-off, EPSI misses 49% of current or future psychotic cases. The cut-off can, however, be adjusted based on purpose. The EPSI is the first validated assessment to predict 12-month psychotic conversion.

This requires that all contours are assigned to either the foreground or the background (border ownership assignment). While earlier studies showed that neurons in primate extrastriate cortex signal border ownership for simple geometric shapes, recent studies show consistent border ownership coding also for complex natural scenes. In order to understand how the brain performs this task, we developed a biologically plausible recurrent neural network that is fully image-computable. Our model uses local edge detector (B) cells and grouping (G) cells whose activity represents proto-objects based on the integration of local feature information. G cells send modulatory feedback connections to those B cells that caused their activation, making the B cells border ownership selective. We found close agreement between our model and neurophysiological results in terms of the timing of border ownership signals as well as the consistency of border ownership signals across scenes. We also benchmarked our model on the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set and achieved performance comparable to recent state-of-the-art computer vision approaches. Our proposed model provides insight into the cortical mechanisms of figure-ground organization. Significance Statement Figure-ground organization is the process of segmenting an image into regions corresponding to objects and background.

Typically, data must be processed to extract useful features to perform LID. The extracting features for LID, based on literature, is a mature process where the standard features for LID have already been developed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Shifted Delta Cepstral (SDC), the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and ending with the i-vector based framework. However, the process of learning based on extract features remains to be improved (i.e. optimised) to capture all embedded knowledge on the extracted features. The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an effective learning model used to perform classification and regression analysis and is extremely useful to train a single hidden layer neural network. Nevertheless, the learning process of this model is not entirely effective (i.e. optimised) due to the random selection of weights within the input hidden layer. In this study, the ELM is selected as a learning model for LID based on standard feature extraction. One of the optimisation approaches of ELM, the Self-Adjusting Extreme Learning Machine (SA-ELM) is selected as the benchmark and improved by altering the selection phase of the optimisation process. The selection process is performed incorporating both the Split-Ratio and K-Tournament methods, the improved SA-ELM is named Enhanced Self-Adjusting Extreme Learning Machine (ESA-ELM). The results are generated based on LID with the datasets created from eight different languages.

In this thesis, we research active portfolio optimisation techniques with heuristic algorithms to manage new regulatory challenges faced in risk management. ::: ::: We first study if heuristic algorithms can support risk management to find global optimal solutions to reduce the regulatory capital requirements. In a benchmark comparison of variance, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objective functions combined with different optimisation routines, we show that the Threshold Accepting (TA) heuristic algorithm reduces the capital requirements compared with the Trust-Region (TR) local search algorithm. ::: ::: Secondly, we introduce a new risk management approach based on the Unconditional Coverage test to optimally manage the regulatory capital requirements, while avoiding to over- or underestimate the portfolio risk. In an empirical analysis with TA and TR optimisation, we show that our new approach successfully optimises the portfolio risk-return profile and reduces the capital requirements. ::: ::: Next, we analyse the effect of different estimation techniques on the capital requirements. More specifically, empirical and analytical VaR and CVaR estimation is compared with a simulation-based approach using a multivariate GARCH process. The optimisation is performed using the Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm. We find that the parametric and empirical distribution assumption generate similar results and neither of them clearly outperforms the other. However, portfolios optimised with the simulation approach reduce the capital requirements by about 11%. ::: ::: Finally, we introduce a global VaR and CVaR hedging approach with multivariate GARCH process and PBIL optimisation. Our hedging framework provides a self-financing hedge that reduces transaction costs by using standardised derivatives. The empirical study shows that the new approach increases the stability of the portfolio while avoiding high transaction costs.

Motif-based and node-based representations are simultaneously generated, so that both the high-order structures and each node's individual properties are preserved in the final embeddings.

This work introduces DaS-related features that characterise UE function and impairment, and aims to demonstrate how multivariate modelling of these metrics can reliably predict the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), a clinician-administered UE assessment in PwMS. ::: ::: ::: APPROACH ::: The FLOODLIGHT DaS test instructed PwMS and healthy controls (HC) to trace predefined shapes on a smartphone screen. A total of 93 subjects (HC, n=22; PwMS, n=71) contributed both dominant and non-dominant handed DaS tests. PwMS subjects were characterised as those with normal (nPwMS, n=50) and abnormal UE function (aPwMS, n=21) with respect to their average 9HPT time (\u2264 or >22.7 [s], respectively). L1-regularization techniques, combined with linear least squares (OLS, IRLS), or non-linear Support Vector (SVR) or Random Forest (RFR) regression were investigated as functions to map relevant DaS features to 9HPT times. ::: ::: ::: MAIN RESULTS ::: It was observed that average non-dominant handed 9HPT times were more accurately predicted by DaS features (r^2=0.41, P<0.05; MAE: 2.08 \u00b1 0.34 [s]) than average dominant handed 9HPTs (r^2=0.39, P<0.05; MAE: 2.32 \u00b1 0.43 [s]), using simple linear IRLS (P<0.01). Moreover, it was found that the Mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted 9HPTs was comparable to the variability of actual 9HPT times within HC, nPwMS and aPwMS groups respectively. The 9HPT however exhibited large heteroscedasticity resulting in less stable predictions of longer 9HPT times. ::: ::: ::: SIGNIFICANCE ::: This study demonstrates the potential of the smartphone-based DaS Test to reliably predict 9HPT times and remotely monitor UE function in PwMS.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32259798", "doi": "10.1088/1361-6579/ab8771", "venue": "Physiological measurement", "journal": "Physiological measurement", "mag_id": "3014262855", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:215407768"}

Thus, the right decision-making makes the school administrators stronger while managing the chaotic environments. School administrators need to be trained by using practice-based training approaches to make right decisions. Action learning (AL) is one of the approaches to serve this aim. But, there is a need for empirical evidences to show the impact of learning action on school administrators\u2019 decision-making styles. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for determination of the school administrators who trained through an AL course where they improved their decision-making skills for various conditions and environments. To this end, a popular single layered feed forward neural network structure namely extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to distinguish the trained and non-trained school administrators based on their MDMQ output. The MDMQ output is a dataset where it was constructed based on a pre-test and post-tests. The pre and post-tests were applied to a number of school administrators and school administrator candidates in Elazig providence in Turkey. Melbourne Decision-Making Questionnaire (MDMQ) was used to collect data on school administrators' decision-making styles before and after the AL course. A series of computer simulations (experimental works) were carried out on MATLAB environment. 5-fold cross validation technique is used in evaluation of the proposed method. The achievements were measured by accuracy, sensitivity and specificity criteria. The computer simulations were conducted based on the two scenarios. All MDMQ outputs were used in the first scenario to distinguish the trained and non-trained school administrators. In the second scenario, each factor of the MDMQ output is used independently to distinguish the trained and non-trained school administrators. The computer simulations show that ELM produced reasonable results in distinguishing trained and non-trained school administrators. We further compare the ELM results with several support vector machines (SVM) classifiers. In comparisons, it is seen that both ELM and SVM methods performed better in three different simulations. Results showed that AL based training course has a measurable impact on school managers' decision-making styles.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2907834219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121973433", "109641783", "194951", "35162286", "140763004", "116858", "142758270", "153580242", "111246054", "52084071", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59311253"}

Due to the sheer size and complexity of these datasets, machine-learning approaches, such as predictive models, play an important role in the extraction of knowledge from these datasets. Most biological research is however not primarily concerned with the predictive capabilities of such models, but is, in fact, aimed at gaining insight into the roles and interactions between biological elements in the biological process measured by the dataset. This requires predictive models to be interpretable in terms of the importance of both individual features and feature combinations. Currently however, most predictive models elude interpretation. We present an approach that applies a frequency analysis to the internal structure of trained Random Forest classification models to score and rank features and feature combinations on their estimated importance in the overall classification of the model. The analysis accounts for the presence of correlated features in the dataset by diffusing scores between similar features and feature combinations. An application of the approach to simulated dataset instances was able to rank predictive features and feature combinations in the datasets correctly. The diffusion was found to be essential for the correct analysis of datasets with correlated features. Applying the analysis to a real dataset predicting gene expression (RNA-seq) from chromatin modification features (ChIP-seq) yielded a notable improvement in the interpretability of both individual features and feature combinations.

However, these features require precise segmentation of cardiac structures. Among the fully automated segmentation methods, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with Skip Connections have shown robustness in medical segmentation problems. In this study, we develop a complete pipeline for classification of subjects with cardiac conditions based on 3D cine-MRI. For the segmentation task, we develop a 2D FCN and introduce Parallel Paths (PP) as a way to exploit the 3D information of the cine-MR image. For the classification task, 125 features were extracted from the segmented structures, describing their anatomy and function. Next, a two-stage pipeline for feature selection using the LASSO method is developed. A subset of 20 features is selected for classification. Each subject is classified using an ensemble of Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine classifiers through majority voting. The Dice Coefficient for segmentation was 0.95+-0.03, 0.89+-0.13, and 0.90+-0.03 for LV, RV, and MC respectively. The 8-fold cross validation accuracy for the classification task was 95.05% and 92.77% based on ground truth and the proposed methods segmentations respectively.

With GAN, we minimize the differences of the distributions between the original target parameters and the generated singing parameters.

PTML-like models have been applied for different authors to study drugs, proteins, nanoparticles, complex networks, social systems, etc. [1-17]. In the particular case of a PTML linear models we can fit an equation with the general form f(si, cj)new = a0 + a1\u00b7 f(si, cj)ref + SUM(bk\u00b7PTO(cj)k). In this model PTO(cj)k are PT operators measuring the perturbations in the new system si with respect to the system of reference sr with observed or expected property f(si, cj)ref. First, we need to calculate the values of the PTOs in the data pre-processing step. This PTOs allow us to perform an Information Fusion process with variables and conditions from different sources. Moving Averages (MA), Multi-condition MA (MMAs), Double MAs, Co-variance Operators, etc. are some examples of useful PTOs. After that, we can use Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or other linear ML techniques to seek the PTML model. In the non-linear cases, we can fit the PTML models using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification Trees, and other ML methods.

WWW has also affected overall growth in scientific literature that makes the process of literature review quite laborious, time consuming and cumbersome job for researchers. Hence a dire need is felt to automatically extract potential information out of immense set of scientific articles to automate the process of literature review. Therefore, in this study, aim is to present the overall progress concerning automatic information extraction from scientific articles. The information insights extracted from scientific articles are classified in two broad categories i.e. metadata and key-insights. As available benchmark datasets carry a significant role in overall development in this research domain, existing datasets against both categories are extensively reviewed. Later, research studies in literature that have applied various computational approaches applied on these datasets are consolidated. Major computational approaches in this regard include Rule-based approaches, Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, Support Vector Machines, Na\u00efve-Bayes classification and Deep Learning approaches. Currently, there are multiple projects going on that are focused towards the dataset construction tailored to specific information needs from scientific articles.

An effective solution for defining such a metric is to learn it from a set of labeled training samples. In this work, we propose a fast and scalable algorithm to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric. The Mahalanobis metric can be viewed as the Euclidean distance metric on the input data that have been linearly transformed. By employing the principle of margin maximization to achieve better generalization performances, this algorithm formulates the metric learning as a convex optimization problem and a positive semidefinite (p.s.d.) matrix is the unknown variable. Based on an important theorem that a p.s.d. trace-one matrix can always be represented as a convex combination of multiple rank-one matrices, our algorithm accommodates any differentiable loss function and solves the resulting optimization problem using a specialized gradient descent procedure. During the course of optimization, the proposed algorithm maintains the positive semidefiniteness of the matrix variable that is essential for a Mahalanobis metric. Compared with conventional methods like standard interior-point algorithms or the special solver used in large margin nearest neighbor , our algorithm is much more efficient and has a better performance in scalability.

The probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to compute sensitivities of probabilistic constraints with respect to random variables. Since the probabilistic sensitivity analysis requires only the limit state function, and not the response surface or sensitivity of the response, an efficient classification method can be used for a sampling-based RBDO. The proposed virtual support vector machine (VSVM), which is a classification method, is a support vector machine (SVM) with virtual samples. By introducing virtual samples, VSVM overcomes the deficiency in existing SVM that uses only classification information as their input. In this paper, the universal Kriging method is used to obtain locations of virtual samples to improve the accuracy of the limit state function for highly nonlinear problems. A sequential sampling strategy effectively inserts new samples near the limit state function. In sampling-based RBDO, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used for the reliability analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Since SVM is an explicit classification method, unlike implicit methods, computational cost for evaluating a large number of MCS samples can be significantly reduced. Several efficiency strategies, such as the hyper-spherical local window for generation of the limit state function and the Transformations/Gibbs sampling method to generate uniform samples in the hyper-sphere, are also applied. Examples show that the proposed sampling-based RBDO using VSVM yields better efficiency in terms of the number of required samples and the computational cost for evaluating MCS samples while maintaining accuracy similar to that of sampling-based RBDO using the implicit dynamic Kriging (D-Kriging) method.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2465835821", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124581726"}

These studies show that both the lexical representations of words and the mechanisms of lexical access are organized so that natural, systematic variation is tolerated by the perceptual system, while a general intolerance of random deviation is maintained. Lexical abstraction distinguishes between phonetic features that form the invariant core of a word and those that are susceptible to variation. Phonological inference relies on the context of surface changes to retrieve the underlying phonological form. In this article we present a model of these processes in speech perception, based on connectionist learning techniques. A simple recurrent network was trained on the mapping from the variant surface form of speech to the underlying form. Once trained, the network exhibited features of both abstraction and inference in its processing of normal speech, and predicted that similar behavior will be found in the perception of nonsense words.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for developing the efficient and flexible IDS using one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). Two-dimensional CNN methods have shown remarkable performance in detecting objects of images in computer vision area. Meanwhile, the 1D-CNN can be used for supervised learning on time-series data. We establish a machine learning model based on the 1D-CNN by serializing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predetermined time range as an invasion Internet traffic model for the IDS, where normal and abnormal network traffics are categorized and labeled for supervised learning in the 1D-CNN. We evaluated our model on UNSW\\_NB15 IDS dataset to show the effectiveness of our method. For comparison study in performance, machine learning-based Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in addition to the 1D-CNN with various network parameters and architecture are exploited. In each experiment, the models are run up to 200 epochs with a learning rate in 0.0001 on imbalanced and balanced data. 1D-CNN and its variant architectures have outperformed compared to the classical machine learning classifiers.

An important advantage of our approach is that it theoretically allows the prediction even when the contradictory cases occur. The proposed method is characterized by a deep and ordinal ensemble and a two-stage aggregation strategy. Specifically, we first set up the ensemble based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques, while the ordinal relationship is implicitly constructed among its base learners. Each base learner will classify the target face into one of two specific age groups. After achieving probability predictions of different age groups, then we make aggregation by transforming them into counting value distributions of whole age classes and getting the final age estimation from their votes. Moreover, to further improve the estimation performance, we suggest to regard the age class at the boundary of original two age groups as another age group and this modified version is named the Deep and Ordinal Ensemble Learning with Three Groups Classification (DOEL3groups). Effectiveness of this new grouping scheme is validated in theory and practice.

We model uncertain parameters like return and illiquidity of various assets using L\u2013R fuzzy numbers belonging to a power reference function family. Such usage of L\u2013R fuzzy numbers is more generic as compared to the conventional triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and is a closer representation of uncertain behavior of the asset parameters. The credibility measure which has an advantage of being self-dual as compared to usual possibility measure marks the uncertain context of the entire setup and adds a new dimension to existing studies. We use an \u201cEntropy-Cross Entropy (ECE) Algorithm\u201d, for finding the solution of the optimization problem meant for finding the best fit L\u2013R fuzzy number corresponding to uncertain asset parameters. This automates the entire subjective exercise where, otherwise, a human intervention is required for feeding the parameters required for fitting L\u2013R fuzzy number. Once the L\u2013R fuzzy number are created around various assets available for the portfolio formation, the portfolio optimization problem is solved using Hybrid Intelligent Algorithm (HIA). HIA is designed by embedding fuzzy simulation within the \u201cMIBEX-SM\u201d genetic algorithm.

Nutrients present in the soil define its fertility. Mineral nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K), Phosphorous (P) are vital for plant growth and food production. Lack of adequate knowledge amongst the farmers about the various parameters in farming like the soil fertility, amount of fertilizer to be used, leads to degradation of the overall soil quality. In this paper, we have represented a system to test the soil fertility by using the principal of colorimetry. Colorimetry is a technique in which we measure the amount of light absorbed by the color developed in the sample. An aqueous solution of the soil sample is prepared using extracting agents and is subjected to the photodiodes of the color sensor. The solution develops a color due to reaction of nutrients in the soil with chemicals. The output by the color sensor is calibrated with standard values present in the database. To verify the results obtained by the color sensor we use the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. This algorithm classifies the intensity values of the soil solutions into three class labels namely low, medium, high. After applying the Naive Bayes classifier, we can predict the accuracy of the intended system. The intended system is thus beneficial to reduce the time required for testing the soil fertility and determining the accuracy of our results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCCNT.2018.8494113", "venue": "2018 9th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)", "journal": "2018 9th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2899099518", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["37253415"], "inbound_citations": ["213183398"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53011638"}

Automatic object classification or detection methods can help a lot in case of long searches, where sonar operators may feel exhausted and therefore miss the possible object. However, most of the existing underwater object detection methods for sidescan sonar images are aimed at detecting mine-like objects, ignoring the classification of civilian objects, mainly due to lack of dataset. So, in this study, we focus on the multi-class classification of drowning victim, wreck, airplane, mine and seafloor in sonar images. Firstly, through a long-term accumulation, we built a real sidescan sonar image dataset named SeabedObjects-KLSG, which currently contains 385 wreck, 36 drowning victim, 62 airplane, 129 mine and 578 seafloor images. Secondly, considering the real dataset is imbalanced, we proposed a semisynthetic data generation method for producing sonar images of airplanes and drowning victims, which uses optical images as input, and combines image segmentation with intensity distribution simulation of different regions. Finally, we demonstrate that by transferring a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN), e.g. VGG19, and fine-tuning the deep CNN using 70% of the real dataset and the semisynthetic data for training, the overall accuracy on the remaining 30% of the real dataset can be eventually improved to 97.76%, which is the highest among all the methods.

Smart cities mitigate harmful environmental impacts and offences and bring energy-efficiency, cost saving and mechanisms for better use of resources based on ubiquitous monitoring systems.

To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a new ubiquitous visual surveillance mechanism based on classification of scene images. The proposed mechanism supports different applications including Soil, Flood, Air, Plant growth and Garbage monitoring. To classify the scene images of the monitoring systems, we introduce a new technique, which combines edge strength and sharpness to detect focused edge components for Canny and Sobel edges of the input images. For each focused edge component, a patch that merges nearest neighbor components in Canny and Sobel edge images is defined. For each patch, the contribution of the pixels in a cluster given by k-means clustering on edge strength and sharpness is estimated in terms of the percentage of pixels. The same percentage values are considered as a feature vector for classification with the help of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

The sampling point was put in the center of the zone, and the depth of the sampling point was 5cm. Soil EC was measured by a DDB-307 EC meter, and the winter wheat yield data were provided by a CASE2366 grain harvester with GPS receiver.

Results showed that there were high gray relation between soil EC and three other indexes, total nitrogen content, K + , pH of soil.

In a small case study in the south western of Germany, the TM and ALS data was investigated for plot-level volume estimation using regression tree-based method of random forest (RF) and boosting regression tree (BRT). The volume per hectare of 411 field plots were calculated using DBH and height of trees. The plot base of height statistics and canopy cover images were extracted from ALS data corresponding to grid cell size of TM images and plots. The TM data using orthorectified CIR image was georeferenced by image-to-image registration methods. The proper vegetation indices, tasselled cap, and principal components were generated on the TM bands. The RF and BRT were examined using a bootstrap learning method on the independent data sets of TM, ALS and combined images. The performances of implementations were examined using relative RMSe and Bias measures. Results showed that employing the BRT using combined ALS and TM data sets could produce more performance with RMSe of 40.56% compared to 42.93% for RF. Combining TM and height-based ALS data could also predict the most accurate volume with 40.56% RMSe than using only one of them with 42.76% and 52.82% RMSe respectively.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.proenv.2011.07.013", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia environmental sciences", "mag_id": "2001614386", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["26725165", "2561251", "92791966", "22986924"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119735820"}

Previous methods typically invert a target image back to the latent space either by back-propagation or by learning an additional encoder.

In this work, we propose a novel approach, called mGANprior, to incorporate the well-trained GANs as effective prior to a variety of image processing tasks. In particular, we employ multiple latent codes to generate multiple feature maps at some intermediate layer of the generator, then compose them with adaptive channel importance to recover the input image. Such an over-parameterization of the latent space significantly improves the image reconstruction quality, outperforming existing competitors. The resulting high-fidelity image reconstruction enables the trained GAN models as prior to many real-world applications, such as image colorization, super-resolution, image inpainting, and semantic manipulation.

First, the graph affinity (i.e., graph structure and edge weights) that indicates the appearance compatibility of two neighboring nodes is optimized based on the weighted sparse representation, in which the modality weight is introduced to leverage RGB and thermal information adaptively. Second, each node weight that indicates how likely it belongs to the foreground is propagated from others along with graph affinity. The optimized patch weights are then imposed on the extracted RGB and thermal features, and the target object is finally located by adopting the structured SVM algorithm. Moreover, we also contribute a comprehensive dataset for RGB-T tracking purpose. Comparing with existing ones, the new dataset has the following advantages: 1) Its size is sufficiently large for large-scale performance evaluation (total frame number: 210K, maximum frames per video pair: 8K). 2) The alignment between RGB-T video pairs is highly accurate, which does not need pre- and post-processing. 3) The occlusion levels are annotated for analyzing the occlusion-sensitive performance of different methods.

Sensitivity of C-band SAR in discerning the variation in canopy roughness and limited penetration capability through forest canopy have been well studied at a given frequency, polarization and incidence angle. However, the scope of C-band SAR in characterizing and monitoring forest density has not been adequately understood with polarimetric techniques. The objectives of the present study were to understand the scattering behaviour of different landcover classes and evaluate the feasibility of polarimetric SAR data classification methods in forest canopy density slicing using C-band SAR data. The RADARSAT- 2 image with fine quad-pol obtained on 27 October 2011 over Madhav National Park, Madhya Pradesh, India and its surroundings was used for the analysis. Forest patches exhibit \u03b1-angle around 45\u00b0, which means the dominant scattering mechanism is volume; entropy of one or a value close to it denotes distributed targets and low anisotropy values than all other land units, which shows a dominant first scattering mechanism. This study comparatively analysed Wishart supervized classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for classification of the forest canopy density along with other associated land-cover classes for a better understanding of the class separability. All forest density classes showed comparatively good separability in Wishart supervized classification (73.8-84.7%) and in SVM classifier (82.3-84.8%). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of SVM classifier (88.7%) over Wishart supervized classifier (87.8%) with kappa coefficient of 0.86 and 0.85 respectively.

How to apply the structural information of data to build a good classifier is a new research focus recently.

In fact, these methods do not balance all structural information's relationships both infra-class and inter-class, which directly results in these prior information not being exploited sufficiently. In this paper, we design a new Structural Twin Support Vector Machine (called S-TWSVM). Unlike existing methods based on structural information, S-TWSVM uses two hyperplanes to decide the category of new data, of which each model only considers one class's structural information and closer to the class at the same time far away from the other class. This makes S-TWSVM fully exploit these prior knowledge to directly improve the algorithm's the capacity of generalization.

In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from \u2018serialised\u2019 MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit.

The parameters of ARIMA time series model were calibrated and fitted statistically to minimize the prediction uncertainty by latest Taguchi method. Rainfall and streamflow data recorded in eight nearby gauging stations were engaged to train, forecast, and calibrate the climate hydrological models.

The next step refers to the temporary position before a final destination is reached and identifying a suitable next step in a dense crowd is challenging as there are many other moving agents that might block the path. Hence, to avoid formulating the decision of the agent's next step to proceed to a target point in an explicit manner, we therefore resort to SVMs whereby the position and velocity of the nearby agents are used as the feature vectors and the next step position as the class label. The training data is trained a priori with feature vectors and class labels supplied by human subjects. In order to produce a higher accuracy of training model, the training data is duplicated by permutation process.

Moreover, user convenience is high because non-invasive image capturing devices are used for recognition. In real environments, however, optical blur can occur while capturing finger-vein images du to both skin scattering blur caused by light scattering in the skin layer and lens focus mismatch caused by finger movement. The blurred images generated in this manner can cause severe performance degradation for finger-vein recognition. The majority of the previous studies addressed the restoration method o skin scattering blurred images; however, only limited studies have addressed the restoration of optically blurred images. Even the previous studies on the restoration of optical blur restoration have performed restoration based on the estimation of the accurate point spread function (PSF) for a specific image-capturing device. Thus, it is difficult to apply these methods to finger-vein images acquired by different devices.

The results of the experiment performed using two open databases, the Shandong University homologous multimodal traits (SDUMLA-HMT) finger-vein database and Hong Kong Polytechnic University finger-image database (version 1) confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2967771", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3002790398", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15191538", "122294391", "1841281", "45013299", "16005798", "51781895", "123483979", "6200260", "1033682", "57623436", "10773844", "41396492", "9234393", "51662768", "13148068", "174820620", "7638752", "14438318", "206771128", "11758569", "3719281", "1658773", "14124313", "206594692", "1799558", "6628106", "115963355", "4552226", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210972424"}

To accomplish this, we applied the computational biology tool Teiresias to identify motifs of variable length appearing frequently in mouse piRNA and non-piRNA sequences, respectively, and then proposed an algorithm for piRNA identification based on motif discovery, termed \"Pibomd\" by using these sequence motifs as features in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a sensitivity of 91.48% and a specificity of 89.76% on a mouse test dataset could be achieved, much better results than those reported in previously published algorithms.

Precise and accurate global cropland extent maps, indicating cropland and non-cropland areas, are starting points to develop higher-level products such as crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), cropping intensities (e.g., single, double, or continuous cropping), crop types, cropland fallows, as well as for assessment of cropland productivity (productivity per unit of land), and crop water productivity (productivity per unit of water). Uncertainties associated with the cropland extent map have cascading effects on all higher-level cropland products. However, precise and accurate cropland extent maps at high spatial resolution over large areas (e.g., continents or the globe) are challenging to produce due to the small-holder dominant agricultural systems like those found in most of Africa and Asia. Cloud-based geospatial computing platforms and multi-date, multi-sensor satellite image inventories on Google Earth Engine offer opportunities for mapping croplands with precision and accuracy over large areas that satisfy the requirements of broad range of applications. Such maps are expected to provide highly significant improvements compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser in resolution, and often fail to capture fragmented small-holder farms especially in regions with high dynamic change within and across years. To overcome these limitations, in this research we present an approach for cropland extent mapping at high spatial resolution (30-m or better) using the 10-day, 10 to 20-m, Sentinel-2 data in combination with 16-day, 30-m, Landsat-8 data on Google Earth Engine (GEE). First, nominal 30-m resolution satellite imagery composites were created from 36,924 scenes of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images for the entire African continent in 2015\u20132016. These composites were generated using a median-mosaic of five bands (blue, green, red, near-infrared, NDVI) during each of the two periods (period 1: January\u2013June 2016 and period 2: July\u2013December 2015) plus a 30-m slope layer derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation dataset. Second, we selected Cropland/Non-cropland training samples (sample size = 9791) from various sources in GEE to create pixel-based classifications. As supervised classification algorithm, Random Forest (RF) was used as the primary classifier because of its efficiency, and when over-fitting issues of RF happened due to the noise of input training data, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to compensate for such defects in specific areas. Third, the Recursive Hierarchical Segmentation (RHSeg) algorithm was employed to generate an object-oriented segmentation layer based on spectral and spatial properties from the same input data. This layer was merged with the pixel-based classification to improve segmentation accuracy. Accuracies of the merged 30-m crop extent product were computed using an error matrix approach in which 1754 independent validation samples were used. In addition, a comparison was performed with other available cropland maps as well as with LULC maps to show spatial similarity. Finally, the cropland area results derived from the map were compared with UN FAO statistics. The independent accuracy assessment showed a weighted overall accuracy of 94%, with a producer\u2019s accuracy of 85.9% (or omission error of 14.1%), and user\u2019s accuracy of 68.5% (commission error of 31.5%) for the cropland class. The total net cropland area (TNCA) of Africa was estimated as 313 Mha for the nominal year 2015.

First, we preclassify the entire remote sensing image into the water and nonwater areas via Deep U-Net, using the results of class membership probabilities as the unary potential in the CRF model. The pairwise potential of CRF is defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels, which forms a fully connected neighbor structure. Next, regional restriction is incorporated into the approach to enhance the consistency of the connected area. We use the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm to generate superpixels and correct the binary classification results by calculating their average posterior probabilities.

Web pre-fetching is the scheme where web pages are pre fetched into the intermediate server (proxy) cache before user accessing it. These two techniques can complement each other since web caching exploits the temporal locality whereas web prefetching utilizes the spatial Locality of web objects.

We created a new dataset of 254 images of edge profile cutting heads which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first publicly available dataset with enough quality for this purpose. All the inserts were segmented and their cutting edges were cropped, obtaining 577 images of cutting edges: 301 functional and 276 disposable. The proposed method is based on (1) dividing the cutting edge image in different regions, called Wear Patches (WP), (2) characterising each one as worn or serviceable using texture descriptors based on different variants of Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and (3) determine, based on the state of these WP, if the cutting edge (and, therefore, the tool) is serviceable or disposable. We proposed and assessed five different patch division configurations. The individual WP were classified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an intersection kernel. The best patch division configuration and texture descriptor for the WP achieves an accuracy of 90.26% in the detection of the disposable cutting edges.

We propose a new generator network to address this issue and show that the resulting network strikes a better balance between style and content. There are no well-defined or agreed-upon evaluation metrics for unpaired image-to-image translation. So far, the success of image translation models has been based on subjective, qualitative visual comparison on a limited number of images. To address this problem, we propose a new framework for the quantitative evaluation of image-to-illustration models, where both content and style are taken into account using separate classifiers.

A significant proportion of patients have features between DLBCL and BL and it is unclear which treatment is most applicable to this group. Many of these patients have MYC rearrangement ( MYC -R), either as the sole abnormality or \u2018dual/triple hit\u2019, which results in poor response to therapy. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has been used to identify patients with BL, however published classifiers use data from fresh/frozen tissue and stratify patients into 3 or more groups, with a significant proportion with features between DLBCL and BL, and these are not applicable in clinical decision making. ::: ::: The aim of this study was to develop a 2-way classifier that is applicable to formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies and to assess it\u2019s clinical utility in identifying patients who would benefit from high dose therapy (classically BL vs DLBCL). ::: ::: We explored different classification algorithms from published studies, and generated a 28-gene classifier, trained on published datasets GSE4732 & GSE4475, that were combined by extracting the 1924 common genes. The classifier consists of a Support Vector Machine (LibSVM) algorithm, uses Z-score normalisation and generates a probability of BL vs. DLBCL prediction. The performance of the algorithm was tested against the individual datasets it was trained on, along with additional datasets (GSE26673 & GSE17189), and a high level of precision and recall accuracy was achieved. The algorithm was then applied to Illumina Whole-Genome DASL data from 558 aggressive B-cell lymphoma samples (original diagnoses: BL, n=72, DLBCL with MYC -R (single, dual, or triple hit) n=39, DLBCL NOS, n=128, DLBCL, MYC status unknown, n=319). The GEP classifier was applied to 544 (97%) samples where GEP data were of sufficient quality for analysis. The data was further interrogated for the presence of a MYC signature, using MYC -target genes identified by Dave et al (2006), and cluster analysis identified three levels of expression of this signature across all cases. The results are summarised in the table. ::: ::: View this table: ::: ::: Table ::: ::: The concordance between the original diagnosis of DLBCL and the classifier was 99% with only 1/35 cases of DLBCL that had MYC -R classified as BL using GEP, however, there was only a 70% concordance in the diagnosis of BL. The high level of \u2018misclassified\u2019 cases is a consequence of the 2-way classifier, and it is expected that these cases would fall within the intermediate categories described by others. ::: ::: Only two genes in the MYC signature were also in the GEP classifier and the level of expression of the signature was independent of the presence of MYC -R, with a high MYC signature in only 24/63 (38%) cases diagnosed as BL and in only 4% of DLBCL cases with MYC -R. This strongly suggests that functional effects of MYC deregulation can be modified by other factors such as microRNA or altered expression of other genes. However, the data also suggests that the genes included in the MYC signature may have an indirect effect on the performance of the classifier with only 16% of tumours originally diagnosed as BL but classified as DLBCL by GEP having a high MYC signature. ::: ::: We have demonstrated that GEP can be applied to the routine diagnostic setting where FFPE tissue is often the only option and we have developed a 2-way classifier that is applicable cross-platform. Had this 2-way classification had been used to determine treatment, only 1% of patients currently regarded as DLBCL would have received intensive chemotherapy, but 30% of patients diagnosed as BL using current diagnostic methods may have been undertreated. However, this data shows that there is significant biological heterogeneity, even within the highly specific diagnostic category of BL, perhaps reflecting genetic abnormalities not routinely detected, which may be relevant to the efficacy of treatment. With multiple diagnostic technologies now available, clinical studies are needed to identify the gold standard approach for identifying patients who require intensive chemotherapy. ::: ::: Disclosures: Jack: Roche /Genentech: Research Funding. ::: ::: [1]: /embed/inline-graphic-2.gif", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.V122.21.74.74", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2980076240", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208437043"}

The load forecasting based on weather forecast data is an effective approach. The meteorological parameters are used as the key inputs of the prediction model, of which the accuracy has a great influence on the prediction loads. Obviously, there are errors between the weather forecast data and the actual weather data, but most of the existing studies ignored this issue. In order to deal with the uncertainty of weather forecast data scientifically, this paper proposes an effective approach based on the Monte Carlo Method (MCM) to process weather forecast data by using the 24-h-ahead Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for load prediction as an example. The data-preprocessing method based on MCM makes the forecasting results closer to the actual load than those without process, which reduces the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of load prediction from 11.54% to 10.92%.

This paper presents an input variable selection method for wind speed forecasting models. The candidate input variables for various leading periods are selected and random forests (RF) is employed to evaluate the importance of all variable as features. The feature subset with the best evaluation performance is selected as the optimal feature set. Then, kernel-based extreme learning machine is constructed to evaluate the performance of input variables selection based on RF. The results of the case study show that by removing the uncorrelated and redundant features, RF effectively extracts the most strongly correlated set of features from the candidate input variables.

Ultrasound examination complements other imaging modalities such as radiography, and allows more definite diagnostic tests to be conducted.

Recently, two leading ultrasound based techniques are used for the assessment of atherosclerosis: B-mode ultrasound used in measurement of carotid artery intima thickness and intravascular ultrasound. These techniques provide images in real time, portable, substantially lower in cost and no harmful ionizing radiations are used in imaging. The processing of ultrasound image takes a major role in the accurate diagnosis of the disease level.

Conditional random fields are an important class of models for accurate structured prediction, but effective design of the feature functions is a major challenge when applying CRF models to real world data. Gradient boosting, which can induce and select functions, is a natural candidate solution for the problem. However, it is non-trivial to derive gradient boosting algorithms for CRFs, due to the dense Hessian matrices introduced by variable dependencies. We address this challenge by deriving a Markov Chain mixing rate bound to quantify the dependencies, and introduce a gradient boosting algorithm that iteratively optimizes an adaptive upper bound of the objective function. The resulting algorithm induces and selects features for CRFs via functional space optimization, with provable convergence guarantees. Experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate that the mixing rate based upper bound is effective for training CRFs with non-linear potentials.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "270386715", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118530741"}

We also found that a fusion between classifiers that use spectral features and classifiers that use prosodic information usually increases the performance for discrimination between motherese and normal-directed speech (around 86% accuracy).", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-11509-7_16", "venue": "NOLISP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1498019496", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["9315987", "18491626"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35538326"}

The research uses a combination of statistical learning, feature selection methods, and multivariate statistics to determine the better prediction function approximation with features obtained from the Non Commissioned Officer Leadership Skills Inventory (NLSI) and biographical data. The research created a methodology for iteratively developing a statistical learning model. After exploring RandomForest, Support Vector Regression, and Linear Regression, the RandomForest model best predicts recruiter performance for these data. The model's performance was further enhanced by using a greedy feature selection method to determine the best subset of features that produced the best model generalization. The resulting model runs in R statistical language and is controlled within an Excel worksheet environment by using Visual Basic Application (VBA) language to call R. The end product enables general user utilization of a statistically eloquent model, normally reserved for advanced researchers, engineers, statisticians, and economists. The model represents a multi-modal relationship primarily between recruiter age and NLSI score and to a lesser degree, 34 other features. This study is a result of Army Recruiting Initiatives earlier research into the feasibility of constructing a recruiter prediction model. The model, because of Excel deployment, is convenient to use. The convenience facilitates the model's migration from Center One to, perhaps, TRADOC. The model also provides significant cost benefits to the Army. If the model is used, recruiting potentially receives those individuals with the inherent skill sets for recruiting. Equipping recruiting with the right individual should reduce the number of required recruiters because the command's gross write rate should increase.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1037/e512512010-001", "venue": "PsycEXTRA Dataset", "journal": "PsycEXTRA Dataset", "mag_id": "246606574", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["12881313"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107810130"}

The analysis presented in this paper is carried out on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data over the site of La Rochelle, France, during the campaign in December 2016. This dataset were processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from October 2016 to February 2017. Two deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based classifier methods were employed. We found that the results of RNNs clearly outperformed the classical machine learning approaches (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest).
