In this paper, we present a new algorithm to learn action models from plan traces by transferring useful information from other domains whose action models are already known. We present a method of building a metric to measure the shared information and transfer this information according to this metric. The larger the metric is, the bigger the information is transferred.

Since data is often derived from autonomous, and increasingly large data sources, it is impractical to manually curate the data, and challenging to continuously and automatically assess their quality. In this paper, we explore two main areas of quality assessment related to evolving knowledge bases: (i) identification of completeness issues using knowledge base evolution analysis, and (ii) identification of consistency issues based on integrity constraints, such as minimum and maximum cardinality, and range constraints. For the completeness analysis, we use data profiling information from consecutive knowledge base releases to estimate completeness measures that allow predicting quality issues. Then, we perform consistency checks to validate the results of the completeness analysis using integrity constraints and learning models. The approach has been tested both quantitatively and qualitatively by using a subset of datasets from both DBpedia and 3cixty knowledge bases. The performance of the approach is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score. From completeness analysis, we observe a 94% precision for the English DBpedia KB and 95% precision for the 3cixty Nice KB. We also assessed the performance of our consistency analysis by using five learning models over three sub-tasks, namely minimum cardinality, maximum cardinality, and range constraint. We observed that the best performing model in our experimental setup is Random Forest, reaching an F1 score greater than 90% for minimum and maximum cardinality and 84% for range constraints.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.12721", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.websem.2018.11.004", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2900611605", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45340081", "5120390", "28828316", "33458904", "115216452", "35740525", "1935639", "5880345", "5319735", "60457482", "26793831", "43068459", "1181640", "13297193", "7278297", "13151033", "41748848", "8429288", "140109802", "2757547", "77139", "207670313", "206787478", "55964618", "15092677", "2898750", "951336", "8716121", "8601741", "18061084", "25124923", "11452910", "286875", "13916937", "14135018", "36819329", "17383901", "9481819", "29297819", "7140359", "60833549", "1208962", "9621977", "10225186", "46066373", "14504105", "2939101", "3345528", "2208604", "18723256", "1554582"], "inbound_citations": ["189986391"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54435048"}

In this paper, a segmentation-free method utilizing Residual Network (ResNet) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is proposed to recognize Chinese and English texts in screen-rendered images. Text lines are firstly extracted from screen-rendered images to obtain feature sequences. Then, a bidirectional RNN layer is applied to model the contextual information within feature sequences and predict identification results. Finally, a CTC method is employed to calculate loss and yield the results. The proposed method can achieve the best performance on ORAND-CAR-A dataset, ORAND-CAR-B dataset and a generated dataset with the recognition accuracy of 91.89%, 93.79% and 95.67%, respectively.

This paper steps towards developing a classification system-oriented approach, where feature selection, classification and fusion-based experiments are conducted to infer which types of behaviour (verbal and nonverbal) and behaviour combinations can best discriminate between depression and non-depression. Using statistical features extracted from speaking behaviour, eye activity, and head pose, we characterise the behaviour associated with major depression and examine the performance of the classification of individual modalities and when fused. Using a real-world, clinically validated dataset of 30 severely depressed patients and 30 healthy control subjects, a Support Vector Machine is used for classification with several feature selection techniques. Given the statistical nature of the extracted features, feature selection based on T-tests performed better than other methods. Individual modality classification results were considerably higher than chance level (83 percent for speech, 73 percent for eye, and 63 percent for head). Fusing all modalities shows a remarkable improvement compared to unimodal systems, which demonstrates the complementary nature of the modalities. Among the different fusion approaches used here, feature fusion performed best with up to 88 percent average accuracy.

In order to improve present and future energy supplies, forecasting energy demands is essential. However, lack of accurate and comprehensive data set to predict the future demand is one of big problems in these countries. Therefore, using ensemble hybrid forecasting models that can deal with shortage of data set could be a suitable solution. In this paper, the annual energy consumption in Iran is forecasted using 3 patterns of ARIMA\u2013ANFIS model. In the first pattern, ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model is implemented on 4 input features, where its nonlinear residuals are forecasted by 6 different ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) structures including grid partitioning, sub clustering, and fuzzy c means clustering (each with 2 training algorithms). In the second pattern, the forecasting of ARIMA in addition to 4 input features is assumed as input variables for ANFIS prediction. Therefore, four mentioned inputs beside ARIMA\u2019s output are used in energy prediction with 6 different ANFIS structures. In the third pattern, due to dealing with data insufficiency, the second pattern is applied with AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) data diversification model and a novel ensemble methodology is presented. The results indicate that proposed hybrid patterns improve the accuracy of single ARIMA and ANFIS models in forecasting energy consumption, though third pattern, used diversification model, acts better than others and model\u2019s MSE criterion was decreased to 0.026% from 0.058% of second hybrid pattern.

Beyond a nontargeted search for PD biomarkers, we hypothesized that PD cerebrospinal fluid would show increased formation of the excitotoxin 3-hydroxykynurenine and diminished concentration of the antioxidant glutathione. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected at <4 hours postmortem from 48 pathologically-verified PD subjects and 57 comparably-aged controls. Assays involved ultra-high-performance liquid and gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry. We used univariate techniques to determine fold-changes in concentrations of biochemicals; false-discovery rates were calculated to exclude spurious findings. Data was modeled using a Support Vector Machine for analyzing compounds selected by Welch's t test. Classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation. Of 243 structurally-identified biochemicals,19 compounds differentiated PD from controls at a 20% false-discovery level. In PD, mean 3-hydroxykynurenine concentration was increased by one-third, and mean oxidized glutathione was decreased by 40% (for each, P < .01). Four of the 19 compounds differentiating PD from controls were N-acetylated amino acids, suggesting a generalized alteration in N-acetylation activity. The Support Vector Machine classification model distinguished between groups at 83% sensitivity and 91% specificity for the learning data, and at 65% and 79% from cross-validation. In this study, the first for metabolomic profiling of PD cerebrospinal fluid, we found several novel biomarkers and offer new directions for recognizing disease-specific biochemical indicators.

First, we design a novel two-stage convolutional neural network for face detection and alignment. The first stage of the network aims at searching face windows and their bounding box regression vector. The second stage merges facial candidates which are covered highly. Then, the network finishes the task of face detection and alignment whose outputs are face regions and the position of the five facial landmarks. It achieves great performance on angle of faces in image and obtains accuracy of 96.1% on AFW and 98.9% on FDDB.

Very rare doctoral thesis are so well supported by empirical analysis, very few which I have seen, this is one of them. External Reviewer Comment. , abstract: Although Support Vector Machines have been used to develop highly accurate classification and regression models in various real-world problem domains, the most significant barrier is that SVM generates black box model that is difficult to understand. The procedure to convert these opaque models into transparent models is called rule extraction. This thesis investigates the task of extracting comprehensible models from trained SVMs, thereby alleviating this limitation. The primary contribution of the thesis is the proposal of various algorithms to overcome the significant limitations of SVM by taking a novel approach to the task of extracting comprehensible models. The basic contribution of the thesis are systematic review of literature on rule extraction from SVM, identifying gaps in the literature and proposing novel approaches for addressing the gaps. The contributions are grouped under three classes, decompositional, pedagogical and eclectic/hybrid approaches. Decompositional approach is closely intertwined with the internal workings of the SVM. Pedagogical approach uses SVM as an oracle to re-label training examples as well as artificially generated examples. In the eclectic/hybrid approach, a combination of these two methods is adopted.

The objective of this paper is to investigate various classification algorithms to predict the turnover of different companies based on the Stock price. The authorized dataset for predicting the turnover was taken from www.bsc.com and included the stock market values of various companies over the past 10 years. The algorithms were investigated using the \"R\" tool. The feature selection algorithm, Boruta, was run on this dataset to extract the important and influential features for classification. With these extracted features, the Total Turnover of the company was predicted using various classification algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM and Multinomial Regression. This prediction mechanism was implemented to predict the turnover of a company on an everyday basis and hence could help navigate through dubious stock market trades. An accuracy rate of 95% was achieved by the above prediction process.

We describe a method to automatically annotate enzyme classes with disease-related information extracted from the biomedical literature for inclusion in such a database. ::: ::: Results: Enzyme names for the 3901 enzyme classes in the BRENDA database, a repository for quantitative and qualitative enzyme information, were identified in more than 100 000 abstracts retrieved from the PubMed literature database. Phrases in the abstracts were assigned to concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) utilizing the MetaMap program, allowing for the identification of disease-related concepts by their semantic fields in the UMLS ontology.

An important feature in this approach is the usage of the empirically successful cross-entropy function between the query model and document models as a document ranking function. However, this function does not follow directly from the underlying models and as such there is no justification available for its usage till date. ::: Another related and interesting observation is that the naive Bayes model for text classification uses the same multinomial distribution to model documents but in contrast, employs document-log-likelihood that follows directly from the model, as a scoring function. Curiously, the document-log-likelihood closely corresponds to cross entropy, but to an asymmetric counterpart of the function used in language modeling. It has been empirically demonstrated that the version of cross entropy used in IR is a better performer than document-log-likelihood, but this interesting phenomenon remains largely unexplained. ::: One of the main objectives of this work is to develop a theoretical understanding of the reasons for the success of the version of cross entropy function used for ranking in IR. We also aim to construct a likelihood based generative model that directly corresponds to this cross-entropy function. Such a model, if successful, would allow us to view IR essentially as a machine learning problem. A secondary objective is to bridge the gap between the generative approaches used in IR and text classification through a unified model. ::: In this work we show that the cross entropy ranking function corresponds to the log-likelihood of documents w.r.t. the approximate Smoothed-Dirichlet (SD) distribution, a novel variant of the Dirichlet distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that this new distribution captures term occurrence patterns in documents much better than the multinomial, thus offering a reason behind the superior performance of the cross entropy ranking function compared to the multinomial document-likelihood. ::: Our experiments in text classification show that a classifier based on the Smoothed Dirichlet performs significantly better than the multinomial based naive Bayes model and on par with the Support Vector Machines (SVM), confirming our reasoning. In addition, this classifier is as quick to train as the naive Bayes and several times faster than the SVMs owing to its closed form maximum likelihood solution, making it ideal for many practical IR applications. We also construct a well-motivated generative classifier for IR based on SD distribution that uses the EM algorithm to learn from pseudo-feedback and show that its performance is equivalent to the Relevance model (RM), a state-of-the-art model for IR in the language modeling framework that uses the same cross-entropy as its ranking function. In addition, the SD based classifier provides more flexibility than RM in modeling documents owing to a consistent generative framework. We demonstrate that this flexibility translates into a superior performance compared to RM on the task of topic tracking, an online classification task.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1263359207", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60614419"}

If the real dataset contains only clean images, then ostensibly, the manifold learned by the GAN should contain only clean images. In this paper, we propose to denoise corrupted images by finding the nearest point on the GAN manifold, recovering latent vectors by minimizing distances in image space. We first demonstrate that given a corrupted version of an image that truly lies on the GAN manifold, we can approximately recover the latent vector and denoise the image, obtaining significantly higher quality, comparing with BM3D. Next, we demonstrate that latent vectors recovered from noisy images exhibit a consistent bias. By subtracting this bias before projecting back to image space, we improve denoising results even further. Finally, even for unseen images, our method performs better at denoising better than BM3D. Notably, the basic version of our method (without bias correction) requires no prior knowledge on the noise variance.

We employed a simple fractionation method and filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) to characterize the cytosolic and membrane fractions of white perch ovary tissues by semiquantitative tandem mass spectrometry using label-free quantitation based on normalized spectral counts. FASP depletes both low-molecular-weight and high-molecular-weight substances that could interfere with protein digestion and subsequent peptide separation and detection. Membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to characterize due to their amphipathic nature and association with lipids. The simple fractionation we employed effectively revealed an abundance of proteins from mitochondria and other membrane-bounded organelles. We further demonstrate that support vector machines (SVMs) offer categorical classification of proteomics data superior to that of parametric statistical methods such as analysis of variance (ANOVA). Specifically, SVMs were able to perfectly (100% correct) classify samples as either membrane or cytosolic fraction during cross-validation based on the expression of 242 proteins with the highest ANOVA p-values (i.e., those that were not significant for enrichment in either fraction).

In this paper, we propose a framework to learn occupant interactions from ambient sensing technologies (e.g., sensing of variables such as sound (dB), CO2 (ppm), light intensity (lux), dry-bulb temperature (\u00b0C), relative humidity (RH%), pressure (mbar)) from both stationary and wearable devices and select the technologies and averaging windows which contain the required information for learning. In this framework, several supervised machine learning algorithms are tested on the labeled datasets and the algorithm which outperforms others is selected. Two types of sensing devices were utilized for analyses: wearable devices worn around the neck by the test subjects, and a network of stationary devices located in the test subjects' working indoor spaces. 221 employees of federal agencies housed in facilities managed by the US. General Services Administration in the mid-Atlantic and Southern states participated in this study, answering questions about their current task every hour. Overall accuracies were observed of 86.72% for wearable and stationary devices, 81.25% for only wearable-only, and 85.16% for stationary-only for prediction of the mixed multi-label classification via Random Forests algorithm. The high prediction allows for identifying subjects\u2019 tasks when training labels are not available. Predicting occupants\u2019 interactions as a main indicator of occupants\u2019 behavior have significant implications for the energy efficiency of building systems (up to 20% savings).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.096", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Energy", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2888364758", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["30704139", "42304207", "55906434", "111137413", "9269095", "9593213", "920724", "57785597", "14216441", "1603360", "2758189", "16935447", "62635383", "141916623", "17793133", "209092086", "110094087", "117637881", "110053724", "17571584", "114893272", "110823696", "111246479", "106734919", "112237352", "1453465", "158833175", "113536197", "113617687", "3313984", "110435020", "58482276", "113250574", "114236937", "115654394", "114565649", "113963956", "448430", "111341282", "53535674", "116307254", "8198438", "10238138"], "inbound_citations": ["135461097", "204969676", "199009091", "108290211"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115523147"}

Most of the previous homogeneous or heterogeneous transfer learning works aim to learn a mapping function between feature spaces based on the inherent correspondence across the source and target domains or labeled instances. However, in many real world applications, existing methods may not be robust when the correspondence across domains is noisy or labeled instances are not representative. In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning framework called Transfer Learning via Feature Isomorphism Discovery (abbreviated to TLFid), which owns high tolerance for noisy correspondence between domains as well as scarce or non-existing labeled instances. More specifically, we propose a feature isomorphism approach to discovering common substructures across feature spaces and learning a feature mapping function from the target domain to the source domain. We evaluate the performance of TLFid on the cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks.

While the association of biological macromolecules is a fundamental biochemical phenomenon crucial for the understanding of complex living systems, protein-protein docking methods aim for the computational prediction of protein complexes from individual subunits. Docking algorithms generally produce large numbers of putative protein complexes with only few of these conformations resembling the native complex structure within an acceptable degree of structural similarity. A major challenge in the field of docking is to extract near-native structure(s) out of the large pool of solutions, the so called scoring or ranking problem. A series of structural, chemical, biological and physical properties are used in this work to classify docked protein-protein complexes. These properties include specialized energy functions, evolutionary relationship, class specific residue interface propensities, gap volume, buried surface area, empiric pair potentials on residue and atom level as well as measures for the tightness of fit. Efficient comprehensive scoring functions have been developed using probabilistic Support Vector Machines in combination with this array of properties on the largest currently available protein-protein docking benchmark. The established classifiers are shown to be specific for certain types of protein-protein complexes and are able to detect near-native complex conformations from large sets of decoys with high sensitivity. Using classification probabilities the ranking of near-native structures was drastically improved, leading to a significant enrichment of near-native complex conformations within the top ranks. It could be shown that the developed schemes outperform five other previously published scoring functions.

Finally, a rapid diagnosis model of pre-diabetes was established by using CART and XGBoost. CART model results were: Specificity: 80.00% (20/25), Sensitivity: 95.00% (19/20), Accuracy: 86.67% (39/45); XGBoost model results: Specificity: 100.00% (25/25), Sensitivity were: 85.00% (17/20)), Accuracy: 93.33% (42/45).The results show that the rapid diagnosis model of pre-diabetes was established by SG-PCA-XGBoost which has the best effect.

Thanks to the increasing availability of high-quality data and the success of deep learning algorithms, machine learning (ML)-based detection and classification have been increasingly effective and adopted against sophisticated attacks. However, many of these techniques rely on the assumptions that the training and testing datasets share the same distribution and the same class labels in a stationary environment. As such assumptions may fail to hold when the system dynamics shift and new threat variants emerge in a non-stationary environment, the capability of trained ML models to adapt in complex operating scenarios will be critical to their deployment in real-world smart grid communications. To this aim, this paper proposes a domain-adversarial transfer learning framework for robust intrusion detection against smart grid attacks. The framework introduces domain-adversarial training to create a mapping between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain so that the classifiers can learn in a new feature space against unknown threats.

Compared with TWSVM, RMCV-TWSVM has better generalization ability because it takes both the empirical risk minimization principle and data distribution characteristics into consideration. While TWSVM and RMCV-TWSVM always neglect the local characteristics of each class sample. Based on the above analysis, this paper presents least squares twin support vector machine based on manifold-based within-class scatter (MWCS-LSTSVM), which not only focuses on the empirical risk minimization principle and data distribution characteristics, but also preserves the local manifold structure of each class sample.

Recently, due to the powerful ability of deep learning (DL) to extract spatial and spectral features, DL-based FE methods have shown great potentials for HSI processing. However, most of the DL-based FE methods are supervised, and the training of them suffers from the absence of labeled samples in HSIs severely. The training issue of supervised DL-based FE methods limits their application on HSI processing. To address this issue, in this paper, a novel modified generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to train a DL-based feature extractor without supervision. The designed GAN consists of two components, which are a generator and a discriminator. The generator can focus on the learning of real probability distributions of data sets and the discriminator can extract spatial\u2013spectral features with superior invariance effectively. In order to learn upsampling and downsampling strategies adaptively during FE, the proposed generator and discriminator are designed based on a fully deconvolutional subnetwork and a fully convolutional subnetwork, respectively.

The Landsat satellites have a long historical record, while the newer Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites offer higher temporal, spatial and spectral resolution. The goal of this study was to evaluate the relative benefits of single- and multi-seasonal multispectral satellite data for discriminating detailed forest alliances, as defined by the U.S. National Vegetation Classification system, in a Mediterranean-climate landscape (Sonoma County, California). Results were compared to a companion analysis of simulated hyperspectral satellite data (HyspIRI) for the same study site and reference data (Clark et al., 2018). Experiments used real and simulated S2 and Landsat 8 (L8) data. Simulated S2 and L8 were from HyspIRI images, thereby focusing results on differences in spectral resolution rather than other confounding factors. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used in a hierarchical classification of land-cover (Level 1), followed by alliances (Level 2) in forest pixels, and included summer-only and multi-seasonal sets of predictor variables (bands, indices and bands plus indices). Both real and simulated multi-seasonal multispectral variables significantly improved overall accuracy (OA) by 0.2\u20131.6% for Level 1 tree/no tree classifications and 3.6\u201325.8% for Level 2 forest alliances. Classifiers with S2 variables tended to be more accurate than L8 variables, particularly for S2, which had 0.4\u20132.1% and 5.1\u201311.8% significantly higher OA than L8 for Level 1 tree/no tree and Level 2 forest alliances, respectively. Combining multispectral bands and indices or using just bands was generally more accurate than relying on just indices for classification. Simulated HyspIRI variables from past research had significantly greater accuracy than real L8 and S2 variables, with an average OA increase of 8.2\u201312.6%. A final alliance-level map used for a deeper analysis used simulated multi-seasonal S2 bands and indices, which had an overall accuracy of 74.3% (Kappa = 0.70). The accuracy of this classification was only 1.6% significantly lower than the best HyspIRI-based classification, which used multi-seasonal metrics (Clark et al., 2018), and there were alliances where the S2-based classifier was more accurate. Within the context of these analyses and study area, S2 spectral-temporal data demonstrated a strong capability for mapping global forest alliances, or similar detailed floristic associations, at medium spatial resolutions (10\u201330 m).", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.11.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2984152560", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209923133"}

Furthermore, the probabilistic modelling approach suggests extending the Markov process to consider sub-sequences of varying length, rather than the standard fixed-length approach used in the string kernel. We give a procedure for determining which sub-sequences are informative features and hence generate a Finite State Machine model, which can again be used to obtain a Fisher kernel.

Over 50% of all marketed drugs are targeted towards a GPCR. There is considerable interest in developing an algorithm that could effectively predict the function of a GPCR from its primary sequence. Such an algorithm is useful not only in identifying novel GPCR sequences but in characterizing the interrelationships between known GPCRs. ::: ::: Results: An alignment-free approach to GPCR classification has been developed using techniques drawn from data mining and proteochemometrics. A dataset of over 8000 sequences was constructed to train the algorithm. This represents one of the largest GPCR datasets currently available. A predictive algorithm was developed based upon the simplest reasonable numerical representation of the protein's physicochemical properties. A selective top-down approach was developed, which used a hierarchical classifier to assign sequences to subdivisions within the GPCR hierarchy. The predictive performance of the algorithm was assessed against several standard data mining classifiers and further validated against Support Vector Machine-based GPCR prediction servers. The selective top-down approach achieves significantly higher accuracy than standard data mining methods in almost all cases. ::: ::: Contact: m.davies@mail.cryst.bbk.ac.uk", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17956878", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btm506", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2121847038", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9464265", "20856348", "13171812", "11349185", "10834526", "1114775", "2444932", "17442367", "17410305", "8159864", "42835524", "44877486", "6370985", "44907311", "22066870", "9822027", "36598306", "9284698", "1536643", "23308800", "20248796", "43458838", "2458205", "12002677", "13279646", "42593575", "53219580", "140109802", "96379545"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9277634"}

Complete blood count (CBC) is a quick, inexpensive, and easily accessible test which is used as the primary test for the diagnosis of anemia. However, as CBC cannot successfully discriminate between IDA and \u03b2-thalassemia, advanced techniques are needed. To date, numerous red blood cell (RBC) indices have been investigated and various parameters have been proposed for each index. In the present study, a differential diagnosis of IDA and \u03b2-thalassemia was performed by using RBC indices and machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The RBC indices were used as input parameters for the classifier and the performances of SVM and KNN were evaluated separately, in order to determine the effectivity of both techniques. Fewer parameters were given as an inputs to machine learning algorithms, and higher performance was achieved. On the other hand, a feature selection technique, the Neighborhood Component Analysis Feature Selection (NCA) algorithm, was used for selecting features from the datasets, and the parameters selected via NCA provided high performance (97% Area Under the ROC curve [AUC]). Taken together, the results indicated that the RBC indices used in the study showed higher performance compared to those reported in the literature. By using these indices, not only the individual effect of each index parameter on the machine learning model was investigated but also a different subset of features from those employed in the literature was established. In addition, as distinct from the literature, the study revealed that different CBC parameters were efficient in distinguishing between IDA and \u03b2-thalassemia in male and female patients. Accordingly, the RBC indices employed in the study can be easily and inexpensively used in clinical and daily practice for the discrimination of IDA and \u03b2-thalassemia.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.chemolab.2019.103886", "venue": null, "journal": "Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems", "mag_id": "2984187091", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209934798"}

The drivers of this behaviour are not fully understood and have been partially attributed to resource distribution and availability. Aims The study sought to develop a spatially explicit ecological-risk model for bark stripping by baboons to understand the environmental factors associated with the presence of damage in the pine plantations of the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. Methods The model was developed in Random Forests, a machine learning algorithm. Baboon damage information was collected through systematic surveys of forest plantations conducted annually. Environmental predictors included aspects of climate, topography and compartment-specific attributes. The model was applied to the pine plantations of the study area for risk evaluation. Key results The Random Forests classifier was successful in predicting damage occurrence (F1 score=0.84, area under curve (AUC)=0.96). Variable predictors that contributed most to the model classification accuracy were related to pine-stand characteristics, with the age of trees being the most important predictor, followed by species, site index and altitude. Variables pertaining to the environment surrounding a pine stand did not contribute substantially to the model performance. Key conclusions (1) The study suggests that bark stripping is influenced by compartment attributes; (2) predicted risk of bark stripping is higher in stands above the age of 5 years planted on high-productivity forestry sites, where site index (SI) is above 25; (3) presence of damage is not related to the proximity to natural areas; (4) further studies are required to investigate ecological and behavioural patterns associated with bark stripping. Implications The model provides a tool for understanding the potential extent of the risk of bark stripping by baboons within this region and it can be applied to other forestry areas in South Africa for risk evaluation. It contributes towards the assessment of natural hazards potentially affecting pine plantations and supports the development of risk-management strategies by forest managers.

Predicting long-term outcomes and stratifying risk are important for clinical decision making and designing future clinical trials. Study Design Multicenter retrospective cohort study of 2,047 patients with IgAN. Setting & Participants Derivation and validation cohorts composed of 1,022 Chinese patients with IgAN from a single center and 1,025 patients with IgAN from 18 renal centers, respectively. Predictors 36 characteristics, including demographic, clinical, and pathologic variables. Outcomes Combined event of end-stage kidney disease or 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate within 5 years after diagnostic kidney biopsy. Analytical Approach A gradient tree boosting method implemented in the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) system was used to select the 10 most important variables from 36 candidate variables. Stepwise Cox regression analysis was used to derive a simplified scoring scale model (SSM) based on these 10 variables. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed using the C statistic and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Risk stratification of the SSM was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results In the derivation and validation cohorts, 74 and 114 patients reached the outcome, respectively. XGBoost predicted the outcome with a C statistic of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80-0.88) for the validation cohort. The SSM included 3 variables: urine protein excretion, global sclerosis, and tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the SSM identified significant risk stratification (P Limitations Retrospective study design, application for other ethnic groups needs to be verified.

Most researchers in this area have focused on exploring the ability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors to identify crops. This paper uses multi-source (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8) and multi-temporal data to identify crop types. The change detection method was used to analyze spectral and indices information in time series. Significant differences in crop growth status during the growing season were found. Then, three obviously differentiated time features were extracted. Three advanced machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest, RF) were used to identify the crop types. The results showed that the detection of (Vertical-vertical) VV, (Vertical-horizontal) VH, and Cross Ratio (CR) changes was effective for identifying land cover. Moreover, the red-edge changes were obviously different according to crop growth periods. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 showed different normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes also. By using single remote sensing data to classify crops, Sentinel-2 produced the highest overall accuracy (0.91) and Kappa coefficient (0.89). The combination of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data provided the best overall accuracy (0.93) and Kappa coefficient (0.91).

In particular, our main goal is the discovery of genetic interactions based on sparse and incomplete information. In our development, we use gene data from two model organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ::: Our first method, information flow, uses circuit theory to evaluate the importance of a protein in an interactome. We find that proteins with high i-flow scores mediate information exchange between functional modules. We also show that increasing information flow scores strongly correlate with the likelihood of observing lethality or pleiotropy as well as observing genetic interactions. Our metric significantly outperforms other established network metrics such as degree or betweenness. ::: Next, we show how Bayesian sets can be applied to gain intuition as to which datasets are the most relevant for predicting genetic interactions. In order to directly apply this method to microarray data, we extend Bayesian sets to handle continuous variables. Using Bayesian sets, we show that genetically interacting genes tend to share phenotypes but are not necessarily co-localized. Additionally, they have similar development and aging temporal expression profiles. ::: One of the major difficulties in dealing with biological data is the problem of incomplete datasets. We describe a novel application of collaborative filtering (CF) in order to predict missing values in the biological datasets. We adapt the factorization-based and the neighborhood-aware CF [13] to deal with a mixture of continuous and discrete entries. We use collaborative filtering to input missing values, assess how much information relevant to genetic interactions is present, arid, finally, to predict genetic interactions. We also show how CF can reduce input dimensionality. ::: Our last development is the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM), an adapted machine learning classification method, to predicting genetic interactions. We find that SVM with nonlinear radial basis function (RBF) kernel has greater predictive power over CF. Its performance, however, greatly benefits from using CF to fill in missing entries in the input data. We show that SVM performance further improves if we constrain the group of genes to a specific functional category. ::: Throughout this thesis, we emphasize the features of the studied datasets and explain our findings from a biological perspective. In this respect, we hope that this work possesses an independent biological significance. The final step would be to confirm our predictions experimentally. This would allow us to gain new insights into C. elegans biology: specific genes orchestrating developmental and regulatory pathways, response to stress, etc. (Copies available exclusively from MIT Libraries, Rm. 14-0551, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307.

Since food shopping often requires fast decision making, due to stressful and crowded situations, the user needs a meaningful assistance, with clear and rapidly available associations from food items to dietary recommendations. This paper presents first results of the Austrian project (MANGO) which develops mobile assistance for instant, situated information access via Augmented Reality (AR) functionality to support the user during everyday grocery shopping.

This classification framework is effective where no prior knowledge of the best performing ConvNet layers is needed. This also allows flexibility in the choice of ConvNet used for feature extraction. The proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art traditional hand-crafted features in terms of classification but also obtains good results compared to other deep ConvNet features extracted from a pre-selected best layer on several anomaly and texture datasets.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIT.2017.7915495", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2612454721", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16047252", "21804891", "130535382", "44761563", "15311395", "14542261", "207763512", "14124313", "206597351", "206592484", "4309276", "10402702", "1241368", "9272368", "40299140", "206593051", "19248931", "362467", "6383532", "206592191", "7204540", "62091811", "17550693", "382735", "622815", "206763997", "11307683", "52865372", "17249609", "22423507", "39095767"], "inbound_citations": ["67185366", "211208374", "201839312", "57191934", "211205691", "164688580", "116025664", "117640365", "117640365"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43442853"}

To make a cooling channel of hot press forming die, deep drilling is a crucial process which is the drilling depth is 10 times of the drill bit diameters itself. However, the major complications that occur is the drill bits will become wear and breaks as the drilling depth keep increasing. This will impact the efficiency of the drilling process. To overcome this drawback, Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) was introduced to refining the quality of the drilling process by monitor the drilling operation, whether by direct or indirect monitoring, thus will improve tool life expectancy by notifying the operator to stop the machine. SKD 61 which is widely used as die material and High Speed Steel (HSS) drill bit was chosen. To improve accuracy, Tri-axial Accelerometer (PCB356B21) was used to detect the vibration of the drill bit when drilling process occurs. The data obtained from this experiment is in the form of acceleration and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) signal which is acceleration x, acceleration y, acceleration z, FFT x, FFT y, and FFT z. Tool condition can be classify into five types by using this data which is good condition, small corner wear, medium corner wear, large corner wear and fracture. To classify this data, machine learning method such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed. SVM performs classification process based on the data input vector that comprise as fault in the machine. The fault is then being produced as the pattern and SVM will recognize thus classify this pattern corresponding to the fault. Nevertheless, the major downside of SVM is less accurate of classifying result due to the data over-fitting. To get an accurate result, the data is compared with Artificial Neural Network machine learning. ANN performs an excellent classifying by determining the correct set of input data, number of hidden layers, target data, and applying a suitable algorithm, which is proven better classifying result than SVM in the aspect of classifying accuracy and number of errors. Consequently, ANN is the most suitable method to classify tool condition, and are capable to be employed for online tool failure detection system which is beneficial for optimizing tool condition in industries.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2593312334", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113846713"}

The task is designed to answer the question: given an audio clip spoken by an unseen person, can we picture a face that has as many common elements, or associations as possible with the speaker, in terms of identity? To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective computational framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The network learns to generate faces from voices by matching the identities of generated faces to those of the speakers, on a training set. We evaluate the performance of the network by leveraging a closely related task - cross-modal matching.

Given that virus-driven genomic variation accumulates during cervical carcinogenesis, we designed a 39 Mb custom capture panel targeting 17 HPV types and 522 mutant genes related to cervical cancer. Using capture-based next-generation sequencing, HPV integration status, somatic mutation and copy number variation were analyzed on 34 paired samples, including 10 cases of HPV infection (HPV+), 10 cases of CIN1 and 14 cases of CIN2+ (CIN2: n=1; CIN2-3: n=3; CIN3: n=9; SCC: n=1). Finally, the Machine Learning Algorithm-Random Forest was applied to build the risk stratification model for cervical precursor lesions based on CIN2+ enriched biomarkers. Generally, HPV integration events (11 in HPV+, 25 in CIN1 and 56 in CIN2+), non-synonymous mutations (2 in CIN1, 12 in CIN2+) and copy number variations (19.1 in HPV+, 29.4 in CIN1 and 127 in CIN2+) increased from HPV+ to CIN2+. Interestingly, \"common\" deletion of mitochondrial chromosome was significantly observed in CIN2+ (P value=0.009). Together, CIN2+ enriched biomarkers, classified as HPV information, Mutation, Amplification, Deletion and mitochondrial change, successfully predicted CIN2+ with average accuracy probability score of 0.814, and Amplification and Deletion ranked as the most important features.

Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a non-invasive computer-aided diagnostic technique to classify the detected plaque into the two classes.

Significant features were then used to train and test several supervised learning algorithm based classifiers.

The SVM classifier presented the highest accuracy of 88%, sensitivity of 90.2%, and specificity of 86.5% for radial basis function (RBF) kernel function. The CT images of the carotid artery provide unique 3D images of the artery and plaque that could be used for calculating percentage of stenosis. Our proposed technique enables automatic classification of plaque into asymptomatic and symptomatic with high accuracy, and hence, it can be used for deciding the course of treatment.

These systems are mainly implemented in software, and thereby they are limited in speed and power efficiency. Several optical and optoelectronic implementations have been demonstrated, in which the system has signals with an amplitude and phase. It is proven that these enrich the dynamics of the system, which is beneficial for the performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel optical architecture based on nanophotonic crystal cavities. This allows us to integrate many neurons on one chip, which, compared with other photonic solutions, closest resembles a classical neural network. Furthermore, the components are passive, which simplifies the design and reduces the power consumption. To assess the performance of this network, we train a photonic network to generate periodic patterns, using an alternative online learning rule called first-order reduced and corrected error. For this, we first train a classical hyperbolic tangent reservoir, but then we vary some of the properties to incorporate typical aspects of a photonics reservoir, such as the use of continuous-time versus discrete-time signals and the use of complex-valued versus real-valued signals. Then, the nanophotonic reservoir is simulated and we explore the role of relevant parameters such as the topology, the phases between the resonators, the number of nodes that are biased and the delay between the resonators. It is important that these parameters are chosen such that no strong self-oscillations occur. Finally, our results show that for a signal generation task a complex-valued, continuous-time nanophotonic reservoir outperforms a classical (i.e., discrete-time, real-valued) leaky hyperbolic tangent reservoir (normalized root-mean-square errors=0.030 versus NRMSE=0.127).", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24807033", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2274670", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2039517497", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2184251", "1045112", "16665195", "1165050", "7433148", "7265855", "11742987", "7571855", "10096876", "3893747", "2908076", "9631491", "2713156", "13709161", "21018971", "17162693", "23151664", "7773074", "38581666", "16054115", "166652", "23086070", "31250228", "8107967", "7049943", "37487448", "125165576", "15467150", "7342429"], "inbound_citations": ["173185271", "208616279", "110903898", "31213144", "36756342", "16788487", "212415629", "115291100", "34602", "52938888", "205651375", "133320490", "24891543", "191665887", "1384022", "115810584", "46975775", "15831853", "13845390", "6680103", "2740065", "199541604"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12922586"}

A novel incremental type-2 meta-cognitive extreme learning machine (ELM) called evolving type-2 ELM (eT2ELM) is proposed to cope with the four issues in this paper. The eT2ELM presents three main pillars of human meta-cognition: 1) what-to-learn; 2) how-to-learn; and 3) when-to-learn. The what-to-learn component selects important training samples for model updates by virtue of the online certainty-based active learning method, which renders eT2ELM as a semi-supervised classifier. The how-to-learn element develops a synergy between extreme learning theory and the evolving concept, whereby the hidden nodes can be generated and pruned automatically from data streams with no tuning of hidden nodes. The when-to-learn constituent makes use of the standard sample reserved strategy.

Among its comorbidities, diabetics are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. While HbA1c remains the primary diagnostic for diabetics, its ability to predict long-term, health outcomes across diverse demographics, ethnic groups, and at a personalized level are limited. The purpose of this study was to provide a model for precision medicine through the implementation of machine-learning algorithms using multiple cardiac biomarkers as a means for predicting diabetes mellitus development. Right atrial appendages from 50 patients, 30 non-diabetic and 20 type 2 diabetic, were procured from the WVU Ruby Memorial Hospital. Machine-learning was applied to physiological, biochemical, and sequencing data for each patient. Supervised learning implementing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) allowed binary (no diabetes or type 2 diabetes) and multiple classification (no diabetes, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes) of the patient cohort with and without the inclusion of HbA1c levels. Findings were validated through Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models with tenfold cross validation. Total nuclear methylation and hydroxymethylation were highly correlated to diabetic status, with nuclear methylation and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activities achieving superior testing accuracies in the predictive model (~ 84% testing, binary). Mitochondrial DNA SNPs found in the D-Loop region (SNP-73G, -16126C, and -16362C) were highly associated with diabetes mellitus.

When combining the most predictive factors from each set, total nuclear methylation and CpG24 methylation were the best diagnostic measures in both binary and multiple classification sets.

In this paper, aiming at learning better features specific for expression representation, we propose to construct a deep architecture, AU-inspired Deep Networks (AUDN), inspired by the psychological theory that expressions can be decomposed into multiple facial Action Units (AUs). To fully exploit this inspiration but avoid detecting AUs, we propose to automatically learn: (1) informative local appearance variation; (2) optimal way to combining local variation and (3) high level representation for final expression recognition. Accordingly, the proposed AUDN is composed of three sequential modules. Firstly, we build a convolutional layer and a max-pooling layer to learn the Micro-Action-Pattern (MAP) representation, which can explicitly depict local appearance variations caused by facial expressions.

Finally, a multi-layer learning process is employed in each receptive field respectively to construct group-wise sub-networks for higher-level representations.

Although some homologous regions explained Immunoglobulin E (IgE) cross-reactivity in groups of allergens, no universal molecular structure could be associated with allergenicity. In addition, studies have showed that cross-reactivity is not directly linked to the homology between protein sequences. Therefore, a new homology independent method needs to be developed to determine if a protein is an allergen or not. The aim of this study is therefore to differentiate sets of allergenic and non-allergenic proteins using a signal-processing based bioinformatics approach. In this paper, a new method was proposed for characterisation and classification of allergenic protein sequences. For this method hydrophobicity amino acid index was used to encode proteins to numerical sequences and Discrete Fourier Transform to extract features for each protein.

Specifically we focus on obtaining the upright orientation for man-made objects that typically stand on some flat surface (ground, floor, table, etc.), which include the vast majority of objects in our everyday surroundings. For these types of models orientation candidates can be defined according to static equilibrium. For each candidate, we introduce a set of discriminative attributes linking shape to function.

Coco (m.i.coco@sms.ed.ac.uk) Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, UK Abstract The top-down guidance of visual attention is one of the main factors allowing humans to effectively process vast amounts of incoming visual information. Nevertheless we still lack a full understanding of the visual, semantic, and memory processes governing visual attention. In this paper, we present a compu- tational model of visual search capable of predicting the most likely positions of target objects. The model does not require a separate training phase, but learns likely target positions in an incremental fashion based on a memory of previous fixations. We evaluate the model on two search tasks and show that it out- performs saliency alone and comes close to the maximal per- formance the Contextual Guidance Model can achieve (CGM, Torralba et al. 2006; Ehinger et al. 2009), even though our model does not perform scene recognition or compute global image statistics. Keywords: visual search; contextual guidance; eye-tracking; incremental learning. Introduction Virtually every human activity occurs within a visual con- text and requires visual attention in order to be success- fully accomplished (Land and Hayhoe, 2001). When pro- cessing a visual scene, humans have to localize objects, identify them, and establish their spatial relations. The eye- movements involved in these processes provide important in- formation about the cognitive processes that unfold during scene comprehension (Henderson, 2003). Studies of free viewing (e.g., Einhauser et al., 2008) have shown that scan patterns on visual scenes can vary greatly be- tween subjects. On the other hand, the task that participants have to perform has an influence on visual attention, result- ing in fixated regions being relatively consistent across par- ticipants for the same experimental conditions (e.g., Torralba et al., 2006). A number of models have been proposed to predict eye- movements during scene comprehension; they can be broadly divided into two categories. The first one consists of bottom- up models exploiting low-level visual features to predict ar- eas likely to be fixated. A number of studies have shown that certain features and their statistical unexpectedness at- tract human attention (e.g., Bruce and Tsotsos, 2006). More- over, low-level features are believed to contribute to the se- lection of fixated areas, especially in case of the visual input that does not provide any useful high-level information (e.g., Peters et al., 2005). These experimental results are captured by models that detect salient areas of visual input and predict attention in a bottom-up fashion. The best-known example is the model of Itti et al. (1998), which builds saliency maps based on color, orientation, and scale filters inspired by neu- robiological results. The second group of models assume the existence of top- down supervision of attention which contributes to the se- lection of fixation targets. Various types of such supervi- sion have been observed experimentally. Humans show the ability to learn general statistics of the appearance, position, size, spatial arrangement of objects, and their relationships (e.g., Zelinsky, 2008). They also exploit visual memory dur- ing scene comprehension tasks (e.g., Shore and Klein, 2000). Moreover, studies such as those of Chun and Jiang (1998) show that participants benefit from learning spatial arrange- ment of the objects in consecutive searches. A series of studies have also shown the importance of con- text in scene comprehension. Context not only provides infor- mation about scene layout and type (Schyns and Oliva, 1994; Renninger and Malik, 2004), but also about object presence, location, and appearance (e.g., Oliva and Torralba, 2007; Bar, 2004). A number of models have been proposed to capture context effects on visual attention; a prominent example is Torralba et al.\u2019s (2006) Contextual Guidance Model, which combines bottom-up saliency with a prior encoding global scene information. A detailed description of the Contextual Guidance Model can be found in the Background section be- low. In this paper, we introduce a model of visual attention that predicts fixation locations in visual search tasks. Our proposal is conceptually similar to the CGM, but the top-down mod- ulation of saliency in our model is based on the memory of previously found targets, rather than on global scene proper- ties. Moreover, we show that the knowledge of expected ob- ject locations can be learned incrementally, and that no prior is needed to achieve satisfactory results in predicting fixation positions. This avoids not only an expensive training phase, but also enables fast adaptation to different data sets, tasks, and experimental conditions.

Specifically, we propose a Pose-Weighted Generative Adversarial Network (PW-GAN) for photorealistic frontal view synthesis. We find frontalizing the faces in large poses (yaw angle larger than 60\u25e6) is so difficult that the results are not photorealistic and the ID information is lost. To simplify the problem, we first frontalize the face image through 3D face model, which is then used to guide the network predicting.

Although conditional distributions are multi-modal (i.e., having many modes) in practice, most cGAN approaches tend to learn an overly simplified distribution where an input is always mapped to a single output regardless of variations in latent code. To address such issue, we propose to explicitly regularize the generator to produce diverse outputs depending on latent codes. The proposed regularization is simple, general, and can be easily integrated into most conditional GAN objectives. Additionally, explicit regularization on generator allows our method to control a balance between visual quality and diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three conditional generation tasks: image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and future video prediction. We show that simple addition of our regularization to existing models leads to surprisingly diverse generations, substantially outperforming the previous approaches for multi-modal conditional generation specifically designed in each individual task.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1901.09024", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949748686,2914848199", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211532294", "215416330", "102351432", "208002892", "214713799", "208139345", "204954535", "209404854", "91184074", "212737075", "211020816"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59291917"}

It is equipped with a range of sensors which measure different, power consumption related values. These values are taken to calculate the consumption for a required house and further classify it as a high or low electrical energy consuming house.

A novel method called Multi Layered Random Forest (MLRF) that learns a binary mask for both the sources is presented. Random Forest (RF) classifiers are trained for each frequency band of a source spectrogram. A specialized set of linear transformations are applied to a local time-frequency (T-F) neighborhood of the mixture that captures relevant local statistics. A sampling method is presented that efficiently samples T-F training bins in each frequency band. We draw equal numbers of dominant (more power) training samples from the two sources for RF classifiers that estimate the Ideal Binary Mask (IBM). An estimated IBM in a given layer is used to train a RF classifier in the next higher layer of the MLRF hierarchy. On average, MLRF performs better than deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Non-Negative Sparse Coding (NNSC) in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of reconstructed audio, overall T-F bin classification accuracy, as well as PESQ and STOI scores.

CNNs are powerful for modeling complex connections between input and output data but lack the ability to directly model dependent output structures, for instance, enforcing properties such as smoothness and coherence. This drawback motivates the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), widely applied as a post-processing step in semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a learning framework that jointly trains the parameters of a CNN paired with a CRF. For this, we develop theoretical tools making it possible to optimize a max-margin objective with back-propagation. The max-margin loss function gives the model good generalization capabilities. Thus, the method is especially suitable for applications where labelled data is limited, for example, medical applications. This generalization capability is reflected in our results where we are able to show good performance on two relatively small medical datasets. The method is also evaluated on a public benchmark (frequently used for semantic segmentation) yielding results competitive to state-of-the-art. Overall, we demonstrate that end-to-end max-margin training is preferred over piecewise training when combining a CNN with a CRF.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-59129-2_3", "venue": "SCIA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2615925700", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["215632631", "5558414", "2356865", "1996665", "10787826", "15222519", "206597351", "1241368", "9237654", "53303132", "5574079", "207763512", "15835149", "14554538", "6385497", "56507745", "623137", "8401718", "4487151", "3719281", "15939599", "1549479", "13252941", "392527", "207224096", "15165760", "16055906", "1318262"], "inbound_citations": ["203578891", "38650437"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6670025"}

Recently, more and more research efforts have been dedicated to the aforementioned challenges and opportunities. This special issue includes five papers focusing on different aspects of social media mining and knowledge discovery. With the popularity of social media applications, large amounts of social images associated with user tagging information are available, which can be leveraged to boost image retrieval performance. In \u201cSparse Semantic Metric Learning for Image Retrieval\u201d, Liu et al. propose a sparse semantic metric learning method by discovering knowledge from these social media resources, and apply the learned metric to search relevant images for users. Different from traditional metric learning approaches that use similar or dissimilar constraints over a homogeneous visual space, the proposed method exploits heterogeneous information from the visual features and the tagging information of images, and formulates the learning problem as a sparse constrained one. Extensive experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In most cases, visual information can be regarded as an enhanced content of the textual document. In \u201cRelative Image Similarity Learning with Contextual Information for Internet Crossmedia Retrieval\u201d, to make image-to-image similarity being more consistent with document-to-document similarity, Jiang et al. propose a method to learn image similarities according to the relations of the accompanied textual documents. More specifically, instead of using the static quantitative relations, rank-based learning procedure by employing structural SVM is adopted, and the ranking structure is established by comparing the relative relations of textual information.

Cognitive processes detectable solely with functional imaging technologies such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can potentially provide interfaces requiring less user training than conventional electroencephalography-based CMIs. We hypothesized that visually-cued emotional induction tasks can elicit forehead hemodynamic activity that can be harnessed for a CMI.MethodsData were collected from ten able-bodied participants as they performed trials of positively and negatively-emotional induction tasks. A genetic algorithm was employed to select the optimal signal features, classifier, task valence (positive or negative emotional value of the stimulus), recording site, and signal analysis interval length for each participant. We compared the performance of Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The latency of the NIRS hemodynamic response was estimated as the time required for classification accuracy to stabilize.ResultsBaseline and activation sequences were classified offline with accuracies upwards of 75.0%. Feature selection identified common time-domain discriminatory features across participants. Classification performance varied with the length of the input signal, and optimal signal length was found to be feature-dependent. Statistically significant increases in classification accuracy from baseline rates were observed as early as 2.5 s from initial stimulus presentation.ConclusionNIRS signals during affective states were shown to be distinguishable from baseline states with classification accuracies significantly above chance levels.

The technique is based on an adaptation of least square SVM (LS-SVM) formulation but extends beyond the static image-based learning of current SVM methodologies. In applying the technique, an initial supervised offline learning phase is followed by a visual behavior data acquisition and an online learning phase during which the cluster head performs an ensemble of model aggregations based on the sensor nodes inputs. The cluster head then selectively switches on designated sensor nodes for future incremental learning. Combining sensor data offers an improvement over single camera sensing especially when the latter has an occluded view of the target object. The optimization involved alleviates the burdens of power consumption and communication bandwidth requirements. The resulting misclassification error rate, the iterative error reduction rate of the proposed incremental learning, and the decision fusion technique prove its validity when applied to visual sensor networks.

Random Forests analysis performed on the entire dataset revealed that changes in the level of the RhoGDI2 protein in PBMC and plasma ApoA4 levels were the two most obvious biomarkers of an extended fasting. Random Forests (RF) analysis of the multiplex immunoassay data revealed leptin and MMP-3 as biomarkers for extended fasting.

In order to extract the shape information, the system firstly extracts the deformed Candide facial grid that corresponds to the facial expression depicted in the video sequence. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) system designed on an Euclidean space, defined over a novel metric between grids, is used for the classification of the shape information. Regarding FAU recognition, the texture extraction method (DNMF) is applied on the differences images of the video sequence, calculated taking under consideration the neutral and the expressive frame.

It remains a challenging task when input images severe occlusions caused by, e.g., adverse camera views. Under such circumstances, biologically implausible pose predictions may be produced. In contrast, human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting geometric constraints of landmark point inter-connectivity. To address the problem, by incorporating priors about the structure of pose components, we propose a novel structure-aware fully convolutional network to implicitly take such priors into account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning of such constraints is typically challenging. Instead, inspired by how human identifies implausible poses, we design discriminators to distinguish the real poses from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible ones). If the pose generator G generates results that the discriminator fails to distinguish from real ones, the network successfully learns the priors.

Only the first slice needs to be manually labeled to train the model which then infers the next slice's segmentation. Inference result is another datum used to train the model again. The updated model then infers the third slice and the same process is carried out until the last slice.

A derivative of this phenomenon is the emergence of communities. Another phenomenon observed in numerous networks is the existence of certain agents that belong simultaneously to multiple communities. An understanding of these phenomena constitutes a central research topic of network science. In this work we focus on a fundamental theoretical question related to the above phenomena with various applications: given an undirected graph G, can we infer efficiently the latent vertex features which explain the observed network structure under the assumption of a generative model that exhibits homophily? We propose a probabilistic generative model with the property that the probability of an edge among two vertices is a non-decreasing function of the common features they possess. This property is true for many real-world networks and surprisingly is ignored by many popular overlapping community detection methods as it was shown recently by the empirical work of Yang and Leskovec [44]. Our main theoretical contribution is the first provably rapidly mixing Markov chain for inferring latent features. On the experimental side, we verify the efficiency of our method in terms of run times, where we observe that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our method is more than 2,400 times faster than a state-of-the-art machine learning method [37] and typically provides non-trivial speedups compared to BigClam [43].

A remaining question is whether we can quantify individual disease risk based on genotype data, in order to facilitate personalized prevention and treatment for complex diseases. Previous studies have typically failed to achieve satisfactory performance, primarily due to the use of only a limited number of confirmed susceptibility loci. Here we propose that sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers may improve the performance of disease risk assessment. We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a GWAS dataset generated on the Affymetrix genotyping platform for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and optimized a risk assessment model with hundreds of markers. We subsequently tested this model on an independent Illumina-genotyped dataset with imputed genotypes (1,008 cases and 1,000 controls), as well as a separate Affymetrix-genotyped dataset (1,529 cases and 1,458 controls), resulting in area under ROC curve (AUC) of approximately 0.84 in both datasets. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when limited to dozens of known susceptibility loci in the SVM model or logistic regression model. Our study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers.

Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment.

For approximating the desired value, LSSVM was employed for training, using the data derived from Wavelets and PCA models. For testing stability and reliability of the proposed model monthly data from two Pakistani rivers was collected.

Some techniques have been proposed for fast learning of SCFGs probabilities, yet, of those, only the HOLA technique can perform learning incrementally. In this paper, two incremental versions of the graphical EM (gEM) technique are proposed. The incremental gEM (igEM) and on-line incremental gEM (oigEM) allow for adapting production rule probabilities from new data, without having to retrain from the start on all accumulated training data. These new techniques are compared to HOLA using radar signal data. An experimental protocol has been defined such that the impact on performance of factors like the size of new data blocks for incremental learning, and the level of ambiguity of MFR grammars, may be observed. Results indicate that, contrary to HOLA, incremental learning of training data blocks with igEM and oigEM provides the same level of accuracy as learning from all cumulative data from scratch, even for small data blocks. As expected, incremental learning significantly reduces the overall time and memory complexities. Finally, it appears that while the computational complexity and memory requirements of igEM and oigEM may be greater than that of HOLA, they both provide a higher level of accuracy", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366232", "venue": "2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07", "journal": "2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2107743272", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121084921", "3044148", "18292764", "7857569", "61130615", "62652431"], "inbound_citations": ["62161881", "60665123"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11695723"}

The cerebellar nuclei (CN), which have afferent connections to these regions, may also play a role in the propagation of these seizures. Some CN neurons in Cacna1atottering (tg) mice phase-lock their spiking activity to the peaks of the SWDs in the EEG during the absence seizures. These CN neurons are deemed to \"participate\" in the absence seizures. To investigate if certain types of CN neuron are more likely to participate, we performed Growing Neural Gas (GNG) clustering [1], using different subsets of the feature set that consisted of CV, mean Cv2, log CV, log-interval entropy, permutation entropy, firing rate, burst index, pause ratio, burst-like spike ratio, mean ISI, mode ISI, median ISI, min ISI of the interictal parts of the spike-trains.

We selected a cluster where all neurons participated in the seizures, indicated by black crosses (+) in Fig. 1, and applied an Evolutionary algorithm (EA) to optimize excitatory and inhibitory input parameters to the CN neuron model such as spike rates, noise, burst parameters, synchronicity, synaptic weights so that the output data point of the EA moved closer to the centre of the selected cluster. The results of the EA indicated that the CN neurons that participated in absence seizures received either a synchronous, bursting inhibitory input or a synchronous, bursting excitatory input. Next, we modified the EA such that the initial input parameters of the CN neuron model resulted in an output data point nearest to the center of the selected interictal cluster, and ran the optimization to move the output data point to the center of the cluster that was formed from the ictal counter-parts of the CN neurons of the selected participating cluster. Surprisingly, a very small change in input parameters could result in a shift from the interictal to the ictal cluster centre and result in a transition to CN neuron activity as observed during seizures. However, when we blocked the Purkinje cell input to the CN neuron model by maintaining the inhibitory synaptic weight at zero, the output data point never reached the center of the ictal cluster. This suggests that blocking Purkinje cell input to the CN neuron can prevent the CN neuron from participating in the absence seizure.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4699018", "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/1471-2202-16-S1-P280", "venue": "BMC Neuroscience", "journal": "BMC Neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2352094497", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["1500966", "27371602"], "inbound_citations": ["27371602"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27371602"}

However, this technique cannot be applied to photos already taken and does not work well for whole-body scenes where the subject is at a distance from the cameras. In this work, we introduce an automatic system that achieves portrait DoF rendering for monocular cameras. Specifically, we first exploit Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the relative depth and portrait segmentation maps from a single input image. Since these initial estimates from a single input are usually coarse and lack fine details, we further learn pixel affinities to refine the coarse estimation maps. With the refined estimation, we conduct depth and segmentation-aware blur rendering to the input image with a Conditional Random Field and image matting. In addition, we train a spatially-variant Recursive Neural Network to learn and accelerate this rendering process.

The problem is difficult because genome-wide association data is very high dimensional and a large portion of SNPs in the data is irrelevant to the disease. Advanced machine learning methods have been successfully used in Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identification of genetic variants that have relatively big effects in some common, complex diseases. Among them, the most successful one is Random Forests (RF). Despite of performing well in terms of prediction accuracy in some data sets with moderate size, RF still suffers from working in GWAS for selecting informative SNPs and building accurate prediction models. In this paper, we propose to use a new two-stage quality-based sampling method in random forests, named ts-RF, for SNP subspace selection for GWAS. The method first applies p-value assessment to find a cut-off point that separates informative and irrelevant SNPs in two groups. The informative SNPs group is further divided into two sub-groups: highly informative and weak informative SNPs. When sampling the SNP subspace for building trees for the forest, only those SNPs from the two sub-groups are taken into account.

The technology to enable such an application is discussed and evaluated for the more general use in ITS mobile applications. Two main problems present themselves when building user-centric ITS mobile applications: the first has to do with knowing the state of the environment variables as captured by relevant sensing hardware, and the second has to do with relaying the right amount of information to the user to achieve the purpose of the application. For the first, we present a middleware architecture that abstracts sensor data into an HTTP interface to allow data consumers to discover and bind to data producers. For the second we present user preference adaptive services that would enable the application to learn from past user experience and adapt its user interaction to meet user preferences. Both research efforts are combined to field test a Smartphone traffic safety application system that is enabled by the middleware and that leverages the user preference adaptive services to enhance user experience and improve driver safety. The middleware is implemented and tested on three types of traffic mobility and safety applications to measure its performance. The performance measurements show the middleware to be efficient enough for road safety and congestion relief applications by limiting the overhead on the system to the order of 100 msec.A field test consisting of 9 drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area is conducted using a Smartphone traffic safety application built on the middleware. Results from the field test show that driver safety on the highway can be improved through a soft-safety warning of slow traffic 1-mile ahead on the driver's route. Data from the field test is then fed to a couple of user preference adaptive services to improve user experience of the Smartphone application. In the first service we construct a Support Vector Machine learning engine for each driver and predict to 75% accuracy their classification of favorable vs. non-favorable alerts.

One important class of probabilisitic graphical models is the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which has distinct advantages over traditional Markov Random Fields (MRF), including: no independence assumption is made over the observation, and local and pairwise potential features can be defined with flexibility. Conventional methods for hyperspectral image classification utilize all spectral bands and assign the corresponding raw intensity values into the feature functions in CRFs.

To mitigate these problems, we propose a novel processing method for hyperspectral image classification by incorporating a lower dimensional representation into the CRFs.

The prediction and prevention of antibody amyloidogenesis are helpful for restoring and enhancing therapeutic effects. Due to a large number of possible germlines, the existing method is not practical to predict sequences of novel germlines, which establishes individual models for each known germline. This study proposes a first automatic and across-germline prediction method (named AbAmyloid) capable of predicting antibody amyloidogenesis from sequences. Since the amyloidogenesis is determined by a whole sequence of an antibody rather than germline-dependent properties such as mutated residues, this study assess three types of germline-independent sequence features (amino acid composition, dipeptide composition and physicochemical properties). AbAmyloid using a Random Forests classifier with dipeptide composition performs well on a data set of 12 germlines. The within- and across-germline prediction accuracies are 83.10% and 83.33% using Jackknife tests, respectively, and the novel-germline prediction accuracy using a leave-one-germline-out test is 72.22%. A thorough analysis of sequence features is conducted to identify informative properties for further providing insights to antibody amyloidogenesis. Some identified informative physicochemical properties are amphiphilicity, hydrophobicity, reverse turn, helical structure, isoelectric point, net charge, mutability, coil, turn, linker, nuclear protein, etc. Additionally, the numbers of ubiquitylation sites in amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic antibodies are found to be significantly different. It reveals that antibodies less likely to be ubiquitylated tend to be amyloidogenic.

However, this telegraph signal is often corrupted by impulsive disturbance and exhibits serious frequency deviation due to the poor High-frequency channel.

To enhance its automatic recognition and provide a reliable substitute for human effort, an automatic detection and recognition system is proposed. The system presented here first utilizes a robust extension of Kalman filter to approximate the time-varying CW telegraph waveform in the presence of impulsive interference.

In this paper, we propose a novel Voice-Visual Cross-Modal Hashing (V2CMH) method, which can generate hash codes with low storage memory and fast retrieval properties. Specially, the proposed V2CMH method can leverage deep feature similarity to establish the semantic relationship between voices and images.

Perhaps the most popular form of meta-learning is transfer learning, which consists of transferring knowledge acquired by a machine learning algorithm in a previous learning task to increase its performance faster in another and similar task [3].

This results in a poor performance of the methods trained on one sensor and applied to the new one.

The detection performance is heavily dependent on the representation capability of the extracted features. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made a breakthrough for various applications in nature images. However, it is problematic to directly apply CNN to perform object detection in VHR optical remote sensing images due to the problem of object rotation variations. To address this issue, a novel rotation invariant probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (RI-pLSA) model is proposed to learn latent semantic representations for object detection. This is achieved by imposing a rotation-invariant regularization term on the objective function of pLSA to enforce the learned representation from all rotations of the same sample to be as consistent as possible. Additionally, the proposed RI-pLSA model takes the CNN features as input, which generates more powerful semantic representation for object detection.

However, the representations learned in DNNs are typically hard to interpret, especially the ones learned in dense layers. One crucial issue is that neurons within each layer of DNNs are conditionally independent with each other, which makes the co-training and analysis of neurons at higher modularity difficult. In contrast, the dependency patterns of biological neurons in the human brain are largely different from those of DNNs. Neuronal assembly describes such neuron dependencies that could be found among a group of biological neurons as having strong internal synaptic interactions, potentially high semantical correlations that are deemed to facilitate the memorization process. In this paper, we show such a crucial gap between DNNs and biological neural networks (BNNs) can be bridged by the newly proposed Biologically-Enhanced Artificial Neuronal assembly (BEAN) regularization that could enforce dependencies among neurons in dense layers of DNNs without altering the conventional architecture. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that BEAN enables the formations of interpretable and biologically plausible neuronal assemblies in dense layers and consequently enhances the modularity and interpretability of the hidden representations learned. Moreover, BEAN further results in sparse and structured connectivity and parameter sharing among neurons, which substantially improves the efficiency and generalizability of the model.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.13698", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2976442878", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["393948", "145420464", "4973749", "2617020", "6719686", "2780876", "1241368", "2238772", "206594692", "144400005", "125571713", "14136028", "49571056", "6628106", "18268744", "195908774", "10137788", "14542261", "6278891", "215211715", "38167084", "6149044", "2211219", "14217653", "189900", "3603485", "14124313", "309759", "2808203", "9100443", "4429113", "4852047", "702279", "4110304", "47014473"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203593281"}

First, the water droplet image of the rubber conveyor belt is input into the generative network composed of a cyclic visual attentive network and an autoencoder with skip connections, and an image of removing water droplets and an attention map for detecting the position of the water droplet are generated. Then, the generated image of removing water droplets is evaluated by the attentive discriminant network to assess the local consistency of the water droplet recovery area.

Here, we adapt protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to examine the DNA-binding characteristics of two HNF4\u03b1 species (rat and human) and isoforms (HNF4\u03b12 and HNF4\u03b18) in a high-throughput fashion. We identified \u223c1400 new binding sequences and used this dataset to successfully train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model that predicts an additional \u223c10,000 unique HNF4\u03b1-binding sequences; we also identify new rules for HNF4\u03b1 DNA binding. We performed expression profiling of an HNF4\u03b1 RNA interference knockdown in HepG2 cells and compared the results to a search of the promoters of all human genes with the PBM and SVM models, as well as published genome-wide location analysis. Using this integrated approach, we identified \u223c240 new direct HNF4\u03b1 human target genes, including new functional categories of genes not typically associated with HNF4\u03b1, such as cell cycle, immune function, apoptosis, stress response, and other cancer-related genes.

Semantic annotation of visual content in large collections is therefore essential if ease of access and use is to be ensured. Classification of images into broad categories such as indoor/outdoor, building/non-building, urban/landscape, people/no-people, etc., allows us to obtain the semantic labels without the full knowledge of all objects in the scene. ::: Inferring the presence of high-level semantic concepts from low-level visual features is a research ::: topic that has been attracting a significant amount of interest lately. However, the power of lowlevel visual features alone has been shown to be limited when faced with the task of semantic scene classification in heterogeneous, unconstrained, broad-topic image collections. Multi-modal fusion or combination of information from different modalities has been identified as one possible way of overcoming the limitations of single-mode approaches. In the field of digital photography, the incorporation of readily available camera metadata, i.e. information about the image capture conditions stored in the EXIF header of each image, along with the GPS information, offers a way to move towards a better understanding of the imaged scene. ::: In this thesis we focus on detection of semantic concepts such as artificial text in video and large buildings in digital photographs, and examine how fusion of low-level visual features with selected camera metadata, using a Support Vector Machine as an integration device, affects the performance of the building detector in a genuine personal photo collection. We implemented two approaches to detection of buildings that combine content-based and the context-based information, and an approach to indoor/outdoor classification based exclusively on camera metadata. An outdoor detection rate of 85.6% was obtained using camera metadata only. The first approach to building detection, based on simple edge orientation-based features extracted at three different scales, has been tested on a dataset of 1720 outdoor images, with a classification accuracy of 88.22%. The second approach integrates the edge orientation-based features with the camera metadata-based features, both at the feature and at the decision level. The fusion approaches have been evaluated using an unconstrained dataset of 8000 genuine consumer photographs. The experiments demonstrate that the fusion approaches outperform the visual features-only approach by of 2-3% on average regardless of the operating point chosen, while all the performance measures are approximately 4% below the upper limit of performance. The early fusion approach consistently improves all performance measures.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2111728367", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129136153"}

However, the great variability in gestures, both in time, size, and position, as well as interpersonal differences, makes the recognition task difficult. With their power in modeling sequence data and processing variable length sequences, modeling hand gestures using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) is a natural extension. On the other hand, discriminative methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), compared to model based approaches such as HMMs, have flexible decision boundaries and better classification performance. By extracting features from gesture sequences via Fisher Kernels based on HMMs, classification can be done by a discriminative classifier. We compared the performance of this combined classifier with generative and discriminative classifiers on a small database of two handed gestures recorded with two cameras. We used Kalman tracking of hands from two cameras using center-of-mass and blob tracking. The results show that (i) blob tracking incorporates general hand shape with hand motion and performs better than simple center-of-mass tracking, and (ii) in a stereo camera setup, even if 3D reconstruction is not possible, combining 2D information from each camera at feature level decreases the error rates, and (iii) Fisher Score methodology combines the powers of generative and discriminative approaches and increases the classification performance.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/11848035_23", "venue": "MRCS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1536692980", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18440098", "7185733", "1107285", "14336127", "59841901", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["431628", "17984998", "18701757", "10741029", "34550483", "11669767", "2923604", "15387721", "12600691"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17815994"}

Though optic cup is characterized by the drop in depth from the disc boundary, most existing methods segment the two structures separately and rely only on color and vessel kink based cues due to the lack of explicit depth information in color fundus images. Methods We propose a novel boundary-based Conditional Random Field formulation that extracts both the optic disc and cup boundaries in a single optimization step. In addition to the color gradients, the proposed method explicitly models the depth which is estimated from the fundus image itself using a coupled, sparse dictionary trained on a set of image-depth map (derived from Optical Coherence Tomography) pairs. Results The estimated depth achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.80 with respect to the ground truth. The proposed segmentation method outperformed several state-of-the-art methods on five public datasets. The average dice coefficient was in the range of 0.87\u20130.97 for disc segmentation across three datasets and 0.83 for cup segmentation on the DRISHTI-GS1 test set. The method achieved a good glaucoma classification performance with an average AUC of 0.85 for five fold cross-validation on RIM-ONE v2. Conclusions We propose a method to jointly segment the optic disc and cup boundaries by modeling the drop in depth between the two structures.

Component failures in cloud systems are very familiar phenomena. However, large cloud service providers' data centers should be designed to provide a certain level of availability to the business system. Infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) cloud delivery model presents computational resources (CPU and memory), storage resources and networking capacity that ensures high availability in the presence of such failures.

The following stepwise algorithm was developed to identify the blueberry fruit: (1) A fruit training set was constructed using 1374 patches cropped from the original colour images. (2) HOG (Histogram Oriented Gradients) feature vectors were calculated from these patches, and a linear SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier was trained to detect fruit-like regions rapidly.

Therefore, the prediction performances of these methods are highly dependent on the quality of such interactions which are usually predicted by computational methods. Meanwhile, machine learning-based methods usually formulate the disease miRNA prediction as a classification problem, where novel associations between disease and miRNA are predicted based on known disease-miRNA associations. However, those methods are mainly based on single binary classifiers; therefore, they have a limitation in prediction performance. In this study, we proposed a new method, namely RFMDA, to predict disease-associated miRNAs. Our method based on Random Forest (RF), an ensemble technique, where the final classifier is constructed by multitude of decision trees, to perform the prediction. In order to compare with other previous methods, we use the same procedure to build training samples, where positive training samples are known disease-miRNA associations. In addition, features of each sample measure either functional or phenotypical similarities between miRNAs or phenotypes, respectively. Simulation results showed that RFMDA outperformed previous learning-based methods including two binary classifiers (i.e., Naive Bayes and two-class Support Vector Machines) and one semi-supervised classifier (i.e., Regularized Least Square).

One Class Random Forests are shown to perform well in comparison to other methods, and in particular to maintain stable performance in higher dimension, while the other algorithms may fail.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2013.05.022", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1981143068", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5414403", "2545890", "2915472", "5898914", "42546822", "17052489", "21189227", "59941878", "207172599", "12946615", "8403942", "36784649", "2478172", "17366789", "17490415", "207160159", "18555984", "58387830", "14121663", "2914537", "58441702", "32184593", "60981168", "21275597", "207566367", "11992173", "6604929", "121730268", "18433487", "28637672", "207576208", "1929844", "2110475", "26615788", "10029477", "56776745", "61437731", "14463568", "8888702", "8154850", "207738357", "15137276", "16609273", "11860755", "206420153", "58489517", "209099422", "6923178", "60538272", "18019062", "17652870", "44867817", "683036", "2619125", "14996010", "14755863", "62145540", "64704896", "120581754", "122009246", "10693225", "15112547", "18946819", "15390394", "16041000"], "inbound_citations": ["10464217", "181679403", "21495356", "14518730", "52894300", "195811815", "152712140", "16067425", "13017894", "33267773", "14197117", "52117892", "3428911", "12691358", "34016364", "14245174", "55890973", "13973394", "203605684", "212633615", "12000198", "203852680", "7378246", "57361112", "209449385", "16736708", "17876141", "206913368", "88524835", "15195515", "5759348", "59435225", "14496458", "28758739", "15686864", "46887848", "126415389", "58671729", "214765109", "27977659"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15107573"}

The electric load cannot be exactly predicted only by a single model, because the short-term electric load is disturbed by several external factors, leading to the characteristics of volatility and instability. To end this, this paper proposes a hybrid model based on wavelet transform (WT) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), which is optimized by an improved cuckoo search (CS). To improve the accuracy of prediction, the WT is used to eliminate the high frequency components of the previous day\u2019s load data.

However it tends to be biased when dealing with multiple types of input variable, and correlated variables. To fix the bias, additional implementations of random forests are needed, such as using conditional inference trees, and conditional permutation.

Fault diagnosis on the transmission line conventionally is implemented either for detection and classification or detection and location of fault only. This leads to time consuming either to locate or classify fault. None of the researchers perform detection, classification and location of fault simultaneously due to huge data transactions and delays. To ensure the availability of supplies, the control centre requires fast and complete information data for immediate follow-up. Among typical intelligent techniques which are normally applied include Fuzzy Logic (LK), Back Propagation Neural Network (RNRB), Support Vector Machines. This thesis develops a fault diagnosis based on the hybrid intelligent algorithms for detection, classification and location of fault simultaneously. The proposed technique is a combination of RNRB and LK techniques known as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SINKUS). SINKUS algorithm has been proposed to enhance the integrated data training for detection, classification and location of faults in power system transmission lines. For each of the stated assignment, four different SINKUS structures were developed producing a total of twelve SINKUS structures, each with six inputs and fuzzified using triangular membership function. During fault detection the system detects the affected phase through four different SINKUS structures and feeds the information to the next stage for classification. At this stage, the system is able to classify the type of the fault in a detected phase, using another four different SINKUS structures. On successful classification, another group of four SINKUS structures can be able to position the fault location. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on 13-bus IEEE Test System, 118-bus IEEE Test System and the Riau Power System. The types of fault performed in the diagnosis are symmetrical and asymmetrical faults. The simulation results are compared with the LK and the RNRB techniques to verify its performance. From the observed results, it is found that the relay operating time using SINKUS technique is only within 0.11 to 0.16 seconds or has been reduced to about 20% to various scales of power systems with 99.95% accuracy. Hence, the proposed technique is able to provide complete, fast and accurate fault information and can be applied to large-scale power system.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2920419045", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86586958"}

Ground objects that are intact and significantly different from collapsed buildings, such as intact buildings, pavements, shadows, and vegetation, were first extracted using the post-event VHR image and lidar data and masked out. Collapsed buildings were then extracted by classifying the combined bi-temporal VHR images and texture images of the remaining area using a one-class classifier, the One-Class Support Vector Machine OCSVM. A post-processing procedure was adopted to refine the obtained result. The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated and compared to two existing methods in Port au Prince, Haiti, which was heavily hit by an earthquake in January 2010. In the two comparative methods, data for the whole study area were directly used. In the first method, collapsed buildings were extracted directly using the OCSVM, while in the second method, buildings and pavements were removed from the extraction result of the first method. The results showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed the existing methods, with increases of 21% and 40%, respectively, in the kappa coefficient.

Our approach involves determining the semantic category of the expression. It also includes the classification of the opinion expression into positive or negative and the classification of its intensity into high, medium and low. Our method relies on wide range of features which are used in the literature like n-grams, morphological, stylistic features, etc. In addition, we propose new features inspired from contextual, semantic information and others specific for Arabic language. In the same context, we try to have a good contribution in opinion mining in Arabic by proposing to use Conditional Random Fields as a discriminative model. We carry out many experiments by combining at the same time different set of features to find the best combination that yield the best results. We evaluate our method at the expression level using a corpus of Arabic news articles. Our method achieves a good result that reaches 84.93% for contextual polarity classification and 87.54% for semantic opinion expression categorization.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3038884.3038906", "venue": "MedPRAI-2016", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2596306152", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3073088", "11657346", "10467454", "108121568", "16195614", "19575018", "34119395", "13886408", "16567576", "12104996", "12826020", "18397233", "196020088", "54934748", "114955219", "2408452", "16768404", "12202858", "6248482", "207178694", "8551727", "10887722", "16310031", "71139650", "60902925", "1362435", "14516398"], "inbound_citations": ["211128781"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6814857"}

In this paper, a novel random-walk based label propagation community detection algorithm (RWLPA) is proposed, which uses the distribution of position probability of random walker to measure the importance of nodes. Moreover, the sum of common neighbor's weight has been introduced to merge the sub-communities. RWLPA can obtain a stable community detection result. Evaluations have been done in four datasets.

This paper focuses on detecting those words which are unfamiliar to the users while reading using Electroencephalography (EEG). In particular, a word-familiarity prediction approach based on EEG signals from the user\u2019s brain waves has been developed. Word-familiarity refers whether a user is familiar with the word or not while reading the text. The recorded signals have been processed using Wavelet decomposition technique and four features, namely mean, standard deviation, Root Mean Square (RMS) and power have been computed from beta and gamma frequency bands. The prediction of word-familiarity has been performed using Random Forest (RF) classifier. Next, a decision fusion approach has also been used to boost the prediction performance. A dictionary based pop-up window has been developed to provide the meaning of the word when a user is found to be unfamiliar with the text. EEG dataset of 12 users has been developed while they are reading 25 words. The results show that the characteristics of brain waves at the time of unknown word perception can be detected, i.e., when the user comes across an unknown word then the pattern of his brain waves comes out to be totally different from the pattern when he is familiar with the word. Similarly, the pattern of brain waves has been found to be different for the word for which the user has confusion in his mind. An accuracy of 82% has been recorded using the proposed classifier combination approach. Finally, a comparative study with other popular classification technique is also discussed.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.11.003", "venue": "Cognitive Systems Research", "journal": "Cognitive Systems Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2775750914", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214666600", "195811850", "211836161", "71150795"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4386650"}

Despite the simplicity of Judet and Letournel classification system, accurate classification of acetabular fracture remains difficult and challenging even for expert surgeons. A literature review have shown that several authors have developed diagnostic algorithms to assist students, residents, radiologists, and surgeons in classifying acetabular fractures according to Judet and Letournel system, but the literature does not mention, as far as we know, any application that automatically diagnoses and recognizes the pattern of acetabular fractures based on conventional radiographs. This paper concerns the first step towards such application which consists of recognizing one major anatomical landmark on conventional radiographs, the iliopectineal line.

Improvement of the resolution and ecological validity of seafloor habitat distribution models has, for the most part, paralleled developments in new generations of acoustic survey tools such as multibeam echosounders. While sonar methods have been well demonstrated to provide useful proxies of the relatively static geophysical patterns that reflect distribution of benthic species and assemblages, the spatially and temporally variable influence of hydrodynamic energy on habitat distribution have been less well studied. Here we investigate the role of wave exposure on patterns of distribution of near-shore benthic habitats. A high resolution spectral wave model was developed for a 624 km2 site along Cape Otway, a major coastal feature of western Victoria, Australia. Comparison of habitat classifications implemented using the Random Forests algorithm established that significantly more accurate estimations of habitat distribution were obtained by including a fine-scale numerical wave model, extended to the seabed using linear wave theory, than by using depth and seafloor morphology information alone. Variable importance measures and map interpretation indicated that the spatial variation in wave induced bottom orbital velocity was most influential in discriminating habitat the classes containing canopy forming kelp Ecklonia radiata, a foundation kelp species that affects biodiversity and ecological functioning on shallow reefs across temperate Australasia.

It can detect target with size less than a pixel by estimating its abundance fraction resident in each pixel. In order for the this approach to be effective, the number of bands must be larger than or equal to that of signatures to be classified, i.e., the number of equations should be no less than the number of unknowns. This ensures that there are sufficient dimensions to accommodate orthogonal projections resulting from the individual signatures. It is known as band number constraint (BNC). Such inherent constraint is not an issue for hyperspectral images since they generally have hundreds of bands, which is more than the number of signatures resident within images. However, this may not be true for multispectral images where the number of signatures to be classified might be greater than the number of bands. In order to relax this constraint, an extension of the least square approach is presented. With a set of least square filters that are nonlinearly combined, endmember detection for multispectral images can be realized. Furthermore, to detect targets in unknown background is a greater challenge. That is the well known Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) programs. In this paper, we also proposed a Multispectral Target Generation Process (MTGP) that will automatic search for potential targets in the image scene.

This work explores the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for the purpose of link load forecast. SVR works well in many learning situations, because they generalize to unseen data, and are amenable to continuous and adaptive online learning - an extremely desirable property in network environments. Motivated by the encouraging results recently gathered by means of SVR on other networking applications, our aim is to enlighten whether SVR is also successful for the prediction of network links load at short time scales. We consider the problem of link load forecast based only on its past measurements, which is referred to as ''embedded process'' regression in the SVR lingo, and adopt a hands-on approach to evaluate SVR performance. In more detail, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the parameters involved, assess the computational complexity for training and validation, dig into the correlation structure of the prediction errors and evaluate techniques to extend the forecasting horizon. Our finding is that accuracy results are close enough to be tempting, but not enough to be convincing.

The discriminative potential of the existing soil/bareness indexes was assessed by collecting globally distributed reference data belonging to major land cover types. The existing soil/bareness indexes parameterized at the local scale did not work satisfactorily everywhere at the global level. A new technique called the Biophysical Image Composite (BIC) is proposed in the research by exploiting time-series of the multi-spectral data to capture global-scale barren land attributes effectively. The BIC is a false color composite image made up of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), short wave infrared reflectance, and green reflectance, which were specially selected from the highest vegetation activity period by avoiding signals from the seasonal snowfall. The drastic contrast between the barren lands and vegetation as exhibited by the BIC provides a robust extraction and mapping of the barren lands, and facilitates its visual interpretation. Random Forests based supervised classification approach was applied on the BIC for the mapping of global barren lands. A new global barren land cover map of year 2013 was produced with high accuracy. The comparison of the resulted map with an existing map of the same year showed a substantial discrepancy between two maps due to methodological variation. To cope with this problem, the BIC based mapping methodology, with a special account of the land surface phenological changes, is suggested to standardize the global-scale estimates and mapping of the barren lands.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/ijgi5120225", "venue": "ISPRS Int.

The evolving nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of time, should represent both the static node features and the evolving topological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal as well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate temporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature interactions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task, and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset.

In this paper, we focus on alarms in the Intensive Care Unit and especially on the use of machine learning techniques for the creation of alarms for the ventilator support of patients. The aim is to study a method to enable timely interventions for intubated patients and prevent complications induced by high Driving Pressure (\u0394P) and lung strain during mechanical ventilation. The relation between the \u0394P and the total set of the ventilator parameters was examined and resulted in a predictive model with bimodal implementation for the short-term prediction of the \u0394P level (high/low). The proposed method includes two sub-models for the prediction of future \u0394P level based on the current level being high or low, named as cH and cL, respectively. Based on this method, for both sub-models, an alarm will be triggered when the predicted \u0394P level considered as high. In this vein, three classifiers (the Random Forest, the Linear Support Vector Machine and the Kernel Support Vector Machine) were tested for each sub-model. To adjust the highly unbalanced classes, four different sampling methods were considered: the downsampling, the upsampling, the smote sampling, and the rose sampling. For the cL sub-model the combination of Linear Support Vector Machine with smote sampling had the best performance, resulting in Accuracy 93%, while the cH sub-model reached best performance, Accuracy 73 %, with Kernel Support Vector Machine combined with the downsampling method. The results are positive towards the generation of new alarms in mechanical ventilation.

The ability of both techniques was evaluated using a case study of a riverine flood event in 2010 in a heterogeneous Mediterranean region, for which TM imagery acquired shortly after the flood event was available. For the two classifiers, both linear and non-linear (kernel) versions were utilised in their implementation. The ability of the different classifiers to map the flooded area extent was assessed on the basis of classification accuracy assessment metrics. Results showed that rkFDA outperformed SVMs in terms of accurate flooded pixels detection, also producing fewer missed detections of the flooded area. Yet, SVMs showed less false flooded area detections. Overall, the non-linear rkFDA classification method was the more accurate of the two techniques (OA = 96.23%, K = 0.877). Both methods outperformed the standard Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) thresholding (OA = 94.63, K = 0.818) by roughly 0.06 K points. Although overall accuracy results for the rkFDA and SVMs classifications only showed a somewhat minor improvement on the overall accuracy exhibited by the NDWI thresholding, notably both classifiers considerably outperformed the thresholding algorithm in other specific accuracy measures (e.g. producer accuracy for the \u201cnot flooded\u201d class was ~10.5% less accurate for the NDWI thresholding algorithm in comparison to the classifiers, and average per-class accuracy was ~5% less accurate than the machine learning models). This study provides evidence of the successful application of supervised machine learning for classifying flooded areas in Landsat imagery, where few studies so far exist in this direction.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a theoretically superior machine learning methodology with great results in classification of remotely sensed datasets. Determination of optimal parameters applied in SVM is still vague to some scientists. In this research, it is suggested to use the Taguchi method to optimize these parameters. The objective of this study was to detect tree crowns on very high resolution (VHR) aerial imagery in Zagros woodlands by SVM optimized by Taguchi method. A 30 ha plot of Persian oak ( Quercus persica ) coppice trees was selected in Zagros woodlands, Iran. The VHR aerial imagery of the plot with 0.06 m spatial resolution was obtained from National Geographic Organization (NGO), Iran, to extract the crowns of Persian oak trees in this study. The SVM parameters were optimized by Taguchi method and thereafter, the imagery was classified by the SVM with optimal parameters. The results showed that the Taguchi method is a very useful approach to optimize the combination of parameters of SVM. It was also concluded that the SVM method could detect the tree crowns with a KHAT coefficient of 0.961 which showed a great agreement with the observed samples and overall accuracy of 97.7% that showed the accuracy of the final map.

Typically, the morphology of wear particles is evaluated qualitatively based on microscopy observations. This procedure relies upon the experts\u2019 knowledge and, thus, is not always objective and cheap. With the rapid development of computer image processing technology, neural network based on traditional gradient training algorithm can be used to recognize them. However, the feedforward neural network based on traditional gradient training algorithms for image segmentation creates many issues, such as needing multiple iterations to converge and easy fall into local minimum, which restrict its development heavily. Recently, extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) has been attracting attentions for its faster learning speed and better generalization performance than those of traditional gradient-based learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose to employ ELM for ferrography wear particles image recognition. We extract the shape features, color features, and texture features of five typical kinds of wear particles as the input of the ELM classifier and set five types of wear particles as the output of the ELM classifier. Therefore, the novel ferrography wear particle classifier is founded based on ELM.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2017/3451358", "venue": "J.

Our method estimates the structure-specific transformation parameters directly from medical scans by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. The resulting parameters are then input to a linear Support Vector Machine classifier, which assigns individual scans to a specific clinical group. The classifier also enables us to interpret the anatomical differences between groups, as we can visualize the discriminative warp that best differentiates the two groups. We test the accuracy of our approach on a data set consisting of Magnetic Resonance scans from 16 first episode schizophrenics and 17 age-matched healthy control subjects. The data set also contains manual labels for four regions of interest in both hemispheres: superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, and para-hippocampal gyrus.

Lee (ddlee@seas.upenn.edu) Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA Abstract Decision making from sequential sampling, especially when more than two alternative choices are possible, requires appro- priate stopping criteria to maximize accuracy under time con- straints. Optimal conditions for stopping have previously been investigated for modeling human decision making processes. In this work, we show how the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm in machine learning can be utilized as a mathemati- cal framework to derive a variety of novel sequential sampling models. We interpret these nearest neighbor models in the con- text of diffusion decision making (DDM) methods. We com- pare these nearest neighbor methods to exemplar-based models and accumulator models, such as Race and LCA. Computa- tional experiments show that the new models demonstrate sig- nificantly higher accuracy given equivalent time constraints. Keywords: sequential sampling; decision making; diffusion decision making model; k-nearest neighbor classification; evi- dence; sequential probability ratio test Introduction Whenever a faster decision is required to save time and re- sources, the decision making process should focus on choos- ing whether to proceed with a decision in light of the given in- formation or to postpone the decision in order to collect more information for a higher confidence level. In many previous and recent psychology works, various computational models have been introduced seeking to explain the speed-accuracy tradeoff and to understand the decision making process in hu- mans. However, apart from the understanding of individual models, there has been little systematic way of understand- ing these models in one mathematically unified framework. Moreover, multiple-choice problems were not discussed in- tensively in any of the methods. The optimality in decision making with sequential sam- pling is discussed with the optimality in speed-accuracy tradeoff. In other words, the objective of the present work is to seek the fastest decision with the same average accuracy or the maximum accuracy if the same average decision time is used. Sequential sampling methods such as Race (Smith & Vickers, 1988; Vickers, 1970), diffusion decision making (DDM) (Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff & Rouder, 2000; Shadlen, Hanks, Churchland, Kiani, & Yang, 2006; Ratcliff & Mck- oon, 2008), and leaky competing accumulator (LCA) (Usher & McClelland, 2001; Bogacz, Usher, Zhang, & McClelland, 2007) are all interested in explaining this optimality in the speed-accuracy tradeoff. In these methods, one or more vari- ables are commonly introduced for accumulating sampled in- formation, and a criterion is used to determine whether to continue collecting more information or to make a decision with given information. Here, we propose a common mathe- matical framework combining these methods and providing a systematic explanation for understanding different methods. Our framework combining sequential sampling methods is the k-nearest neighbor (NN) classification in machine learn- ing. The sequential sampling situation with multiple choices is explained as the multiway k-NN classification from the the- oretical analysis on k-NNs in the asymptotic situation. Due to this connection, we can interpret all different types of se- quential sampling methods as different methods of choosing k adaptively in k-NN classification. By further analyzing the strategy of choosing k in k-NN classification using the Se- quential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) (Wald & Wolfowitz, 1948) and Bayesian inference, we can obtain five different ac- cumulating variable and stopping criteria for optimal tradeoff. Interestingly, all these five optimal methods are interpreted as different kinds of DDM strategies. Our work is directly applied to a recently reported neuro- scientific decision making mechanism. The proposed mech- anism considers an output neuron which sends out a decision result. By collecting Poisson spike trains from different neu- rons, the output neuron makes a decision about which neuron gives Poisson spikes at the highest rate (Shadlen & Newsome, 1998; Ma, Beck, Latham, & Pouget, 2006; Beck et al., 2008; Zhang & Bogacz, 2010). The output neuron can achieve op- timality by using our proposed strategies. The proposed method can be compared with traditional ex- emplar models which explain memory retrieval using similar- ity weighted voting based on stored exemplars. Our work is different from this line of research by using majority voting of adaptively chosen k number of NNs. We discuss the ad- vantages and disadvantages of our method when it is applied to the memory retrieval problem. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the sequential sampling problem in Section 2 especially from the point of view of multiple-choice. In Section 3, we in- troduce problems to which sequential sampling methods can be applied, and we show how k-NN classification can be natu-", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2408233882", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["117482922", "6819595", "7855353", "204515", "16045616", "5246200", "14426786", "5182410", "11562994", "8869524", "5842102", "5221867", "1166147", "10588249", "204330692", "9284081", "1713903", "123042835", "15778703", "122130353", "60826655", "11196088"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1324430"}

We demonstrate theoretically that under a regularity assumption on manifolds, the proposed algorithm is able to capture the underling parameter space of the manifolds with self-intersection.

Improper calculation of water saturation leads to remarkable errors in following studies for development and production from reservoir. There are conventional methods to determine water saturation, but these methods suffer from poor generalization and cannot be applicable for various conditions of reservoirs. These methods also depend on core measurements. On the other hand, well log data are usually accessible for all the wells and provide continuous information across the well. Customary techniques are not fully capable to prepare meaningful results for predicting petrophysical properties, especially in presence of small data sets. In this regard, soft computing approaches have been used here. In this research, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, Decision Tree Forest and Tree Boost methods have been employed to predict water saturation of Mesaverde tight gas sandstones located in Uinta Basin. Tree Boost and Decision Tree Forest are powerful predictors which have been applied in many research fields. Multilayer Perceptron is the most common neural network, and Support Vector Machine has been used in many petrophysical and reservoir studies. In this research, by using a small data set, the ability of these methods in predicting water saturation has been studied. Based on the data from four wells, two data set patterns were designed to evaluate training and generalization capabilities of methods. In each pattern, different combinations of well data were used. Three error indexes including correlation coefficient, average absolute error and root-mean-square error were used to compare the methods results. Results show that Support Vector Machine models perform better than other models across data sets, but there are some exceptions exhibiting better performance of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Decision Tree Forest models.

A secondary objective is to integrate these significant improvements in diagnostic and prognostic biomedical applications into the clinical research arena. That is, to devise a framework for converting SLT results into direct, useful clinical information for patient care or pharmaceutical research. We, therefore, propose and preliminarily evaluate, a process whereby PLS, K-PLS, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) may be integrated with the accepted and well understood traditional biostatistical \"gold standard\", Cox Proportional Hazard model and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis methods. Specifically, this new combination will be illustrated with both PLS and Kaplan-Meier followed by PLS and Cox Hazard Ratios (CHR) and can be easily extended for both the K-PLS and SVM paradigms. Finally, these previously described processes are contained in the Fine Feature Selection (FFS) component of our overall feature reduction/evaluation process, which consists of the following components: 1.) coarse feature reduction, 2.) fine feature selection and 3.) classification (as described in this paper) and prediction.ResultsOur results for PLS and K-PLS showed that these techniques, as part of our overall feature reduction process, performed well on noisy microarray data. The best performance was a good 0.794 Area Under a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) for classification of recurrence prior to or after 36 months and a strong 0.869 AUC for classification of recurrence prior to or after 60 months. Kaplan-Meier curves for the classification groups were clearly separated, with p-values below 4.5e-12 for both 36 and 60 months. CHRs were also good, with ratios of 2.846341 (36 months) and 3.996732 (60 months).ConclusionsSLT techniques such as PLS and K-PLS can effectively address difficult problems with analyzing biomedical data such as microarrays.

We genotyped panels of haplotype tagging (ht)SNPs in the \u03b2-globin gene-like cluster and covering the 8q and Xp QTL in two independent patient samples and applied two independent analytical methods to study their association with HbF levels. The first sample included 327 patients (135 htSNPs) and the second sample had 987 patients (102 htSNPs). Genotyping was done using a custom 384 multiplex design and the Illumina platform. Single SNP association was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis with simultaneous adjustment for age, sex and the co-existence of \u03b1 thalassemia; we performed a permutation procedure to correct for multiple testing. The nonlinear regression Random Forest method was used for a joint analysis of covariates and all SNPs. In the smaller patient sample, 7 SNPs in TOX (thymus high mobility protein; 8q12.1) gene showed significant association with HbF (p-value TOX also showed significant association in the larger patient sample and SNP rs7817609 passed the multiple test correction. This SNP in TOX was significantly associated with HbF under codominant and dominant models (empirical p-values 0.0154 and 0.0067) with the C allele associated with a high level of HbF expression; the level of HbF in subjects with CC and CG genotypes was on average 25 percent higher than that in subjects with GG genotype.

This SNP was the 2 nd most important SNP in predicting HbF expression using Random Forest analysis indicating that it might interact non-linearly with other regulatory factors. Joint analysis of all SNPs and covariates revealed that the most important variables for predicting HbF matched most of the SNPs identified by single SNP association studies in both data sets. Random Forest analysis also identified SNPs in EGFL6 , GPM6B and FIGF that have a strong effect on predicting HbF level and that lie within the Xp22.2\u2013p22.3 QTL.

TOX belongs to one of the high mobility group (HMG) box protein families, which contains proteins with a single HMG box that bind with high sequence specificity to variants of the DNA sequence (A/T)(A/T)CAAAG, inducing a sharp bend in DNA, altering local chromatin structure and modulating the formation of multi-protein regulatory complexes. Within 50 kb 5\u2032 and 40 kb 3\u2032 to the HBG2 there were 50 matches to this binding sequence.

Despite aggressive treatment modalities (radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical resections) the prognosis is poor, as median overall survival (OS) is 12-14 months. GBM\u2019s neuroimaging (non-invasive) features can provide opportunities for subclassification, prognostication, and the development of targeted therapies that could advance the clinical practice. This thesis focuses on developing a prognostic model based on multimodal MRI-derived (Tl pre- and post-contrast, T2 and FLAIR) radiomics in GBM. The proposed methodological framework consists in i) registering the available 3D multimodal MR images andsegmenting the tumor volume, ii) extracting radiomics iii) building and validating a prognostic model using machine learning algorithms applied to multicentric clinical cohorts of patients. The core component of the framework rely on extracting radiomics (including intensity, shape and textural metrics) and building prognostic models using two different machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) that were compared by selecting, ranking and combining optimal features. The potential benefits and respective impact of several MRI pre-processing steps (spatial resampling of the voxels, intensities quantization and normalization, segmentation) for reliable extraction of radiomics was thoroughly assessed. Moreover, the standardization of the radiomics features among methodological teams was done by contributing to \u201cMulticentre Initiative for Standardisation of Radiomics\u201d. The accuracy obtained on the independent test dataset using SVM and RF reached upto 83%- 77% when combining ail available features and upto 87%-77% when using only reliable features previously identified as robust, depending on number of features and modality. In this thesis, I developed a framework for developing a comprehensive prognostic model for patients with GBM from multimodal MRI-derived \u201cradiomics and machine learning\u201d.

Numerous approaches have been used to study the phenomenon; however, insufficient knowledge regarding flood conditioning factors continues to hinder prevention and control measures. This research examines the hypothesis that by adding further conditioning factors to a dataset used in river flood modeling, increases the accuracy of the final susceptibility mapping result. Additionally, this study assesses the impact of individual conditioning factors on flood susceptibility mapping and their importance in the construction of precise mapping of potential flood regions. Two robust machine learning approaches, Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were utilized to evaluate spatial correlations between flood conditioning factors and rate their level of importance for mapping the flood prone areas. For this purpose, two datasets were used; dataset 1 (DS1): Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived factors of altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Topographic Roughness Index (TRI), and Sediment Transport Index (STI) and dataset 2 (DS2): a combination of LiDAR derived factors supplemented by geology, soil, landuse/cover (LULC), distance from roads and distance from rivers parameters. An extreme flood event in 2011 in Brisbane, Australia was used as a case study, in which DT and SVM techniques were both applied, using both datasets. In addition, multi-collinearity, variance inflation factors (VIF), Pearson's correlation coefficients and Cohen's kappa analysis provided useful information regarding the inter-relationships of factors, as well as the influence of each factor on the precision of the final map. The area under curve (AUC) method was used for accuracy assessment. SVM and DT produced the highest accuracies of prediction, with rates of 85.52% and 88.47% respectively, using DS1 (the LiDAR dataset). Altitude, SPI and TRI were found to have a significant impact on the precision of the outcomes. It was concluded that the inclusion of additional factors in the modeling, does not necessarily guarantee the achievement of greater accuracy.

By merely transmitting partial results or classifications based on the sampled data, the amount of traffic on the network can be significantly reduced. Such classifications can be made by learning based algorithms using sampled data. An important issue, however, is the training phase of these learning based algorithms. Training a deployed sensor network requires a lot of communication and an impractical amount of human involvement. QUEST is a hybrid algorithm that combines supervised learning in a controlled environment with unsupervised learning on the location of deployment. Using the SITEX02 dataset, we demonstrate that the presented solution works with a performance penalty of less than 10% in 90% of the tests.

Among various physiological biometric traits, face offers unmatched advantages over the others, such as fingerprints and iris, because it is natural, non-intrusive and easily understandable by humans. Nowadays conventional face recognition techniques have attained quasi-perfect performance in a highly constrained environment wherein poses, illuminations, expressions and other sources of variations are strictly controlled. However these approaches are always confined to restricted application fields because non-ideal imaging environments are frequently encountered in practical cases. To adaptively address these challenges, this dissertation focuses on this unconstrained face recognition problem, where face images exhibit more variability in illumination. Moreover, another major question is how to leverage limited 3D shape information to jointly work with 2D based techniques in a heterogeneous face recognition system. To deal with the problem of varying illuminations, we explicitly build the underlying reflectance model which characterizes interactions between skin surface, lighting source and camera sensor, and elaborate the formation of face color. With this physics-based image formation model involved, an illumination-robust representation, namely Chromaticity Invariant Image (CII), is proposed which can subsequently help reconstruct shadow-free and photo-realistic color face images. Due to the fact that this shadow removal process is achieved in color space, this approach could thus be combined with existing gray-scale level lighting normalization techniques to further improve face recognition performance. The experimental results on two benchmark databases, CMU-PIE and FRGC Ver2.0, demonstrate the generalization ability and robustness of our approach to lighting variations. We further explore the effective and creative use of 3D data in heterogeneous face recognition. In such a scenario, 3D face is merely available in the gallery set and not in the probe set, which one would encounter in real-world applications. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are constructed for this purpose. The first CNN is trained to extract discriminative features of 2D/3D face images for direct heterogeneous comparison, while the second CNN combines an encoder-decoder structure, namely U-Net, and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to reconstruct depth face image from its counterpart in 2D. Specifically, the recovered depth face images can be fed to the first CNN as well for 3D face recognition, leading to a fusion scheme which achieves gains in recognition performance. We have evaluated our approach extensively on the challenging FRGC 2D/3D benchmark database. The proposed method compares favorably to the state-of-the-art and show significant improvement with the fusion scheme.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:188931020"}

The main purpose of the first stage is to remove the background of the vehicle image to reduce the interference of redundant information on subsequent stage. In second stage, a concept of multi-scale fusion feature which integrates handcrafted features with learning-based feature is to put forward to describe the characteristics of vehicles.

In fact, original post usually contains detailed content information about event itself, while retweets reflect the diffusion of information in online interaction. Recently, several studies manifest the effectiveness of deep neural network in rumor detection. However, these previous research has made no distinction between original post and retweets for rumor detection. In this paper, we propose a Merged Neural Rumor Detection (MNRD) model that consider three aspects of rumor data: content of original post, diffusion of retweet and user information. We propose content attention to aggregate pivotal words in original post and diffusion attention to focus on most informative retweets during the diffusion process.

There exist different ways of solving this problem such as rule-based, machine learning, and hybrid approaches. This paper provides a better solution for QC using machine-learning approaches. Three methods of feature extraction are proposed in this paper. The First method uses clustering algorithms to partition vocabulary into clusters and acquires feature vector corresponding to each question using clustering information. The second one suggests a method of extracting features from questions to dispose of using recurrent neural networks and to use feedforward neural networks, which have the advantage of learning faster and less need for data, instead. Each question is converted to a feature vector, which is obtained by the Word2vec method and weighted by tf-idf coefficients. The results of question classification using Support Vector Machine and Neural Network classifiers indicate the effectiveness of this type of feature vector and based on that, high performance of the proposed QC system.

However, its prediction accuracy is heavily influenced by the setting of parameters that needs to be done when employing it. No general guidelines are available to select these parameters, whose choice also depends on the characteristics of the dataset being used. This motivated the work described in (Corazza et al. 2010), extended herein. In order to automatically select suitable SVR parameters we proposed an approach based on the use of the meta-heuristics Tabu Search (TS). We designed TS to search for the parameters of both the support vector algorithm and of the employed kernel function, namely RBF. We empirically assessed the effectiveness of the approach using different types of datasets (single and cross-company datasets, Web and not Web projects) from the PROMISE repository and from the Tukutuku database. A total of 21 datasets were employed to perform a 10-fold or a leave-one-out cross-validation, depending on the size of the dataset.

Fidelity maps refer to the regions of the parameter space within which the discrepancy between computational and experimental data is below a user-defined threshold. It is shown that fidelity maps provide an efficient and rigorous approach to approximate likelihoods in the context of Bayesian update or maximum likelihood estimation. Fidelity maps are constructed explicitly in terms of the parameters and aleatory uncertainties using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The approach has the advantage of handling numerous correlated responses, possibly discontinuous, without any assumption on the correlation structure. The construction of accurate fidelity map boundaries at a moderate computational cost is made possible through a dedicated adaptive sampling scheme. A simply supported plate with uncertainties in the boundary conditions is used to demonstrate the methodology. In this example, the construction of the fidelity map is based on several natural frequencies and mode shapes to be matched simultaneously. Various statistical estimators are derived from the map.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.probengmech.2014.08.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2043159262", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["107124106", "53646273", "126345943", "125498267", "119958710", "30307653", "7138354", "64543020", "119562136", "17438005", "120909360", "12198598", "1046577", "21204149", "55687557", "15466123", "16071085", "54091074", "119433303", "58225730"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14153997"}

Visual inspection, as part of the routine maintenance procedures, is a common practice used in the condition assessment of infrastructure to ensure its safety and serviceability. This practice, however, is labour-intensive, costly and inaccurate and, therefore, a new system based on computer vision technology is presented in this thesis, aiming to tackle these inadequacies. This thesis proposes a novel mosaicing system for inspection reporting, which can create an almost distortion-free mosaic of tunnels, thus allowing a large area of tunnels to be visualised. The system relies on Structure from Motion (SFM), which enables the system to cope with images with a general camera motion, in contrast to standard mosaicing software that can cope only with a strict camera motion. The system involves the automatic robust estimation of a 3D cylindrical surface using a Support Vector Machine to classify 3D points to improve the accuracy of the estimation. It is shown that some curvatures are observed in the mosaics when an inaccurate surface is used for mosaicing, while the mosaics from a surface estimated using the proposed method are almost distortion-free. New feature matching algorithms aiming to improve the performance of SFM systems are proposed. These algorithms apply a spatial consistency constraint to match features with a similar topography, in contrast to other matching algorithms that rely on matching based on the similar appearance of local image patches. The Shape Context and Random Forest algorithms are combined in the proposed algorithm, revealing promising results. The final contribution is a new change detection system for monitoring cracks in multi-temporal images. The system can cope with images with a general camera motion achieved by geometrical registration using SFM, unlike other systems that assume fixed or controlled cameras. The system performs photometric normalisation to cope with illumination variation in the images, and also a motion-invariant change detection algorithm is applied to handle deformable objects. It is shown that the results from the proposed change detection system are still impractical for use with tunnel images from a real environment, and further study is required.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17863/CAM.14071", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "813308443", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16502294", "201105802", "16343303", "42247810"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55053462"}

To solve this problem, a new method based on online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is proposed in this paper to predict online job termination status. With this method, real-time data are collected according to the sequence of job arriving, the job status could be predicted and the operation model is thus updated based on these data.

The machine Learning method, Random Forest, is applied to estimate whether a pedestrian is distracted or not and predict whether he will cross driveway or not using walking characteristics. The experimental result indicates this method can identify which of four-walking patterns the pedestrian is in because the F-measure value of Random Forest in the four-walking patterns were around 0.70.

Doing so, our implementation on a reasonable size (18) GPU cluster achieves the pricing of a high dimensional (40) option in less than one hour against almost 8 as observed for runs we conducted in the past, using a 64-core cluster (composed of quad-core AMD Opteron 2356). In order to benefit from different GPU device types, we detail the dynamic strategy we have used to load balance GPU calculus which greatly improves the overall pricing time we obtained. An analysis of possible bottleneck effects demonstrates that there is a sequential bottleneck due to the training phase that relies upon the AdaBoost classification method, which prevents the implementation to be fully scalable, and so prevents to envision further decreasing pricing time down to handful of minutes. For this we propose to consider using Random Forests classification method: it is naturally dividable over a cluster, and available like AdaBoost as a black box from the popular Weka machine learning library.

A wide range of devices to detect and deter animals causing conflict are used for this purpose, although their effectiveness is often highly variable, due to habituation to disruptive or disturbing stimuli. Automated recognition of behaviours could form a critical component of a system capable of altering the disruptive stimuli to avoid this. In this paper we present a novel method to automatically recognise goose behaviour based on vocalisations from flocks of free-living barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis). The geese were observed and recorded in a natural environment, using a shielded shotgun microphone. The classification used Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which had been trained with labeled data. Greenwood Function Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC) were used as features for the pattern recognition algorithm, as they can be adjusted to the hearing capabilities of different species.

Time- and cost-sensitive data is present in many common induction applications, such as predicting the bankruptcy of corporations and approving their credit.

Present rule induction methods do not account for the varying availability of data, and research on the cost of data in rule induction is contradictory. Utilizing the presence of these cost factors can result in a more valuable decision support tool, one that can classify cases from partial information. Making such early decisions trades reduced accuracy for the benefits of early classification. Previous research has selected attributes and stopped tree development on the basis of cost. This research identifies some weaknesses in the previous research and offers modifications to the methodology The result is a set of guidelines for constructing more cost-effective induced decision trees. Experiments validated the usefulness of cost pruning and identified conditions in which a given cost selection measure may be superior. The data for the experiments came from two applications: approving loans (an expert's decisions) and predicting a hospital patient's length of stay (actual outcomes). In the hospital application, the goal is to identify the early characteristics that predict excessive length of stay.

To do this,, we combine large genomic and sampling datasets analyzed with approximate Bayesian computation and Random Forest scenario evaluation to compare single and multiple invasion scenarios with pre- and post-introduction admixture simultaneously. We show the historical admixture zone within native North America originated before global invasion of this weed, and could act as a potential source of introduced populations. We provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the invasive populations established through multiple introductions from the native range into Europe and subsequent bridgehead invasion into Australia.

In the present study, height data from a digital surface model (DSM) created from overlapping UAS-images has been incorporated together with the spectral and textural features from the UAS-orthoimage to test if classification accuracy can be improved further.

We tested our hypothesis at five test sites (100 m \u00d7 100 m each) with varying vegetation complexity and image quality using automated object-based image analysis in combination with Random Forest classification. Overall accuracy at each of the five test sites ranged from 78% to 87% at the growth-form level and from 66% to 85% at the dominant-taxon level.

A salient feature of SBCN is its reliance on the knowledge of the gearbox structure and the type of features obtained from processed vibration signals as a substitute to training. To formulate this knowledge, approximate vibration transfer models are developed for the two gearboxes and utilized to derive the connection weights representing the influence of component faults on vibration features. The validity of the structural influences is evaluated by comparing them with those obtained from experimental RMS values. These influences are also evaluated by comparing them with the weights of a connectionist network trained through supervised leaning. The results indicate general agreement between the modeled and experimentally obtained influences. The vibration data from the two gearboxes are also used to evaluate the performance of SBCN in fault diagnosis.

The success of these data-driven methods largely depends on collecting sufficient labeled data, which is usually a crucial limitation in practical cases. The current solutions to this issue utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data in semi-supervised learning. However, existing GAN-based methods treat image generations and hashing learning as two isolated processes, leading to generation ineffectiveness. Besides, most works fail to exploit the semantic information in unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Self-pace Adversarial Hashing method, named SSAH to solve the above problems in a unified framework. The SSAH method consists of an adversarial network (A-Net) and a hashing network (H-Net). To improve the quality of generative images, first, the A-Net learns hard samples with multi-scale occlusions and multi-angle rotated deformations which compete against the learning of accurate hashing codes.

Raman and ROA are sensitive to biomolecular structure with the bands of each spectra corresponding to structural elements in proteins and when combined give a fingerprint of the protein. However, there are many bands of which little is known. There is a need, therefore, to find ways of extrapolating information from spectral bands and investigate which regions of the spectra contain the most useful structural information. Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification and Random Forests (RF) trees classification were used to mine protein fold class information and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used to determine secondary structure content of proteins. The classification methods were used to group proteins into ?-helix, ?-sheet, ?/? and disordered fold classes. The PLS regression was used to determine percentage protein structural content from Raman and ROA spectral data. The analyses were performed on spectral bin widths of 10cm-1 and on the spectral amide regions I, II and III. The full spectra and different combinations of the amide regions were also analysed. The SVM analyses, classification and regression, generally did not perform well. SVM classification models for example, had low Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) values below 0.5 but this is better than a negative value which would indicate a random chance prediction. The SVM regression analyses also showed very poor performances with average R2 values below 0.5. R2 is the Pearson?s correlations coefficient and shows how well predicted and observed structural content values correlate. An R2 value 1 indicates a good correlation and therefore a good prediction model. The Partial Least Squares regression analyses yielded much improved results with very high accuracies. Analyses of full spectrum and the spectral amide regions produced high R2 values of 0.8-0.9 for both ROA and Raman spectral data. This high accuracy was also seen in the analysis of the 850-1100 cm-1 backbone region for both ROA and Raman spectra which indicates that this region could have an important contribution to protein structure analysis. 2nd derivative Raman spectra PLS regression analysis showed very improved performance with high accuracy R2 values of 0.81-0.97. The Random Forest algorithm used here for classification showed good performance. The 2-dimensional plots used to visualise the classification clusters showed clear clusters in some analyses, for example tighter clustering was observed for amide I, amide I & III and amide I & II & III spectral regions than for amide II, amide III and amide II&III spectra analysis. The Random Forest algorithm also determines variable importance which showed spectral bins were crucial in the classification decisions. The ROA Random Forest analyses performed generally better than Raman Random Forest analyses. ROA Random Forest analyses showed 75% as the highest percentage of correctly classified proteins while Raman analyses reported 50% as the highest percentage.The analyses presented in this thesis have shown that Raman and ROA vibrational spectral contains information about protein secondary structure and these data can be extracted using mathematical methods such as the machine learning techniques presented here. The machine learning methods applied in this project were used to mine information about protein secondary structure and the work presented here demonstrated that these techniques are useful and could be powerful tools in the determination protein structure from spectral data.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "83175248", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32218613"}

We call attention to the fact that this assumption is often unrealistic, as no model can completely account for every single possible situation ahead of time. When the robot's hypothesis space is misspecified, human input can be unhelpful - or even detrimental - to the way the robot is performing its tasks.

However, they suffer from severe performance deterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens in practice and can be characterized as the task mismatch issue.

It is based on a general \u201clearning to optimize\u201d framework for solving MINLP problems. A unique advantage of the proposed method is that it can tackle the task mismatch issue with a few additional unlabeled training samples, which is especially important when transferring to large-size problems.

Since training of classifiers is essentially achieved through learning from features, it is crucial to extract and select a set of relevant features that can effectively distinguish one class from other classes. However, different instances could present features which are highly dissimilar, even if these instances belong to the same class. The above difference in feature representation can also result in high diversity among classifiers trained by using different algorithms or data samples. In this paper, we investigate the impact of multi-classifier fusion on shape recognition by using six features extracted from a 2D shape data set. In particular, popular single learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine and K Nearest Neighbours, are adopted to train base classifiers on features selected by using a wrapper approach. Furthermore, two popular ensemble learning algorithms (Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees) are adopted to train decision tree ensembles on the same feature sets. The outputs of the two ensemble classifiers are finally combined with the outputs of all the other base classifiers The experimental results show the effectiveness of the above setting of multi-classifier fusion for advancing the performance in comparison with using each single (non-ensemble) learning algorithm.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/icwapr.2018.8521305", "venue": "2018 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)", "journal": "2018 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2883828728", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2026284", "6431165", "123536979", "2888141", "18757238", "1255474", "17088022", "10515534", "32259296", "8684310", "52874011", "667586", "5262555", "89141", "4545665", "18645513", "60385584", "15412559"], "inbound_citations": ["86567018", "199371368"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51688693"}

These questions are typically investigated with paradigms like the flanker task, which require participants to inhibit an automatic response before making a decision. Connectionist modeling work suggests that between-trial changes in attention result from fluctuations in conflict-as conflict occurs, attention needs to be upregulated to resolve it. Current sequential sampling models (SSMs) of within-trial effects, however, suggest that attention focuses on a goal-relevant target as a function of time. We propose that within-trial changes in cognitive control and attention are emergent properties of the dynamics of the decision itself. We tested our hypothesis by developing a set of SSMs, each making alternative assumptions about attention modulation and evidence accumulation mechanisms. Combining the SSM framework with likelihood-free Bayesian approximation methods allowed us to conduct quantified comparisons between subject-level fits. Models included either time- or control-based attention mechanisms, and either strongly- (via feedforward inhibition) or weakly correlated (via leak and lateral inhibition) evidence accumulation mechanisms. We fit all models to behavioral data collected in variants of the flanker task, one accompanied by EEG measures. Across three experiments, we found converging evidence that control-based attention processes in combination with evidence accumulation mechanisms governed by leak and lateral inhibition provided the best fits to behavioral data, and uniquely mapped onto observed decision-related signals in the brain.

In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel divide-and-conquer solver for kernel SVMs (DC-SVM). In the division step, we partition the kernel SVM problem into smaller subproblems by clustering the data, so that each subproblem can be solved independently and efficiently. We show theoretically that the support vectors identified by the subproblem solution are likely to be support vectors of the entire kernel SVM problem, provided that the problem is partitioned appropriately by kernel clustering. In the conquer step, the local solutions from the subproblems are used to initialize a global coordinate descent solver, which converges quickly as suggested by our analysis. By extending this idea, we develop a multilevel Divide-and-Conquer SVM algorithm with adaptive clustering and early prediction strategy, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training speed, testing accuracy, and memory usage. As an example, on the covtype dataset with half-a-million samples, DC-SVM is 7 times faster than LIBSVM in obtaining the exact SVM solution (to within 10-6 relative error) which achieves 96.15% prediction accuracy.

In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data.

Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled \u2018seed\u2019 image patch. In contrast to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256).

Thus, features from these cross-sectional views of echocardiograms extracted using computer-aided techniques may aid in characterizing Myocardial Infarction (MI). Therefore, this paper proposes a new algorithm for automated MI characterization using features extracted from parasternal short axis and apical four chambers cross-sectional views of 160 subjects (80 with MI and 80 normal) echocardiograms. The Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) method is used to extract the Relative Wavelet Energy and Entropy (RWE and RWEnt) features from the two cross-sectional views of echocardiography images separately. These features are ranked and subjected to classification in two different steps: (i) the features from each view are separately ranked using entropy, t-test and Wilcoxon ranking tests and fed to the classifier, and (ii) later, the features from both the views are combined and ranked. Finally, these ranked features are subjected to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for characterization of normal and MI using a minimum number of features. The proposed method is able to identify MI with 95.0% of accuracy, 93.7% of sensitivity and 96.2% of specificity using 32 features extracted from parasternal short-axis view; an accuracy of 96.2%, sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 95.0% with 18 apical four chamber view features. The results show that by combining the features from both views enables the confirmation of MI LVs with an accuracy of 96.8%, sensitivity of 93.7% and specificity of 100% using 16 features extracted from only two frames.

Serum samples were collected from 2 sets of patients: cirrhotic patients with HCC (n = 39) and without HCC (n = 40). The FTIR spectra (10 per sample) were acquired in the transmission mode, and data homogeneity was tested by cluster analysis to exclude outliers. After data preprocessing by extended multiplicative signal correction and principal component analysis, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was applied using a leave-one-out cross-validation algorithm to classify the spectra into 2 classes of cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. When SVM was applied to all spectra (n = 790), the sensitivity and the specificity for the diagnosis of HCC were, respectively, 82.02% and 82.5%. When applied to the subset of spectra excluding the outliers (n = 739), SVM classification led to a sensitivity and specificity of 87.18% and 85%, respectively. Using median spectra for each patient instead of all replicates, the sensitivity and specificity were 84.62% and 82.50%, respectively. The overall accuracy rate was 82%\u201386%.

While pixel- and object-based classification approaches are widely used for satellite image analysis, often these approaches exploit the high-fidelity image data in a limited way. In this paper, we explore an unsupervised feature learning approach for scene classification. Dense low-level feature descriptors are extracted to characterize the local spatial patterns. These unlabeled feature measurements are exploited in a novel way to learn a set of basis functions. The low-level feature descriptors are encoded in terms of the basis functions to generate new sparse representation for the feature descriptors. We show that the statistics generated from the sparse features characterize the scene well producing excellent classification accuracy. We apply our technique to several challenging aerial scene data sets: ORNL-I data set consisting of 1-m spatial resolution satellite imagery with diverse sensor and scene characteristics representing five land-use categories, UCMERCED data set representing twenty one different aerial scene categories with sub-meter resolution, and ORNL-II data set for large-facility scene detection. Our results are highly promising and, on the UCMERCED data set we outperform the previous best results.

In the telecommunications industry, machine-learning techniques have been applied to the Call Detail Record (CDR) for predicting customer behaviour such as churn prediction. In this paper, we pursue the identification of the calling communities and demonstrate how cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify communities using information derived from the CDR data. We use the information extracted from the cluster analysis to identify customer calling patterns. Customer calling patterns are then input to a classification algorithm to generate a classifier model for predicting the calling communities of a customer.

However, due to their non-linear properties it can be challenging to obtain accurate information. The goal of this study was to investigate if machine learning can be applied to obtain more accurate measurements. Methods: In a tensile test using a linear stage setup, data were collected from two commercial available stretch sensors (Adafruit and Image SI) and one self-fabricated sensor (Menrva research group at Simon Fraser University, Canada). For each sensor, one hour of consecutive stretches in both a trapezoidal and sinusoidal input pattern were collected. We identified a set of features, trained three commonly used machine learning algorithms, and compared their performance in estimating the amount of stretch. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in real life, we tested our setup in two human applications. First, we attached a stretch sensor to the human chest to estimate the expansion of the rib cage during breathing. Second, we evaluated the performance in estimating the ankle position with a sensor attached to the foot. Results: In the tensile test, Support Vector Regression performed best with an average accuracy $(\\mathbf{R}^{2})$ of 0.98 (0.01) and mean absolute error of 0.18 (0.06) mm across all input patterns and sensors. The accuracy was significantly $(\\mathbf{p} < \\pmb{0.01})$. higher than the performance of a traditional linear model. An accuracy $(\\mathbf{R}^{2})$ of 0.91 (0.04) with a mean absolute error of 3.08 (0.38) mm has been achieved in estimating the expansion of the chest. Similarly, an accuracy (R2) of 0.90 (0.04) with a mean absolute error of 2.90 (0.61) degree has been achieved in estimating the ankle position.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach to extracting meronymy relations, which is based on both patterns and kernel functions. In a first step, meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from a text corpus by applying patterns. In a second step these relation hypotheses are validated by using several shallow features and a graph kernel approach. In contrast to other meronymy extraction and validation methods which are based on surface or syntactic representations we use a purely semantic approach based on semantic networks. This involves analyzing each sentence of the Wikipedia corpus by a deep syntactico-semantic parser and converting it into a semantic network. Meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from the semantic networks by means of an automated theorem prover, which employs a set of logical axioms and patterns in the form of semantic networks. The meronymy candidates are then validated by means of a graph kernel approach based on common walks.

To construct the model, we introduce a Support Vector Regression Machine (SVRM) technique with a systematic approach that balances model smoothness with fitting accuracy to produce a model that reveals the manner in which the size and shape of the magnetopause depend upon various control parameters without any assumptions concerning the analytical shape of the magnetopause. The new model fits the data used in the modeling very accurately, and can guarantee a similar accuracy when predicting unseen observations within the applicable range of control parameters. We introduce a new error analysis technique based upon the SVRM that enables us to obtain model errors appropriate to different locations and control parameters. We find significant east-west elongations in the magnetopause shape for many combinations of control parameters.

The main difficulty of the recognition process lies in the large number of classes/ligatures (17,000 different possible ligatures in our Urdu text data). This large number of classes not only limits the efficiency (run-time) of the recognition algorithms, but also makes it difficult to use state-of-the-art classifiers - like Random Forests - that can only handle up to a few hundred classes. Nearest neighbor classifiers scale up well to tackle such large-scale classification problems, however their poor run-time efficiency poses a major obstacle. In this paper, we investigate two strategies for improving the efficiency (reducing the search space) of nearest neighbor based classification of Urdu ligatures. The first approach uses spectral hashing to resort to approximate nearest neighbor classification. The second approach is based on the idea of hierarchical classification to partition the search space based on the number of characters in a ligature. Experiments using spectral hashing show that the search space of nearest neighbor comparison can be reduced by about 50% without a loss in recognition accuracy. Further experiments demonstrate that the Random Forest classifier can be reliably used as the first stage classifier to distinguish one-character ligatures from multiple-character ligatures in a hierarchical classification scheme.

The performance of such kind of visual servo system is closely related to precision of motion estimation and time delay. Large time delay results in larger phase delay between motion estimation and micromechanical compensation, and leads to larger uncompensated residual motion and limited bandwidth. The paper analyzes the time delay caused by image acquisition period and introduces a time delay compensation method based on SVM (Support Vector Machine) motion prediction.

Therefore, we make use of MR Cine images acquired in the same session (in which the myocardium has a more predictable appearance) in order to create a prior model of the myocardial borders. Using image features in the DEMR images and this prior we are able to segment the myocardium consistently.

Many implementations based on different sparse formats were proposed to improve this kernel on the recent GPU architectures. However, it has been widely observed that there is no \u201cbest-for-all\u201d sparse format for the SpMV kernel on GPU. Indeed, serious performance degradation of an order of magnitude can be observed without a careful selection of the sparse format to use. To address this problem, we propose in this article BestSF (Best Sparse Format), a new learning-based sparse meta-format that automatically selects the most appropriate sparse format for a given input matrix. To do so, BestSF relies on a cost-sensitive classification system trained using Weighted Support Vector Machines (WSVMs) to predict the best sparse format for each input sparse matrix. Our experimental results on two different NVIDIA GPU architectures using a large number of real-world sparse matrices show that BestSF achieved a noticeable overall performance improvement over using a single sparse format. While BestSF is trained to select the best sparse format in terms of performance (GFLOPS), our further experimental investigations revealed that using BestSF also led, in most of the test cases, to the best energy efficiency (MFLOPS/W). To prove its practical effectiveness, we also evaluate the performance and energy efficiency improvement achieved when using BestSF as a building block in a GPU-based Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) iterative solver.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3226228", "venue": "TACO", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2891818448", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13903091", "31352412", "3055701", "1574912", "3946259", "60775233", "15886962", "261945", "11289099", "532281", "15971875", "961425", "10561693", "15834246", "15500598", "206787478", "14541849", "207191190", "16810637", "16876582", "1905828", "5577284", "207173155", "15874442", "15943670", "5184714", "196095190", "3954503", "14241689", "19450406", "398288", "3939011", "165863", "206743611", "14446984", "169491", "6036439", "14859861", "2063521", "6491967", "9763118", "2968351", "2210918", "207312792", "9960950", "12459095", "6136462", "10987043", "17602837", "1493982"], "inbound_citations": ["203654797", "208111530"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52183644"}

Macroinvertebrate biomonitoring is particularly efficient in pinpointing the cause-effect structure between slow and subtle changes and their detrimental consequences in aquatic ecosystems. The greatest obstacle to implementing efficient biomonitoring is currently the cost-intensive human expert taxonomic identification of samples. While there is evidence that automated recognition techniques can match human taxa identification accuracy at greatly reduced costs, so far the development of automated identification techniques for aquatic organisms has been minimal. In this paper, we focus on advancing classification and data retrieval that are instrumental when processing large macroinvertebrate image datasets. To accomplish this for routine biomonitoring, in this paper we shall investigate the feasibility of automated river macroinvertebrate classification and retrieval with high precision. Besides the state-of-the-art classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Bayesian Classifiers (BCs), the focus is particularly drawn on feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs), namely multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and radial basis function networks (RBFNs). Since both ANN types have been proclaimed superior by different investigations even for the same benchmark problems, we shall first show that the main reason for this ambiguity lies in the static and rather poor comparison methodologies applied in most earlier works. Especially the most common drawback occurs due to the limited evaluation of the ANN performances over just one or few network architecture(s). Therefore, in this study, an extensive evaluation of each classifier performance over an ANN architecture space is performed. The best classifier among all, which is trained over a dataset of river macroinvertebrate specimens, is then used in the MUVIS framework for the efficient search and retrieval of particular macroinvertebrate peculiars.

We distinguish between basic country conditions, country structural characteristics and international developments. We find that crises are more varied than they are similar. For banking crises we find that low net interest rate spreads in the banking sector and a shallow or inverted yield curve are their most important forerunners in the short term, whereas in the longer term it is high house price inflation. For currency crises, high domestic short-term rates coupled with overvalued exchange rates are the most powerful short-term predictors.

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used for feature selection. The machine learning (ML) classifiers were k-NearestNeighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of classifiers was mainly evaluated and compared by certain metrics. Results Seven CMP features (ICC range, 0.990-0.999) and seven NP features (ICC range, 0.931-0.999) were selected. The accuracy of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 82.2%\u201385.9 %, 82.8%\u201394.5 % and 86.5%\u201390.8 % in the training cohort, and 90.7%\u201395.4%, 77.8%\u201379.6 % and 91.7%\u201393.5 % in the validation cohort. The AUC of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 0.901 to 0.938, 0.912 to 0.976, 0.948 to 0.968 in the training cohort, and 0.957 to 0.974, 0.856 to 0.875, 0.960 to 0.978 in the validation cohort. Conclusions ML-based CT radiomics analysis can be used to predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCCs preoperatively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31756634", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejrad.2019.108738", "venue": "European journal of radiology", "journal": "European journal of radiology", "mag_id": "2983452901", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202889102"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208234440"}

First, we summarized an augmented, diverse repository of overhead river images to be used in training. Second, we incorporate the Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN), a network architecture that iteratively trains smaller-resolution GANs to gradually build up to a very high resolution, to generate 256x256 river satellite imagery. With conventional GAN architectures, difficulties soon arise in terms of exponential increase of training time and vanishing/exploding gradient issues, which the PGGAN implementation seems to significantly reduce.

We then use the discriminator as a source of error signal for unlabelled data. This effectively boosts the performance of a network on a held out test set.

Intuitively, models trained to predict these semantic latent representations given data may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping -- projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary

Combined with an appropriate tag weighting mechanism, more relevant samples play a more important role in the calibration of the final concept-detector model. We propose a complete, automated framework that (i) calculates relevance scores for each image-concept pair based on image tags, (ii) transforms the scores into relevance probabilities and automatically annotates each image according to this probability, (iii) transforms either the relevance scores or the probabilities into appropriate training weights and finally, (iv) incorporates the training weights and the visual features into a Fuzzy Support Vector Machine classifier to build the concept-detector model. The framework can be applied to online public collections, by gathering a large pool of diverse images, and using the calculated probability to select a training set and the associated training weights. To evaluate our argument, we experiment on two large annotated datasets. Experiments highlight the retrieval effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, experiments with various levels of annotation error show that using weights derived from tags significantly increases the robustness of the resulting concept detectors.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2790230", "venue": "TOMM", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2239739895", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12774316", "5748741", "14847714", "2762657", "7793000", "6483070", "5964689", "12913369", "33803154", "14945781", "14040310", "14761697", "15199783", "15750120", "21314877", "32494949", "13435674", "38234642", "2313539", "1812369", "2809668", "29350028", "6430687", "7715987", "38639736", "41277", "14855478", "207167403", "61557420", "26418330", "5522849", "3781190", "2118658", "11749653", "54692343", "16372463", "8703121", "8295935", "14077031", "7033526", "54049119", "3463023", "15655141", "6561699", "18739236", "5157172"], "inbound_citations": ["23743417", "52285725"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17746428"}

To avoid the trivial solution of classifying all the unlabeled examples to a same class, balancing constraint is often used with S3VM (denoted as BCS3VM). Recently, a novel incremental learning algorithm (IL-S3VM) based on the path following technique was proposed to significantly scale up S3VM. However, the dynamic relationship of balancing constraint with previous labeled and unlabeled samples impede their incremental method for handling BCS3VM. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a new incremental S3VM algorithm (IL-BCS3VM) based on IL-S3VM which can effectively handle the balancing constraint and directly update the solution of BCS3VM. Specifically, to handle the dynamic relationship of balancing constraint with previous labeled and unlabeled samples, we design two unique procedures which can respectively eliminate and add the balancing constraint into S3VM. More importantly, we provide the finite convergence analysis for our IL-BCS3VM algorithm.

The open source EEG data which is provided by University of Bonn, Germany, and Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), India, are used in this work. Further, the DWT coefficients obtained from D3-D5 to A5 sub-bands increases the computational burden of the classifier. So, feature selection based on the estimation of mutual information theory is applied to the DWT coefficients to obtain significant features required for the classifier to get better accuracy with lesser computational burden. The results show that SVM performs well for 9 data sets and NB performs better for 4 varying data sets.

The most effective ways focus on spontaneous feature extraction by using deep learning. However, they ignore the structure information of skeleton joints and the correlation between two different skeleton joints for human action recognition. In this paper, we do not simply treat the joints position information as unordered points. Instead, we propose a novel data reorganizing strategy to represent the global and local structure information of human skeleton joints. Meanwhile, we also employ the data mirror to increase the relationship between skeleton joints. Based on this design, we proposed an end-to-end multi-dimensional CNN network (SRNet) to fully consider the spatial and temporal information to learn the feature extraction transform function. Specifically, in this CNN network, we employ different convolution kernels on different dimensions to learn skeleton representation to make the most of human structural information to generate robust features.

KNN is a simple and mature algorithm, but it cannot effectively solve the problem of overlapped categories borders, unbalanced class samples, k value determination, and overlarge search space. In this paper, we propose a new TKNN that absorb tree structure and adaptive k value method based on classical KNN algorithm. TKNN can overcome the shortcoming of KNN and improve the performance of multi-class text classification. Then the theoretical analysis and experimental results show TKNN can greatly enhance the classification efficiency than KNN.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CIS.2011.310", "venue": "2011 Seventh International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security", "journal": "2011 Seventh International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2043980125", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["60532258", "207670313", "2026944", "967678", "19572577", "57843776", "5816593"], "inbound_citations": ["88488314", "2748225"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17839121"}

To achieve satisfying scheduling process triggered by limited streamflow data, four methods are used to derive the operation rule of hydropower reservoirs, including multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and support vector machine (SVM). Then, the data from 1952 to 2015 in Hongjiadu reservoir of China are chosen as the survey case, and several quantitative statistical indexes are adopted to evaluate the performances of different models. The radial basis function is chosen as the kernel function of SVM, while the sigmoid function is used in the hidden layer of ELM and ANN. The simulations show that three artificial intelligence algorithms (ANN, SVM, and ELM) are able to provide better performances than the conventional MLR and scheduling graph method.

State Governments responsible for mapping woody vegetation change release mapping results several years after the clearing has occurred, are at Ministerial discretion and there is no guarantee they will continue being made public. This makes it imperative to develop capacity to detect land clearing independently. Hence, the main objective of this research project was to develop and apply a robust and rapid woody vegetation change detection approach using publically available computing capabilities and data. This was done using the Google Earth Engine, and two selected Landsat scenes, in the Brigalow Belt and Mulga Lands biogeographic regions in Queensland, Australia, where land clearing is known to have occurred. Validated woody vegetation clearing data were available for the study sites from 2004-2010. ::: ::: Four change detection approaches were investigated using the Google Earth Engine Application Programming Interface: (1) visual identification of areas of presumptive clearing, used to train change detection algorithms in GEE and then extrapolate a detection model across the scenes of interest; (2) CART and Random Forest classifiers trained using existing validated woody vegetation clearing information for different time epochs; (3) a normalised time-series of NDVI mean and standard deviation values combined with a spectral index; and (4) a normalised time-series of Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) mean and standard deviation values combined with a spectral index. The initial research shows that the CART and Random Forest classifiers produced the highest mapping accuracies (user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and producer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accuracies of clearing were 77-92% and 54-77%, respectively) when detecting woody vegetation change between 2004 and 2010 from which training data were available. However, for prediction of woody vegetation change using extrapolation within epochs from where no training data were available, the classification accuracies were significantly reduced. This was mainly because of variations in rainfall, and associated vegetation greening and senescence, between the years with and without training data. The normalised time-series of NDVI and FPC mean and standard deviation values combined with a spectral index did not yield accuracies as high as the CART and Random Forest classifiers, but proved to be more robust, as this approach did not rely on training data and took advantage of time-series information. The approach, using visual identification of presumptive clearing for training, yielded the lowest land clearing classification accuracies. The methods developed in this research project provide new knowledge and techniques significantly contributing to applied remote sensing and environmental monitoring, i.e. assessment of the relative capacity and accuracy of commonly available image processing algorithms for mapping woody vegetation changes from a globally accessible, free online database of Landsat image data. It also provides more detailed information, suited to Australian conditions, on woody vegetation loss than other existing approaches relying on publically available image and computing facilities.

A hybrid Machine Learning algorithm developed at the University of South Florida is presented as a knowledge acquisition tool for developing knowledge-based systems. The learning algorithm addresses the knowledge acquisition problem by developing and maintaining the knowledge base through inductive learning from the examples. The learning algorithm named as Symbolic-Connectionist net (SCnet), overcomes the problems associated with neural and symbolic learning systems by integrating the symbolic information into a neural network representation. The learning system allows for knowledge extraction and background knowledge encoding in the form of rules. Fuzzy logic has been made use of in dealing with uncertainty in the learning domain. The description language for the learning system consists of continuous and discrete variables along with relational and fuzzy comparators. The applicability of the learning system for process design is illustrated through a complex column sequencing example.

An efficient monitoring would trigger an alarm timely once it detects an out-of-control event by learning the state change from the collected sensor data. However, in practice, multiple sensor data may not be gathered appropriately into a database for some unexpected reasons, such as sensor aging, wireless communication failures, and data reading errors, which leads to a large number of missing data as well as inaccurate or delayed detection, and poses a great challenge for field monitoring in sensor networks. This fact motivates us to develop a multitask-learning based field monitoring method in order to achieve an efficient detection when considerable missing data exist during data acquisition. Specifically, we adopt a log likelihood ratio (LR)-based multivariate cumulative sum (MCUSUM) control chart given spatial correlation among neighboring regions within the monitored field. To deal with the missing data problem, we integrate a multitask learning model into the LR-based MCUSUM control chart in the sensor network. Both simulation and real case studies are conducted to validate our proposed approach and the results show that our approach can achieve an accurate and timely detection for an out-of-control state when a large number of missing data exist in the sensor database. Our model provides an effective field monitoring strategy for engineering applications to accurately and timely detect the products with abnormal quality during production and reduce product losses.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6480029", "pubmed_id": "30934893", "doi": "10.3390/s19071533", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2923708003", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["53763826", "9840523", "12749459", "26904046", "15246633", "120737706", "16687872", "108515634", "121912178", "12717714", "42341717", "14360067", "45636990", "116157119", "22487199", "52226168", "5899038", "53018911", "20524202", "740063", "10598373", "20394084", "32380849", "1874766", "145108739", "479617", "40339931", "18239475", "13895067", "63888270", "115992725", "119976742"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91187207"}

This technique has shown some experimentally very convincing results on a variety of tasks, but a thorough understanding of the importance of the dynamics for the performance is still lacking. This contribution aims to extend this understanding, by presenting a more sophisticated extension on the traditional way of characterizing the reservoir dynamics, by using the dynamic profile of the Jacobian of the reservoir instead of static, a priori measures such as the standard spectral radius.

Data of a group of 109 female subjects (62 healthy, 47 with IHD) were analyzed on the basis of extracted parameters from the three-dimensional vector loops of the heart. The LDA achieved an accuracy of 83,5% (Sensitivity 78,7%, Specificity 87,1%), whereas the SVM achieved an accuracy of 86% (Sensitivity 80,5%, Specificity 89,8%). It could be shown that cardiogoniometry, an electrophysiological diagnostic method performed at rest, detects variables that are helpful in identifying ischemic heart disease. As it is easy to apply, non-invasive, and provides an automated interpretation it may become an inexpensive addition to the cardiologic diagnostic armamentarium, possibly useful for early diagnosis of IHD or CAD, as well as in patients who do not tolerate exercise testing.

This novel framework offers a unified view for understanding many existing sparse metric learning algorithms including the Sparse Metric Learning framework proposed in (Rosales and Fung ACM International conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD), pp 367\u2013373, 2006), the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (Weinberger et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems (NIPS), 2006; Weinberger and Saul in Proceedings of the twenty-fifth international conference on machine learning (ICML-2008), 2008), and the D-ranking Vector Machine (D-ranking VM) (Ouyang and Gray in Proceedings of the twenty-fifth international conference on machine learning (ICML-2008), 2008). Moreover, GSML also establishes a close relationship with the Pairwise Support Vector Machine (Vert et al. in BMC Bioinform, 8, 2007). Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of extending many current non-sparse metric learning models to their sparse versions including Relevant Component Analysis (Bar-Hillel et al. in J Mach Learn Res, 6:937\u2013965, 2005) and a state-of-the-art method proposed in (Xing et al.

This new model averts doing the expensive optimization problem for each contact by FEM; hence dramatically reduces the calculating time. Multi-Layers Neurons (MLN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are adopted as a learning machine. The testing errors of these two learning machines are also compared. SVR showed superior performance than MLN in this application.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-28648-6_122", "venue": "ISNN", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1534561438", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20308673"}

The assumption may not hold in cost-sensitive recognition tasks, such as face recognition based access control system, where misclassifying a stranger as a family member and allowed to enter the house may result in more serious disaster than misclassifying a family member as a stranger and not allowed to enter. Though recent cost-sensitive learning can reduce the total loss with a given cost matrix that quantifies how severe one type of mistake against another type of mistake, in many realistic cases the cost matrix is unknown to users. Motivated by these concerns, this paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive extreme learning machine (ECSELM), with the following merits: 1) to our best knowledge, it is the first proposal of cost-sensitive ELM; 2) it well addresses the open issue of how to define the cost matrix in cost-sensitive learning tasks; 3) an evolutionary backtracking search algorithm is induced for adaptive cost matrix optimization. Extensively, an ECSLDA method is generalized by coupling with cost-sensitive subspace learning.

Opinion mining is a field of study that extracts sentiments from user generated contents. Because of the complexity of the Arabic language, extracting those opinions are challenging. Better representation of reviews can help to improve extraction of opinions. The traditional way of representing opinion documents is using Bag-of-Words where the word is presented in fixed-length. The problem of this presentation is that it loses the order of the word and it ignores grammatical structure and lexicon-dependent. To overcome these limitations, distributed representations can be employed. It is based on learning vector representations of words, which also called \"word embeddings\". It can make the performance of natural language processing tasks have better performance with the help of learning algorithms. This representation uses neural networks and makes the learned vectors explicitly encode many linguistic patterns. In this study, we used distributed representations for Arabic opinion mining and compare it with Bag of Words (BOW) representation. We applied them on four benchmark datasets. Then, we used four machine learning methods which are Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

We introduce a scoring based miRNA target prediction system which gives better accuracy than the existing systems. Our system model consists of two stages. The first stage is to build a classifier using a database of miRNA and experimentally validated targets and non targets. Each mRNA target sequence is aligned with miRNA sequence using Smith-Waterman algorithm and 23 features are extracted. A Random Forest based classifier gives an accuracy of 95.56% which is better than the existing models.

In unsupervised clustering algorithms using kernel method, typically, a nonlinear mapping is used first to map the data into a potentially much higher feature space, where clustering is then performed. A drawback of these kernel clustering algorithms is thatthe clustering prototypes lie in high dimensional feature space and hence lack clear and intuitive descriptions unless using additional projection approximation from the feature to the data space as done in the existing literatures. In this paper, a novel clustering algorithm using the 'kernel method' based on the classical fuzzy clustering algorithm (FCM) is proposed and called as kernel fuzzy c-means algorithm (KFCM). KFCM adopts a new kernel-induced metric in the data space to replace the original Euclidean norm metric in FCM and the clustered prototypes still lie in the data space so that the clustering results can be reformulated and interpreted in the original space. Our analysis shows that KFCM is robust to noise and outliers and also tolerates unequal sized clusters. And finally this property is utilized to cluster incomplete data. Experiments on two artificial and one real datasets show that KFCM hasbetter clustering performance and more robust than several modifications of FCM for incomplete data clustering.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/B:NEPL.0000011135.19145.1b", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2051856481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["30806637", "9178107", "14029378", "12234494", "28637672", "13585263", "29535089", "61972012", "122725444", "50742905"], "inbound_citations": ["14124502", "4568873", "46068722", "17574997", "12991332", "203587879", "14333295", "29123260", "18361877", "11858622", "202745345", "8568338", "1315927", "21290668", "12069458", "40648713", "56025076", "26963023", "13175754", "18387006", "55357066", "35859105", "11819533", "12737381", "12737381", "12737381", "12950919", "3665238", "122334635", "17850492", "44000255", "26491864", "24123381", "2141469", "202689321", "27901624", "122059072", "6301532", "6805267", "16936359", "16135589", "1421079", "5776807", "215706436", "12362081", "18933410", "42578710", "73539847", "15370601", "54525904", "19615884", "18042615", "108636707", "195882385", "37498490", "18880245", "17803395", "30692163", "37506494", "198931148", "20299742", "214705267", "61091812", "133497206", "16546598", "14910509", "126103639", "1740448", "24744393", "9046756", "25516373", "17099203", "6435681", "53059070", "309514", "15278560", "28398218", "20957596", "15292083", "18463883", "9076165", "202733027", "17212464", "17304600", "10279258", "46357118", "14449970", "6675278", "505788", "21148533", "51805618", "1009096", "111241558", "14668961", "38744156", "215390807", "27719228", "4539626", "3952631", "39299272", "34667859", "140718997", "17011172", "13980620", "24761181", "73700145", "8075791", "3005031", "2959561", "199488557", "2311659", "30510025", "14909045", "12219991", "53278643", "12790357", "207676843", "15641993", "22276521", "209941051", "12986050", "753471", "21217854", "210930307", "210963815", "5691277", "207725332", "1068168", "12097876", "28788032", "26079988", "19509562", "2894332", "14871057", "235705", "23943275"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2793020"}

The lidar data are used exclusively to evaluate the potential in the road extraction process. First, the SVM algorithm is used to classify the lidar data into five classes: road, tree, building, grassland, and cement. Then, some misclassified pixels in the road class is removed using the road values in the normalized Digital Surface Model and Normalized Difference Distance features. In the postprocessing stage, a method based on Radon transform and Spline interpolation is employed to automatically locate and fill the gaps in the road network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm for gap filling works well on straight roads. The proposed road extraction algorithm is tested on three datasets. An accuracy assessment indicated 63.7%, 60.26% and 66.71% quality for three datasets. Finally, centerline of the detected roads is extracted using mathematical morphology. Road information plays an important role in many modern applications, including transportation, automatic navigation systems, traffic management, and crisis management, and enables existing geographic information system (GIS) databases to be updated more efficiently. In the past two decades, automatic road extraction has become an important topic in remote sensing, photogrammetry, and computer vision.

This includes all steps from determining the right GPS device to processing the GPS trajectories using a data driven approach without relying on geographic information systems (GIS) or user input. A participant\u2019s habit in route choice, travel times, travel mode changes and travel modes is extracted and stored in a profile. Using this, at the beginning of a commute, routes that the commuter is likely to take are determined and used to provide personalized real-time time traffic information. Extracting the commuter profile includes pre-processing methods for the trajectories, detection methods for places of travel mode changes and segmentation of tracks into singular travel modes. Also a detailed mode detection step is performed, comparing decision trees, logistic regression, multilayer perceptions and support vector machines as classification methods. Finally, the data is reduced to a network of prototypes using Growing Neural Gas (GNG), a self-organizing-network algorithm. This in turn enables a more effective algorithm for detecting likely routes.

For each exposure, the function of multiple pathways may be relevant. As pathways can have dozens of genes and most genes have multiple variant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 100s of SNPs are candidate susceptibility factors. Discerning the variants that affect function and cancer susceptibility is a major challenge. The goal of this study was identification of polymorphisms in base excision repair (BER) and antioxidant (AO) genes that affect the amount of DNA damage in untreated cells, primarily damage from oxidative metabolism, and the ability to repair damage induced by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Using the alkaline Comet assay we quantified single strand breaks and abasic sites in untreated cells and in cells immediately and 15 minutes after exposure to 5Gy IR, in 80 lymphoblastoid cell lines of the DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource (DPDR). Comet distributed moment was the parameter used to quantify damage. Genotypes of the cell lines, known from extensive resequencing studies of the DPDR, included 174 variants of 34 BER genes (159 amino acid substitution SNPs and 15 SNPs in upstream \u223c150bp sequences) and 17 amino acid substitution SNPs of 5 AO genes. Random Forests Regression (RFR) was used to identify SNPs that were important for predicting 2 phenotypes: endogenous (background) damage and % damage repaired 15 min after IR. Using a stringent cutoff for importance, there were 5 SNPs from 4 genes that were most influential for background damage (from greatest impact to least, POLD1 Arg19His, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC1 Val72Ala, LIG3 Arg780His, RPA4 Ala33Thr) and 7 influential SNPs for repair of IR damage (RPA4 Ala33Thr, XRCC1 Val72Ala, MPG 5 prime UTR, PNKP Pro20Ser, RAD23B Ala249Val, POLE Phe695Ile, LPO Thr105Ile). It is notable that the frequencies of these important SNPs range from 0.01 to 0.42 and that the SIFT scores of these variants independently predict an impact on protein function. In summary, RFR efficiently identified 10 out of 191 polymorphisms that help predict two phenotypes relevant to cancer risk. This study demonstrates the ability to use heuristic machine learning techniques to identify functionally important genetic variation by analyzing relationships between phenotypes and complex genotypes.

We introduce a modified spectral problem that uses all data points by constraining the latent projection of each point to be a local linear function of the landmarks' latent projections.

Robotic manipulators are highly nonlinear, coupled multivariable dynamical system, and may contain uncertain elements such as friction and load. Many efforts have been made in developing control schemes to achieve the precise tracking control of robot manipulators. For this reason, classical linear controller, such as PID (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative) controller, will provide robustness only over relatively small range operation because of complexity and nonlinearity of the system. Neurofuzzy employed in this system to increase the range operation without lack of robustness. Before considering the actual control system, a neurofuzzy controller must be trained. Two strategies of training are presented in this paper : generalized training and specialized training. In generalized training a neurofuzzy controller is trained off-line. The objective of this training is the controller should performed the ability to follow an input signal over the wide range operation even the transient response is poor. Specialized training is on-line procedure learning. Based on the result of generalized training a neurofuzzy controller is trained to achieve the desired transient response.The results proved the potency of the neurofuzzy in robotic manipulators control systems. Neurofuzzy control systems are essentially nonlinear systems, due to the nature of the nonlinear neurofuzzy controller. Mostly, the nonlinear system is so difficult to be solved. Consequently, the analysis of such systems is complicated, particularly, when a neurofuzzy controller is involved.

However, the architecture of ELM has a great impact on its generalization performance and is traditionally determined by a trial and error manner. Therefore selecting an appropriate ELM architecture becomes the crucial problem in the successful application of ELM. In this paper, we propose a Robust Incremental ELM (RI-ELM), a constructive method where the hidden nodes are added one by one. We consider RI-ELM as a robust algorithm, because the suitable architecture is selected based on the Leave-One-Out (LOO) Cross-Validation procedure, a nearly unbiased and reliable criterion, but with notorious slow implementation speed. To tackle this speed issue, we propose an efficient formula that can incrementally update the LOO error with every new hidden node recruited, thus RI-ELM can secure the speed advantage of ELM and achieve good and robust performance.

Lastly, it was predicted that the control group in this study would be a better match to the schizophrenic group compared to the control group studied in Chap. 11 by Tilaka. Method: 12 control group participants were each interviewed for about 20 min. The interviews were then rated for disorganised speech using TLC, CLANG, and SVM. Data for the schizophrenic group were obtained from Tilaka. Results: It was found that two-class SVM was as good as TLC and CLANG in diagnosing schizophrenic speech. It was also found that one-class SVM was comparable to two-class SVM in classifying schizophrenic speech.

Conventional RBDO methods are less than satisfactory in dealing with discrete design parameters and complex limit state functions (nonlinear and non-differentiable). Methods that are flexible enough to address the concerns above, however, come at a high computational cost. To enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing model flexibility, we propose a new RBDO framework: PS2, which combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Subset Simulation (SS). SS can efficiently estimate small failure probabilities, based on which SVM is adopted to evaluate the reliability of candidate solutions using binary classification. PSO is employed to solve the discrete optimization problem. Primary emphasis is placed upon the cooperation between SVM and PSO. The cooperation is mutually beneficial since the SVM classifier helps PSO evaluate the feasibility of solutions with high efficiency while the optimal solutions obtained by PSO assist in retraining the SVM classifier to attain better accuracy. The PS2 framework is implemented to find the optimal design of a ten-bar truss, whose component sizes are selected from a commercial standard. The reliability constraints are non-differentiable with two failure modes: yield stress and buckling stress. The interactive process between PSO and SVM contributes greatly to the success of the PS2 framework. It is shown that in various trials the PS2 framework consistently outperforms both the double-loop and single-loop approaches in terms of computational efficiency, solution quality, and model flexibility.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00366-011-0251-9", "venue": "Engineering with Computers", "journal": "Engineering with Computers", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1981382277", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["111722465", "122196753", "17368143", "122161004", "123042696", "122449540", "14607075", "15559648", "52874011", "120272732", "121418528", "16312373", "106693775", "16552240", "209828641", "21204149", "120201822", "108706816", "7367791", "22785667", "121225897", "108822620", "120858553", "27599992", "110300258", "44945", "15448188", "9436600", "28663487", "40157095", "108732742", "137510223", "7138354", "109996683", "109596136", "109654979", "121558237", "73609165"], "inbound_citations": ["214619097", "3181616", "13739451", "57427159", "125940562", "203182964", "49669568", "46656260", "204762518", "207989825", "14185506"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14694741"}

Manually constructed affective lexicons have limited scale and thus only have limited use in practical systems. In this work, we propose a regression-based method to automatically infer multi-dimensional affective representation of words via their word embedding based on a set of seed words. This method can make use of the rich semantic meanings obtained from word embedding to extract meanings in some specific semantic space. This is based on the assumption that different features in word embedding contribute differently to a particular affective dimension and a particular feature in word embedding contributes differently to different affective dimensions. Evaluation on various affective lexicons shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all the lexicons under different evaluation metrics with large margins. We also explore different regression models and conclude that the Ridge regression model, the Bayesian Ridge regression model and Support Vector Regression with linear kernel are the most suitable models.

There have been many attempts to predict the risk of DILI based on in vivo and in silico identification of hepatotoxic compounds. In the current study, we propose the in silico prediction model predicting DILI using weighted molecular fingerprints. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this study, we used 881 bits of molecular fingerprint and used as features describing presence or absence of each substructure of compounds. Then, the Bayesian probability of each substructure was calculated and labeled (positive or negative for DILI), and a weighted fingerprint was determined from the ratio of DILI-positive to DILI-negative probability values. Using weighted fingerprint features, the prediction models were trained and evaluated with the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The constructed models yielded accuracies of 73.8% and 72.6%, AUCs of 0.791 and 0.768 in cross-validation. In independent tests, models achieved accuracies of 60.1% and 61.1% for RF and SVM, respectively. The results validated that weighted features helped increase overall performance of prediction models. The constructed models were further applied to the prediction of natural compounds in herbs to identify DILI potential, and 13,996 unique herbal compounds were predicted as DILI-positive with the SVM model. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The prediction models with weighted features increased the performance compared to non-weighted models. Moreover, we predicted the DILI potential of herbs with the best performed model, and the prediction results suggest that many herbal compounds could have potential to be DILI. We can thus infer that taking natural products without detailed references about the relevant pathways may be dangerous. Considering the frequency of use of compounds in natural herbs and their increased application in drug development, DILI labeling would be very important.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5471939", "pubmed_id": "28617228", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-017-1638-4", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2618135456", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45970930", "20761720", "11304043", "1466622", "24305991", "17158127", "41882904", "87325742", "78968200", "84588490", "11166951", "17821458", "13485431", "441601", "31088695", "24151963", "25519563", "25959978", "44610451", "25001006", "23476936", "10555000", "94653040", "21297977", "206032727", "961425", "6950391", "2149305"], "inbound_citations": ["4465620", "58190307"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12494969"}

To this end, this paper proposes a tree-based space partition and merging ensemble learning framework known as the space partition tree (SPT), to partition the data space into two sub-spaces recursively. The partition hyperplane partitions the current space according to the maximum scatter direction of the majority set in the current space. When the partitioned sub-space satisfies the termination conditions, the sub-space is regarded as a decision space, and the decision region of the minority and majority classes is learned in this decision space. By merging the decision regions in all decision spaces, the SPT provides the entire decision region for the original problem. Thereby, the original complex problem can be divided into smaller problems with a relatively balanced and regular distribution. Moreover, the designed partition strategy offers advantages for the recognition of minority samples in the decision space. Finally, the space partition and merging exhibit superior geometric intuition and property of diversity. By introducing the biased penalties Support Vector Machine (BPSVM) into the SPT, the SPT-BPSVM demonstrates satisfactory performance and validates the effectiveness of the SPT in the experiment.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.06.033", "venue": "Inf.

A simulation-optimization approach, which incorporates a simulation model for groundwaterflow and transport processes within an optimization program, could help engineers in designing a remediation system that best satisfies management objectives as well as regulatory constraints. In-situ bioremediation is a highly complex, non-linear process and the modelling of such a complex system requires significant computational exertion. Soft computing techniques have a flexible mathematical structure which can generalize complex nonlinear processes. In in-situ bioremediation management, a physically-based model is used for the simulation and the simulated data is utilized by the optimization model to optimize the remediation cost. The recalling of simulator to satisfy the constraints is an extremely tedious and time consuming process and thus there is need for a simulator which can reduce the computational burden. This study presents a simulation-optimization approach to achieve an accurate and cost effective in-situ bioremediation system design for groundwater contaminated with BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) compounds. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used as a proxy simulator to replace BIOPLUME III for the simulation. The selection of ELM is done by a comparative analysis with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as they were successfully used in previous studies of in-situ bioremediation system design. Further, a single-objective optimization problem is solved by a coupled Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to achieve the minimum cost for the in-situ bioremediation system design.

In this work, we propose to learn according to classification decision objectives directly. We shall work on two classification objectives namely, the Total Error Rate and the Receiver Operating Characteristics, and directly optimize the learning process according to these objectives. Using a learning model which is linear in its parameters, we propose two approximation methods to optimize these classification objectives. Our empirical results on biometrics fusion show comparable performances of the proposed methods with the widely used Support Vector Machines (SVM), with one of the approaches having a clear advantage of fast single-step solution.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIEA.2006.257074", "venue": "2006 1ST IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications", "journal": "2006 1ST IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2097517760", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["192934", "60499797", "15583196", "3135985", "6105738", "198168616", "1998068", "1659002", "36399259", "6806508", "23612477", "840234", "2252222", "419941", "7198537", "60888073", "39044166", "7788300", "27321170"], "inbound_citations": ["14897102", "12241551", "25309154", "8477098", "17306815", "15705273", "18055043", "28445203", "18311195", "9722388", "15356450", "207320976", "211008162", "16060062"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15795285"}
