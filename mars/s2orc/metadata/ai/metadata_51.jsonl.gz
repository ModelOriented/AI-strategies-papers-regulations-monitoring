During the early neonatal stages of human development, the basic activity of the brain is to develop itself during sleep. Prolonged sleep is required in infants for further development of the nervous system. Sleep also plays an important role in body temperature regulation and energy saving. Neonatal sleep is divided into two main different sleep stages: Rapid EyeMovement (REM) and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM). As the infant develops, sleep stages vary in maturity, length and distribution, thus underlining the importance of the quantification of these stages, which could eventually lead to new biomarkers of neonatal brain development. Nowadays, the golden standard in sleep monitoring is Polysomnography (PSG), in which vital signs as well as EEG and muscle activity are recorded during a whole-night study and subsequently sleep stages are classified by an expert. However, the high obtrusiveness of the multiple electrodes involved in PSG and its high associated costs make it impossible to use PSG as a routine monitor system. The SOMNUS project had two main targets: (i) to accurately measure respiration signals from patients using an ultra-wideband radar module, and (ii) to detect differences in respiration between REM and NREM phases in order to unobtrusively and automatically score sleep states of infants without the need of any electrode attached to the patient. The system has been developed using a training dataset of 23 patients from 3 months to 14 years old. It is for the first time UWB radar technology is used to monitor sleep in young patients. Moreover, this work provides a new data analysis algorithm to suppress motion artifacts from radar signals and increase the robustness of respiration monitoring. The results from the breathing detection algorithm developed in the present work provided an average mean absolute error of 3.25 Respirations per Minute in respiration rate. Amount of movement was employed to estimate Sleep/Awake events, with an average error in percentage of Total Sleep Time of 7.48%. Regarding sleep-state classification, several classification analyses were performed in order to study the best classification variable to detect REM/NREM, along with analyses regarding the best classification technique. Respiration variability was the main feature determining REM/NREMstate, with an overall sleep classification accuracy of around 80% when using linear classifiers such as Support Vector Machines and Fisher Linear Discrimination.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2767189938", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:148848345"}

This research aims to produce algorithms that can detect lung nodules automatically in CT images, by utilizing a combination of hybrid computing between Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphical Processing Unit. The framework used is Compute Unified Device Architecture, which consists of platform and programming model. The algorithm consists of several steps: read dicom and data normalization, lung segmentation, candidate nodule extraction, and classification. Normalization is required to facilitate calculation by changing the data type ui16 to ui8. Furthermore, segmentation is used to separate the lung parts with other organs, where at this stage the Otsu Algorithm and Moore Neighborhood Tracing (MNT) are used. The next step is Lung Nodule Extraction, which aims to find the nodule candidate. The last step is a classification that utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to distinguish which one is nodule or not. The algorithm successfully detects near round nodules that are free-standing or not attached to other parts of organs. After undergoing ground truth tests, it was found that under some conditions, the algorithm has not been able to distinguish nodules and other strokes that resemble nodules.

This novel algorithm makes the major contribution. The OBIA algorithm combined Digital Surface Models (DSMs), orthomosaics and machine learning techniques (Random Forest, RF). OBIA-based plant heights were accurately estimated and used as a feature in the automatic sample selection by the RF classifier; this was the second research contribution. RF randomly selected a class balanced training set, obtained the optimum features values and classified the image, requiring no manual training, making this procedure time-efficient and more accurate, since it removes errors due to a subjective manual task.

For this end, a conceptual strategy (multi-station model) was developed to forecast the Souris River discharge more accurately. The strategy used herein was capable of covering uncertainties and complexities of river discharge modeling. At first a classic model along with WT was performed to predict the one-day-ahead river discharge for the each single station. Based on the results, db4 and decomposition level equal to 5 (db(4,5)) presented a better performance among selected mother wavelets for all hydrometric station. Therefore db(4,5) and EEMD was coupled and feature selection was performed for decomposed sub-series using MI to be employed in conceptual models.

Small insertions and deletions (indels) are one of the most common types of human genetic variants, and indels play a significant role in human inherited disease. To date, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how indels cause diseases. Therefore, identification and analysis of such deleterious variants is a key challenge and has been of great interest in the current research in genome biology. Increasing numbers of computational methods have been developed for discriminating between deleterious indels and neutral indels. However, most of the existing methods are based on traditional sequential or structural features, which cannot completely explain the association between indels and the resulting induced inherited disease. In this study, we establish a novel method to predict deleterious non-frameshifting indels based on features extracted from both protein interaction networks and traditional hybrid properties. Each indel was coded by 1,246 features. Using the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method and the incremental feature selection method, we obtained an optimal feature set containing 42 features, of which 21 features were derived from protein interaction networks. Based on the optimal feature set, an 88 % accuracy and a 0.76 MCC value were achieved by a Random Forest as evaluated by the Jackknife cross-validation test. This method outperformed existing methods of predicting deleterious indels, and can be applied in practice for deleterious non-frameshifting indel predictions in genome research. The analysis of the optimal features selected in the model revealed that network interactions play more important roles and could be informative for better illustrating an indel's function and disease associations than traditional sequential or structural features.

In previous work, macular anomalies have been detected automatically through multiscale analysis procedures such as wavelet analysis or dimensionality reduction algorithms followed by a classification algorithm, e.g., Support Vector Machine. The method that we propose is a Vectorized Matched Filtering (VMF) algorithm combined with Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm with locality preserving properties. By applying LE, we are able to represent the data in the form of eigenimages, some of which accentuate the visibility of anomalies. We pick significant eigenimages and proceed with the VMF algorithm that classifies anomalies across all of these eigenimages simultaneously. To evaluate our performance, we compare our method to two other schemes: a matched filtering algorithm based on anomaly detection on single images and a combination of PCA and VMF. LE combined with VMF algorithm performs best, yielding a high rate of accurate anomaly detection.

Thus, it is hard for a search engine to figure out what the users precisely want. Most commercial search engines simply return the same set of results to all users who ask the same query. However, different users may have different preferences on the result set. Thus, personalization is needed in order to rank the results according to a user's personal preferences. In this thesis, we develop two methods to mine a user's conceptual preferences from search engine clickthrough data, and adjust the search result ranking according to the extracted preferences to improve the retrieval effectiveness for the user. ::: We first propose a framework that supports mining a user's conceptual preferences from users' clickthrough data resulting from web search. The discovered preferences are utilized to adapt a search engine's ranking function. In the framework, an extended set of conceptual preferences is derived for a user based on the concepts extracted from the search results and the clickthrough data. Then, an Ontology-based User Profile (OUP) representing the user profile as a concept ontology tree is generated. Finally, the OUP is input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn a concept preference vector for adapting a personalized ranking function that re-ranks the search results. We confirm that our approach is able to improve significantly the retrieval effectiveness for the user. ::: We then adopt the OUP approach in the area of location-based personalization. We propose a personalized mobile search engine, PMSE, that captures the users' preferences in the form of concepts by mining their clickthrough data. Due to the importance of location information in mobile search, PMSE classifies these concepts into content concepts and location concepts. In addition, users' locations (positioned by GPS) are used to supplement the location concepts in PMSE. The user preferences are organized in an ontology-based, multi-facet user profile, which are used to adapt a personalized ranking function for rank adaptation of future search results. To characterize the diversity of the concepts associated with a query and their relevance to the user's need, four entropies are introduced to balance the weights between the content and location facets. We also present a detailed client-server architecture of PMSE. In our design, the client collects and stores locally the clickthrough data to protect privacy, whereas resource consuming tasks such as concept extraction, training and reranking are performed at the PMSE server. We prototype PMSE on the Google Android platform. Experimental results show that PMSE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness compared to the baseline without personalization.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14711/thesis-b1114801", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "4066884", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107753364"}

I.INTRODUCTION Numerous incremental learning algorithms based onneural networks, whicharecalled incremental orcompetitive neural networks, havebeenproposed andapplied inmanyapplica- tion domains asclassification models. A salient advantage of incremental neural networks istheir capability ofoperating withinformation ofnewdataincrementally. Thereby, they canimprove their performance bygradually increasing their structural complexity. Well-known examples ofincremen- talorcompetitive neural networks include Kohonen's self- organizing map(SOM)(1)andGrowing CellStructures (GCS)(2). Neural network architecture consisting ofSOM or GCSlayer followed byaRadial Basis Function output layer (3)canrealize supervised learning. Inaddition, theGrowing Neural Gas(GNG)architecture isa modification tothe GCS,inwhich thedimensionality oftopological structures is notpredefined, butisinstead discovered during training. In recent years, further modifications havebeenproposed: Life- long Learning Cell Structures (LLCS) (4)forsupervised clas- sification andSelf-Organizing Incremental Neural Network (SOINN) (5)forunsupervised clustering. Inthese methods, theinsertion ofnodesisstopped automatically. Thereby, these methods avoid thepermanent increase ofnodes. They areintended tobalance stability andplasticity. A mainchallenge inthedesign ofefficient androbust learning algorithms isthat newdatasets arecontinually added toanalready hugedatabase. Theuseofthehugedataset introduces twoissues. Thefirst ishowtolearn newknowl- edge without forgetting previous knowledge.

Generating realistic data is especially challenging, since human perception is highly sensitive to non-realistic appearance. In recent times, new levels of realism have been achieved by advances in GAN training procedures and architectures. These successful models, however, are tuned mostly for use with regularly sampled data such as images, audio, and video. Despite the successful application of the architecture on these types of media, applying the same tools to geometric data poses a far greater challenge. The study of geometric deep learning is still a debated issue within the academic community, as the lack of intrinsic parametrization inherent to geometric objects prohibits the direct use of convolutional filters, a main building block of today\u2019s machine learning systems. ::: In this article, we propose a new method for generating realistic human facial geometries coupled with overlayed textures. We circumvent the parametrization issue by utilizing a specialized non-rigid alignment procedure, and imposing a global mapping from our data to the unit rectangle. This mapping enables the representation of our geometric data as regularly sampled 2D images. We further discuss how to design such a mapping to control the distortion and conserve area within the target image. By representing geometric textures and geometries as images, we are able to use advanced GAN methodologies to generate new plausible textures and geometries. We address the often-neglected topic of relationship between texture and geometry and propose different methods for fitting generated geometries to generated textures. In addition, we widen the scope of our discussion and offer a new method for training GAN models on partially corrupted data.

This difficulty has lead to recent top-down segmentation algorithms that are based on class-specific image information. Despite the success of top-down algorithms, they often give coarse segmentations that can be significantly refined using low-level cues. This raises the question of how to combine both top-down and bottom-up cues in a principled manner. ::: ::: In this paper we approach this problem using supervised learning. Given a training set of ground truth segmentations we train a fragment-based segmentation algorithm which takes into account both bottom-up and top-down cues simultaneously, in contrast to most existing algorithms which train top-down and bottom-up modules separately. We formulate the problem in the framework of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and derive a feature induction algorithm for CRF, which allows us to efficiently search over thousands of candidate fragments. Whereas pure top-down algorithms often require hundreds of fragments, our simultaneous learning procedure yields algorithms with a handful of fragments that are combined with low-level cues to efficiently compute high quality segmentations.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11263-008-0166-0", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "journal": "International Journal of Computer Vision", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2584149233,2978644077,1969735849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12481669", "5558414", "1101504", "6953475", "11859305", "14477095", "10689850", "277918", "7959003", "18320130", "6533591", "118606142", "9966171", "9389968", "2038782", "17925738", "5489503", "52835993", "122671527", "15926"], "inbound_citations": ["9170320", "13187368", "58463955", "15911389", "9616328", "2750803", "16319381", "7969654", "1264280", "3113624", "5778312", "8658838", "1443031", "16769316", "2005244", "9338937", "54194690", "14458536", "6470548", "16055906", "10880491", "18564371", "15772471", "35788111", "38647352", "3069989", "10657512", "16934611", "11092026", "15642645", "1671282", "14692313", "6951689", "2335442", "104545", "14713551", "2717728", "12935095", "12765959", "21878793", "16711244", "11646120", "9011644", "2455273", "1926500", "11266944", "6460499", "18638513", "16054975", "5643192", "2818836", "10640752", "3522817", "2369740", "6260508", "5383428", "14412103", "6856958", "10480097", "32018953", "206764991", "13285929", "13500363", "14331681", "6382076", "18002044", "10651691", "9605513", "37573700", "8458161", "12917143", "14022400", "17490408", "18765157", "16680332", "9992392", "3233916", "18850055", "16204745", "55951282", "15647205", "199511374", "17457976", "10685399", "17891640", "15220121", "52805831", "1954972", "1676517", "17308300", "15570677", "14833979", "437251", "19705861", "8878928", "10230713", "15333206", "36630067", "15557448", "16766181", "5728901", "6952603", "2428333", "8300778", "15625651", "13968478", "552537", "687221", "9848139", "9848139", "18833642", "2279060", "18136467", "14593894", "6962453", "14215585", "1589339", "9518679", "67778142", "11860682", "13496867", "7625628", "17449255", "2468599", "16445175", "10390895", "17683105", "16425413", "17867317", "5875591", "128211", "73503613", "9807718", "673851", "17028241", "2092164", "6219585", "3505099", "1811326", "5754512", "17859772", "15111239", "2230205", "22557050", "5324341", "39283944", "17989203", "18402653", "10825765", "17068021", "8812277", "6569104", "1555443", "11486128", "1290784", "3258810", "6282441", "5700931", "9302577", "13139171", "16184372", "9905377", "52285751", "5674867", "6086735", "207322357"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:558628"}

This technique, besides being language independent and relatively accurate, can (a) classify a change immediately upon its completion and (b) use features extracted solely from the change delta (added, deleted) and the source code to predict buggy changes. Thus, integrating change classification within an IDE can predict potential bugs in the software as the developer edits the source code, ideally reducing the amount of time spent on fixing bugs later.

This paper explores the area of character segmentation and proposes an innovative character segmentation scheme for Assamese word images, both printed and handwritten, which operates in a sliding window based mechanism taking aid of a classifier. The method extends the conventional role of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers and makes them useful in segmentation also. Here, a small window is passed over the word image and word segment inside the current window is fed to the trained SVM. Based on the probability estimate given by the SVM, segmentation points are determined. When probability estimate is higher than a predefined threshold it is assumed that the current window holds a segmentation point. Otherwise the size of window is incremented and again fed to the SVM. This process is repeated until the window passes over the entire word.

Image features are derived from edge information from human annotated images. The features are combined within a discriminatively trained Conditional Random Field (CRF). Loopy belief propagation is used to infer segmentations when an unsegmented video sequence is given.

How to efficiently manage and utilize the video content information within network public opinion becomes a research hot spot in the field of the analysis of network public opinion. The main task of tackling video information is classifying the video contents in social networks which could strengthen the ability of public opinion classification.

In this study, the performance of four computational models to estimate electrical conductivity (EC) (soil salinization) was evaluated using laboratory reflectance spectroscopy. To investigate the influence of bandwidth and band positioning on the EC estimates, we simulated the spectral resolution of two hyperspectral sensors (airborne ProSpecTIR-VS and orbital Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI)) and three multispectral instruments (RapidEye/REIS, High Resolution Geometric (HRG)/SPOT-5, and Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8)). Principal component analysis (PCA) and the first-order derivative analysis were applied to the data to generate metrics associated with soil brightness and spectral features, respectively. The three sets of data (reflectance, PCA, and derivative) were tested as input variable for Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Ordinary Least Square regression (OLS), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Finally, the laboratory models were inverted to a ProSpecTIR-VS image (400\u20132500 nm) acquired with 1-m spatial resolution in the northeast of Brazil. The objective was to estimate EC over exposed soils detected using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results showed that the predictive ability of the linear models and ELM was better than that of the MLP, as indicated by higher values of the coefficient of determination (R2) and ratio of the performance to deviation (RPD), and lower values of the root mean square error (RMSE). Metrics associated with soil brightness (reflectance and PCA scores) were more efficient in detecting changes in the EC produced by soil salinization than metrics related to spectral features (derivative). When applied to the image, the PLSR model with reflectance had an RMSE of 1.22 dS\u00b7m\u22121 and an RPD of 2.21, and was more suitable for detecting salinization (10\u201320 dS\u00b7m\u22121) in exposed soils (NDVI < 0.30) than the other models. For all computational models, lower values of RMSE and higher values of RPD were observed for the narrowband-simulated sensors compared to the broadband-simulated instruments.

We perform supervised fine-tuning on an AlexNet deep convolutional neural network in a three-stage process, using three FER datasets in succession. The first two training stages are based on FER datasets containing frontal images only. The final training stage uses a third FER dataset that includes non-frontal poses in images that are relatively low in resolution and/or with partial occlusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MSPTL approach outperforms typical TL and other PTL systems for FER in both frontal and non-frontal face poses.

Effectively assessing waterlogging susceptibility can reduce or even avoid the damage caused by such disasters. Here, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for waterlogging susceptibility assessment due to its simplicity, objectivity, and understandability. The Particle Swarm Optimization method was used to compute parameters of the SVM. When selecting negative samples for machine learning methods, the methods of subjective selection and single random selection used in previous studies made it easy to select improper negative samples, and thus affected the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the trained classifiers. To overcome these shortcomings, we proposed a repeatedly random sampling and verifying model to select negative samples for an SVM. As such, this study adopted the spatial framework of integrating GIS and an SVM to assess waterlogging susceptibility using the primary urban area of Guangzhou as an example. The results demonstrate that the waterlogging susceptibility map derived from the most accurate classifier (MAC) can reflect the real occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging. Moreover, we randomly generated 100,000 groups of samples to test the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the MAC; the results show that in 82% of the samples, the area under the curve value of the MAC was higher than that of the randomly generated classifier. This demonstrated that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of an MAC with a relatively high and stable classification accuracy.

Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been used in the past for the problem of protein subcellular localization, but have been shown to suffer from a lack of annotated training data in each species under study. To overcome this data sparsity problem, we observe that because some of the organisms may be related to each other, there may be some commonalities across different organisms that can be discovered and used to help boost the data in each localization task. In this paper, we formulate protein subcellular localization problem as one of multitask learning across different organisms. We adapt and compare two specializations of the multitask learning algorithms on 20 different organisms. Our experimental results show that multitask learning performs much better than the traditional single-task methods. Among the different multitask learning methods, we found that the multitask kernels and supertype kernels under multitask learning that share parameters perform slightly better than multitask learning by sharing latent features. The most significant improvement in terms of localization accuracy is about 25 percent.

These issues, namely quantity, quality, and impurity challenges, are the main focus of this study. Three classification algorithms, including Maximum Likelihood Classifier MLC, Artificial Neural Networks ANNs, and Support Vector Machines SVMs, are comprehensively evaluated, and their requirements for control data are determined. To accomplish this, rich field data, collected from diving off of Lizard Island in eastern Australia, and Landsat-8 images are used as the input data.

On the other hand, SVM shows the best resistance against the quantity and impurity challenges. Being aware of these points, a coral reef map is produced, for the first time, of the northern Persian Gulf, a coral habitat with very special environmental conditions.

Existing technologies such as remote sensing are valuable tools for estimating the lacking data, as these technologies become more widely available and have a high areal coverage. However, indirect estimates of the environmental characteristics are prone to uncertainty. Hence, an improved understanding of the quality of the estimates and the development of methods for dealing with their associated uncertainty are essential to evolve towards accurate PUB. In this study, the impact of the uncertainty associated with the classification of land cover based on multi-temporal SPOT imagery, resulting from the use of the Random Forests classifier, on the predictions of the hydrologic model TOPLATS is investigated through a Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the predictions of evapotranspiration, runoff and baseflow are hardly affected by the classification uncertainty when area-averaged predictions are intended, implying that uncertainty propagation is only advisable in case a spatial distribution of the predictions is relevant for decision making or is coupled to other spatially distributed models. Based on the resulting uncertainty map, guidelines for additional data collection are formulated in order to reduce the uncertainty for future model applications. Because a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty analysis is computationally very demanding, especially when complex models are involved, we developed a fast indicative uncertainty assessment method that allows for generating proxies of the Monte Carlo-based result in terms of the mean prediction and its associated uncertainty based on a single model evaluation. These proxies are shown to perform well and provide a good indication of the impact of classification uncertainty on the prediction result.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.05.049", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2019564919", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["8729594", "155980866", "126023675", "67773689"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129176044"}

Human Movement Science, 23 , 605\u2013620] and Growing Neural Gas (Fritzke, 1995) by quality neurons. A quality neuron reflects the rareness of a piece of information and therefore can measure the originality of a recorded activity that was assigned to the neuron during the network training. The DyCoNG approach was validated using data from a longitudinal field-based study.

By adopting the efficient image processing techniques, the diagnosis process can be made effective, earlier and accurate, where the time aspect is extremely decisive.

Moreover, the proposed ECM-CSD (Efficient Classification Model for Cancer Stage Diagnosis) uses Computed Tomography (CT) lung images for processing, since it poses higher imaging sensitivity, resolution with good isotopic acquisition in lung nodule identification. With those images, the pre-processing has been made with Gaussian Filter for smoothing and Gabor Filter for enhancement. Following, based on the extracted image features, the effective segmentation of lung nodules is performed using the FCM based clustering.

Using a vector space model, the generated representations structure is altered to increase performance. Query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback is applied to fine-tune the results. The content-based retrieval subsystem performs retrieval based on visual features extracted from the images. A Gaussian Mixture Model is constructed from the extracted visual features, in our case - RGB histograms, and is used in encoding the same features into Fisher Vectors. With scalability and speed in mind, we utilized a product quantization technique over the generated vectors, which provides fast response times over large image collections. Product quantization drastically reduces the size of the image representation at almost no cost to accuracy, thus improving the scalability factor of our system.

A few methods exist in the market presently towards this aim. However, sleep physicians may not have full assurance and consideration in such methods due to concerns associated with systems accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This paper presents a novel and efficient technique that can be implemented in a microcontroller device to identify sleep stages in an effort to assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of related sleep disorders by enhancing the accuracy of the developed algorithm using a single channel of EEG signals. First, the dataset of EEG signal is filtered and decomposed into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma subbands using Butterworth band-pass filters. Second, a set of sample statistical discriminating features are derived from each frequency band. Finally, sleep stages consisting of Wakefulness, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) are classified using several supervised machine learning classifiers including multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Neural Networks (NN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB).

This paper proposes a Copy and Paste Generative Adversarial Network (CPGAN) to recover authentic high-resolution (HR) face images while compensating for low and non-uniform illumination. To this end, we develop two key components in our CPGAN: internal and external Copy and Paste nets (CPnets). Specifically, our internal CPnet exploits facial information residing in the input image to enhance facial details; while our external CPnet leverages an external HR face for illumination compensation. A new illumination compensation loss is thus developed to capture illumination from the external guided face image effectively. Furthermore, our method offsets illumination and upsamples facial details alternately in a coarse-to-fine fashion, thus alleviating the correspondence ambiguity between LR inputs and external HR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method manifests authentic HR face images in a uniform illumination condition and outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.10650", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3007053533", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2891906", "4319595", "1882232", "4564405", "9417016", "9925788", "4110173", "1033682", "22066308", "6576859", "6200260", "6099034", "11738409", "211227", "1380259", "459456", "7336648", "13613792", "76663699", "4435725", "3100155", "14124313", "4248647", "13951779", "52084187", "3721829", "157056745", "35258007", "39018476", "2064528", "3951396", "207912376", "145822345", "49657846", "206770979", "11859568"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211296814"}

The first applies graph smoothing as a postprocessing step to tease the vectors of different senses apart, and is applicable to any vector space model.

In this paper we propose a completely automatic shoulder pain intensity recognition system. A very small dimensional directional displacement geometric feature vector is extracted automatically from prominent facial regions.

Recent studies have shown that Support Vector Regression (SVR) has an interesting potential in the field of effort estimation. However applying SVR requires to carefully set some parameters that heavily affect the prediction accuracy. No general guidelines are available to select these parameters, whose choice also depends on the characteristics of the data set used. This motivates the work described in this paper. Aims. We have investigated the use of an optimization technique in combination with SVR to select a suitable subset of parameters to be used for effort estimation. This technique is named Tabu Search (TS), which is a meta-heuristic approach used to address several optimization problems. Method. We employed SVR with linear and RBF kernels, and used variables' preprocessing strategies (i.e., logarithmic). As for the data set, we employed the Tukutuku cross-company database, which is widely adopted in Web effort estimation studies, and performed a hold-out validation using two different splits of the data set. As benchmark, results are compared to those obtained with Manual StepWise Regression, Case-Based Reasoning, and Bayesian Networks. Results. Our results show that TS provides a good choice of parameters, so that the combination of TS and SVR outperforms any other technique applied on this data set. Conclusions. The use of the meta-heuristic Tabu Search allowed us to obtain (I) an automatic choice of the parameters required to run SVR, and (II) a significant improvement on prediction accuracy for SVR. While we are not guaranteed that this is the global optimum, the results we are presenting are the best performance ever obtained on the problem at the hand, up to now. Of course, the experimental results here presented should be assessed on further data. However, they are surely interesting enough to suggest the use of SVR among the techniques that are suitable for effort estimation, especially when using a cross-company database.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1868328.1868335", "venue": "PROMISE '10", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2166573308", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17156028", "195720856", "6253838", "153568267", "40756084", "14313093", "61006989", "60835179", "23402451", "206787478", "16336931", "5634305", "29367015", "88516979", "9988056", "18556197", "8176105", "11275937", "13195959", "15756092", "44550047", "15480929", "115205884", "59778174", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["15287603", "16707121", "7118228", "51884092", "13266016", "1238411", "588661", "12509721", "2773042", "9540357", "33786509", "6942521", "9988277", "9439971", "52114900", "9533797", "12449824", "6037763", "6089057", "1565879", "204707415", "9313242", "16899279", "15036265", "16631323"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15027564"}

Through extensions of linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and reduction to a Sylvester equation, we construct an algorithm that improves the time complexity of kernel computation from $O(n^6)$ to $O(n^3)$.

Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that it is often more than a thousand times faster than previous approaches.

In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1577069.1577078", "venue": "J.

Seventy-nine new-borns, with less than 48 hours of life and with a gestational age between 36 and 41 weeks, borned in the Consorci Hospital General Universitari of Valencia were enrolled after the tutor's authorization. Fifteen of them were diagnosed with sepsis. Electrocardiogram signal was monitored and recorded for 90 minutes and HRV parameters were calculated. Clinical data was extracted from the electronic medical record and sepsis was confirmed by central laboratory analyses. Supervised ML algorithms were evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Significant differences were observed in the power spectrum density at very low and low frequency bands and in long-term non-linear components.

In this paper we propose a system for text detection of both artificial and scene text in images and video frames. The system is based on a machine learning stage which uses an Random Forest classifier and a highly discriminative feature set produced by using a new texture operator called Multilevel Adaptive Color edge Local Binary Pattern (MACeLBP). MACeLBP describes the spatial distribution of color edges in multiple adaptive levels of contrast. Then, a gradient-based algorithm is applied to achieve distinction among text lines as well as refinement in the localization of the text lines. The whole algorithm is situated in a multiresolution framework to achieve invariance to scale for the detection of text lines. Finally, an optional connected-component step segments text lines into words based on the distances between the resulting components.

Using the captured traffic and the feedback of the IT team of the network, we assess the performance of the Multivariate Statistical Network Monitoring (MSNM) technique proposed in a recent paper, and compare it with the one-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). We derive two main conclusions from this real experiment: i) while both approaches showed a similar detection performance, MSNM was superior in diagnosis, a step which is seldom considered in comparisons, and ii) the traffic also presented several non-induced anomalies, initially labeled as normal traffic and clearly detected by both MSNM and OCSVM. This suggests caution in the use of typical performance measures in this type of experiments, since they heavily rely on the correctness of the labeling.

This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to plotting in 3D space, approximate contour trees from a set of scattered samples embedded in the high-dimensional space. Our main idea is to take advantage of manifold learning so that we can elongate the distribution of high-dimensional data samples to embed it into a low-dimensional space while respecting its local proximity of sample points. The contribution of this paper lies in the introduction of new distance metrics to manifold learning, which allows us to reformulate existing algorithms as a variant of currently available dimensionality reduction scheme. Efficient reduction of data sizes together with segmentation capability is also developed to equip our approach with a coarse-to-fine analysis even for large-scale datasets.

The prediction problem is solved by a sketch-refinement process in which the sketcher generates the preliminary anatomical and physiological information and the refiner refines and generates images reflecting the tissue myelin content in the human brain. We evaluated the ability of our method to predict myelin content at both global and voxel-wise levels.

Due to this, researchers have proposed several methods aimed at detecting drivers\u2019 drowsiness. These methods include subjective, physiological, behavioral, vehicle-based, and hybrid methods. However, recent reports on road safety are still indicating drowsy driving as a major cause of road accidents. This is plausible because the current driver drowsiness detection (DDD) solutions are either intrusive or expensive, thus hindering their ubiquitous nature. This research serves to bridge this gap by providing a test-bed for achieving a non-intrusive and low-cost DDD solution. A behavioral DDD solution is proposed based on tracking the face and eye state of the driver. The aim is to make this research an inception to DDD pervasiveness. To achieve this, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) Computer Vision Lab\u2019s driver drowsiness detection video dataset was utilized. Several video and image processing operations were performed on the videos so as to detect the drivers\u2019 eye state. From the eye states, three important drowsiness features were extracted: percentage of eyelid closure (PERCLOS), blink frequency (BF), and Maximum Closure Duration (MCD) of the eyes. These features were then fed as inputs into several machine learning models for drowsiness classification. Models from the K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) machine learning algorithms were experimented. These models were evaluated by calculating their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, miss rate, and false alarm rate values. Although these five metrics were evaluated, the focus was more on getting optimal accuracies and miss rates. The result shows that the best models were a KNN model when k = 31 and an ANN model that used an Adadelta optimizer with 3 hidden layer network of 3, 27, and 9 neurons respective.

The special attributes are more suitable for the attribute manipulation and thus conducting searches. In order to solve the mentioned fashion search problem, it is crucial for the deep neural networks to understand attribute similarities. To facilitate more specific similarity learning, clothing items are represented by their structural subcomponents or \"parts\". The parts are estimated using an unsupervised segmentation method and used inside the proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an attention mechanism. Meaning, different parts are connected to the special attributes, e.g. sleeve part is connected with sleeve length attribute. With this mechanism, part-based triplet ranking constraint is applied to learn similarity of each special attribute independently from one another in a single network. In the end, the well-defined features are used to conduct the fashion search. Additionally, an adaptive relevance feedback module is used to personalize the fashion search process with the feature descriptions.

Agricultural information is currently collected through seasonal agricultural surveys, but more frequent and timely data collection is needed to adequately inform public and private decision-makers about the status of crops during the growing season. Sentinel-1 and -2 data are freely available with new images provided every 4-5 days. While analysis of these multispectral images has been used for agricultural applications, there are few applications to smallholder agriculture. Major challenges for satellite image analysis in the context of Rwanda include heavily clouded scenes and small plot sizes that are often intercropped. Sentinel-2 scenes corresponding to mid-season were analyzed, and spectral signatures of maize could be distinguished from those of other crops. Seasonal mean filtering was applied to Sentinel-1 scenes, and there was significant overlap in the spectral signatures across different types of vegetation.

Firstly, the pre-processed facial images are projected into Radon space via Radon transform at a specified angle. Then, the obtained Radon space or sinogram that represent the facial emotions is subjected to wavelet transform. In this framework, the Radon space is decomposed into four sub-band at a different level of decomposition. The approximate coefficients sub-band are independently extracted and used as intrinsic features to recognize the facial emotion. To reduce the data dimensionality, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the extracted features. Then, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is adopted as a classifier to classify seven (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise) facial emotions.

Such models typically possess clear explanatory clarity and are well able to handle the apparently recursive structure of natural sentences. In fact, they tend to be too powerful in this respect and ad hoc external constraints and manipulations are often necessary to limit their performance to better match humans\u2019 imperfect abilities. Furthermore, due to their reliance on simple rules and structured knowledge, symbolic methods do not lend themselves to learning. A focus on symbolic models and an idealized notion of language processing has contributed to the widespread belief that language is primarily innately specified. But over the past twenty years there has been increasing interest in connectionist models of language processing. Initially, these were relatively straight-forward implementations of symbolic methods using simple processing units. However, as the representational and learning abilities of connectionist networks were exploited to an increasing extent, connectionist systems have taken on a markedly different character than symbolic models. This has lead to a shift in our understanding of the critical sources of information in language and how they interact in processing and learning. The importance of connectionism is not merely that it links our understanding of cognition to the hardware of the brain but that its study leads to fundamental changes in our understanding of cognition. It now seems quite reasonable to hypothesize that much of language could be learned by general processing mechanisms exposed to a natural environment. However, current connectionist models have only demonstrated limited abilities in simple domains and there remains considerable room for skepticism. This paper describes the development of a unified connectionist model of sentence comprehension and production. It extends previous work in its use of more sophisticated languages, word-level rather than phrase or word-class inputs, minimal symbolic control structures, and implicit prediction as a training method for production. The current proposal outlines progress to date on the model and discusses how it will be further extended and tested.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2416164230", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63610799"}

In our method, target-specific similarity metrics are learned, which give rise to the appearance-based models used in the tracklet affinity estimation. Trajectory-based tracklets are refined by using the learned metrics to account for appearance consistency and to identify reliable tracklets. The metrics are then re-learned using reliable tracklets for computing tracklet affinity scores. Long-term trajectories are then obtained through network flow optimization.

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel subspace learning method named Discriminant Manifold Learning via Sparse Coding (DML_SC). In our method, we first decompose the input image into several components via dictionary learning, and then regroup the components into a More Important Part (MIP) and a Less Important Part (LIP). The MIP can be regarded as the clean part of the original image residing on a nonlinear submanifold, while LIP as noise in the image. Finally, the MIP and LIP are incorporated into manifold learning to learn a desired discriminative subspace.

The central idea is that CAD to BIM translation is a complex diagrammatic interpretation problem requiring a domain (drafting language) KR to render it tractable and that such a KR can take the form of an information model. ::: Formal notions of drawing-as-language have been advanced and studied quite extensively for close to 25 years. The analogy implicitly encourages comparison between problem structures in both domains, revealing important similarities and offering guidance from the more mature field of Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The primary insight we derive from NLU involves the central role that a formal language description plays in guiding the process of interpretation (inferential reasoning), and the notable absence of a comparable specification for architectural drafting. ::: We adopt a modified version of Engelhard\u2019s approach which expresses drawing structure in terms of a symbol set, a set of relationships, and a set of compositional frameworks in which they are composed. We further define an approach for establishing the features of this KR, drawing upon related work on conceptual frameworks for diagrammatic reasoning systems. We augment this with observation of human subjects performing a number of drafting interpretation exercises and derive some understanding of its inferential nature therefrom. We consider this indicative of the potential range of processes a computational drafting model should ideally support. ::: The KR is implemented as an information model using the EXPRESS language because it is in the public domain and is the implementation language of the target Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) model. We draw extensively from the IFC library to demonstrate that it can be applied in this manner, and apply the MVD methodology in defining the scope and interface of the DOM and IFC. This simplifies the IFC translation process significantly and minimizes the need for mapping. ::: We conclude on the basis of selective implementations that a model reflecting the principles and features we define can indeed provide needed and otherwise unavailable support in drafting interpretation and other problems involving reasoning with this class of diagrammatic representations.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2431873315", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63048703"}

Typically, microRNA genes are short non-coding (~20-22 nt) RNAs that do not encode proteins, but instead they produce small RNA molecules. These molecules can regulate mRNA target genes by binding to the 3\u2019 UTR of mRNA in accordance to Watson-Crick complementarity for cleavage or translational repression. MicroRNAs have been a major object of study as they have been found to be involved in some basic biological processes. These observations underline the importance of normal microRNA homeostasis on functions such as development, differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation. Dysregulation of miRNA is fundamental to the pathogenesis of many diseases and it has been long suspected that miRNA expression can be deregulated in cancer and abnormal miRNA activity may lead to tumorgenesis. From all the above, it is obvious that the better understanding of miRNA mechanism and function may lead to new and more sophisticated design of clinical therapies. Consequently, the identification of novel microRNA genes is a challenging bioinformatics problem. ::: The experimental identification has some important drawbacks: the small size of microRNA genes in comparison to the size of the genome, cost and time, and low sensitivity. To overcome these technical problems a lot of computational methods have been proposed and several Artificial Intelligence techniques have been applied to distinguish real pre-miRNAs from pseudo hairpins. Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and other probabilistic algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models have been successfully developed as classification methods. All these computational methods rely on the computation of several sequential, structural and thermodynamical microRNA features. In addition, the prediction efficiency is related to the extraction of the most discriminative features and to the optimization of the parameters. ::: At first, this thesis presents a hybrid approach for simultaneous microRNA classification, feature extraction and parameters optimization. We took advantage of the innovative techniques of Evolutionary Programming and we introduced an embedded classification method, which combines the efficiency and robustness of Support Vector Machines with Genetic Algorithms for feature selection and parameters optimization. Secondly, objective of this thesis was the development of an online platform for effective microRNA genes prediction. The prediction model is based on our classification model and we used a significant feature subset that the proposed methodology revealed to be consistent. Also, we provided the opportunity to calculate all the microRNA features that have been proposed in the literature. We incorporated different packages such as the Vienna RNA package and UnaFold package and we introduced some new features with high discriminative power. This work is related to biophysics and thermodynamics of small RNA molecules and it can be applied to other categories of regulatory molecules. ::: Also, the provided service in accordance to the feature calculation will encourage the application of other Artificial Intelligence Techniques in identifying microRNAs. We hope that the construction of new datasets will contribute to the Development of new Machine Learning methodologies. ::: Furthermore, our tool maintains a Database about predicted microRNA sequences plus some informating metadata about them.

However, most of existing methods are not adaptive in real-world applications due to the complexity of real noise. To address this problem, a novel pyramidal generative structural network (PGSN) is proposed for robust and efficient real-world noisy image denoising. Specifically, we consider the denoising problem as a process of image generation. The procedure is to first build a Gaussian pyramid where a cascade of encoder-decoder networks are used to adaptively capture multi-scale image features and progressively reconstruct the corresponding noise-free image from coarse to fine granularity. Then, we train a conditional form of GAN at each pyramid level. By integrating the conditional GAN approach into the Gaussian pyramid, the proposed network can well combine the image features from different pyramid levels, and an incremental distinction between the real noise and image details is dynamically built up, hence greatly boosting the denoising performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our PGSN gives satisfactory denoising results, and achieves superior performance against the state-of-the-arts.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-020-10215-w", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011186950", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["12479973", "37169052", "6888534", "1887989", "6514658", "6329825", "20937588", "1663191", "7620274", "64147556", "16386052", "16321534", "7572570", "15799108", "996788", "3050157", "62367331", "2932038", "2456655", "6253552", "2882843", "49665770", "24246005", "199438318", "159041705", "1900475", "10352330", "4350405", "51989956", "14800614", "1033682", "12803511", "86757630", "3655281", "58673218", "206594470", "2202933", "2930547", "9715523", "9247572", "16008641", "211227", "980236"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212421540"}

Three types of image segmentation approaches were evaluated to assess any differences while performing the material classification; pixel-wise, superpixel-wise and building-wise image segmentation.

In this paper, we propose a LSTM network model by using aggregated feature learning strategy to extend feature representation in both spatial and temporal domains. In this model, the features of a joint are aggregated not only from all joints at previous moments, but also at current moment.

In this study, we proposed an object-based random forest (RF) method for paddy rice mapping using time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Robust Adaptive Spatial Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) was used to blend MODIS and Sentinel-2 data for achieving multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Subsequently, the Savitzky-Golay filter (S-G) was applied to smooth the time series Sentinel-2 NDVI data. And the phenological parameters were derived from the filtered time series NDVI using the threshold method. Then, the optimum feature combination for paddy mapping was formed on the basis of Sentinel-2 MSI images, time series Sentinel-2 NDVI, phenology data and time series Sentinel-1 SAR backscattering images by using the JBh distance. Finally, an object-based Random Forest classifier was used to extract paddy rice with the optimum feature combination. The result showed that fused Sentinel-2 NDVI time series using RASTFM has a high correlation with the original Sentinel-2 image. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the classification results are higher than 95% and 0.93, respectively, when use the optimum feature combination and object-based RF method.

A promising way to overcome this problem is to detect driver distraction and adapt in-vehicle systems accordingly to mitigate such distractions. To realize this strategy, this paper applied support vector machines (SVMs), which is a data mining method, to develop a real-time approach for detecting cognitive distraction using drivers' eye movements and driving performance data. Data were collected in a simulator experiment in which ten participants interacted with an IVIS while driving. The data were used to train and test both SVM and logistic regression models, and three different model characteristics were investigated: how distraction was defined, which data were input to the model, and how the input data were summarized. The results show that the SVM models were able to detect driver distraction with an average accuracy of 81.1%, outperforming more traditional logistic regression models. The best performing model (96.1% accuracy) resulted when distraction was defined using experimental conditions (i.e., IVIS drive or baseline drive), the input data were comprised of eye movement and driving measures, and these data were summarized over a 40-s window with 95% overlap of windows. These results demonstrate that eye movements and simple measures of driving performance can be used to detect driver distraction in real time.

Our main theoretical contribution is a dynamical depth separation result, proving that while shallow models can exhibit incremental learning dynamics, they require the initialization to be exponentially small for these dynamics to present themselves. However, once the model becomes deeper, the dependence becomes polynomial and incremental learning can arise in more natural settings. We complement our theoretical findings by experimenting with deep matrix sensing, quadratic neural networks and with binary classification using diagonal and convolutional linear networks, showing all of these models exhibit incremental learning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.12051", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996210821,2976713865", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["52296593", "140225885", "3909231", "44099388", "195769437", "3526301", "3692345", "167217440", "16513805", "17272965", "29068185", "3994909", "195069159"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202888483"}

Nevertheless, the training of MLPs suffers from drawbacks like the nonconvex optimization problem and the choice of the number of hidden units. In support vector machines (SVMs) for classification, as introduced by Vapnik, a nonlinear decision boundary is obtained by mapping the input vector first in a nonlinear way to a high-dimensional kernel-induced feature space in which a linear large margin classifier is constructed. Practical expressions are formulated in the dual space in terms of the related kernel function, and the solution follows from a (convex) quadratic programming (QP) problem. In least-squares SVMs (LS-SVMs), the SVM problem formulation is modified by introducing a least-squares cost function and equality instead of inequality constraints, and the solution follows from a linear system in the dual space. Implicitly, the least-squares formulation corresponds to a regression formulation and is also related to kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. The least-squares regression formulation has advantages for deriving analytic expressions in a Bayesian evidence framework, in contrast to the classification formulations used, for example, in gaussian processes (GPs). The LS-SVM formulation has clear primal-dual interpretations, and without the bias term, one explicitly constructs a model that yields the same expressions as have been obtained with GPs for regression. In this article, the Bayesian evidence framework is combined with the LS-SVM classifier formulation. Starting from the feature space formulation, analytic expressions are obtained in the dual space on the different levels of Bayesian inference, while posterior class probabilities are obtained by marginalizing over the model parameters.

Remote sensing image classification, as an important direction of remote sensing image processing and application, has been widely studied. However, in the process of existing classification algorithms, there still exists the phenomenon of misclassification and missing points, which leads to the final classification accuracy is not high. In this paper, we selected Sentinel-1A and Landsat8 OLI images as data sources, and propose a classification method based on feature level fusion. Compare three kind of feature level fusion algorithms (i.e., Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening, Principal Component Analysis transform and Brovey transform), and then select the best fused image for the classification experimental. In the classification process, we choose four kinds of image classification algorithms (i.e. Minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, Support Vector Machine and ISODATA) to do contrast experiment. We use overall classification precision and Kappa coefficient as the classification accuracy evaluation criteria, and the four classification results of fused image are analysed. The experimental results show that the fusion effect of Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening is better than other methods. In four kinds of classification algorithms, the fused image has the best applicability to Support Vector Machine classification, the overall classification precision is 94.01 % and the Kappa coefficients is 0.91. The fused image with Sentinel-1A and Landsat8 OLI is not only have more spatial information and spectral texture characteristics, but also enhances the distinguishing features of the images.

To measure the data misfit as stated, the epsilon insensitive function is introduced as a loss function. In comparison with the popular quadratic loss function, it is robust but only continuous and therefore numerical minimization is difficult. However, as a combination of robust treatment to large errors and showing quadratic treatment to small errors, Huber function is used in the literature to measure the data misfit having the smooth property that it is differentiable everywhere. In this study, we propose a novel robust Huber SVR (HSVR) formulation in primal where the regressor is made as flat as possible by considering the regularization term in L1-norm.

Despite the increasing attention on multi-label classification, there are fewer studies concerning multi-target (MT) regression. The current leading MT models are based on ensembles of regressor chains, where random, differently ordered chains of the target variables are created and used to build separate regression models, using the previous target predictions in the chain. The challenges of building MT models stem from trying to capture and exploit possible correlations among the target variables during training. This paper presents three multi-target support vector regression models. The first involves building independent, single-target Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for each output variable. The second builds an ensemble of random chains using the first method as a base model. The third calculates the targets\u2019 correlations and forms a maximum correlation chain, which is used to build a single chained support vector regression model, improving the models\u2019 prediction performance while reducing the computational complexity. The experimental study evaluates and compares the performance of the three approaches with seven other state-of-the-art multi-target regressors on 24 multi-target datasets.

As a maritime nation, the United States depends on a strong commercial maritime industry that is tied to maritime security and its stability. Ports and affiliated transportation are all part of a complex system and are potential targets, with wide-scale disaster implications. A need to detect, track and classify vessels of all sizes approaching our ports and harbors is imperative to the security of this country and its complex maritime systems. This case study is an application of the passive acoustic method for vessel classification. The complexity of the classification problem is approached using acoustic signature analysis. Prior studies at Stevens Institute of Technology found that reliable results can be obtained based on signal frequency analysis, specifically, some of the most useful signal characteristics are found in the signal's envelope spectrum. Detection of Envelope Modulation on Noise (DEMON) tool is used in this case study to analyze the acoustic signatures of various vessel types and to provide for specific features that are later implemented into a decision algorithm, which determines the final classification.BackgroundAcousticsAcoustics involves the study of the production, propagation, and reception of sound. As sound travels through water, the waves attenuate, which enable instrumentation to record the changes and associate them with vessel noise characteristics. The main sources of noise generated by a marine vessel are (1) mechanical noise of the main engine and auxiliary machine, (2) propeller cavitations noise, and (3) hydrodynamic noise of the moving vessel.1 The acoustic signature produced by the radiating noise consists of a continuous broadband spectrum and line spectrum. It is the specific configuration of the narrow band frequencies that helps classify and identify different classes of vessels.Classification Algorithms- Decision TreeThe classification objective is to identify vessels (ferry, speed boat, sail boat etc) based on a training set of acoustic signatures whose group-label is previously known and then be able to embrace any new observation. The general process of classification is placing individual vessels into groups labeled based on quantitative information of their attributes. Attributes are: an in-depth and structured set of categories that are usually denoted by a numerical code. In essence, the attributes are the preparation for the classification algorithm construction. A wide range of classification algorithms has been studied in various fields, some of which have been applied to acoustic signature classification. Common classification algorithms mentioned in acoustics studies are: neural networks, K-nearest neighbors, Gaussian, and decision tree. Due to its simplicity and ability to handle a mix type data set, the decision tree model was chosen as the classification algorithm for this case study. The decision tree uses relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler (KL) to study the contrast between two or more probability vectors. This approach sprung from information theory.2 A typical decision tree encodes in a form of tree, where data passes through branch like nodes, constructed from the attributes-rule mentioned earlier and eventually flows through to the final leafs representing the group label (ferry, sail boat, speed boat etc). The node selection is accomplished by selecting the attribute that divides the inhomogeneous data into minimal inhomogeneous subsets using entropy calculations (Kullback-Leibler method).MethodologyData CollectionStevens Passive Acoustic Detection System is composed of four ITC-6050C hydrophones manufactured by International Transducer Corporation and connected to an underwater computer, which communicates and feeds acoustical information (both acquisition and analysis) into the control room of the Maritime Security Laboratory (MSL) at Stevens Institute of Technology (figure 1a). \u2026", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Homeland Security Affairs", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1018133989", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["22964026", "19938905", "19938905"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53865149"}

In contrast to classical data-driven machine learning methods, transfer learning methods exploit the knowledge accumulated from data in auxiliary domains to facilitate predictive modeling in the current domain. A significant number of transfer learning methods that address classification tasks have been proposed, but studies on transfer learning in the case of regression problems are still scarce. This study focuses on using transfer learning techniques to handle regression problems in a domain that has insufficient training data.

In this work, we propose a method for generating a CAPTCHA image that will resist recognition by machines while maintaining its recognizability to humans. The method utilizes the style transfer method, and creates a new image, called a style-plugged-CAPTCHA image, by incorporating the styles of other images while keeping the content of the original CAPTCHA. In our experiment, we used the TensorFlow machine learning library and six CAPTCHA datasets in use on actual websites.

Distinguished by their top-down and bottomup mechanisms all three approaches have strengths and weaknesses. While the logical reasoning approach is precise and well supported by mathematical theories and procedures, it is constrained by a largely predefined representational model. Connectionist systems, on the other hand, are able to recognize patterns even if these patterns are only similar and not identical to the patterns that they have been trained to recognize, but they have no understanding of the meaning of those patterns. The subsumption approach appears to overcome many of the weaknesses of the other two approaches in theory, but there is concern that it may not scale to more complex real world applications. The author points out that in addition there are weaknesses that all three AI approaches share, namely inability to deal with exceptions, lack of mechanisms for analogous comparisons, and very primitive conceptualization capabilities at best. It is noted that the human agent performs decidedly better in these areas. The paper concludes with the proposition that only a hybrid approach holds sufficient promise to meet the full expectations of intelligent systems.

The extreme learning machine for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks tends to provide good generalization performance at an extremely fast learning speed.

However, there are still many problems waiting to be solved, such as skewed data distribution, too many overlapped data, fickle-minded consumer behavior, and so on. To improve the above problems, we propose to develop a personalized system, which can prevent fraud from the initial use of credit cards. First, the questionnaire-responded transaction (QRT) data of users are collected by using an online questionnaire based on consumer behavior surveys. The data are then trained by using the support vector machines (SVMs) whereby the QRT models are developed. The QRT models are used to predict a new transaction.

FS selects the number of the most significant terms of the model for fault detection and identification, reducing the dimension of the dataset. Pattern recognition is carried out by the following supervised learning classifiers based on statistical models to calculate and classify the signal depending on the fault: Ensemble Subspace Discriminant; k-Nearest Neighbours; Linear Support Vector Machine; Linear Discriminant Analysis; Decision Trees. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis is used to evaluate the classifiers. Neighbourhood Component Analysis has been employed in feature selection. Several case studies of mud on the WTB surface have been considered to test and validate the approach. Autoregressive (AR) model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been employed to FE.

Using the language of neurodynamics a meme is defined as quasi-stable associative memory attractor state. Depending on the temporal characteristics of the incoming information and the plasticity of the network, memory may self-organize creating memes with large attractor basins, linking many unrelated input patterns.

Simulations of various neural network models trained with competitive Hebbian learning (CHL) on stationary and non-stationary data lead to the same conclusion: short learning with high plasticity followed by rapid decrease of plasticity leads to memes with large attraction basins, distorting input pattern representations in associative memory.

Recent advances in genomic technology and sequencing efforts is generating a huge amount of DNA sequence data every day. The predicted proteome of these genomes needs annotation at a faster pace. In view of this, one such annotation need is to develop an automated system that can distinguish between plastid and non-plastid proteins accurately, and further classify plastid-types based on their functionality. We compared the amino acid compositions of plastid proteins with those of non-plastid ones and found significant differences, which were used as a basis to develop various feature-based prediction models using similarity-search and machine learning. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this study, we developed separate Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained classifiers for characterizing the plastids in two steps: first distinguishing the plastid vs. non-plastid proteins, and then classifying the identified plastids into their various types based on their function (chloroplast, chromoplast, etioplast, and amyloplast). Five diverse protein features: amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, the pseudo amino acid composition, N(terminal)-Center-C(terminal) composition and the protein physicochemical properties are used to develop SVM models. Overall, the dipeptide composition-based module shows the best performance with an accuracy of 86.80% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.74 in phase-I and 78.60% with a MCC of 0.44 in phase-II. On independent test data, this model also performs better with an overall accuracy of 76.58% and 74.97% in phase-I and phase-II, respectively. The similarity-based PSI-BLAST module shows very low performance with about 50% prediction accuracy for distinguishing plastid vs. non-plastids and only 20% in classifying various plastid-types, indicating the need and importance of machine learning algorithms. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The current work is a first attempt to develop a methodology for classifying various plastid-type proteins. The prediction modules have also been made available as a web tool, PLpred available at http://bioinfo.okstate.edu/PLpred/ for real time identification/characterization.

This paper is the third in a series implementing a classificat ion system for Gaia observations of unresolved galaxies.

We present (1) the semi-empirical library of galaxy spectra, (2) a comparison between the observed and synthetic spectra, and (3) first results of classification and parametrization expe riments with simulated Gaia spectrophotometry of this library. Methods. We use\u03c7 2 -fitting to fit SDSS galaxy spectra with the synthetic library in order to construct a semi-empirical library of galaxy spectra in which (1) the real spectra are extended by the synthetic ones in order to cover the full wavelength range of Gaia, and (2) astrophysical parameters are assigned to the SDSS spectra by the best fitting synthetic spectrum. The SVM models were trained with and applied to semi-empirical spectra. Tests were performed for the classification of spectral types and the estima tion of the most significant galaxy parameters (in particular redshift, mas s to light ratio and star formation history). Results. We produce a semi-empirical library of 33 670 galaxy spectra covering the wavelength range 250 to 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm or less.

Currently, there are several algorithms to classify eye movement events which use different approaches. However, to date, only a limited number of studies have assessed these algorithms under specific conditions, such as those required for surgical training programmes. This study presents an investigation of ten open-source eye-movement classification algorithms using the Eye Tribe eye-tracker. The algorithms were tested on the eye-movement records obtained from 23 surgical residents, who performed computer-based surgical simulation tasks under different hand conditions. The aim was to offer data for the improvement of surgical training programmes. According to the results, due to the different classification methods and default threshold values, the ten algorithms produced different results. Considering the fixation duration, the only common event for all of the investigated algorithms, the binocular-individual threshold (BIT) algorithm resulted in a different clustering compared to the other algorithms. Based on the other set of common events, three clusters were determined by eight algorithms (except BIT and event detection (ED)), distinguishing dispersion-based, velocity-based and modified versions of velocity-based algorithms. Accordingly, it was concluded that dispersion-based and velocity-based algorithms provided different results. Additionally, as it individually specifies the threshold values for the eye-movement data, when there is no consensus about the threshold values to be set, the BIT algorithm can be selected. Especially for such cases like simulation-based surgical skill-training, the use of individualised threshold values in the BIT algorithm can be more beneficial in classifying the raw eye data and thus evaluating the individual progress levels of trainees based on their eye movement behaviours. In conclusion, the threshold values had a critical effect on the algorithm results. Since default values may not always be suitable for the unique features of different data sets, guidelines should be developed to indicate how the threshold values are set for each algorithm.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951506", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2987607811", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1591474", "21715002", "3479843", "44577978", "67846258", "6899019", "21192177", "71151923", "52301426", "22056064", "27377964", "34175686", "9498495", "10909509", "41998368", "1986808", "3611032", "2394116", "206869634", "56163633", "25706284", "52190838", "7458451", "149555603", "50779007", "33744418", "13823469", "126002750", "20458539", "195559", "10730254", "23380237", "754565", "13065241", "60101284", "64308618", "61818595"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208034188"}

Nonetheless, these aggregation rules would fail when the majority is more likely to be wrong.

Tapping on these already available data for additional purposes, aiming at improving care, without significant incremental effort and cost. This potential of secondary patient data is explored through modeling administrative and billing data, as well as the hierarchical structure of pathology codes of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the prediction of unplanned readmissions, as a clinically relevant outcome parameter that can be impacted on in a quality improvement program. Methods In this single-center, hospital-wide observational cohort study, we included all adult patients discharged in 2016 after applying an exclusion protocol (n = 29,702). In addition to administrative variables, such as age and length of stay, structured pathology data were taken into account in predictive models. As a first research question, we compared logistic regression against penalized logistic regression, gradient boosting and Random Forests to predict unplanned readmission. As a second research goal, we investigated the level of hierarchy within the pathology data needed to achieve the best accuracy. Finally, we investigated which prediction variables play a prominent role in predicting hospital readmission. The performance of all models was evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) measure. Results All models have the best predictive results using Random Forests. An added value of 7% is observed compared to a baseline method such as logistic regression. The best model, based on Random Forests, achieved an AUC of 0.77, using the diagnosis category and procedure code as lowest level of the hierarchical pathology data. Conclusions The most accurate model to predict hospital wide unplanned readmission is based on Random Forests and includes the ICD hierarchy, especially diagnosis category. Such an approach lowers the number of predictor variables and yields a higher interpretability than a model based on a detailed diagnosis.

To solve this problem, we adopt a supervised learning to rank approach that learns a ranking function from a set of training examples, which are queries and ranked lists of documents for each query. We consider that the elements to be ranked are divided into two groups: protected and non-protected. Following long-standing empirical observations showing that users of information retrieval systems rarely look past the first few results, we consider that some items receive more exposure than others. Our objective is to produce a ranker that is able to reproduce the ordering of the training set, which is the standard objective in learning to rank, but that additionally gives protected elements sufficient exposure, compared to non-protected elements.

Then, the domain (modality) invariant information represented in the common space is leveraged to synthesize the missing modalities for a joint prediction of glioma grades (high- vs. low-grade). Furthermore, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) is utilized to provide interpretability to the factors that contribute to the grading, for potential clinical usage.

The main innovation is the experimental setting chosen in order to obtain an improvement in the children's English language skills. In previous studies of educational contexts, robots have typically been used as \"teachers\" to \"structure\" the learning process (Fridin, 2014). This also means that children viewed the robot-teacher as \"other\" (in the case of humanoid robots) or as an \"artifact\" like a computer or a book (in the case of robots with non-human features). The link between Robotics and Psychology has presented a very interesting challenge for many scholars over the last fifty years (Kelley & Cassenti, 2011). Starting from the development of the first types of computer (the first Turingcomplete machine, ENIAC, created by John Von Neumann in the middle of the 20th century), the simulation of human mental processes, and, later, of human decisions and actions, has lead robotics to become one of the most exciting fields for the evolution of human behavioral models. Throughout this process, many of the most important models and theories of Psychology have been examined, in particular Piaget's Constructivism and the related processes of assimilation and accommodation, Skinner's operant conditioning, the Vygotskian Zone of Proximal Development, Cognitivism's Human-Information Processing (HIP) model, as well as the latest models of artificial intelligence, Connectionism and Neural Networks (Dautenhahn & Billard, 1999a; 1999b; Ziemke, 2001). Even though all these models have been looked at as part of the broad field of Human-Robot Interactions (HRI) or in Robot Development/Evolution, each model has also been analyzed in more specific and well-defined scopes of application. We can briefly summarize five areas of application for psychological models in robotics: (a) The evolution of robot prototypes which simulate human mental and physical behavior; (b) Robot-robot interaction in complex environments for simulating human social behavior; (c) Human[right arrow]robot and robots[right arrow]robot interaction in which the human or one of the robots acts as the tutor|teacher|expert and the (other) robot is a learner; (d) Human[left arrow]robot interaction in which the robot acts as a mechanical \"partner\" which allows the human to try out (and/or train) certain abilities or social skills so that he/she may make progress; (e) And finally a situation in which the human-robot interaction is characterized by a human who acts as a \"tutor|teacher\" for the robot and a robot acting as a counterpart in the learning process which, in the end, sees the convergence of improvement and knowledge acquisition influencing the human's cognitive development. The first two areas have been principally influenced by Skinner's Operant Conditioning, Cognitivism, and more recently by Artificial Intelligence (AI), Connectionism and neural networks (including their recent evolutions). Behaviorism played an important role in the development of early robots, as this psychological model has simple rules which can be easily fed into a machine. Thanks to these characteristics, Skinner's teaching machines were very successful in learning environments and demonstrated the importance of feedback (reinforcement) and also of coherence and repeated reinforcement over time in maximizing the learning process. Applying behavioral rules to robotics (and informatics), i.e., determining the behavior of a machine on the basis of the effects of a particular type of behavior and its related reinforcement, helped to produce a set of \"mechanical\" machines that were able to react to their environment by simulating certain types of human behavior. Robots capable of more sophisticated actions (and quasi-decisions) have been developed using behavioral models derived from AI connected to Behaviorism, the socalled Behavior-Based Robotics (Arkin, 1998; Brooks, 1986a). \u2026", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Educational Technology & Society", "journal": "Educational Technology & Society", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2197461842", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["142535853", "126508", "109755619", "42204652", "8313595", "931233", "14723571", "17913125", "11608109", "142557411", "145080306", "140308100", "28251401", "5484397", "143676368", "10392986", "654485", "53067809", "147620444", "8527012", "143543999", "151865961", "140481780", "16504277", "7418514", "18637629", "115477845", "204312038", "1328646", "9687790", "62395287"], "inbound_citations": ["3817794", "149773800", "157221543", "11187906", "53601694", "189762799", "63521369", "209450791", "55325073", "52291947", "17547414", "52901900", "17551916", "207906708", "209393489"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12937682"}

In this paper, we describe an algorithm for taking full advantage of the training batches in the neural network training by lifting the vector of pairwise distances within the batch to the matrix of pairwise distances. This step enables the algorithm to learn the state of the art feature embedding by optimizing a novel structured prediction objective on the lifted problem. Additionally, we collected Online Products dataset: 120k images of 23k classes of online products for metric learning. Our experiments on the CUB-200-2011, CARS196, and Online Products datasets demonstrate significant improvement over existing deep feature embedding methods on all experimented embedding sizes with the

Most recent work on the acquisition of morphology takes the perspective of production, but it is receptivemorphology which comesfirst in the child. This paper presentsa connectionistmodel of the acquisition of the capacity to recognize morphologically complex words. The model takes sequences of phonetic segments as inputs and maps them onto output units representing the meanings of lexical and grammatical morphemes. It consists of a simple recurrent network with separate hidden-layer modules for the tasks of recognizing the root and the grammatical morphemes of the input word. Experiments with artificial language stimuli demonstrate that the model generalizes to novel words for morphological rules of all but one of the major types found in natural languages and that a version of the network with unassigned hidden-layer modules can learn to assign them to the output recognition tasks in an efficient manner. I also argue that for rules involving reduplication, that is, the copying of portions of a root, the network requires separate recurrent subnetworks for sequencesof larger units such as syllables. The network can learn to develop its own syllable representations which not only support the recognition of reduplication but also provide the basis for learning to produce, as well as recognize,morphologically complex words. The model makes many detailed predictions about the learning difficulty of particular morphological rules.", "year": 1993, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2111972908", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["61046497", "53575110", "9408979", "6797972", "2118433", "14625010", "16058497"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2438307"}

Unlike the existing methods that mostly use a cubical or rectangular shape, we regard the anatomical shape of regions as atypical forms of patches. Using the complex nonlinear relations among voxels in each region learned by deep neural networks, we extract a regional abnormality representation. We then make a final clinical decision by integrating the regional abnormality representations over a whole brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality representations allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing them in a brain space individually.

Most existing approaches train offline detectors using manually labeled data and predefined parameters, and are hard to model changing scenes. This paper introduces a neural network based model called online Growing Neural Gas (online GNG) to perform an unsupervised learning. Unlike a parameter-fixed GNG, our model updates learning parameters continuously, for which we propose several online neighbor-related strategies. Specific operations, namely neuron insertion, deletion, learning rate adaptation and stopping criteria selection, get upgraded to online modes. In the anomaly detection stage, the behavior patterns far away from our model are labeled as anomalous, for which far away is measured by a time-varying threshold. Experiments are implemented on three surveillance datasets, namely UMN, UCSD Ped1/Ped2 and Avenue dataset. All datasets have changing scenes due to mutable crowd density and behavior types. Anomaly detection results show that our model can adapt to the current scene rapidly and reduce false alarms while still detecting most anomalies. Quantitative comparisons with 12 recent approaches further confirm our superiority.

Thus, the National Park authority is particularly interested in investigating the structure and dynamics of the forest ecosystems within the park. However, conventional forest inventories are timeconsuming and not able to fully record the heterogeneity of natural forests. Our goal is to develop advanced techniques for tree species mapping based on hyperspectral remote sensing in combination with other remote sensing and in situ measurements that meet the demands of the National Park. This approach needs to be adapted to the heterogeneous appearance of the forest. This work aims at building a model transferable to an area-wide mapping of tree species based on the needs of the Bavarian Forest National Park. It reveals the requirements for tree species mapping and shows which spectral/spatial features and data combinations generate the best results within a Random Forest modelling approach. The study is based on airborne hyperspectral data acquired with the HySpex VNIR-1600 sensor (160 spectral bands, 400 \u2013 990 nm, 1.6 m spatial resolution). Additional full waveform LiDAR data, including a Digital Surface Model, Digital Terrain Model and a Digital Canopy Height Model, were available for the analysis. Individual tree crowns as well as clusters of tree crowns from 13 different tree species were located and identified during a field survey. The field-demarcated tree canopies were used as reference data for creating the feature database. Several preprocessing steps including atmospheric correction, spectral and spatial polishing, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect correction as well as ortho-rectification of the hyperspectral imagery were conducted before the analysis. A band selection procedure based on principal component analysis, band correlation, and band variance was performed to identify the most appropriate spectral bands for species discrimination, resulting in a set of 53 spectral bands. Seven different combinations of hyperspectral, structural and terrain-specific parameters contained in the feature database were investigated in a Random Forest Modelling approach to ascertain which variables enhance the overall classification accuracy. A classification model using all available parameters in the feature database yielded an overall accuracy that is 17 percentage points higher (94%) compared to using only the preselected spectral bands (77%). For most of the 13 tree species, the final classification model achieved individual class accuracies of more than 90%.

Using the pitch and formants feature vectors, the emotion classification has been carried out using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In this preliminary investigation, the vowel regions have been separated manually, so as to assess their efficacy in classifying the emotions. The approach has been validated using an emotional speech dataset in English language, collected especially for this study. The performance evaluation results obtained are encouraging. This approach can be further refined for wider applications.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSPCom.2016.7980624", "venue": "2016 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICSC)", "journal": "2016 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICSC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2734501184", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["25659482", "211146195", "15964513", "9350778", "35209811", "32988874", "62216704", "2192817", "64165997", "57009570", "15582309", "14112723", "35613472", "123256352", "1607434", "59890974", "5967041", "121743269", "57157700", "1363533", "14727192", "19325318", "15799881", "194951", "16382166", "33654590", "18707340", "9541199", "14306254", "2523118"], "inbound_citations": ["59601987", "5112006"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24364825"}

Prior works build machine learning models that take a user-centric approach in terms of training -- using predominantly user data to classify whether a user will click on an advertisement or not. While this approach has proven effective, it is inaccessible to most entities and relies heavily on user data. To accommodate for this, we first consider a large set of advertisement data on Facebook and use natural language processing (NLP) to extract key concepts that we call conceptual nodes. To predict the value of CTR for a combination of conceptual nodes, we use the advertisement data to train four machine learning (ML) models. We then cast the problem of finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes as an optimization problem. Given a certain budget $k$, we are interested in finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes that maximize the CTR. A discussion of the hardness and possible NP-hardness of the optimization problem is provided. Then, we propose a greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm to find near-optimal combinations of conceptual nodes in polynomial time, with the genetic algorithm nearly matching the optimal solution.

Traditional SVM works as a closed system, which means the parameters of the SVM freeze after training is finished. This strategy leads to the SVM cannot adapt to the online learning environment and also hinders the application of the SVM in expert systems which need to be updated in an online way. Many online SVMs retrain SVM with the current support vectors and new incoming data. However, the retained system usually shows a declined performance due to losing much information about the data. To handle this problem, we propose an Online Support Vector Machine (OSVM). The OSVM includes a Representative Prototype Area (RPA), which retains the representative data of all historical data. In the RPA, each class is maintained by an Online Incremental Feature Map (OIM) which learns a suitable representative set from the stream data automatically, e.g., we do not need to predefine a compression ratio, the OIM will dynamically adapt to the current input data. Retraining is periodically conducted on the updated OIM, which can avoid a declined performance and significantly reduce the computational cost. Variety data sets from different fields are used to test our method and the experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of OSVM is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art SVM and the speed of OSVM is much faster. Moreover, OSVM is more stable than the other methods in the open-ended learning environment, where stream data from novel classes occur.

Audio classification technique has two basic parts: audio feature extraction and classifier. In general the audio content classification method is firstly to identify the original audio into text, then use the identified text to classify. But the text recognition rate is not high, some words that good for classification are identified by mistake causing that the classification effect is not ideal. In order to solve these problems above, this paper proposes a new effective audio classification method based on two-step strategy. In the first step the features are extracted by using the improved mutual information and classified with Naive Bayes classifier. After classification of the first step, an unreliable area is determined, and samples with features in this area go on to be classified with the second step. In the second step, textual features extracted with CHI statistic method are used to build a text feature space model. Then audio features containing MFCC and frame energy are combined together with the text features to build a new feature vector space model. Finally, the new feature vector space model is classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments show that the two-step strategy classification method for audio classification achieves great classification performance with the accuracy rate of 97.2%.

In recent years, object detection has made great advances in public datasets, and the algorithm performance is also consistently similar to human capabilities. Therefore, all improvements in this paper are based on two-stage object detection. The algorithm model in the paper has three main innovations: first, considering that the resolution of the feature map and the size of the receptive field are not very good. Therefore, in this paper, a deep dilated convolution network is added to the backbone network to replace the conventional residual module, forming our own backbone network structure-Deep_Dilated Convolution Network (D_dNet). The formation of the D_dNet greatly reduces the number of parameters of the model during the training phase, and improves the quality of feature extraction. In addition, to improve accuracy, the network structure of the second part becomes \u201cthick\u201d, which increases the number of computations and reduces the detection speed. Therefore, by compressing the pretrained feature map and adding an 81-class fully connected layer to replace the original two layers, a light-weight network is formed. The light-weight network has changed the tradition of an overly thick fully connected layer, which not only makes the network lighter, but also significantly increases the corresponding detection speed. Finally, given the good hierarchy and transfer of the deep convolution neural network, this paper adds transfer learning to the training model to further optimize the model. In this paper, transfer learning is implemented to realize the transfer of weights. The training data samples are increased in disguise, there by increasing the stability of the training model. The evaluation of the entire model relies on the MSCOCO and PASCAL VOC datasets.

To address these issues, a novel tracking method is presented via combining sparse representation and an emerging learning technique, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). Specifically, visual tracking can be divided into two consecutive processes. Firstly, ELM is utilized to find the optimal separate hyperplane between the target observations and background ones. Thus, the trained ELM classification function is able to remove most of the candidate samples related to background contents efficiently, thereby reducing the total computational cost of the following sparse representation. Secondly, to further combine ELM and sparse representation, the resultant confidence values (i.e., probabilities to be a target) of samples on the ELM classification function are used to construct a new manifold learning constraint term of the sparse representation framework, which tends to achieve robuster results. Moreover, the accelerated proximal gradient method is used for deriving the optimal solution (in matrix form) of the constrained sparse tracking model. Additionally, the matrix form solution allows the candidate samples to be calculated in parallel, thereby leading to a higher efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracker.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4634458", "pubmed_id": "26506359", "doi": "10.3390/s151026877", "venue": "Sensors", "journal": "Sensors", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1880274833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1660289", "6795574", "10355303", "2676234", "6222150", "11646088", "6564374", "15039945", "206737254", "2627705", "7677466", "16051076", "463067", "15859987", "17100949", "7299089", "15725489", "15473155", "6604534", "215632042", "205398154", "8281525", "2539545", "10519006", "116858", "38135033", "981528", "18201924", "15037168", "9221252", "2460118", "28224865", "7028394", "52874011", "14518923", "20288740", "206590783", "961425", "53940663", "5709930", "4246903"], "inbound_citations": ["18790530"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15926599"}

Optimal conditions for state variables, such as I, pH and Temperature, were experimentally obtained and then used as parameters in the mechanistic model. Kinetics from either the proposed mechanistic model or the experimental photo-fermentations were compared, obtaining similar time trajectories for the process variables when operating at optimal conditions. However, this similarity decreased slightly at different light intensities, when the pH oscillated during the fermentations. Simulations under different initial conditions of substrate concentration, pH, and light intensity were run so as to generate data sets, used for constructing data-based classification models. A complete methodology, which entails a feature extraction step with Multi-way Principal Component Analysis technique and a proper classification stage using Support Vector Machines as algorithm, was proposed and addressed in order to develop such data models.

We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble.

A free and open source GIS application coupled with remote sensing data was developed under QGIS software allowing to improve the C factor functionality: (i) automatically download satellite images; (ii) clip with the study case and; (ii) perform a supervised or unsupervised classification, in order to obtain the land cover classification and produce the final C map. One of the most efficient supervised classification algorithms is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Random Forest (RF) is also an easy-to-use machine learning algorithm for supervised classification. The automation of this functionality was based in the R and SAGA software, both integrated in QGIS. To perform the supervised classification, SVM and RF methods were incorporated. The overall accuracy and Kappa values are also automatically obtained by the R script and GRASS algorithms, which allows to evaluate the result obtained. To perform the unsupervised classification K-means algorithm from SAGA was used.

Since these alignments are usually not annotated within the corpora, external models have to be used to produce such an alignment in a preprocessing step. In this work, we propose two approaches to integrate the alignment generation directly and efficiently into the CRF training process. Whereas the first approach relies on linear segmentation as starting point, the second approach considers all possible alignments given certain constraints.

Current evolutionary biology is increasingly focussed on understanding how the evolution of developmental organisations modifies the distribution of phenotypic variation, the evolution of ecological relationships modifies the selective environment, and the evolution of reproductive relationships modifies the heritability of the evolutionary unit. The major transitions in evolution, in particular, involve radical changes in developmental, ecological and reproductive organisations that instantiate variation, selection and inheritance at a higher level of biological organisation. However, current evolutionary theory is poorly equipped to describe how these organisations change over evolutionary time and especially how that results in adaptive complexes at successive scales of organisation (the key problem is that evolution is self-referential, i.e. the products of evolution change the parameters of the evolutionary process). Here we first reinterpret the central open questions in these domains from a perspective that emphasises the common underlying themes. We then synthesise the findings from a developing body of work that is building a new theoretical approach to these questions by converting well-understood theory and results from models of cognitive learning. Specifically, connectionist models of memory and learning demonstrate how simple incremental mechanisms, adjusting the relationships between individually-simple components, can produce organisations that exhibit complex system-level behaviours and improve the adaptive capabilities of the system. We use the term \u201cevolutionary connectionism\u201d to recognise that, by functionally equivalent processes, natural selection acting on the relationships within and between evolutionary entities can result in organisations that produce complex system-level behaviours in evolutionary systems and modify the adaptive capabilities of natural selection over time. We review the evidence supporting the functional equivalences between the domains of learning and of evolution, and discuss the potential for this to resolve conceptual problems in our understanding of the evolution of developmental, ecological and reproductive organisations and, in particular, the major evolutionary transitions.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5119841", "pubmed_id": "27932852", "doi": "10.1007/s11692-015-9358-z", "venue": "Evolutionary Biology", "journal": "Evolutionary Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2156183867", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["12174018", "83264735", "170389686", "85586200", "147080096", "142093962", "143299458", "6862261", "81939763", "2513041", "75291", "82258317", "10570975", "1841680", "7245107", "53709399", "5882242", "86503375", "846517", "9705572", "122945115", "154874624", "15140757", "142125120", "7886157", "86171774", "155031523", "208865182", "16357218", "3150015", "169523464", "82680388", "117031646", "18665799", "2767663", "141345781", "15066318", "2309950", "1658773", "60095295", "53309505", "784288", "36483354", "10096429", "7773376", "6559129", "971123", "1496364", "3743613", "14674321", "15513088", "86315204", "10145116", "16901983", "17088453", "32042771", "36882702", "13454463", "2470794", "999221", "12370993", "2466865", "26013502", "170998955", "84684420", "9117555", "83828379", "4705561", "30750102", "21087505", "86708793", "83283846", "9786067", "18420633", "36816116", "592403", "19264907", "142747336", "10681898", "82266778", "84028822", "145374837", "21009944", "9297205", "9524926", "85813898", "14199415", "2703146", "3164124", "16262554", "122361140", "6658842", "215042816", "2780846", "81468584", "25465466", "50263509", "10955880", "10688152", "23881714", "9114471", "9808338", "3336839", "141674917", "16884546", "206535786", "21786948", "10410415", "11464523", "86479817", "25443407", "3723963", "146091971", "2383726", "11262044", "82784254", "35942015", "15606235", "45616288", "3160534", "21518830", "14485749", "10990082", "81587182", "18864014", "705400", "3899527", "44046306", "83096285", "83684917", "145084877", "56437082"], "inbound_citations": ["3505518", "11760361", "211931986", "215147598", "29151472"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7040746"}

However, almost all possible analysis approaches require knowledge of the discharge coefficient, which depends on several geometric and hydraulic parameters. An effective methodology for predicting discharge coefficient can be based on machine learning algorithms. In this research, experimental data obtained from tests carried out on a side weir in a circular channel and supercritical flow have been used to build predictive models of the equivalent discharge coefficient, by which the lateral outflow can be estimated by referring only to the flow depth upstream of the side weir. Four models, different in the input variables, have been developed. Each model has been proposed in 5 variants, depending on the applied algorithm. The focus is mainly on two lazy machine learning algorithms: k Nearest Neighbor and K-Star. The 5-input variables Model 1 and the 4-input variables Model 2 noticeably outperform the 3-input variables Model 3 and Model 4, showing that a suitable characterization of the side weir geometry is essential for a good accuracy of the prediction model.

SF6 is widely in use since it is most suitable gas accepted for high voltage applications due to excellent dielectric properties, high thermal conductivity, fast arc quenching. The pressure and density inside Gas Insulated Switchgear are dependent upon dielectric properties of SF6. Conventional one-point measurement of gas pressure and density fails to take into account the variations in pressure and density because of non-uniform temperature profile. It is observed that the pressure inside the chamber rises 3 to 4 times of the normal pressure when arcing phenomenon takes place. The rise in pressure makes it easier to detect leakage by taking multiple pressure measurement samples. Conditions similar to that of arcing were simulated and variations in pressure were investigated with four different points of leakage. The results indicate a considerable difference in the profiles due to leakage from the four different points which cannot be detected by conventionally used one-point pressure-temperature-density measurement system.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely used as powerful information processing models and adopted in applications such as bankruptcy prediction, predicting costs, forecasting revenue, forecasting share prices and exchange rates, processing docu- ments, and many more.

For good generalization, the classification portion of the algorithm determines the probability that the image patch is in a given class by modeling all possible image content (learned through a training set) as a Gaussian mixture, with each Gaussian of the mixture portraying a single class. The regression portion of the algorithm has been chosen to be a modified Support Vector Regression, where the kernel has been learned by solving a semi definite programming (SDP) and quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. The SVR is further modified by scaling the training points in the SDP and QCQP problems by their relevance and importance to the examined regression.

Support vector machine (SVM)-based models have been frequently used for MVL. A typical SVM-based MVL model is SVM-2K, which extends SVM for MVL by using the distance minimization version of kernel canonical correlation analysis. However, SVM-2K cannot fully unleash the power of the complementary information among different feature views. Recently, a framework of learning using privileged information (LUPI) has been proposed to model data with complementary information. Motivated by LUPI, we propose a new multiview privileged SVM model, multi-view privileged SVM model (PSVM-2V), for MVL. This brings a new perspective that extends LUPI to MVL.

Though skinning injury is pervasive and obstructive, its detection is very limited. This study attempted to identify injured skin using two CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensor-based machine vision technologies, i.e., visible imaging and biospeckle imaging. The identification of skinning injury was realized via exploiting features extracted from varied ROIs (Region of Interests). The features extracted from visible images were pixel-wise color and texture features, while region-wise BA (Biospeckle Activity) was calculated from biospeckle imaging. In addition, the calculation of BA using varied numbers of speckle patterns were compared. Finally, extracted features were implemented into classifiers of LS-SVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) and BLR (Binary Logistic Regression), respectively. Results showed that color features performed better than texture features in classifying sound skin and injured skin, especially for injured skin stored no less than 1 day, with the average classification accuracy of 90%. Image capturing and processing efficiency can be speeded up in biospeckle imaging, with captured 512 frames reduced to 125 frames. Classification results obtained based on the feature of BA were acceptable for early skinning injury stored within 1 day, with the accuracy of 88.10%. It is concluded that skinning injury can be recognized by visible and biospeckle imaging during different stages.

An increase in the amount of information acquired by satellite imaging systems, urges the need for automatic tools for classification. Satellite images exhibit spatial and/or temporal dependencies in which the conventional machine learning algorithms fail to perform well. In this paper, we propose an improved framework for automated land cover classification using Spatial Spectral Schroedinger Eigenmaps (SSSE) optimized by Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is adopted for the final thematic map generation following dimensionality reduction and clustering by the proposed approach. The novelty of the proposed framework is that the applicability of optimized SSSE for land cover classification of medium and high resolution multi-spectral satellite images is tested for the first time. The proposed method makes land cover classification system fully automatic by optimizing the algorithm specific image dependent parameter \u03b1 using CS algorithm. Experiments are carried out over publicly available high and medium resolution multi-spectral satellite image datasets (Landsat 5 TM and IKONOS 2 MS) and hyper-spectral satellite image datasets (Pavia University and Indian Pines) to assess the robustness of the proposed approach.

Performing structural health testing for coated/uncoated metallic or dielectric materials with the same testing equipment requires a testing method that can work on metallics and dielectrics such as microwave testing. Reducing complexity and expenses associated with current diagnostic practices of microwave NDT of structural health requires an effective and intelligent approach based on feature selection and classification techniques of machine learning. Current microwave NDT methods in general based on measuring variation in the S-matrix over the entire operating frequency ranges of the sensors. For instance, assessing the health of metallic structures using a microwave sensor depends on the reflection or/and transmission coefficient measurements as a function of the sweeping frequencies of the operating band. The aim of this work is reducing sweeping frequencies using machine learning feature selection techniques. By treating sweeping frequencies as features, the number of top important features can be identified, then only the most influential features (frequencies) are considered when building the microwave NDT equipment. The proposed method of reducing sweeping frequencies was validated experimentally using a waveguide sensor and a metallic plate with different cracks. Among the investigated feature selection techniques are information gain, gain ratio, relief, chi-squared. The effectiveness of the selected features were validated through performance evaluations of various classification models; namely, Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

Consistent models are being adopted by companies as part of a decision making process when important choices are based on short or long-term forecasting. This work aims to evaluate Wavelet Neural Networks (WNNs) performance combined with five optimization techniques in order to obtain the best time series forecasting by considering two case studies in the agribusiness sector. The first one adopts the soybean sack price and the second deals with the demand problem of a distinct groups of products from a food company, where nonlinear trends are the main characteristic on both time series. The optimization techniques adopted in this work are: Differential Evolution, Artificial Bee Colony, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, Gravitational Search Algorithm, and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. Those were evaluated by considering short-term and long-term forecasting, and a prediction horizon of 30 days ahead was considered for the soybean sack price case, while 12 months ahead was selected for the products demand case. The performance of the optimization techniques in training the WNN were compared to the well-established Backpropagation algorithm and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) assuming accuracy measures. In long-term forecasting, which is considered more difficult than the short-term case due to the error accumulation, the best combinations in terms of precision was reached by distinct methods according to each case, showing the importance of testing different training strategies.

However, for many years research focused on understanding and enhancing tree growth was not always linked with research into wood quality. Much of the initial work investigating radiata pine wood quality focused on quantifying the extent of variation in key properties of interest, principally density, within and among trees (Cown and McConchie, 1983, Harris, 1965, Palmer et al., 2013) and how these were affected by forest management (Carson et al., 2014, Cown, 1973, Cown, 1974, Cown and McConchie, 1981, Cown and McConchie, 1982). At the same time research into growth looked at how to improve both productivity and profitability. This has resulted in a reduction in rotation length and also silvicultural regimes that were often characterized by heavy and early thinning (James, 1990). The focus of much of the early tree improvement research was on enhancing growth and improving stem form, rather than on improving internal wood properties (Jayawickrama and Carson, 2000). Not unsurprisingly, there has been concerns that many of these practices have had a negative impact on wood quality (Burdon, 2010, Cown, 1992, Moore and Cown, 2017). In order to better understand the implications of current and future research aimed at enhancing productivity on wood quality, better knowledge about the connection between tree growth and wood properties is required. In this presentation, we describe different modelling and experimental approaches that have aided our understanding of this connection. Empirical models were developed to predict the radial and longitudinal variation in wood density, microfibril angle and spiral grain angle (Kimberley et al., 2015, Moore et al., 2014, Moore et al., 2015) within a tree. These non-linear mixed effects models are based on ring-level data and account for the hierarchical structure in these data, which arises from the fact that they were obtained from radial samples taken at different heights in selected trees from a number of stands. The models enable the effects of ring number, ring width and height in the tree to be accounted for which enables them to be directly linked to growth models. In the case of wood density, genetic improvement can also be accounted for (Kimberley et al., 2016). This modelling approach is suitable for wood properties that are continuous and approximately normally distributed. However, traits such as resin pockets and intra-ring checks, which are major sources of value loss in appearance products (Cown et al., 2011, Cown, 2013), are discrete and are better represented as counts. Previous efforts to try to describe the variation in these traits and the factors associated with their occurrence have generally not yielded many useful results. To identify factors associated with these traits, we have applied machine learning approaches, specifically Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Trees, to historical data on resin pockets and intra-ring checks. Finally, we explore the potential to further link tree growth, form and wood properties through the analysis of high-density airborne LiDAR data acquired from a UAV, terrestrial LiDAR data and wood properties data that were obtained from a large (~10 ha) field experiment that contained a range of different seedlots and stand densities. Ring-level models have enabled the general intra-stem patterns in wood density, microfibril angle and spiral grain angle to be quantified. A large proportion of the radial variation in density and microfibril angle can be accounted for by ring number from the pith and ring width. This enables these models to be linked to growth models and used to predict the effects of factors such as age and stand density on these two wood properties. At the time of writing, we have only just commenced the analysis of data on resin pocket and intra-ring checking occurrence using machine learning approaches, so do not have any results yet which identify any site, stand or genetic factors associated with the incidence of these two traits. Likewise, we have only commenced analyzing the LiDAR dataset that has been collected. We are currently calculating a range of stem and crown metrics for individual trees within this trial and will determine whether any of these are associated with wood density and stiffness measurements made on individual trees. The simple empirical models that have been developed for radiata pine have enabled a better understanding of the effects of some growth-related factors on selected wood properties. However, such models do have a number of limitations. Firstly, they focus on associations rather than explicitly attempting to model the underlying growth and wood formation processes. Secondly, they still predict idealized patterns of intra-stem variation in wood properties and ignore the departures from this pattern due to factors such as the presence of reaction wood. More realistic representations of these patterns is needed in order to better understand the impacts on end product performance. It is hoped that being better able to characterize the growing environment of a tree and its crown structure will lead to an improved understanding of the connection between tree growth and wood properties.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2922473412", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127511374"}

The quantization will map keypoints extracted from every training image into a unified dimensional histogram vector (Bag-of-words) after K-means clustering. This histogram is treated as an input vector for a multi-class SVM to build the training classifier model.

This process is based on the concept of \"distance\", calculated on the basis of several dataset characteristics. The information about the performance of the candidate algorithms on the selected datasets is then processed by a second technique, a ranking method. Such a method uses performance information to generate advice in the form of a ranking, indicating which algorithms should be applied in which order.

Three feature extraction tools are utilized to represent the light curves as sets of features, i.e., FATS (Feature Analysis for Time Series), feets (feATURE eXTRACTOR FOR tIME sERIES) and UPSILoN (AUtomated Classification for Periodic Variable Stars using MachIne LearNing) public tools. To address the problem of class imbalance, four oversampling techniques are applied, i.e., ADaptive SYNthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN), Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), and two modifications of SMOTE, specifically, Borderline-SMOTE and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-SMOTE. Results show that the features extracted using the FATS tool lead to a better performance, and therefore, they appear to represent light curves in a more informative manner, compared to feets and UPSILoN.

The spatial\u2013temporal dynamics of oak mortality at the landscape scale are crucial indicators of disease progression. Modeling disease spread requires accurate mapping of the dynamic pattern of oak mortality in time through multi-temporal image analysis. Traditional mapping approaches using per-pixel, single-date image classifications have not generated consistently satisfactory results. Incorporation of spatial\u2013temporal contextual information can improve these results. In this paper, we propose a spatial\u2013temporally explicit algorithm to classify individual images using the spectral and spatial\u2013temporal information derived from multiple co-registered images. This algorithm is initialized by a spectral classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for each individual image. Then, a Markov Random Fields (MRF) model accounting for ecological compatibility is used to model the spatial\u2013temporal contextual prior probabilities of images. Finally, an iterative algorithm, Iterative Conditional Mode (ICM), is used to update the classification based on the combination of the initial SVM spectral classifications and MRF spatial\u2013temporal contextual model. The algorithm was applied to two-year (2000, 2001) ADAR (Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration) images, from which three classes (bare, dead, forest) are detected.

RC is a computational paradigm in which a trained readout layer interprets the dynamics of an excitable component (called the reservoir) that is perturbed by external input. The reservoir is often implemented as a homogeneous recurrent neural network, but there has been little investigation into the properties of reservoirs that are discrete and heterogeneous. Random Boolean networks are generic and heterogeneous dynamical systems and here we use them as the reservoir. An RBN is typically a closed system; to use it as a reservoir we extend it with an input layer. As a consequence of perturbation, the RBN does not necessarily fall into an attractor. Computational capability in RC arises from a trade-off between separability and fading memory of inputs. We find the balance of these properties predictive of classification power and optimal at critical connectivity.

Approaches have been developed that consider the use of machine learning approaches, specifically Support Vector Machines (svm), to automatically categorize bug reports into the appropriate component to help streamline the process of solving a bug. One drawback of an SVM-based approach is that the results of categorization can be uneven across various components in the system if some components receive less reports than others.

To address these issues, conventional methods usually focus on proposing robust feature representation or learning metric transformation based on pairwise similarity, using Fisher-type criterion. The recent development in deep learning based approaches address the two processes in a joint fashion and have achieved promising progress. One of the key issues for deep learning based person Re-ID is the selection of proper similarity comparison criteria, and the performance of learned features using existing criterion based on pairwise similarity is still limited, because only P2P distances are mostly considered. In this paper, we present a novel person Re-ID method based on P2S similarity comparison. The P2S metric can jointly minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance, while back-propagating the gradient to optimize parameters of the deep model. By utilizing our proposed P2S metric, the learned deep model can effectively distinguish different persons by learning discriminative and stable feature representations.

The overarching purpose of this thesis was to advance understanding of SAR backscatter response to peatland hydrology and develop new approaches for remote mapping and monitoring of peatland environments with SAR. Specifically, this thesis aimed to 1) improve methods for peatland ecosystem mapping and classification accuracy assessment with a Random Forest classifier; and 2) develop methods for surface soil moisture and water table depth retrieval in peatlands using SAR remote sensing data. At Alfred Bog, a peatland in eastern Ontario, Canada, a Random Forest classification workflow was developed and enabled the creation of a site-wide peatland ecosystem map, which was used to better understand the SAR response to hydrological and vegetation conditions. For the retrieval of surface hydrologic information, SAR data were compared with trends in soil moisture, water table and vegetation spatial variability and change over time. Various polarimetric parameters were used to build statistical models of soil moisture and, in some cases, resulted in high explained variance but independent validation indicated that models were over-fit. These results are important, as many examples were found in the literature where, through statistical models, SAR was reported to be a strong predictor of soil moisture but models were not validated. To determine if models could predict soil moisture from SAR at times when no field measured data existed, linear mixed-effects models were built. These accounted for the temporal autocorrelation due to the repeated measures design of field data. While some models resulted in high explained variance, most of the explained variance was attributed to the variability between peatland classes and/or the specific date that the image was acquired, rather than the SAR data itself. Overall, this thesis points to some fundamental limitations on our ability to accurately monitor peatland hydrology with SAR due to the complexity of the scattering response. It highlights a need for extensive field monitoring campaigns and testing to further refine approaches for remote hydrologic monitoring in natural environments.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.22215/etd/2016-11581", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2796554867", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2849707"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133911673"}

However, since dimensionality reduction is carried out prior to ensemble comparison, such strategies are susceptible to artifactual biases from information loss. Here we introduce a method based on support vector machines that yields a normalized quantitative estimate for the difference between two ensembles after comparing them directly against one another. While this method can be applied to any molecular system, including non-biological molecules and crystals, here we show how it can be applied to identify the specific regions of a paramyxovirus G-protein that are affected by the binding of its preferred human receptor, Ephrin-B2. This protein-protein interaction essentially regulates viral fusion. Specifically, for every residue in the G-protein, we obtain separately a quantitative difference between the ensemble of configurations they sample in the presence and in the absence of Ephrin-B2. These ensembles were generated using molecular dynamics simulations. Rank-ordering and then mapping the residues that undergo the greatest change in motion on to the 3-d structure of the G-protein reveals that they are clustered primarily on a single contiguous facet of the protein, and include the set that is known experimentally to play a vital role in regulating viral fusion.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2012.11.2785", "venue": null, "journal": "Biophysical Journal", "mag_id": "1972711846", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:83753479"}

Immense number of personal, professional and political thoughts are shared online every single day. Thus, OSNs are attractive for cyber criminals who are trying to exploit their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Fake accounts on OSNs have become a basic threat used in different online attacks. And even if some of these attacks are harmless like generating fake accounts for \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook, followers on Twitter and views on YouTube, other attacks are more serious and can be dangerous online. Influence on trending topics, spread spam advertisements and false political content are just some of the examples how attackers are able to wreak havoc online by using fake profiles. With the increasing number of security and privacy threats, some of the OSNs have adopted security measures to stop the mass creation of the fake accounts. However, those measures are often ineffective by the many tools available on the underground marketplaces that allow people to cheaply acquire fake accounts. In this regard, this thesis aims to detect the fake profiles on a very popular OSN, Twitter, with the help of machine learning algorithms. The first key contribution is the research on the appropriate machine learning techniques. Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbour were the three supervised learning algorithms. In addition to them, one clustering algorithm was tested, namely k-Means. The next contribution is the acquisition of labelled data related to real and fake profiles in Twitter for the training phase. After analysing the behaviour of the users and their tweets activities, an extensive dataset of 12 features was created. The named Fake profile\u00b4s detection dataset plays key role in distinguishing fake accounts among real ones and it is applied on the machine learning algorithms. Analysis of the results has been performed in five different scenarios. The classifiers achieve accuracy score of around 92% for separating the fake profiles from the real ones and the clustering algorithm is able to detect all fake profiles. Finally, for testing purposes were analysed some of the followers of Donald Trump with the already trained models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2904530892", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70343444"}

To address this issue, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is applied to handle the data-imbalance. Furthermore, considering the fact that misclassification is unavoidable, and most existing schemes aim to achieve a low detection error rate, while ignoring the fact that different type of misclassification errors can cause different economic losses to the operators. We consider the cost sensitivity and use rescaling method to help the classifier differentiate the importance of different samples, so that a minimal total loss can be achieved.

The problem is how to classify these genes based on their behavior in response to changing pH of the growth medium and mutation of the acid tolerance response gene regulator GadX. In order to apply these techniques, first we have to label the genes. The labels indicate the response of genes to the experimental variables: 1-unchanged, 2-decreased expression level and 3-increased expression level. To label the genes, an unsupervised K-Means clustering technique is applied in a multi-level scheme. Multi-level K-Means clustering is itself an improvement over standard K-Means applications. SVM is used here in two ways. First, labels resulting from multi-level K-Means clustering are confirmed by SVM. To judge the performance of SVM, two other methods, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are implemented. The Implementation of Multi-class SVM used one-against-one method and one-against-all method. The results show that SVM outperforms KNN and LDA. The advantage of SVM includes the generalization error and the computing time. Second, different from the first application, SVM is used to label the genes after it is trained by a set of training data obtained from K-Means clustering.

In the FERET datasets, where the aim is identification, we use the angle distance. In the LFW dataset, where the aim is to verify a given match, we use the Support Vector Machine and Similarity Metric Learning. Our proposed system performs well on both datasets, obtaining, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest performance rates published in the literature on the FERET datasets.

The established similar addressing tests have been having a tendency to gather uncertain results against which new hearty strategies are being explored upon for acquiring more productive Falsehood discovery set up.Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-obtrusive strategy to quantify the action of mind through the anodes appended to the scalp of a subject.

Gully erosion mapping through field-work is difficult, time-consuming, and costly. This article compares various pixel-based image classification (PBC) algorithms, such as ISODATA, Maximum Likelihood Classification, and Support Vector Machine, with the object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique for gully erosion mapping on IRS-P6 images. Six models defined by classification types, classifiers, and feature spaces were built for comparison. The results show that OBIA classification performed better than PBC in terms of accuracy. We also found that the improvement of OBIA was primarily due to employing textural and shape features and optimized feature space, while the use of standard feature space did not improve OBIA. In addition, OBIA significantly reduced the salt-and-pepper effect that obscures the features on the output maps compared to the PBC maps (which had more salt-and-pepper effects). It seems that object-based techniques have yielded better results because of their focus on the shape of gully networks rather than on their spectral heterogeneity. In order to improve the accuracy, a priority may be gained by fully exploring the use of membership function and hierarchical approach with multi-scale segmentation for gully mapping. In future studies we propose to determine how these factors can affect the performance of OBIA in terms of gully mapping.

There are several ways of querying from an image database for retrieval purpose. Some of which are text, image, and sketch. However, the traditional methodologies support only one of the domains at a time. There is a need of bridging the gap between different domains (sketch and image) for enabling a Multi-Modal CBIR system.

As neuro and fuzzy approaches are promising methods to interface between a vehicle operator and an automobile, they are used to design a transmission controller. Automobile loads are estimated from the signals of status sensors by fuzzy logic. Vehicle driver's intention is inferred by fuzzy logic using the information from automobile status sensors on which driver's intention is reflected. These are then fed into a neural network. An experienced driver (much data) teachers the neural network an optimal gear-shift scheduling such that a vehicle operator feels comfortable even when automobile loads change (for example when an automobile is traveling up and down hill). >", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/87.370709", "venue": "IEEE Trans.

In the proposed approach, GMD starts from a single Gaussian and is built up by sequentially adding new components. Each new component is globally selected to produce optimal gain in the objective function. MLE and MMI are unified under the H-criterion, which is optimized by the extended BW (EBW) algorithm.

Without considering complicated spatiotemporal heterogeneity, previous studies could not extract urban transition rules at large scale well. This study proposed a random forest algorithm (RFA) based cellular automata (CA) model to simulate China's urban expansion and farmland loss in a fine scale from 2000 to 2030. The objectives of this study are to 1) mine urban conversion rules in different homogeneous economic development regions, and 2) simulate China's urban expansion process and farmland loss at high spatial resolution (30 meters). Firstly, we clustered several homogeneous economic development regions among China according to official statistical data. Secondly, we constructed a RFA-based CA model to mine complex urban conversion rules and carried out simulation of urban expansion and farmland loss at each homo-region. The proposed model was implemented on Tianhe-1 supercomputer located in Guangzhou, China. The accuracy evaluation demonstrates that the simulation result of proposed RFA-based CA model is more in agreement with actual land use change. This study proves that the primary factor of farmland loss in China is rapid urbanization from 2000, and the farmland loss rate is expected to slow down gradually and will stabilize from 2010 to 2030. It shows that China is able to preserve the 1.20 million km farmland without crossing the \"red line\" within the next 20 years, but the situation remains severe.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1705.05651", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2615436780", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18773041", "14463568", "89141", "55776221", "156635845", "33077587", "153438683", "140618509", "14668540", "86723492", "32087362", "109723980", "62588269", "154467911", "33714848", "99164762", "4607540", "6926926", "205994844", "536137", "28515675", "62701924", "3467289", "28601529", "55086666", "4551769", "4548563", "4620657", "4621717", "154493854", "206956701", "10929812", "13216253", "30440357", "25863108", "16396014", "9331255", "85551470", "5723276", "121995257", "127274", "132161727", "85214294"], "inbound_citations": ["159054078"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26040810"}

For each training example, the distance metric is learned by enforcing a margin between the interclass sparse reconstruction residual and interclass sparse reconstruction residual, so that the reconstruction residual of training samples can be effectively exploited to compute the between-class and within-class variations. To better use multiple features for distance metric learning, we propose a reconstruction-based multimetric learning method to collaboratively learn multiple distance metrics, one for each feature descriptor, to remove uncorrelated information for recognition.

Compared with existing bounds, the new bound does not require expert knowledge about the target distribution, nor the optimal combination rule for multisource domains. Interestingly, our theory also leads to an efficient learning strategy using adversarial neural networks: we show how to interpret it as learning feature representations that are invariant to the multiple domain shifts while still being discriminative for the learning task. To this end, we propose two models, both of which we call multisource domain adversarial networks (MDANs): the first model optimizes directly our bound, while the second model is a smoothed approximation of the first one, leading to a more data-efficient and task-adaptive model. The optimization tasks of both models are minimax saddle point problems that can be optimized by adversarial training.

Firstly, we propose a preliminary segmentation strategy for spot mark image based on the K-means clustering, the image is clustered into backgrounds, halos, and targets, the image corrosion method is used to remove the interference around the target, and according to the deterministic characteristics of convex hull method to extract the target marks, consequently, the spot target with different ablation power has a uniform segmentation criterion. Secondly, we extract the geometric feature parameters of a spot mark image, such as pixel area, height, width, inner radius, and outer radius, and then construct the geometric parameters sample set of spot mark image. Finally, taking the geometric feature parameters of spot mark image as the input vector and the corresponding laser power level as the output vector, the recognition model of laser power level based on SVM is constructed.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00170-017-1007-5", "venue": null, "journal": "The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology", "mag_id": "2754235618", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198190590"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116044712"}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to taking audio context into account for better action recognition performance, since audio can provide strong evidence to certain actions such as phone-ringing to answer-phone. At first, classifiers are established for visual and audio modalities, respectively. Specifically, bag of visual-words model is employed to represent human actions in visual modality, a number of audio features are extracted for audio modality, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classification technique. Then, a decision fusion scheme is utilized to fuse classification results from two modalities. Since audio context is not always helpful, two simple yet effective decision rules are developed for selective fusion. Experimental results on the Hollywood Human Actions (HOHA) dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better recognition performance than that of integrating scene context.

In recent years, traffic classification based on the statistical properties of flows has become a relevant topic. In this work we analyze the size of the firsts packets on both directions of a flow as a relevant statistical fingerprint.

The cognitive state in car driving task is one of key issue in cognitive neuroscience because fatigue driving usually causes enormous losses nowadays. The damage can be extremely decreased by the assistant of various artificial systems. Many Electroencephalography (EEG)-based interfaces have been widely developed recently due to its convenient measurement and real-time response. However, the improvement of recognition accuracy is still confined to some specific problems (e.g., individual difference). In order to solve this issue, the proposed methodology in this paper utilizes a nonlinear fuzzy neural network structure to increase the adaptability in the real-world environment. Therefore, this study is further to analysis the brain activities in car driving, which is constructed in a simulated three-dimensional virtual-reality (VR) environment. Finally, through the development of brain cognitive model in car driving task, this system can predict the cognitive state effectively before drivers' action and then provide correct feedback to users.

Parallel implementations of SVM, which can run on large scale supercomputers, are becoming commonplace.

In this paper, we present several approaches for designing fault tolerant SVM algorithms. First, we present an in-depth analysis to identify the critical data structures, and build baseline algorithms that simply periodically checkpoint these data structures. Next, we propose a novel algorithm, which requires no inter-node data movement for checkpointing, and only O(n2/p2) recovery time -- a small fraction of the expected O(n3/p) time-complexity of SVM. We implement these algorithms and evaluate them on a large scale cluster. Our evaluation indicates that the overall data movement for checkpointing in the baseline algorithm can be up to 100x the dataset size!, while the proposed novel algorithm is completely communication-free of checkpointing. In addition, it saves up to 20x space, while providing better (by an average of 5.5x speedup on 256 cores) recovery time than the baseline algorithm with different number of checkpoints.

We address this problem by proposing an approach to assess the relationship between visual tasks and their task-specific models. Our method uses Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA), which is commonly used to find a correlation between neuronal responses from brain data and models. With RSA we obtain a similarity score among tasks by computing correlations between models trained on different tasks. Our method is efficient as it requires only pre-trained models, and a few images with no further training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method to generating task taxonomy on Taskonomy dataset. We next evaluate the relationship of RSA with the transfer learning performance on Taskonomy tasks and a new task: Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. Our results reveal that models trained on tasks with higher similarity score show higher transfer learning performance.

While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets.

In order to obtain the optimal input-weights and bias of hidden layer, this paper proposes the self-adjusting extreme learning machine, called SA-ELM.

Compared with ELM and fast learning network, the SA-ELM owns good regression accuracy and generalization performance.

First, the construction of Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems to help alleviate the burden of increasing amounts of data for diagnosis. Second, the identification of image biomarkers corresponding to anatomical locations of the features selected for classification. This thesis is an empirical exploration of these ideas in the case of three neurological diseases. We have developed sound methodological frameworks, avoiding circularity effects in the validation process. For feature selection we have been working with supervised methods which produce good classification results and the ability to determine the spatial location of the features in the brain, among them an evolutionary wrapper selection method based on Extreme Learning Machines. The thesis covers experiments with a wide spectrum of classifiers for comparison. Finally, the approach has been tested on different MRI modalities showing its general applicability. A critical issue for multivariate modalities is the definition of appropriate scalar measures that may be useful for feature selection and extraction. The thesis tests the most appropriate for each modality: FA and MD for diffusion data, functional activity measures such as ReHo for functional data and measures from deformation maps resulting from non-linear registration of anatomical data.

In this area, dunes form long corridors made of thousands crescent shaped dunes moving simultaneously, thus, making data gathering in the field very difficult. A computer vision approach based on machine learning was proposed to automate the detection of barchans sand dunes and monitor their complex interactions. An IKONOS high resolution satellite image was used with the combination of a clustering algorithm for image segmentation of the dunes corridor, and a Transfer Learning model which was trained to detect three classes of objects: Barchan dunes, bare fields and a new introduced class consisting of dunes collisions. Indeed, collisions were very difficult to model using classical digital image processing methods due to the large variability of their shapes. The model was trained on 1000 image patches which were annotated then augmented to generate a larger dataset. The obtained detection results showed an accuracy of 84,01%.

However, in this paper it is shown that there is a direct evolution in Turing's ideas from his earlier investigations of computability to his later interests in machine intelligence and machine learning. Turing realised that machines which could learn would be able to avoid some of the consequences of Godes and his results on incompleteness and undecidability. Machines which learned could continuously add new axioms to their repertoire. Inspired by a radio talk given by Turing in 1951, Christopher Strachey went on to implement the world's first machine learning program. This particular first is usually attributed to A.L. Samuel. Strachey's program, which did rote learning in the game of Nim, preceded Samuel's checker playing program by four years.

Seven land use classes such as paddy, rubber, coconut, deciduous forest, evergreen forest, water bodies and others land use (e.g., built-up, barren etc.) were selected based on literature review and local land use classification policy. Both Sentinel-2A (optical) and sentinel-1A (SAR) satellite imageries of 2017 for Kharif season were used for classification using three machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Further, the performance of these techniques was also compared in order to select the best classifier. In addition, spectral indices and textural matrices (NDVI, GLCM) were extracted from the image and best features were selected using the sequential feature selection approach. Thus, 10-fold cross-validation was employed for parameter tuning of such classifiers to select best hyperparameters to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, best features, best hyperparameters were used for final classification and accuracy assessment. The results show that SVM outperforms the RF and CART and similarly, Optical+SAR datasets outperforms the optical and SAR satellite imageries.

Methods Blood smears were prepared on glass slides commonly used in pathology laboratories for microscopy. Two types of sample per patient were prepared: a conventional blood smear and a deposit of \u201cpure\u201d lymphocyte subtypes (i.e. normal B, CLL B, T and NK), sorted out in flow cytometry by using the negative double labelling technique. The second sample is used for the construction of a database of spectral markers specific of these different cell types. The preparations were analyzed with the multimodal machine which combines i) a Raman micro-spectrometer, equipped with a 532nm diode laser excitation source; ii) a micro- scope equipped with 40x and 150x lenses and a high precision xyz motorized stage for scanning the blood smear, and localizing x-y coordinates of representative series (~100 for each patient) of lymphocyte cells before registering three Raman spectra; these cells of interest being previously localized by an original method based on the morphology analysis. After the Raman acquisitions, the conventional blood smears were submitted immunolabelling using specific antibodies. For the establishment of the Raman classifiers, this post-acquisition treatment was used as reference to distinguish the different lymphocyte sub-populations. Raman data were then analyzed using chemometric processing and supervised statistical classifiers in order to construct a spectral library of markers highly specific of the lymphocyte type and status (normal or pathological). Results Currently, a total of 60 patients (CLL and healthy) were in- cluded in the study. Various classification methods such as LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), PLS-DA (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis), RF (RandomForest) and SVM (Support Vector Machine), were tested in the purpose to distinguish tumoral B lymphocytes from other cell types. These classification algorithms were combined with feature selection approaches. The best performances were around 70% of correct identification when a three-class model (B-CLL vs B-normal vs T and NK lymphocytes) was considered, and 80% in case of a two-class model (B-CLL vs B-normal lymphocytes). These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of Raman micro-spectroscopy coupled to supervised classification algorithms for leukemic cell classification. The approach can find interest more generally in the field of cyto-hematology. Further developments will concern the integration of additional modality such as Quantitative Phase Imaging on one hand to speed the exploration process of cells of interest to be probed, and on the other hand to extract additional characteristics likely to be informative for CLL diagnosis. In addition, the identification of prognostic markers will be investigated by confronting the photonic data to clinical patient information.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17629/www.diagnosticpathology.eu-2016-8:125", "venue": null, "journal": "Diagnostic Pathology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2524211208", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73594515"}

The results of evaluations made by consulting expert opinion beforehand were accepted as actual values, compared with the classification results and the performances of the classifiers were calculated. Within the scope of this study, participants were classified into four as rapidity branch (E), strength branch (F), height branch (G) and other group (H). Results: The accuracy values of classification of support vector machines were found ranging from 96% to 100% in each class, and 98% in average. Minimum value of sensitivity was found to be 93% while it was 99% in maximum. On the other hand , precision varied between 92% and 100%.

These applications increasingly require fast processing. Therefore, it becomes important to include the computational latency in the evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose a novel human action descriptor based on skeleton data provided by RGB-D cameras for fast action recognition. The descriptor is built by interpolating the kinematics of skeleton joints (position, velocity and acceleration) using a cubic spline algorithm. A skeleton normalization is done to alleviate anthropometric variability. To ensure rate invariance which is one of the most challenging issues in action recognition, a novel temporal normalization algorithm called Time Variable Replacement (TVR) is proposed. It is a change of variable of time by a variable that we call Normalized Action Time (NAT) varying in a fixed range and making the descriptors less sensitive to execution rate variability. To map time with NAT, increasing functions (called Time Variable Replacement Function (TVRF)) are used. Two different Time Variable Replacement Functions (TVRF) are proposed in this paper: the Normalized Accumulated kinetic Energy (NAE) of the skeleton and the Normalized Pose Motion Signal Energy (NPMSE) of the skeleton. The action recognition is carried out using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results on five challenging benchmarks show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of recognition accuracy and computational latency.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.imavis.2018.06.004", "venue": "Image Vis.

In order to distinguish different material types of underwater small targets with the same size and geometry, a series of broadband, transient-like bio-inspired dolphin sonar signals (clicks) are used as the transmitting waveform. In the joint time-frequency space, Reduced Interference Distribution (RID) is used to analyze the echoes, and then the RID-SV feature is extracted by singular value decomposition (SVD). The Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to classify echoes. In order to verify the efficiency of the bio-inspired click signal for distinguishing materials, an anechoic pool experiment was conducted. In this experiment, three bio-inspired dolphin signals are generated by two linear frequency modulation component covering different frequency band in 40-80 kHz. These three signals are used to detect and recognize three 10 cm diameter solid spherical targets with different materials (copper, aluminum, stainless).

We compared one-class Support Vector Machine (ocSVM) and OCKRA (One-Class K-means with Randomly-projected features Algorithm). Both classifiers were tested using four versions of the publicly available PRIDE (Personal RIsk DEtection) dataset. The first version is the original PRIDE dataset, which is based only on time-domain features. We created a second version that is simply an extension of the original dataset with new attributes in the frequency domain. The other two datasets are a subset of these two versions, after a feature selection procedure based on a correlation matrix analysis followed by a Principal Component Analysis. All experiments were focused on the performance of the classifiers as well as on the execution time during the training and classification processes. Therefore, our goal in this work is twofold: we aim at reducing execution time but at the same time maintaining a good classification performance. Our results show that OCKRA achieved on average, 89.1% of Area Under the Curve (AUC) using the full set of features and 83.7% when trained using a subset of them. Furthermore, regarding execution time, OCKRA reports in the best case a 33.1% gain when using a subset of the feature vector, instead of the full set of features. These results are better than those reported by ocSVM, in which case, even though the AUCs are very close to each other, execution times are significantly higher in all cases, for example, more than 20 h versus less than an hour in the worst-case scenario. Having in mind the trade-off between classification performance and efficiency, our results support the choice of OCKRA as our best candidate so far for a mobile implementation where less processing and memory resources are at hand. OCKRA reports a very encouraging speed-up without sacrificing the classifier performance when using the PRIDE dataset based only on time-domain attributes after a feature selection procedure.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6163624", "pubmed_id": "30200188", "doi": "10.3390/s18092857", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2888870618", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["46513232", "16343558", "7223043", "8690015", "21038284", "15357341", "29162113", "1536455", "66001", "3616879", "122725444", "122725444", "15070933", "123217261", "656476", "56699897", "426548", "28637672", "7553535", "214973498"], "inbound_citations": ["149536129", "212564056", "212647754"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52182020"}

In the common decomposition framework, iSVM starts with a minimum working set (WS), and then iteratively selects one training example to update the WS in each optimization loop. iSVM employs a two-stage strategy in processing the training data. In the first stage, the most prominent vector among randomly selected data is added to the WS. This stage results in an approximate SVM solution. The second stage uses temporal solutions to scan through the whole training data once again to find the remaining support vectors (SVs). We show that iSVM is especially efficient for training SVMs on applications where data size is much larger than number of SVs.

In this paper, we present an approach for learning with few data samples, involving additional constraints based on computing derivatives of the decision boundary at the location of the training samples. Based on the kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) formulation in Empirical Feature Space (EFS), we add an additional constraint which stipulates that the derivative of the separating hyperplane corresponds to either a maxima or a minima at the locations of the training samples. This is done by setting the derivative of the conventional SVM constraint to zero. We call our approach the SVM-Derivative (SVM-D). We also present a variant of this approach based on the Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM), called the MCM-Derivative (MCM-D), which allows us to realize sparser models in terms of fewer number of support vectors.

Is the strength of the relationship between species distribution and environment stronger in some disturbance-response types than in others? Location: California southwest ecoregion, USA. Methods: We developed species distribution models (SDMs) for 45 plant species using three primary modeling methods (GLMs, GAMs, and Random Forests). Using AUC as a performance measure of prediction accuracy, and measure of the strength of species\u2013environment correlations, we used regression analyses to compare the effects of fire disturbance response type, longevity, dispersal mechanism, range size, cover, species prevalence, and model type. Results: Fire disturbance response type explained more variation in model performance than any other variable, but other species and range characteristics were also significant. Differences in prediction accuracy reflected variation in species life history, disturbance response, and rarity. AUC was significantly higher for longer-lived species, found at intermediate levels of abundance, and smaller range sizes. Models performed better for shrubs than subshrubs and perennial herbs. The disturbance response type with the highest SDM accuracy was obligate-seeding shrubs with ballistic dispersal that regenerate via fire-cued germination from a dormant seed bank. Conclusions: The effect of species characteristics on predictability of species distributions overrides any differences in modeling technique. Prediction accuracy may be related to how a suite of species characteristics co-varies along environmental gradients. Including disturbance response was important because SDMs predict the realized niche.

It generally makes a compromise between fit with the data and the complexity of the model. Currently the most popular techniques used by practitioners are Cross-Validation (CV) and Leave-One-Out (LOO). In this study we concentrated on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Boser et al., 1992) model. Recently, Ozogur-Akyuz et al. (In Press), following on work by Ozogur et al. (2008), show that selecting a model whose hyperplane achieves the maximum separation from a test point obtains comparable error rates to those found by selecting the SVM model through CV. In other words, while methods such as CV involve finding one SVM model (together with its optimal parameters) that minimises the CV error, Ozogur-Akyuz et al. (In Press) keep all of the models generated during the model selection stage and make predictions according to the model whose hyperplane achieves the maximum separation from a test point. The main advantage of this approach is the computational saving when compared to CV or LOO. However, their method is only applicable to large margin classifiers like SVMs. We continue this line of research, but rather than using the distance of each test point from the hyperplane we explore the idea of using the nonconformity measure (Vovk et al., 2005; Shafer & Vovk, 2008) of a test sample to a particular label set. The nonconformity measure is a function that evaluates how \u2018strange\u2019 a prediction is according to the different possibilities available. The notion of nonconformity has been proposed in the on-line learning framework of conformal prediction (Shafer & Vovk, 2008), and is a way of scoring how different a new sample is from a bag of old samples. The premise is that if the observed samples are well-sampled then we should have high confidence on correct prediction of new samples, given that they conform to the observations. We take the nonconformity measure and apply it to the SVM algorithm during testing in order to gain a time advantage over CV and to generalise the algorithm of Ozogur-Akyuz et al. (In Press).

The issue is somewhat alleviated when high spatial resolution data are used, allowing the production of detailed classification schemes, using either pixel- or object-based classification methods. To determine the best performing classification methods for Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) mapping , the research was divided in twofold: (1) the comparison of classification methods for LU/LC mapping using high spatial resolution data provided by the FORMOSAT-2 satellite. Two approaches, a pixel-based and an object-based classification, are evaluated; the pixel-based approach employs the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, and the object-based classification uses the Nearest Neighbour (NN) classifier. (2) An innovative method was proposed, the Stratified Masking Process (SMP) that integrates a ranking process within the classes based on spectral fluctuation of the sum of the training and testing sites. Its implementation was performed by ML and SVM classifiers. An analysis of the overall and individual accuracy of the classification results of all four methods reveals that the SVM classifier was the most efficient overall by distinguishing most of the classes with the highest accuracy. NN succeeded to deal with artificial surface classes in general while agriculture area classes, and forest and semi-natural area classes were segregated successfully with SVM. Moreover, adding the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) features to the FORMOSAT-2 image increased dramatically the classification accuracy especially with the SVM classifier. Furthermore, a comparative analysis indicates that the conventional classification method yielded better accuracy results than the SMP method overall with both classifiers used, ML and SVM.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2305918216", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:130917439"}

This work is motivated by data on clinical and laboratory features of severe dengue infections (dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) obtained from 51 individuals enrolled in a prospective observational study of acute human dengue infections.ResultsWe carry out a comprehensive performance comparison using several classification models for DHF over the dengue data set. We compared variable selection results by Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Learning Ensemble, Random Forest, Bayesian Moving Averaging, Stochastic Search Variable Selection, and Generalized Regularized Logistics Regression. Model averaging methods (bagging, boosting and ensemble learners) have higher accuracy, but the generalized regularized regression model has the highest predictive power because the linearity assumptions of candidate predictors are strongly satisfied via deviance chi-square testing procedures. Bootstrapping applications for evaluating predictive regression coefficients in regularized regression model are performed.ConclusionsFeature reduction methods introduce inherent biases and therefore are data-type dependent. We propose that these limitations can be overcome using an exhaustive approach for searching feature space.

Compared with state-of-the-art methods that use the length of the rule body as a metric for rule complexity, our approach permits a much more fine-grained specification of the shape of hypothesis candidate rules. Similar to the ILASP system, our system iteratively increases the rule cost limit until it finds a suitable hypothesis. Different from ILASP, our approach generates a new search space for each cost limit. The Inspire system searches for a hypothesis that entails a single example at a time, utilizing a simplification of the ASP encoding used in the XHAIL system. To evaluate ASP we use Clingo. We perform experiments with the development and test set of the ILP competition. For comparison we also adapted the ILASP system to process competition instances.

Methods: We preregistered the following three hypotheses: 1) a contingent Negative Variation (CNV) difference in the amplitude voltage between auditory vs faces stimuli; 2) a greater amplitude voltage in the CNV, in high arousal stimuli vs low arousal stimuli, both in auditory and faces stimuli, in the temporal window from 0 to 1000 ms before the stimulus presentation; 3) in the time window from 0 to 1000 ms a sensory specific activation at the brain source level in the temporal lobe and auditory cortex before the presentation of an auditory stimulus and an activation of occipital area, dedicated to the elaboration of visual stimuli, before the presentation of faces . Results: Using a preregistered, hypothesis-driven approach, we found no statistically significant differences in the CNV due to an overly conservative correction for multiple comparisons for the control of Type I error. By contrast, using a data-driven approach based on a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine), we found a significantly larger amplitude in the occipital cluster of electrodes before the presentation of faces with respect to sounds, along with a larger amplitude in the right auditory cortex before the presentation of sounds with respect to faces. Furthermore, we found greater CNV activity in the late prestimulus interval for high vs. low-arousal sounds stimuli in the left centro-posterior scalp regions.

In this sense, data from MPP (ASTM D5853) of 105 crude oil samples, their hydrogen (1H) NMR spectra and carbon (13C) NMR spectra were acquired. With MPP ranging from \u221254 \u00b0C to 39 \u00b0C, two classes were assigned: the first containing 43 samples with MPP value \u2264 \u22129 \u00b0C, and, the second, 62 samples with MPP value > \u22129 \u00b0C. The 1H NMR models, with 90% accuracy, and 13C NMR, with 71% accuracy, were used in the selection of variable method. The results showed that the methodology proposed to select variables was effective in the distinction of the variables that best contributed to the discrimination of oils.

In particular, the relative role of chronological age, sex, anthropometry, and body composition in physical fitness of children has been barely investigated. This cross-sectional study investigated determinants of physical fitness using a set of predictive variables including, in addition to chronological age and sex, a large panel of anthropometric measurements as well as body composition. The study was carried out in a convenience sample of children aged 6-12 participating in a summer camp. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: One-hundred-ninety-three children (128 males) fulfilled all requirements and entered analysis. Health-related physical fitness components (speed, muscular power and balance) were explored by means of field tests, namely the 30-m dash test for running speed, the standing long jump and the seated chest pass test for lower limbs and upper body muscular power, respectively, and the flamingo balance test for static balance. Determinants of physical fitness were investigated by regression analysis using chronological age, sex, anthropometry, and body composition in a hierarchical approach. To minimize the expected effect of collinearity in predictor variables, an original statistical approach using Random Forests analysis was adopted. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: Age predicted 45.2%, 43.6%, 35.6% and 25.6%; and sex 9.5%, 10.7%, 6.3% and 2.0% of variance in the 30-m dash, seated chest pass, standing long jump, and flamingo balance test, respectively. Anthropometry and body composition explained a limited or no percentage of variance. The adjusted R 2 (root mean square error) was 0.61 (0.31 s), 0.45 (0.32 m), 0.58 (0.15 m) and 0.41 (0.75 logs) for the 30-m dash, seated chest pass, standing long jump, and flamingo balance test, respectively making these models useful when physical fitness tests are not feasible. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: We highlighted the respective role of chronological age, sex, anthropometry, and body composition in physical fitness of children in the wide age range 6-12 years.

A \u201cdyslexic\u201d model of reading was created by reducing the quality of the phonological representations available to the model during learning. The model behaved similarly to dyslexic children in that it had a selectively reduced ability to process nonwords, but showed normal effects of words' spelling-to-sound regularity. An experimental test of the model's predictions confirmed that dyslexic children perform similarly, in that they are impaired on irregular words to the same extent as nondyslexic children.

Human faces, as the most prominent and easily accessible features, have attracted great attention from researchers. Since humans have rich emotions and developed musculature, there exist a lot of fine-grained expressions in real-world applications. However, it is extremely time-consuming to collect and annotate a large number of facial images, of which may even require psychologists to correctly categorize them. To the best of our knowledge, the existing expression datasets are only limited to several basic facial expressions, which are not sufficient to support our ambitions in developing successful human-computer interaction systems. To this end, a novel Fine-grained Facial Expression Database - F2ED is contributed in this paper, and it includes more than 200k images with 54 facial expressions from 119 persons. Considering the phenomenon of uneven data distribution and lack of samples is common in real-world scenarios, we further evaluate several tasks of few-shot expression learning by virtue of our F2ED, which are to recognize the facial expressions given only few training instances. These tasks mimic human performance to learn robust and general representation from few examples. To address such few-shot tasks, we propose a unified task-driven framework - Compositional Generative Adversarial Network (Comp-GAN) learning to synthesize facial images and thus augmenting the instances of few-shot expression classes. Extensive experiments are conducted on F2ED and existing facial expression datasets, i.e., JAFFE and FER2013, to validate the efficacy of our F2ED in pre-training facial expression recognition network and the effectiveness of our proposed approach Comp-GAN to improve the performance of few-shot recognition tasks.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2001.06144", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2999157588", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["57761115", "18752719", "16251989", "1586662", "17612122", "37515850", "45213489", "2473564", "1442595", "33709025", "5789308", "10647804", "59599957", "3136364", "130535382", "16796921", "52847135", "206597351", "7016601", "46966770", "46969120", "4050365", "57662636", "148087987", "15091825", "15637667", "4668423", "1771257", "19815778", "5058972", "15823252", "589516", "206590483", "10728535", "67481", "10585115", "142574268", "12803511", "6200260", "206770979", "8785311", "52855313", "50785552", "6953475", "6719686", "67413369", "205432040", "8909022", "67413369", "4608153", "5351802", "980236", "17024133", "13746081", "13746081", "9424558", "9047720", "53112765", "3719281", "459456", "740063", "6141990", "1008003", "6597536"], "inbound_citations": ["211252634"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210713950"}

These measurements usually contain a large number of frequency points, as well as a high number of dimensions, since each frequency range swept can be considered as an independent variable. That makes this kind of data hard to handle, increasing the computational costs and being substantially time-consuming. In that sense, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based data compression has been employed in this work, in order to enhance the analysis capability of the raw data. Furthermore, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which has been widespread used in machine learning and pattern recognition fields, has been applied in this study in order to model any possible existing pattern in the PCAcompress data, using for that just the first two Principal Components. Different known non-damaged and damaged measurements of an experimental tested beam were used as training input data for the SVM algorithm, using as test input data the same amount of cases measured in beams with unknown structural health conditions.

Among the LCMAP product suite are annual land cover maps that will be available to the public. This paper describes an approach to optimize the selection of training and auxiliary data for deriving the thematic land cover maps based on all available clear observations from Landsats 4\u20138. Training data were selected from map products of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Land Cover Trends project. The Random Forest classifier was applied for different classification scenarios based on the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We found that extracting training data proportionally to the occurrence of land cover classes was superior to an equal distribution of training data per class, and suggest using a total of 20,000 training pixels to classify an area about the size of a Landsat scene. The problem of unbalanced training data was alleviated by extracting a minimum of 600 training pixels and a maximum of 8000 training pixels per class. We additionally explored removing outliers contained within the training data based on their spectral and spatial criteria, but observed no significant improvement in classification results. We also tested the importance of different types of auxiliary data that were available for the conterminous United States, including: (a) five variables used by the National Land Cover Database, (b) three variables from the cloud screening \u201cFunction of mask\u201d (Fmask) statistics, and (c) two variables from the change detection results of CCDC. We found that auxiliary variables such as a Digital Elevation Model and its derivatives (aspect, position index, and slope), potential wetland index, water probability, snow probability, and cloud probability improved the accuracy of land cover classification. Compared to the original strategy of the CCDC algorithm (500 pixels per class), the use of the optimal strategy improved the classification accuracies substantially (15-percentage point increase in overall accuracy and 4-percentage point increase in minimum accuracy).", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.11.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2553544826", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203591851", "215068982", "53613463", "13984171", "27189260", "134722096", "134027728", "19715729", "7606528", "46945960", "208035095", "167210394", "55329881", "32096502"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126403261"}

One major obstacle relates to the large dimensionality of motor abnormalities in PD. We aimed to extract global motor performance measures covering different everyday motor tasks, as a function of a clinical intervention, i.e., deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: We followed a data-driven, machine-learning approach and propose performance measures that employ Random Forests with probability distributions. We applied this method to 14 PD patients with DBS switched-off or -on, and 26 healthy control subjects performing the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), the Functional Reach Test (FRT), a hand coordination task, walking 10-m straight, and a 90\u00b0 curve. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: For each motor task, a Random Forest identified a specific set of metrics that optimally separated PD off DBS from healthy subjects. We noted the highest accuracy (94.6%) for standing up. This corresponded to a sensitivity of 91.5% to detect a PD patient off DBS, and a specificity of 97.2% representing the rate of correctly identified healthy subjects. We then calculated performance measures based on these sets of metrics and applied those results to characterize symptom severity in different motor tasks. Task-specific symptom severity measures correlated significantly with each other and with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, part III, correlation of r2 = 0.79). Agreement rates between different measures ranged from 79.8 to 89.3%. ::: ::: ::: Conclusion ::: The close correlation of PD patients' various motor abnormalities quantified by different, task-specific severity measures suggests that these abnormalities are only facets of the underlying one-dimensional severity of motor deficits. The identification and characterization of this underlying motor deficit may help to optimize therapeutic interventions, e.g., to \"automatically\" adapt DBS settings in PD patients.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5694559", "pubmed_id": "29184533", "doi": "10.3389/fneur.2017.00607", "venue": "Front.

In this study we used stochastic gradient boosting (TreeNet) to develop three specific habitat selection models for roosting, daytime resting, and feeding site selection. In addition, we used a geographic information system (GIS) combined with TreeNet to develop a species distribution model. We also generated a digital map of the relative occurrence index (ROI) of this species at daytime resting sites in the study area. Our study indicated that the water depth, distance to village, coverage of deciduous leaves, open water area, and density of plants were the major predictors of roosting site selection. For daytime resting site selection, the distance to wetland, distance to farmland, and distance to road were the primary predictors. For feeding site selection, the distance to road, quantity of food, plant coverage, distance to village, plant density, distance to wetland, and distance to river were contributing factors, and the distance to road and quantity of food were the most important predictors. The predictive map showed that there were two consistent multi-year daytime resting sites in our study area. Our field work in 2013 using systematic ground-truthing confirmed that this prediction was accurate. Based on this study, we suggest that Lindian plays an important role for migratory birds and that cultivation practices should be adjusted locally.

beta occur long before clinical symptoms can be detected. Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid \u03b21\u221242 (A\u03b21\u221242) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individual\u2019s CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOE\u03b54 carrier status and four plasma analytes (CGA, A\u03b21\u221242, Eotaxin 3, APOE) are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those with predicted normal CSF A\u03b21\u221242 levels and that the resulting model also validates reasonably across PET A\u03b21\u221242 status (0.78 AUC). This is the first study to show that a machine learning approach, using plasma protein levels, age and APOE\u03b54 carrier status, is able to predict CSF A\u03b21\u221242 status, the earliest risk indicator for AD, with high accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6409361", "pubmed_id": "30853713", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-37149-7", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "journal": "Scientific Reports", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["18181917", "7835041", "6873561", "205671753", "9100590", "613648", "25096393", "2229969", "11656631", "205408201", "15008986", "30545421", "18280670", "36379670", "15230092", "355279", "4855252", "13769726", "19894618", "20814578", "4468650", "89141", "18897840", "1858029", "58293622", "26512961", "18304054", "3724243", "9033318", "16629193", "30189180", "20519020", "8578776", "521813", "27572956", "25192326", "33941730", "206759459", "3195451", "5772857"], "inbound_citations": ["198132963"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73725405"}

However, this limits their scalabilities to realistic applications, in which a large amount of data over multiple disjoint camera views is available but not labelled. To overcome the problem, we propose unsupervised asymmetric metric learning for unsupervised RE-ID. Our model aims to learn an asymmetric metric, i.e., specific projection for each view, based on asymmetric clustering on cross-view person images. Our model finds a shared space where view-specific bias is alleviated and thus better matching performance can be achieved. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a baseline and five large-scale RE-ID datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Through the comparison, we show that our model works much more suitable for unsupervised RE-ID compared to classical unsupervised metric learning models. We also compare with existing unsupervised RE-ID methods, and our model outperforms them with notable margins.

While frequently mutated oncogenes and differentially expressed genes, which we term Class I cancer genes, are readily detected by most analytical tools, the new class of cancer-related genes, i.e., Class II, escape detection because they are neither mutated nor differentially expressed. Given this hypothesis, we developed a Machine Learning-Assisted Network Inference (MALANI) algorithm, which assesses all genes regardless of expression or mutational status in the context of cancer etiology. We used 8807 expression arrays, corresponding to 9 cancer types, to build more than 2 \u00d7 108 Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for reconstructing a cancer network.

Statistical tests show that our proposal is competitive in both performance and diversity measures against bagging and boosting ensemble methodologies.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2019.06.040", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2956735254", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199128902"}

In this paper, we propose a new method called SuperMirTar that exploits super vised distance learning to predict miRNA targets. Specifically, we use the experimentally supported miRNA-mRNA pairs as a training set to learn a distance metric function that minimizes the distances between miRNAs and mRNAs with validated interactions, then use the learned function to calculate the distances of test miRNA-mRNA interactions, and those with smaller distances than a predefined threshold are regarded as true interactions.

In this study, we show that ASD brain morphometry is highly heterogeneous, and demonstrate that the heterogeneity can be mitigated and classification improved if autism severity (AS), verbal IQ (VIQ) and age are used with morphometric features. Morphometric features from structural MRIs (sMRIs) of 734 males (ASD: 361, controls: 373) of ABIDE were derived using FreeSurfer. Applying the Random Forest classifier, an AUC of 0.61 was achieved. Adding VIQ and age to morphometric features, AUC improved to 0.68. Sub-grouping the subjects by AS, VIQ and age improved the classification with the highest AUC of 0.8 in the moderate-AS sub-group (AS = 7\u20138). Matching subjects on age and/or VIQ in each sub-group further improved the classification with the highest AUC of 0.92 in the low AS sub-group (AS = 4\u20135). AUC decreased with AS and VIQ, and was the lowest in the mid-age sub-group (13\u201318 years). The important features were mainly from the frontal, temporal, ventricular, right hippocampal and left amygdala regions. However, they highly varied with AS, VIQ and age. The curvature and folding index features from frontal, temporal, lingual and insular regions were dominant in younger subjects suggesting their importance for early detection. When the experiments were repeated using the Gradient Boosting classifier similar results were obtained. Our findings suggest that identifying brain biomarkers in sub-groups of ASD can yield more robust and insightful results than searching across the whole spectrum. Further, it may allow identification of sub-group specific brain biomarkers that are optimized for early detection and monitoring, increasing the utility of sMRI as an important tool for early detection of ASD.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4827874", "pubmed_id": "27065101", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0153331", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "mag_id": "2326145038", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["92830917", "52812965", "58583352", "91963320", "349985", "215121562", "196672521", "212721615", "3510081", "195847560", "21407552", "207411792"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8425622"}

The different counts of three different lymphoblasts can affect the type and intensity of the therapy to be used as well as the likely course of the disease. However, bone marrow smear examination and its interpretation is a tedious time consuming process. Therefore, any automation in terms of easing and pacing up the workflow is required.

The sudden emptying of these lakes releases large volumes of water and sediment in destructive glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), one of the most publicised natural hazards to the rapidly growing Himalayan population. Despite the growing number and size of glacial lakes, the frequency of documented GLOFs is remarkably constant. We explore this possible reporting bias and offer a new processing chain for establishing a more complete Himalayan GLOF inventory. We make use of the full seasonal archive of Landsat images between 1988 and 2016, and track automatically where GLOFs left shrinking water bodies, and tails of sediment at high elevations. We trained a Random Forest classifier to generate fuzzy land cover maps for 2491 images, achieving overall accuracies of 91%. We developed a likelihood-based change point technique to estimate the timing of GLOFs at the pixel scale. Our method objectively detected ten out of eleven documented GLOFs, and another ten lakes that gave rise to previously unreported GLOFs. We thus nearly doubled the existing GLOF record for a study area covering ~ 10% of the HKH region. Remaining challenges for automatically detecting GLOFs include image insufficiently accurate co-registration, misclassifications in the land cover maps and image noise from clouds, shadows or ice. Yet our processing chain is robust and has the potential for being applied on the greater HKH and mountain ranges elsewhere, opening the door for objectively expanding the knowledge base on GLOF activity over the past three decades.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2017.12.025", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2793994056", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["91713204", "133796789", "209518135", "198406416", "204835716", "60442901", "201637766", "134780066", "201814937", "88489435", "204763036", "108468324"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:135347747"}

Although quite a few single node deep learning frameworks exist, such as tensorflow, pytorch and keras, we still lack a complete processing structure that can accommodate large scale data processing, version control, and deployment, all while staying agnostic of any specific single node framework. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a new, higher level framework, i.e. Nemesyst, which uses databases along with model sequentialisation to allow processes to be fed unique and transformed data at the point of need. This facilitates near real-time application and makes models available for further training or use at any node that has access to the database simultaneously. Nemesyst is well suited as an application framework for internet of things aggregated control systems, deploying deep learning techniques to optimise individual machines in massive networks. To demonstrate this framework, we adopted a case study in a novel domain; deploying deep learning to optimise the high speed control of electrical power consumed by a massive internet of things network of retail refrigeration systems in proportion to load available on the UK National Grid (a demand side response). The case study demonstrated for the first time in such a setting how deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (vanilla and Long-Short-Term Memory) and Generative Adversarial Networks paired with Nemesyst, achieve compelling performance, whilst still being malleable to future adjustments as both the data and requirements inevitably change over time.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.01600", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compind.2019.103133", "venue": "Computers in Industry, 2019", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2979486412,2948773726", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59617420", "3603485", "205572964", "46821460", "52189988", "22901106", "3412710", "206907269", "104320987", "195767581", "68230685", "49572173", "52931090", "49577512", "1799558", "40027675", "38063112", "157142737", "55680639", "154413756", "11796911", "20929081", "8317747", "115679615", "116482172", "1915014", "1033682", "3439214", "134172446", "117134615", "6628106", "195908774", "10940950", "70293087"], "inbound_citations": ["210932550", "214709849"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:174798340"}

First, the presented defect exaggeration approach produces both the flawless image and the corresponding exaggerated version of the defect by taking the variations in the image as regularization terms. Second, a generative adversarial network (GAN) in conjunction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to guarantee the accuracy of tiny surface defect detection by producing exaggerated defect image samples. Furthermore, the limited dataset of the training samples for defect detection is enlarged by exploiting the GAN technique with the variation exaggerated images.

A change of these factors will lead to a change in the spatial distribution of soil types. In this study, we use a digital soil mapping approach to improve our knowledge about major soil type distributing factors in the steppe regions of Inner Mongolia (China) which currently undergo tremendous environmental change, e.g. climate and land use change. We use Random Forests in an effort to map Reference Soil Groups according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) in the Xilin River catchment. We benefit from the superior prediction capabilities of RF and additional interpretive results in order to identify the major environmental factors that control spatial patterns of soil types. The nine WRB soil groups that were identified and spatially predicted for the study area are Arenosol, Calcisol, Cambisol, Chernozem, Cryosol, Gleysol, Kastanozem, Phaeozem and Regosol. Model and prediction performances of the RF model are high with an Out-of-Bag error of 51.6% for the model and a misclassification error for the predicted map of 28.9%. The main controlling factors of soil type distribution are land use, a set of topographic variables, geology and climate. However, land use and climate are of major importance and topography and geology are of minor importance. The visualizations of the predictions, the variable importance measures as result of RF and the comparisons of these with the spatial distribution of the environmental factors delivered additional, quantitative information of these controlling factors and revealed that intensively grazed areas are subjected to soil degradation. However, most of the area is still governed by natural soil forming processes which are driven by climate, topography and geology. Most importantly though, our study revealed that a shift towards warmer temperatures and lower precipitation regimes will lead to a change of the spatial distribution of RSGs towards steppe soils that store less carbon, i.e. a decrease of spatial extent of Phaeozems and an increase of spatial extent of Chernozems and Kastanozems.

To improve the predictive power of landscape hydrologic models, it is essential to consider both soil and terrain attributes when stratifying a catchment into similar hydrologic functional units. In this study, we developed and validated a new catchment-scale stratification scheme for the Shale Hills watershed by combining soil and terrain attributes in an attempt to delineate soil-landscape units with similar soil moisture dynamics. Terrain was combined with soils information by first using a Random Forest supervised classification algorithm to predict a detailed soil map using 47 field soil samples and terrain variables derived from 1-m LiDAR. A slope class map generated from the LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) was overlaid on the predicted soil map to delineate areas of similar slope value across the catchment. We compared the performance of this new stratification scheme with two classical stratification schemes, a soil map developed from detailed field survey and a landform unit map based on the DEM, for estimating soil moisture time-series across the forested watershed. The combined soil-terrain method outperformed classical stratification schemes in estimating soil moisture time-series over a 4-year period.

In this paper, the dropout behaviour of learners in a MOOC is thoroughly studied by first extracting features that describe the behavior of learners within the course and then by comparing three classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest and AdaBoost) in two tasks: predicting which users will have dropped out by a certain week and predicting which users will drop out on a specific week. The former has showed to be considerably easier, with all three classifiers performing equally well. However, the accuracy for the second task is lower, and Logistic Regression tends to perform slightly better than the other two algorithms.

Using high resolution land cover maps and lidar-derived vertical structural data, we quantified land cover composition and vertical structural characteristics for detached, single-family residential parcels. These data were combined with socioeconomic and demographic datasets from the 2010 US Census and local government agencies and used in Random Forest analyses of outdoor water use estimated from residential water meter records, with separate analyses conducted using parcels and census block groups as sampling units. Conditional variable importance measures from Random Forest analyses and comparisons of the predictive accuracy of models developed using subsets of explanatory variables were used to assess the relative importance of physical and socioeconomic variables in predicting outdoor water use. Models developed using the subset of land cover variables had the highest predictive accuracy, followed by vertical structural variables, and lastly, socioeconomic/demographic variables. At both the parcel and census block group scale, there was significant spatial clustering in outdoor water use as indicated by various spatial statistical analyses. Our approach demonstrates the value of high resolution land cover and structure data for understanding urban water use patterns and can be used for targeting water conservation efforts.

MANET faces lots of challenges while maintaining a secured and resilient communication due to its limited resources and operational capacity. One of the serious challenges is handling and classifying tons of incoming data at a single point of time for efficient processing. As tons of data enter MANETs network at a single point of time, it is necessary to deploy a new mechanism not only for classification but also for further processing. The heavy and extensive data become unmanageable on the part of mobile nodes while implementing techniques like data analysis to trace anomaly or extracting the required information from the data pool incoming into MANETs.

We introduced a confidence interval on the output of the SVM that allows us to reject points with low confidence values. It is also important in this application to infer which genes are important for the classification. We have preliminary results for a feature selection algorithm for SVM classifiers.

However, the employability of these algorithms depends ::: on the desired application and its requirements. Therefore, selection of the classifier to ::: employ for the classification task is an important issue to be taken into account. The ::: first part of the thesis studies this problem and fuzzy Bandler-Kohout (BK) sub-triangle ::: product (subproduct) is employed as a classifier. The performance is tested for human ::: action recognition and scene classification. This is a crucial step as it is the first attempt ::: of using fuzzy BK subproduct for classification. ::: The second part of this thesis studies the problem of early human action detection. ::: The method proposed is based on fuzzy BK subproduct inference mechanism and utilizes ::: the fuzzy capabilities in handling the uncertainties that exist in the real-world for reliable ::: decision making. The fuzzy membership function generated frame-by-frame from fuzzy ::: BK subproduct provides the basis to detect an action before it is completed, when a certain ::: threshold is attained in a suitable way. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed ::: framework, a set of experiments is performed for few action sequences where the detector ::: is able to recognize an action upon seeing \ufffd32% of the frames. ::: iii ::: Finally, the proposed method is analyzed from a broader perspective and a hybrid ::: technique for early anticipation of human action is proposed. It combines the benefits of ::: computer vision and fuzzy set theory based on fuzzy BK subproduct. The novelty lies ::: in the construction of a frame-by-frame membership function for each kind of possible ::: movement, taking into account several human actions from a publicly available dataset. ::: Furthermore, the impact of various fuzzy implication operators and inference structures ::: in retrieving the relationship between the human subject and the actions performed is ::: discussed. The existing fuzzy implication operators are capable of handling only two dimensional ::: data. A third dimension \u2018time\u2019 plays a crucial role in human action recognition ::: to model the human movement changes over time. Therefore, a new space-time fuzzy ::: implication operator is introduced, by modifying the existing implication operators to ::: accommodate time as an added dimension. Empirically, the proposed hybrid technique ::: is efficiently able to detect an action before completion and outperform the conventional ::: solutions with good detection rate. The detector is able to identify an action upon viewing ::: \ufffd23% of the frames on an average.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2601350280", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126358034"}

To adopt suitable response strategies for wind power ramps, it is important to predict them accurately and in a timely manner. Since power ramps are caused by various factors, their occurrence has irregular characteristics and vary by location, bringing great difficulty in forecasting. To solve this problem, a hybrid forecasting model termed as orthogonal test and support vector machine (OT-SVM) was developed in this paper, which combines an orthogonal test (OT) with a support vector machine (SVM). A novel factor analysis method was established based on the theory of the OT, and applied to determine the optimal inputs of a SVM. The effectiveness of OT-SVM was tested with three wind farms in China, while comparing the results with other related methods. The results show that the proposed OT-SVM has the highest accuracy covering different input numbers and time resolutions. In addition, a novel evaluation index mean accuracy index was proposed, considering both the missed ramps and false ramps, which can be used as a supplementary index for critical success index.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSTE.2016.2604852", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2508682153", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["3519007", "111753092", "11766358", "113803163", "15556430", "120406379", "30445594", "12134110", "9434342", "42183716", "26828794", "9349696", "23119221", "107956815", "21222222", "26947543", "128961932", "16101147", "121599458", "55883576", "26025054", "15081028", "113844681"], "inbound_citations": ["210996049", "59619565", "51689226", "49183791", "25817404", "6607599", "10076483", "52062757", "53012111", "211063289", "202641450", "135339403", "54924750", "155109264", "24423691", "49557939", "71150839"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25307319"}

Transportation agencies, port authorities, and terminal operators have a need to know in advance the truck traffic in order to accommodate them accordingly. Several previous studies have developed models for predicting the daily truck traffic at seaport terminals using terminal operations data. In this study, two kernel-based supervised machine learning methods are introduced for the same purpose: Gaussian Processes (GP) and e-Support Vector Machines (e-SVMs). They are compared against the Multilayer Feed-forward Neural Networks (MLFNNN) model, which was used in past studies, to provide a comparison of their relative performance. The model development is done using the data from Bayport and Barbours Cut (BCT) container terminals at the Port of Houston. Truck trips generated by import and export activities at the two terminals are investigated separately, generating four sets of data for model testing and comparison. For all test datasets, the GP and e-SVMs models perform equally well and their prediction performance compares favorably to that of the MLFNN model. On a practical note, the GP and e-SVMs models require less effort in model fitting compared to the MLFNN model. The strong performance of the GP and e-SVMs models relative to the commonly used MLFNN model suggest that they can be considered as alternative approaches to the MLFNN in other predictive applications.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2275466831", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["110306732", "110070952", "110584784", "17349422", "109548516", "108980543", "45220648", "2757547", "195652429", "110977917", "11214220", "198910286", "195652429", "7678703", "15480929", "109728085", "961425"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111503309"}
